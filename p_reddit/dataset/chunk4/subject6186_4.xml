	<TEXT> So, after all these experimental reveals...  My assumption is that this is a Alternate History telling of World War 1.  My guess is that the game is going to take place in 1919 and 1920, in a timeline where Germany didn't surrender.  It makes much more sense with all the experimental weaponry and piece by piece armor additions that characters seem to be scavenging for.

My problem is with some of the things the narrator mentioned, and also how Horses being used in other purposes rather than pulling around Artillery.  Horses were used in battle in the early stages of World War 1, got completely and utterly massacred, and then retired all together.

I really want to get a sense of the 'lore' behind this game.  Otherwise, it looks like they shoved all these automatic weapons into WW1 to appease the CoD kiddies and modern warfare fans who couldn't think of using a bolt-action rifle as a main assault gun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, there are only a few people who watch it at my work.  Usually the excuse I hear is, "I'm not into fantasy." Or, "I'll watch it eventually."

Honestly, I don't have that reaction when people tell me they don't watch it.  Hell, after season 5 I would have said, "Good." Season 5 was a train wreck filled with anthrax.  Season 6 has mostly kicked ass though.  That finale was probably the best episode of the series, IMO.  But when people say they don't watch it, I just go, "Ok." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm glad Zootopia went the way it did.  This scene, powerful as it is, is waaay too on the nose, and it simplifies the issue to one extreme point of view.

The way they presented it in the movie was excellent.  The 'racism' of other species is a multifaceted problem, and you lean one way with Judy's story only for Nick's backstory to swing you another.  It plays with your emotions, and shows that people's perceptions of each other come from places of history, profiling, economics, etc...  

And to be fair, the 'naizism' of the collars is pretty heavy for a kids movie geared towards Americans.  Racial issues today are more reflected of the Civil Rights movement to most modern Americans, so I'm glad the movie steered more towards a multi-layered setting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a show based on a movie series where a frog monster teaches a punk kid to lift a starship out of a swamp while he talks to the ghost of his old mentor.  Where did this sudden suspension of disbelief of Star Wars comes from?  Star Wars has always been schlocky, fun, ridiculous pulp.  I don't see how Darth Maul creating spider-legs from sheer hatred takes you out of the experience...

Besides, what they do with his character in the series is miles ahead of what they did with him in the movie.  Everyone has this Boba Fett fascination with Maul, and he was a nothing character who flipped around like an idiot and died.  And now, he's in these shows, with more character development, depth and personality than Lucas could EVER attempt to imagine, and people hate it.  I can almost say that I enjoyed the Season 2 Finale of Rebels more than TFA. 

I'm sorry to be so passionate about this, but this is really starting to piss me off.  The Clone Wars has single-handedly repaired irreversible damage done to the Star Wars franchise.  I know, everyone's opinion is subjective...  But the way you dismiss it over trivial shit, with a lot of others, bugs the hell out of me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, granted I'l give you that...  It is interesting to see those other nations featured.  But even still, looking at the tweet you posted...  People are already annoyed that both France and Russia are not featured.

It's great if they want to focus on the smaller empires, but the name of the game is Battlefield...  Battlefield is well known for featuring starring nations of huge conflicts, and you'd actually be surprised how much the USSR is left in.  Most CoD games have them included, and Battlefield 1942 included them as well.  Because those games recognize the importance of their nation to the war.  Hell, 1942 even included Canada.  

It just seems like a disservice to have a game set around one of the biggest conflicts in modern history, and leave out a HUGE chunk to be released as DLC.  If I was controlling the game, I'd say to keep France and Russia in the main game, and deal out the smaller nations in DLC.  I'm not saying that their nations didn't contribute, but World War 1 was a conflict driven by the larger powers, not the smaller ones.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it bugs me because it's stating with its content that France wasn't important enough to be in the main game, when France was one of the major three players in the war.  

If I, hypothetically, was a French gamer, and I bought this game thinking that my country would be represented due to HOW IMPORTANT it was to the conflict, only to see the U.S. take credit for it, I think I'd be a little pissed.  Oh, and I'd have to BUY my country's DLC to play it?  Yeah, fuck that and fuck EA.

It'd be like stripping the USSR from a WW2 game.  You just don't do it...  I know most Americans are of the ignorant opinion that the French are cowards, lost the wars, etc.  But they were vital in World War 1, and to see their faction stripped away to be sold as some after-market DLC later is what offends me. </TEXT>

Like with the big overarching reviews of stuff like Cyberbully, but he gets too focused in the nitty details which can ruin a whole film for him.  He also has this annoying tendency to repeat popular sentiments about actors.  I remember him going on this rant about  Tyler Perry despite his performance being quite good in Gone Girl.  I feel that he's not a good film reviewer.  A film reviewer should be examining the themes, story and characters of a film.  Not how a particular sound made the rest of the film weird... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is completely fair.  He doesn't have to pry into his childhood friend's sex life on Facebook, but he does.  He doesn't have to pry into the drug trafficking business of his roommate's boyfriend, but he does.  He doesn't have to go and find out that his psychiatrist is into anal or not, but he does.  Yes, he may feel that this sense of justice-fueled invasiveness is a part of his problem, but it is still HIS problem.  I'm not saying I dislike Elliot.  He's a very flawed and compelling character, but to say, 'It's not his fault he invades other people's privacies.' Is incredibly naive.  He has the ability to change his circumstances, embrace his friends, leave the hacking side behind, but he doesn't...  Partly because of the ghost of his father following him around, but also because he has this overwhelming sense of self-worth and value to himself and his cause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UGH, NO.  That's not what schizophrenia is...  Elliot has Dissociative Personality Disorder, or some kind of fictional version of it.  And I know that he doesn't have Autism, seeing as how my brother has Autism...  Part of the reason that Elliot is so disconnected from people is because he has forced himself into that hole.  The episode where he decides to be normal and go to parties is evidence of this.  If he were autistic, he wouldn't be able to turn it off like he does.  If Elliot were autistic, he would have shown signs as a child, WHICH HE DOESN'T.  Part of his problems revolve around a traumatic element of his childhood, his father dying and his mother being abusive.  YOU DON'T CATCH AUTISM, that's not how it works.  Elliot has some form of PTSD, or has experienced a traumatic past, and that influences how he is now.

Stop watching Fight Club and thinking that's a academic look into schizophrenia.  It's not.  Schizophrenia is completely different. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I...  I already answered your question.  You don't consider it pathetic to hack into your friends social media?  You don't consider it sociopathic to dress down an employee that you barely know and tell him he doesn't matter?  I realize you like the show, but Elliot is a very bad person...  he's just written so well that he's sympathetic.  

Also, you don't know what either Schizophrenia or Autism is.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow...  That's a big question seeing as how you'd need to only watch the first ten minutes of episode one to know the answer.  He spies on all of his friends, he has no idea how to initiate social cues or how to act in social situations, he has a paranoid delusion that there are people consistently after him, he has a skewed idea of justice that applies to his own biased set of morals, he is currently losing his fucking mind, his body language is a complete mess...

I mean, come on man, the dude is off kilter...  I would have said he is psychotic as well, seeing as how he has a double personality WITH HIS DEAD FATHER.  How did you not pick up on this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this video.

It's hard not to feel the weight of the damage wrought to the Soviet Union.  Most Americans are of this jingoistic mentality that we won the war, that France was a bunch of cowards, etc...

No.  In the European theater, we were basically the clean up crew.  World War 2 was a Russian and German war, and it bugs the hell out of me that people don't realize that...  

But the way the video creator shows the numbers, how Russian deaths tower over all the others, just hits the nail in the coffin.  I'd say I'm more pessimistic about 'Long Peace' than the creator is.  The fact that more people were killed during World War 2, which wasn't that long ago, then any other war in history just tells me that we're still violent cavemen.  Our technology may be better, and we may have convinced ourselves that we're beyond the mentality of the evils of World War 2, but we aren't.  At all.  Just look at the political climate of the U.S. Election, or Russia's more recent invasion of Ukraine.  I feel as if another huge conflict is coming...  And it'll probably be more devastating than World War 2. </TEXT>

Am I crazy, or is there a LOT more going on in TFA than ANH?  For one thing, ANH was written without the idea of sequels coming afterwards.  That's why the characters are so cookie cutter, despite being wonderfully written.  TFA has hints of things to come, so there's a lot of speculation and hidden depth to all of the characters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, not a joke.  I think there are more character moments in TFA then there were in ANH.  And one thing they do, which is pretty unheard of in a Star Wars film, is let the characters just do things in silence.  Finn realizes he's not a killer as he fumbles around the village, the blood streaks across his helmet speaking volumes over what he could express in his war horrors, Rey spends like a whole five minutes exploring derelict Imperial ships for parts and buying food.  The majority of which is in silence.  We get an idea that Finn is conflicted about his role in the New Order and that Rey is bored of her life as a scavenger.  All without much dialogue uttered!  The only scene in ANH that kind of reflects on that is when Luke is looking at the two suns.  That's his 'call to adventure' so to speak.  Like I said, ANH is the most BASIC retelling of the hero's tale. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you completely.

People forget that A New Hope is the most BASIC retelling of the hero's tale.  I remember people saying that the pacing of The Force Awakens moved by at such a fast speed, when we get the same kind of pace in A New Hope.  We only get a few moments in the entire film of A New Hope for just honest character development...  When Obi-Wan is telling Luke about his Father, and when Obi-Wan, Luke, Han and Chewie are training on the Falcon while it's in Hyperspace.  That's it...  The rest is just action or dialogue relating to the next action set piece.

I love Tony Zhou, and I think he's one of the most influential and important voices in film right now, but yeah...  He's a bit more biased here.

	<TEXT> Maybe this is my Bond super villain in me speaking, but we honestly should dip our population by a billion...  Or more.

Not by catastrophic nuclear war of course, but perhaps a stop to reproduction world wide.

An impossible solution, but the growing environmental problems on this earth outside of Nuclear war is due to having too many God Damned people on our planet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have this thread once a month, and I always say Silvia from Skyfall.

My favorite Bond Villain at that.

And no...  Having him connected through Spectre was NOT a good decision.  Completely ruined his character. </TEXT>
