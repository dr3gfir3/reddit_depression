It's ridiculous that they stuff like do this without even sending us a message or warning.

Shows why they never have as much dissent on that sub as they should...

Even r/Amd mods at least warn you.

Wonder how much they like me now that I've started appearing on other subs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks like it, either way, requesting it in r/redditrequest is not the way to do it.

That only works if a subreddit has been abandoned but that's not the case here.

The issue is that the only person with full permissions, obeseclown, is inactive to the point of abandonment.

He has refused to answer any of our PMs or fellow brothers questions/requests comments and seldom comments/posts.

I've even got [proof](https://i.gyazo.com/79a0090f196c9722e562339d7f2908c9.png) that he was active yesterday, but all he did was remove stuff and not answer any questions or reply to anyone.

The only way to fix this is by repeatedly PMing obeseclown and hope he answers, or waiting until he's awake which is seldom these days.

Hell, the only way I was able to be active was being active *daily*, especially with memes.  I just happened to be around while obeseclown was online . (He decided it would be cute to remove one of my posts and claim it as his own and I called it.)

I'm doing the best that I can, but there are issues in this sub that haven't been fixed due to the lack of permissions.

I've suggested making u/-tilde mod and maybe opening an application for more mods but again, no answers.

It's too bad we've got permissions gimped like NoVideo, or else this sub could be so much better.

There should be full permissions for all the mods, so that getting things done isn't dependent on someone who's barely active. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About PCMR:

I used to not post there because I saw so much AMD stuff getting downvoted.  But then when they started stealing our stuff and posting it there without our knowledge or consent, I snapped.

There was so much bs being spewed there by Nvidiots/Int$hills that I couldn't immediately counter that I created a place where I could instantly facts check their asses.

I know a lot of people who came in here from that place and my user tags are showing that they frequent this place so we shouldn't abandon our allies in the field of war.

Not to mention I have to expand the Heretics page and nominate Dank Users.

I know I'm getting downvoted in these subs, but it don't really matter 'cause I'm gaining thousands of karma a day and a couple of angry fancucks isn't going to stop me.

Not to mention now they can't say anything negative about me when I post a good article, otherwise they get the downvote arrow like they should.

That's why I began posting in so many subs as you can see.

I've started a side project to see how much karma I could whore just for fun.

As long as my favorite sub doesn't show up as r/pcmasterrace, I'm good. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The few times I posted in there were AyyMD shitposts and insults to Nvidia. 

That's the only reason why I have karma in that sub.

People are getting really angry at me over there and I love it.

I think that's why they shadowbanned me as none of my comments are showing up.  Probably AutoModerator.

They didn't even give me a proper *banned* message that I could `Inspect Element` with.

Oh well, still have TotesMessenger to do my dirty work.

Not to mention all the other subs that I now have footholds in as you can see in the screenshot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good chart.

I'm conflicted as to what to do with the dual cards.  A lot of people say Xfire/SLI is broken to the point of negative scaling.

But where it does work, SLI sees about 60-70% depending on resolution while Xfire is similar, improving at higher resolutions.

Will add to chart based on these values. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wrong, and wrong.

 your 480 has higher power consumption than a 1080.

It's the other way around dumbass.

The GTX 1080 **ALWAYS** consumes more power than the 480

 HALF the performance

Wrong again Nvidiot. 

The 1080 is roughly [**~70%** stronger] (https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/MSI/GTX_1070_Quick_Silver_OC/29.html), and not the 'double' that you claim.


Are you done being wrong, or shall I continue?
