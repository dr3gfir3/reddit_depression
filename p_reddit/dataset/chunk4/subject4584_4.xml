	<TEXT> "Oh -- but the STUDENTS!"

More like their rich parents. Do you know why the paved over all the unpaved areas in the Plaza downtown? Because there was no ordinance against the homeless sleeping on the unpaved areas, only on the pavement. Rich UF booster parents were "appalled" at their kids having to see that (while they are stumbling around drunk at night downtown, probably) and so they paved the whole frigging thing. No shit. 

I once had a parent say to me on FB that she thought the entire SE side of town should be razed and rebuilt, because she hated to even drive her kid through it to get to school. Her main complaint was that Walgreens had a sign advertising free HIV tests. I guess her baby never had unprotected sex, right?

	<TEXT> I had a guy ask me once what was wrong with his business computer, so I brought in my toolkit of spyware/virus scanners and found over 100 malwares on his machine -- all from porn sites. He even had the porn sites bookmarked! He tried to blame it on "the guys in the shop," but I knew one of those guys, and he said that the boss sat there staring at porn most of the day, and would call them in sometimes to watch it with him. 

I fixed all his malware and blocked all the porn sites. As soon as I left, he called someone in to unblock them. </TEXT>

I told her it was because I was more computer literate than she was, and she said she didn't need to be computer literate, because she knew how to do what she needed to do on the computer. So, despite the fact that she had been there a year longer than I had, I was promoted to office manager, and she had the world's biggest hissy fit. The boss told her to go into my office for an hour a day and learn how to use the computer if she wanted to get promotions. She quit and went to work somewhere with a bunch of stupid shits that made her look like Einstein.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is so true! I have fixed so many problems on my machine just by asking someone what to do, or Googling it, or watching YouTube videos. I taught myself HTML and built a complete website when that was the way they were built. I'm minimally literate in CSS (although I hate it) and am trying to learn more about XML and other design languages. I'm really into how the internet works now, although learning that is harder than coding, I find. I remember when I asked somebody to explain "the cloud" to me, but now I understand it at least rudimentarily. 

And I'm 64 frigging years old! I know 1000x what some of these idiots passing this legislation they know nothing about know. Of course, I've always been a knowledge junkie who, before the WWW, read hundreds of books a year, mostly non-fiction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mostly just the ones who make money from it, and unfortunately, money talks louder than the opinions of actual residents. I see this town being totally taken over by UF one day, and a lot of flight to places like Hawthorne, which will become a bedroom community of Gainesville, complete with overpriced homes and gentrified neighborhoods. But they'll probably move out toward Waldo first, because of the access to the airport.

I'm just sad, because I really don't want to ever move again. I don't think my neighborhood is in any danger of being changed much, though. </TEXT>

I know you're probably too young to remember Orlando before Disney, but it was a sleepy little small town much like Gainesville was a few years back. Many native Orlando residents hate Disney and wish it had never opened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live off of 34th about a mile from Butler Plaza (1.5 mi from WalMart), and don't have a car, so I do agree about having everything in one place. I moved out here about 2 years ago expressly because I could walk to do my shopping, plus on hot or rainy days, there are tons of buses going anywhere you want to go. I just hate that these high-rises are ruining the small-town feel of Gainesville, and most of them are high-end residences, so it also changes the entire culture of the area. Plus, it puts twice as many cars on the road, so there's that. Right now, Windmeadows Blvd. doesn't really need street lights, but it will once that hotel and high rise go in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Coral snakes are notoriously non-aggressive. You practically have to stick your finger in their mouth to get bitten. Most people run into them while gardening, and they usually try to get away. I had one in my yard in SW FL, and I just watched out for it. The black racer that used to like to scare the shit out of me and almost give me heart attacks while I was working in the yard was much bigger danger. 

Remember that most snakes do not want to bite you, and they will backtrack and leave if they can. Venemous snakes want to save their venom for something they can eat. 

I agree to teach your child to recognize the snakes and stay away from them. My grandmother lived on a largely undeveloped island, and there were snakes everywhere. She taught us to take a "snake stick" with us to thrash the underbrush to scare them off, and the only snake I ever saw was a green snake and a black racer. My sister, on the other hand, forgot the rules and got bit by a copperhead later in life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are no refugees in my area, but there are organizations that will send someone to get things, but they won't pick up. I can't handle larger items; have no place to put them. I donate my clothes to a community ministry who has helped me in the past. They aren't "nice" enough for Goodwill, who would just sell them for rags or to be torn apart and made into thread. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I give away all baby and child things on Craigslist. I try to make sure they don't go to resellers, but I might have missed one or two. My problem is that I have no car, and the places you are talking about don't pick up, but I do let them know what I have so they can send people after it. I admit, I sell some stuff, because I need money too, but I have a very small apartment (500sf) so I can't stash a lot of stuff. 

Those are three good questions, especially the last one. I've been looking at things with a very critical eye lately, and asking "Do I need this?" It doesn't have to be a physical need. Sometimes I may need it because it makes me happy. If I can't say I "need" it, it goes into a box to be done away with in some way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are so many factors. Some topics pay better than others, your experience counts (don't expect to start at 20cpw unless you have a degree in journalism and a couple of years of experience). I make most of my money right now writing product descriptions because online articles are not as hot as e-commerce. You have to be fast to make decent money at it. I've been doing it awhile, so I can make about $20 an hour if there is plenty of work and I can get on a roll, but some days I've only made $10, and that's not for 8 hours straight. It doesn't work that way. 

Freelance writing is feast or famine, and you have to be very flexible in what you are willing to write. If you're looking for something stable, this isn't it, although there are some people who have turned it into a decent living. 

There is no way to project what you can make down the road, because the market changes every day. I'm not writing now what I wrote when I started, nor am I earning what I used to earn. Remember also, that you will be self-employed, so you have to pay your own taxes. I don't know about Canada, but in the U.S., we save back about 30% of each payout for taxes. 

Why don't you get started somewhere like one of the content mills and see how you like it? Textbroker has a site for the UK (textbroker.co.uk) and it's as good a place to start as any. They don't pay the best, but you can learn what clients want there, and work your way up to better pay and direct orders. If you hate it, you can go on to something else. </TEXT>

Then I have to take boxes out of the bedroom so I can put the bookcase in. In the courtyard, I have to take everything out so I can put the tables in where I want them.

So lots of work, but when I'm done, it will look and feel a lot better, and boxes will be unloaded! Yay! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, that's why I got this stuff, because I really do need it all. Well, maybe not the microwave, but it's so much prettier and more compact than the one I have and I have so little counter space. 

My problem isn't that I don't need the stuff. Mostly, it's that I end up letting it sit forever until I do something with it, but not this time. I'm going to jump right in and get this done! This bookshelf will be so great, because I have the tops of my desks covered with baskets full of stuff, so now I can put those baskets on the bookshelf and have a nice, clean desktop where I can work. Got both the desk and the chair from the dumpster last year, and haven't gotten to use it yet. 

So there is a plan, but I have so little space here, I have to be careful how much I bring in. ETA: Now if someone would just toss out a decent dresser, I'd be happy, so I can get rid of this old ratty one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know at least 3 people who are doing very well writing novels for Amazon and none of them have a college degree. If you want it, you can have it, you just have to want it badly enough to learn how to get it. 

Forget the "great American novel." Erotic romance is where the money is. Lonely women, sitting at home bored, wishing they had a Prince Charming to rescue them are the ones you need to write for. 

I don't know if you're old enough to remember those little Harlequiin romance novels, but my mom had about 100 of them, and she traded them with her friends for new ones. She belonged to a Harlequin romance book club with about 30 members, and all of them had dozens of those little books. Now they buy them for $2.99 on Amazon. 

While you're raking in money from those to support yourself, you can write any kind of great American novel you want. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Actually, some of the stuff I got will help me declutter, like the nice bookshelves and tables. I now have somewhere to put things I take out of the boxes. Honestly, I figure I can unload about 10-12 boxes onto this huge bookshelf, which motivates me to unpack them and get rid of more stuff. 

The outdoor tables will help get my plants up off the ground so I can sort and photograph them to sell. 

But I really didn't need that microwave! Here I am thinking of getting rid of the one I have, and now I have TWO! This one is a bit nicer, a bit smaller and works perfectly, so I guess I'll keep it for now and get rid of the other one. It's not worth selling because the ring under the glass is broken, but if I toss it up on Craigslist for free, maybe someone will take it.

I also got one of those tension-bar bath organizers, which I really, really need. That will get things off the sink counter and the top of the toilet tank. 

Now, if I could just find a place to put them until I can get them where they need to be.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm with you! I've had a horrendous few years where most of what I own has been packed in unopened boxes for 5 years. No way am I just tossing that stuff out! 

I actually had someone say "Why go through it all? Just load up the boxes and take them to Goodwill since you don't even know what's in them?" Really??? The fact that I don't know what's in them is EXACTLY why I have to go through them. 

I had pared down to things I didn't think I could or didn't want to live without, so everything in those boxes is something in those categories. 

I have been in this apartment almost two years now. The first year, I was so scared I was going to have to move again, I wouldn't unpack anything but what I really needed. I even kept all my boxes, flattened out, just in case. For most of the next year, I was helping my son financially during his last year of college, and couldn't afford to furnish the place like I wanted, so I just put it off. Now that all that is out of the way, I get to go through my treasures and decide what I really want to keep and what I can let go of. 

Don't feel bad at all! Other people don't know you and don't know your life or your heart. Do what gives you JOY! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many years ago (20 at least), a friend gave me a set of round-bottom copper bowls, which I promptly used as decoration on my kitchen wall, since I never whip egg whites and they are annoying since the bottom isn't flat. Since I really don't have room for decorative items in my kitchen anymore, I was thinking I probably don't need them. So I thought I'd sell them, and lo and behold! They are selling for anywhere from $30 to over $100 on eBay! I never noticed the brand name, but even the cheap-looking ones are going for a premium. Unbelievable. I'll have to polish these up a bit and see what I can get for them.

Some of the stuff I have had packed away for a long time is now "vintage," and will probably fetch a decent price on Craigslist (I don't do eBay). We'll see.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see so many people on here asking for quick money that they need in a very few days. You'd have better luck selling your possessions. 

Setting up accounts takes time, and if you are under 18 and don't have a PayPal account, you're pretty much screwed. MTurk pays into Amazon Payments, which you need to transfer to either a prepaid debit card or a bank account. 

The problem with places like UpWork is that it takes longer than a few days sometimes just to get a reply from some jobs, and even longer than that to get the jobs approved and paid.

So if you have any inkling that you may need money in the future very quickly, set things up now. Otherwise, start going through everything you own and sell it on Craigslist. 

I speak from experience. I've been working online for 8 years, mostly writing, and I only have two places where I could work and make any amount of money paid overnight or in a few days, and that would be limited by how much competition there is for that work and how much work there is available. One of those is MTurk and one is not accepting applications, so no need to write and ask me what they are. </TEXT>
