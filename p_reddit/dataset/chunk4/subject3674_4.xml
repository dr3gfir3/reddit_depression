	<TEXT> Thank you so much for sharing your experience! The whole time I was reading I was wondering if you'd found your son - I hope someday you do and someday soon at that. It's nice to know you want contact with both and I hope my birth mother is the same. I like the idea that simpler is better; I'm not in a huge hurry and only recently have I really started to consider searching. I think my first step will be calling the adoption agency to see if she's left any information for me and to request my own copy of my records. I need to have them again before I start searching so I'm sure of all the information. Thanks again. It's cool to know someone else out there has experienced multi-generational adoption! </TEXT>
