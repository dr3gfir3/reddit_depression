	<TEXT> Wow I never saw my profile in a light that suggests that I'd like to date only younger women; looking at it now I realize that I did have it set to 24-30 (I've changed to 26-32) - not sure how I came up with those numbers in the first place. The age really isn't an issue with me as long as her mindset is not significantly younger.

There's a whole weird history as to why all my friends are much younger than I am, long story short: I kind of just fell into a younger crowd making friends through family who're much younger than I am.

I'm very open to having kids as I feel it'd put a little more focus towards my life but that's just me.

Thank you for the critique! re-reading it with this new view, I'll take the advice about the last two paragraphs.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone have any tips dealing with the disorientation associated with heavy prescriptions (-9) when switching back and fourth between contacts and glasses? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-05 01:09:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been near-sighted since the 3rd grade, started wearing gas permeable contacts in the 5th grade (I'm 30 now with soft contacts). I have a really hard time adjusting to wearing glasses after wearing contacts for an extended period; with my glasses everything is further away, there's a a fishbowl effect on objects that closer to me, and my overall balance feels similar to being tipsy. It takes me up to four days to adjust to the disorientation but the everything-looks-farther-away and fishbowl effect stays (as compared to my blurred vision or contacts).

I've experienced this issue with all the glasses I've ever had, I figure it's because of how bad my vision is but I would love to know if it's not. (My current pair is the SOUL from FATHEADZ)

Is there anything I can do to reduce the disorientation?

Any input would be great, Thanks!

Oh, btw I thought I should mention that I can adjust from glasses to contacts in a matter of hours. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there are two downsides so far: the tiny little screws that keep the battery door on (because I want to be able to change batteries on the fly), [easily remedied](http://instagram.com/p/rtB2GUB8x0/) with a drill and some [magnets](http://amzn.com/104800001X); and the worse one (new to me today) is that the built-in ohm reader bugs out and reads your coils lower than they actually are. I found that clicking 4-times and holding on the 4th click bypasses that, not sure if that's a real fix  because it just started happening today but so far it seems to do fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I make the waffles with a plantain, an egg, almond milk, pecans, almonds, and a pinch of salt - throw all in a blender until silky smooth. After the waffle iron's done with the waffles I throw them in a pan on medium heat until they get a nice crisp crust (leaving the waffle in the iron longer just  seems to just steam the waffle and makes it dark soggy). 

I don't have any measurements as I just eyeball everything, sorry.

I used 6x uncured bacon strips (baked at 405f), organic local colorado tomato, four whole lettuce leaves and homemade olive oil mayo. 

For the dehydrated sweet-potato chips, i used a mandolin and threw the pieced in a dehydrator for about 4hrs, tossed in EVOO with some salt and baked at 300 until I felt they were done.  </TEXT>

my cat stops as soon as I make eye-contact with her and won't do it if I'm paying attention (I had to hide to get the video).

She's definitely not in any pain nor does she move away or show any negative reactions - of all the years she's never even so much as hissed. 

I've noticed one constant: she'll inevitably howl right after eating, then throughout the day regardless if she just ate or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't remember where I found this but I make this every 2-3 weeks and snack on about a hand-full at a time when I'm really hungry and lazy. Outside of [homemade pork rinds](http://www.reddit.com/r/Paleo/comments/2bkpkd/pork_rinds_1cup_174cal_1002gfat_0carbs/), this is my favorite snack.

**Paleo Granola**

Ingredients

* 1 cup Almonds, roughly chopped

* 1 cup Pecans, roughly chopped
*  cup Cashews, roughly chopped
*  cup Unsweetened Coconut Flakes
*  cup Unsweetened Shredded Coconut
*  cup Hemp Hearts
* 2 tsp Vanilla Extract
*  tsp Sea Salt
* 1 tsp Cinnamon
*  cup Raw Honey

*Instructions*

Preheat oven to 350F. Line a rimmed 1318 baking sheet with parchment paper or a properly-sized silicone mat. Set aside.
Combine all ingredients except honey in a large bowl. Stir to evenly combine everything.
Add the honey to the nut mixture. Evenly stir it all in, coating everything evenly.
Pour the mixture onto the prepared baking sheet. Make sure to scrape everything out, the hemp hearts tend to stick to the bowl and spoon and you dont want to waste those little guys.

Bake in the preheated oven for 10-20 minutes, stirring once or twice after 10 minutes. Check periodically after 10 minutes to make sure its not burning. My ovens sweet spot is 16-17 minutes, stirring twice after the 10 minute mark. Youll notice the granola is an overall rich, golden color when its done.
Remove from oven, stir, and let cool completely on a wire rack. It will harden as it cools. Break up into bite-size pieces and store in an airtight container for up to one week to preserve the crunchiness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She does this every couple of hours throughout the day and the night, it's completely random: she'll howl and then it could be a couple of hours or just 10min before she starts again - sometimes the howling can last up to a whopping five minutes! I have to put up with this for a couple of weeks at a time but it's completely sporadic when it comes to frequency. Sometimes she goes for months as just my lovable cat and then she pulls this madness for weeks. The longest I've gone without her howling was roughly eight months but sometimes it'll only be a month of bliss.

This time's been the longest she's continued, it's been a ridiculous three weeks of this howling! She won't howl if I'm looking directly at her (I had to hide to get this video), she'll howl when I'm in the room sleeping or just not looking but if I make eye-contact she'll stop and just stare me down - often she'll just walk out of my sight to howl.

I've given her catnip,[ this calming stuff](http://www.petsmart.ca/gsi/webstore/WFS/PETNA-PETCA-Site/en_CA/-/CAD/ViewProduct-Start?CategoryName=200050 CatalogName=36 SKU=36-5161167) and even tried using [this collar](http://amzn.com/B0026JAKWG) for a night and it did absolutely nothing.

She's 6 (I've had her since she was a tiny kitten), indoor-only, spaded, and eats science diet "indoor". She eats and drinks regularly and doesn't throw up much, maybe she'll throw up once every two to three weeks but my understanding's that it's pretty normal.

I did take her to a vet a few years back and show'd them a different video of her howling and they didn't know what to make of it, they shaved her belly to make sure there was a spade scar and proceeded to tell me that they'd have to analyze her stool for $250 on top of the $80 I've already paid for the consultation; I was unemployed at the time and did not have the funds for that. Here I am again unemployed (yet again) and cannot take her to the vet, so I'm asking reddit.

Any insight would be great! 

Thank you! </TEXT>

my last try was booting into my hackintosh hdd on the desktop but of course osx won't write to NTFS.

	<TEXT> The only installation access I have is on a flash drive that I made on a different machine which needs isn't UEFI. I tried to create a recovery disk using my desktop but windows tells me that I'm missing files and if I have issues I should use my installation disk.

The built-in recovery ie booting from the recovery partition on the notebook just takes me windows restore and the only options I have are to factory reset or restore from a designated point in time. 

I guess at this point I'm going to have to mount the drive on my desktop to be able to use the utilman exploit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My version of the lenovo yoga 2 11 only allows me to boot GPT/UEFI and everyone suggests changing the BIOS to legacy after disabling secure boot [If you look at post #15](http://forums.lenovo.com/t5/Idea-Windows-based-Tablets-and/Yoga-2-11-USB-boot/td-p/1463993/page/2) you can see that I'm in the same situation and simply do not have this option. 

I've tried dozens of bootable flash drives in my arsenal: linux distros, recovery tools, even my windows8 flash drive will not show up in the boot options (probably because it wasn't UEFI).

Of all of my tools the only flash drive that my lenovo even sees is the Clover bootloader, I was hoping there is a way to use Clover to boot into Trinity Rescue.

Any details on how I could accomplish this would be of tremendous help, thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i've gone from 205 to 191 with zero exercise. energy has been great, before paleo, even the smallest of meals (sometimes light snacks) would make me sleepier than taking two benadryls! eating paleo so far has been fantastic in the health department, i look noticeably thinner all around and acid-reflux has been tremendously better as well. 

the only downsides are the amount of effort that has to be put in to cook, it takes me almost twice as long to cook my meals and grocery cost is a but higher but I think this lifestyle change will be for the better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 2000(?) my high school principal was tricked into having a techno dance but it turned out to be a rave called Candyland, I of course attended as I indulged myself in a lot of raves back in those days. Seeing people fxcking in the bathroom, everyone smoking everything while rolling balls in the commons was quite the experience. Drugs, sex, debauchery and loud techno thumping for hours - the school was trashed by the end of it. I'm a proud alumni of Rampart High School, go class of 2002!

	<TITLE> So... alcohol. Can I drink it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-31 23:51:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm 30 and I'm just starting with Paleo, stumbled upon this solution because even the lightest of meals were putting me to sleep, 4 days of paleo and not a single meal has induced the coma!

On the weekends I drink quite heavily, I'm not at all a beer person but I do consume quite a large amount of tequila, clear "blanco" ie Patron Silver. In a single night I'll knock back roughly 15-18 1.5oz shots and I'll do this Friday night and Saturday night - but the other 5 days of the week zero alcohol consumption.

Obviously cavemen didn't have distilled liquor and I'm guessing that alcohol breaks down into sugars and carbs - so am I answering my own question there? 

Any info on alcohol regarding Paleo would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

edit:
I'm beginning to understand! so the directory ~/.conkyrc which houses mutiple text is the config files, so they need to be consolidated into a single text file named .conkyrc - i will experiment and see what i can come up with </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-04-16 07:28:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my friends and I all took advantage of the upgrade price when win8 first launched and of course the keys we have only work for a win8 build, not win8.1, which is fine and all but when we have to format for whatever reason (like a new pc build) we'll have to install via the usb key we created from the microsoft website.

the issue is that we have to endure hours of updates until we're caught up enough to upgrade to 8.1. my question is:

"is there a way where I can download all of the necessary updates and inject them into the win8 usb so that I can just let the install run and install all the required updates and be on my way to updating to 8.1 on basically the initial boot?"

my google-fu doesn't seem to be doing me any favors at the moment, any info would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My drone takes off but at an angle, one of the motors stutters as it takes off at a weird angle - one of the motors continue to stutter as it veers into a wall at which point the flight is obviously over, all of this in a matter of seconds.

I've checked my propellers, they "seem fine" (i'm guessing i'm just looking for eveness and imperfections); looked at the cogs and such, nothing astray there; reset the drone with a toothpick multiple times, and i've pressed the 'flat trim' a thousand times but nothing has worked!

There's definitely something a matter with one of the motors, i'm not sure which one but if i just hold the drone and take off, i can hear stutters - i'll try and shoot a video and post it for clarity but in the meantime i would appreciate absolutely any input!

Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bought 4 of the [patriot 22mm fasttech clones](https://www.fasttech.com/p/1604700) - I've pawned 3 of them off to friends and am currently using one on my caravela, they work great except for one issue: the ones from fasttech only have one hole and it's on the opposite side of the logo, so you either have to drill one new hole through the logo and widen up both or drill two brand new holes on the sides of the logo but they all perform fine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For example I want to basically just click from one point to another and have it automatically create a line with line distance without having to actually draw a long line then two short lines and typing out the length.

Just trying to speed up my workflow as a package designer, thanks!

	<TEXT> I felt like you at first being that i started vaping back in '09 coming off of a pack-a-day or more but I've accepted the "trend" and am quite thankful for it, juices and material have never been easier to get and innovation's always just around the corner. I lean more towards killabud's mentality and also try to just accept that there will always be "posers" but to waste energy on it just isn't worth it - I mean it's similar to music: "hip hop's dead" "micheal was better when he was black" "metallica isn't metal" etc. times change, we don't have to like it but it's not worth the effort to hate it =P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looking at GPU-Z I do notice that one of my cards run roughly 5-7degrees hotter under zero load on both cards, looks like I'll have to stress test the new card to see if it's faulty.

Thanks for your input! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well after an extensive search many forums are pointing to a faulty bridge, trying to ensure a working bridge I pulled the trigger on a "brand-name" bridge.

As for the temperatures, upper right-hand monitor during benchmarks doesn't even reach 65c before the crash </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SLI GTX 670 Crashes during benchmark tests </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-04 07:04:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've got 2 [EVGA 2GB GTX 670](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16814130784)s with a [3rd gen i](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16819116504)5 on a[ sabertooth z77](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813131821) with a [OCZ 750W ZT](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16817341052); all clocks are stock and am using the bundled [flimsy SLI Bridge](http://img.techpowerup.org/110216/SLI_Front.jpg) that came with my MOBO. NVIDIA Control panel seems to say that the SLI is fine (as far as I can tell).  

I'm running benchmarks at 1440 via display port on a dell ips monitor. When I run heaven and valley w/o SLI enabled I can run the benchmark all the way through but when I enable SLI my monitor basically gets disconnected after 2 or 3 scenes during the benchmark sequences (it especially struggles when changing scenes), I can still hear the benchmark audio for about a minute until there's a sound glitch and the whole rig locks up forcing me to have to do a manual restart.

I've googled far and wide and have re-installed the drivers but haven't had any luck, I've also ordered the an [EVGA branded SLI bridge](http://amzn.com/B00F93S5DM) and it should be here at the end of week but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone has any insight on this issue that doesn't concern the bridge itself.

Thanks for anything ahead of time! </TEXT>
