	<TEXT> I have chronic back pain, have been on meds for years (flexiril and ibuprofen), and I had chronic stomach pain start two years ago. Nobody can find a cause. My quality of life has gone down significantly. I can't exercise, can barely eat, I don't sleep. The doctors seem uninterested because "it's only pain". After my own research I'm starting to figure out that all four of the meds I'm on interact with each other and every single one can cause ulcers and stomach bleeding. Pretty disappointed in all my docs for not catching that (they know all the drugs I'm on).  </TEXT>

We are working on day FOUR here and no one is any closer to locating this aircraft. I'm not saying that there isn't a HUGE, concentrated effort going on, it must be so frustrating for them out there, searching and not finding anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm Canadian and my son's Sex Ed started last year, in grade four. I'm not ashamed to admit that my eldest son was a "WHOOPS!" at 19. Though I love him dearly, it was very hard (his father and I are still together and have his younger brother together, my fifth grader). We have openly told my eldest that he was unplanned (though a HUGE joy to us) and that there are things we wish we would've been able to do before children. Like travel. We tell him (and have been telling him for years) that we don't care IF he's having sex, we just care that he's being smart about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having the confidence to go barefaced is great. I eventually stopped wearing daily make-up due to break-outs (at 37, STILL), my favorite part is being able to rub my eye or scratch my face without having to worry about my make-up. Do what works in your life. Let your work speak to your professionalism. </TEXT>
