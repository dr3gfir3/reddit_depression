	<TEXT> My freshman year, my best friend and I were going to a concert. I didn't know about it till last minute, like the week of. So I bought my tickets and I was going to drive us both. I thought he was super excited to go with me.
Well, later I found a message on my other friend 2's phone from him (I wasn't snooping, I was answering a message from Friend 1 he asked me to reply to) and I saw Friend 1 tell Friend 2 "hey let's not mention this to subject7608. Invite all the hot girls you know" which was later followed up with "...guess who is having car troubles and has to tell subject7608 they're going to the concert and convince her to buy tickets so she can drive me. -_-"

So basically he used me to get a ride to a concert. Under the guise of friendship.
It rocked. </TEXT>
