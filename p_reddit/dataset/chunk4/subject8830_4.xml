	<TEXT> This is an interesting paper, but I feel it might be a bit dated. The paper was published (2014) a year before a massive piece of this glacier broke off (2015). The paper itself states that better imaging and and more research is needed. This article I posted clearly states that the images that showed the crack growing for 2 years wwas almost missed by these researchers and was probably missed by those before them. I'm not saying head for the hills straight away, but it seems quite likely that they are on to something. </TEXT>

Grab your pale

	<TEXT> Once Bonded 

The day has no feelings
Tasteless, colorless,   wanting
I was the day
Till your presence
Dominated me
Refusing me
Even a glance
Enticing me
With your torture

Finally you took me
Without warning
Breaking my will
With a compassionate severity
I always deserved

Then my heart came
To be too delicate
As my need for you swelled
With each of my punishments

The pain I asked for
Was never enough
It was your absence
That I could not bare
You cut loose the leather
Severed the cuff chains
Showing it wasn't role play
 You truly were a sadist.

A man answered.  
I asked if the Lady of the house was in.  
His eyes narrowed and he asked, "why?"  
"I'm just inquiring about her services", I said.  
"What kind of services", he asked with a perplexed tone.  
"Well, the red-light services" I said bluntly.  
He started screaming and flailing his arms and body about.

  out of me comes it all   
Dirty words comforting loneliness  
As emotions wrap themselves in filthy sheets   
Passion turns to angry thoughts   
That are confined in padded walls  
Oceans of solitude are rippled with false hopes  
  frames confine the universe  
While tears and blood mingle no longer  
The endless beating has ended  
Words do tricks like playing dead  
Emotional insanities inside my head  
Temptations arm reaches into moonless nights  
Mercy cries dance out of pregnant wombs   
So kiss me, kill me, but dont say you love me  
For out of me comes nothing.

When the moon softens,  
Before the cock of morning   
I wander, looking, through the streets   
Till I chance upon your likeness.  


Sometimes -   
You are the wind chiming through the leaves   
And I have found you   
in moonlit shadows of sleeping feline.  
Once you even took to metaphor   
written on a temple door.   


Sometimes, wine makes a beggar out of me   
Though, sober or stupor,    
I shall always be   
Loves beggar.

Her emotions not shared by her alone  
My soul seeking to touch hers  
Or just a glimpse from afar would fill my need for her  
I knew nothing of loneliness until we met  
Mere seconds were apart are endless torture  
If there was no time, with her I would spend eternity  
I long to bath in the ocean her eyes behold  
To flow along the river in her veins  
To pulsate within her heart, that we may become one  
Within her I feel complete  
She fills me with a wholeness Ive never known 
Alone I am myself, but with her I am so much more.

Now Im drowning and naked    
Cuzz you couldnt make it    
To hear this poem being read    
Though even that gives me voice,    
though no choice    
To get out these words,    
you might think absurd
Yet I have no doubt, that without them    
I wouldnt have found a way     
To be here tomorrow    
Let alone, today     
  

I remember when you held me     
by my shirt collar    
You screamed and you hollered    
You had a knife in your hand     
Stabbed it into the night stand     
  asked me how I wanted to die     
But in the 5th grade     
Dad  I still thought you were the greatest guy.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Afterwards, she hummed a soothing melody     
  afterwards, the bartender rinsed out the glass     
  afterwards, I said I loved her     
Though I dont think she believed me     
    
During our little escapade, we soothed each other     
  during my drunken state the bartender stared     
  during all of this, I said I loved her     
Though I dont think she believed me     
     
Before we soothed each other, we were so lonely     
  before I walked into the bar, I was sober     
  before I said to her, I love you     
I wasnt sure that I believed it     

When all was said and done, we were good together     
  when all was said and done, I left the bar, towards her house     
  when all was said and done, I still loved her     
  I think shes starting to believe me.

	<TEXT> And so, for the last time I looked into his eyes    
I knew it.    
He knew it.     
There was nothing we could do.
Staring, without words,     
just the understanding of it all   how it had to be    
I took his hand, reassuringly,
breathing him in deeply    
breathing him out slowly    
feeling the relaxation of him in me.
My heart sank.    
Sank into the loneliness that was to come.    
I knew no present pleasure in a fading moment    
  understanding it all, he let me be alone    
But stayed by my side,     
holding me,     
loving me,     
in a silent sensual way.
So it was, us, together for the moment     
But time went on,   the moment passed us by         
  again, we were two lonely lovers.

It keeps you engaged throughout and, as I mentioned, does, IMO, have a very satisfying ending. </TEXT>
