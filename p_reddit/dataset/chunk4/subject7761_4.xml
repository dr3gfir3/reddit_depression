	<TEXT> I suppose I used to be quite ageist, but I never expected to make friends with a much older person. One of my best friends is elderly and has Alzheimer's. Obviously she gets very confused sometimes, but she always remembers me, even if she doesn't know my name. Despite her difficulties she's one of the most considerate people I've ever met.

I also had a friend since childhood, I don't see her so much now, but we were polar opposites. She made me watch the Justin Bieber movie. Twice.

	<TEXT> Do you know exactly what's making you feel dissatisfied? Is there anything in particular you feel you want to do, but just aren't doing? I think if you want your life to be different, you should absolutely go for it. A couple of years ago I didn't do much socially, but I came out of my comfort zone and started volunteering, and it really opened things up for me.  </TEXT>
