	<TEXT> No problem! 

Eyeshadow palettes usually have sensors. So does perfume. Any contour palettes or glow kits by Anastasia Beverly Hills will be tagged, so will any Naked palettes or the Sweet Peach eyeshadow palette from Too Faced. Basically the most popular items are the ones they tag.

My favorite items to lift from Ulta are foundation, rollerball perfumes (some of these are tagged though), eyebrow pencils, lipstick, mascara, and highlighter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure! At my training, we met our loss prevention manager at the store. He's very friendly once you get to know him but was of course trying to scare the shit out of us. To me, Nordstrom is more focused on internal theft than anything. We have a specific door that only employees can use, and everyone has a unique code to get in. If you try to hold the door open for someone, an alarm will go off. The cameras are state of the art PTZ cameras and they're all over the store. We have no shelves and everything is very open, so no blind spots. 

We learned some basic LP training when I was hired, but the main thing they told us was that we're not allowed to apprehend even if we see someone put something in their bag. Because it "offends the customer". But we have a special key on our computer to page LP to come to our area. There is always someone watching cameras and they have several plainclothes. When we need LP, we page "Clay Morgan" to come to whatever department needs help.

One of the managers who trained us said that "the best deterrent to theft is great customer service!" Pffffft. That's actually company policy. It was in our handbook.

We mostly get return fraud but like any other store people will conceal shit in their bags and go. LP has their own office where they detain lifters and cuff them. They take LP very seriously and will directly contact the police.

Cameras can see everything from the color of your eyes to the time on your fucking watch. They're the same cameras that are used in casinos.

I'm SO tempted to lift something from our store (because there's no way in hell I could afford anything there), but I would recommend not fucking with Nordstrom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem! I'm flattered that you asked me. Lol.

All of the employees wear all black. At most Ultas, only the employees at the cash wrap have headsets, along with the store manager. Small items (lipsticks, eyebrow pencils, blushes, etc.) are easy to grab and conceal and usually aren't tagged. Mainly be on the lookout for RFIDs (and sometimes they hide sensors in packaging...be careful) If employees try to approach you, ask where you can find an item that they don't have (like Hourglass products, Kat Von D products, or Beauty Blenders). This will usually deter them. There's a few good blind spots, especially in the aisles where the drugstore makeup is or where the drugstore skin care products are. Just be aware of employees, nosy customers, cameras, and mirrors. Best tactic is to crouch down and look at "items on the bottom shelf" and peel off sensors, and conceal your haul in your bag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've lifted from there. They usually do receipt checks, but if you go late at night it's a lot easier. Staff will watch you pretty closely but I walked out once with a brand-new pair of $150 Nikes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very true! Plus a lot of teenagers shop there and teenagers are always looked out for by LP. But the items aren't very expensive so maybe that's got something to do with it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree with everything you had to say here. I also find it serendipitous that the majority of folks I've met in this community are genuinely good people. Lifting doesn't make someone a bad person. People with no concern for others and with huge egos (i.e. the Walton siblings) are the real bad people in this world.

I appreciate your kind words, man. Be safe and keep doing what you're doing. You're a really good person and I wish you the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never seen/heard of LP at Forever 21. That's really interesting! Anytime I've lifted there it's been pretty easy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you! I'm so excited! Lifting has played a significant role in me being able to finally afford a place. Once I started getting good, I'd lift more expensive things (especially makeup) and sell them to save up some cash or for lunch money. I also still lift groceries (especially at places with reusable bags) because no one can live off of McDonalds and soda, and healthy food is expensive as fuck.

I enjoy lifting and I'm proud of myself when I pull off tricky lifts, but someday I'd like to be secure enough to not have to steal. Well...maybe I will every once in a while. Lol. </TEXT>
