	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure Amaranthus said this once. Without NoCheat players with hacked clients can teleport across the server, very far distances on the server. When doing that the game does not just generate the chunk they go to, it generates all the chunks along the way as well. Because of all the chunks the map has to generate at once the server will crash. I don't think we want server crashing. NoCheat will probably be staying on. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> City Biosphere is located at +1376 +1419. This is south-east of spawn

The plan for the city is to have player houses and city resources (farms, chest rooms, furnace rooms) to be located in biospheres. Each sphere should be themed to a different biome (you can choose your own biome theme).

If you want to join all the city needs now is resources (sand and coal are the two biggest things). After the base sphere is built the home spheres will be built above it. The main sphere size is 51 in diameter and the home spheres will probably 25 in diameter (this may be changed). Please do not build anything large (houses, roads, etc.) because the city is just in the first stages. Also place your chests/furnaces outside the large main sphere. All you need to do is collect sand and coal to make glass (there is a large desert at +1573 +1762 which is a little south of the city).

Thanks and have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't at all though. I interviewed my pastor one time for religion class (I do not attend a Catholic or public school) and he said that the most important thing he sees is the relationship between you and God and that the relationship should be personal. I personally take that as trying to be just a good person. 

My actions shouldn't be any different than somebody who doesn't believe in God. By being born into religion, like the kids mentioned in the story. They saw what they grew up in and after they learned more about the world they could question what they believed to be true. This happens a lot in high school and college where kids learn the most about themselves. By questioning their own beliefs and seeing what was wrong with those beliefs and choosing how to live the rest of their life they are growing a lot as a person and **it is for the better no matter what they choose if they have truly soul searched.**  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If DICE is licensing stuff from other studios in EA for the public to use it every single user would have to purchase a licence for each thing that DICE doesn't directly own and that would cost a large amount of money. The only way DICE could feasibly make mod tools would be to custom make mod tools that had no licensed material in them which would probably be a big undertaking and would probably not be fiscally feasible.

tl;dr It would cost too much money for us if they released it the way it is now and it would cost too much money for EA/DICE to make mod tools for us. </TEXT>

Also the M320 is not getting a faster reload speed but a faster resupply speed. It will take less time to get more ammo. They still have to get more ammo. This really should not unbalance it at all. </TEXT>

I kind of think they did this a little too late. Google+ could have been bigger if it was open to everybody when it first started. One of the big groups on facebook is the under 18 crowd and they might have checked out G+ but the age requirement prevented them from doing that.

	<TEXT> Did you watch the video I linked to? (BTW I was taking that guys points from the video).

As the video stated other weapons balance difficultly of use with more damage. The G3A3 has a slower rate of fire and more recoil than other assault weapons but off sets the difficulty by giving a higher damage per bullet. Since it is harder to directly hit a target with frag rounds there should be compensation for this increased difficulty by increasing the damage per round. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Discussion About Shotgun Frag Rounds </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-21 22:45:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Shotgun frag rounds are an interesting choice for shotguns. Here is the official Battlelog description of it

An advanced explosive round, FRAG rounds provides enhanced suppression but lacks accuracy or stopping power.

There are two ways you can look at frag rounds, an overpowered super weapon which should be nerfed and an underpowered weapon that needs to be buffed. Just some background information: Frag rounds for semi auto and full auto shotguns were nerfed in the Dec 6th patch for PC's, I have heard that on consoles frag rounds deal pre-patch damage.

**Pre-Patch Damage Semi Auto/Full Auto**

60 damage up to 8 meters with a fall off to 34 (I think, it could be 10) damage at 40 meters.

**Post-Patch Damage Semi Auto/Full Auto**

20 damage up to 8 meters with a fall off to 10 damage at 40 meters.

Pump action shotguns were not affected by the patch and have consistently dealt the same damage. 60 up to 8 meters with a fall off to 10 damage at 40 meters.

We can all agree that frag rounds for semi auto and full auto shotguns were overpowered but now there is disagreement. Some say they are still overpowered, some say they are fine, some say they need to be buffed a little.

**ARGUMENT FOR BUFFING FRAG ROUNDS**

Let us look at this video to see one good argument for why frag rounds for semi auto shotguns should be buffed a little.

[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQUWD4Lpdk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWQUWD4Lpdk)

His major points:

* Frag rounds have one of the slowest or the slowest projectile speeds which means the player must compensate more for bullet drop and the target's movement.
* Shotguns fire slower which means the player will have fewer opportunities to damage his target in the same amount of time as other weapons

**So the more difficult the weapon is to use the higher the payoff should be for using the weapon effectively. This would mean frag rounds for semi auto shotguns should deal more damage due to the increased skill it takes to use them.**

He then does some tests by getting the first shot at the enemy before they can fire back. He loses at every range. (At closer ranges they were shooting head shots so that probably skewed the results).

After all this you could argue that frag rounds for semi auto shotguns could use a buff.

(Also check out this video for more info about this: [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgLWw8GSdVI](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EgLWw8GSdVI)).

**ARGUMENT FOR NERFING FRAG ROUNDS**

Now lets look at the other side. Frag rounds deal massive amounts of suppression and also deal 240% damage for headshots (other weapons only deal 200% for headshots). Frag rounds also deal explosive damage  which means you do not even have to hit the target to damage them. A full auto frag round user can turn a corner and take out 5 or 6 guys fairly quickly which would not be possible with other weapons...I actually do not have any other reasons why you would want to nerf frag rounds. If you have any post them in the comments.

**ARGUMENT THAT FRAG ROUNDS ARE FINE**

The easy way to look at this is that frag rounds were OP before and if they were nerfed anymore their effectiveness would be almost 0 because their damage output would be even lower. This is a really bad way to say they are fine because that doesn't help anyone. There is another way to look at them. Remember the description of frag rounds. Have enhanced suppression but lack stopping power. You can look at frag rounds as a supportive weapon type. Instead of trying to use it offensively use it as team support. If your team is trying to attack an well fortified position use frag rounds to suppress enemies so that your team can take them down. Frag rounds are excellent at confusing, disorienting, and scaring the enemy. They do not need to deal a whole lot of damage because they deal a whole lot of suppression.

	<TEXT> I'll back you up. [Battlefield 3 Rules of Conduct](http://help.ea.com/article/battlefield-rules-of-conduct?showhome=true) and [EA Terms of Service](http://tos.ea.com/legalapp/WEBTERMS/US/en/PC/). The rules of conduct say that you cannot break the terms of service of your servers. Let me refer to number 11: Rules of Conduct line 2:

Harass, threaten, embarrass, spam or do anything else to another player that is unwanted, such as repeatedly sending unwanted messages or making personal attacks or statements about race, sexual orientation, religion, heritage, etc.

Kicking somebody based solely on their gender probably breaks this rule which then breaks the Rules of Conduct for servers.

	<TEXT> Russia can steal US vehicles. Also C is supposed to be a tactical point. Without that point you can lose the game, that's the whole point. Should your team only defend C and lose every other point or should your team distribute defense around the island leaving C more vulnerable. Everything in this game is pro and cons. Should i use a fast firing rifle with lower damage and more recoil or a slower firing weapon with less ammo, less recoil, and more damage? If everything was just simple and easy the game would lose depth. Without depth and complexities the game would get boring very quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wake Island is fair because Russia starts with all the points. If you set up a good defense your team can take down any vehicles or aircraft even before they get to the island. This game requires teamwork. That's why it also takes more than one person to take down a heli usually. In Wake if they get to the island the smartest thing to do as US is to take the Russian vehicles. It gives your team a better chance of winning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoyed the campaign but if they made the campaign similar to the book (The Russian) then it would have been much better. The book follows Dima's story and how Blackburn becomes involved. The book also has a better time fleshing out the characters (because it is a book) and you learn so much more about the Russian side of the story.

[Also Dima has a son from a lost lover who works at the stock exchange (thats why he goes to get the bomb) and the nuke never goes off because Dima defuses it.](/spoiler) </TEXT>
