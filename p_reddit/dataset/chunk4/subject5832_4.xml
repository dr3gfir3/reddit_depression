	<TEXT> Let's have a 30 minute video skype conversation, record and it let the internet judge who has a boring, generic personality. I'm a world class mothafucka, mothafucka. I bet you have an anxiety attack at the thought of even interacting with a person online in live/video form. Go back to the dungeon </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't even know he still existed until his streaming career started. And to be honest, it feels like he only exploded because Ice Poseidon was there to show support. Even now though, all he does is take pictures with fans, eats food all day, and walks 4-5 miles because he has no other content for the viewers. Even though the Ruben drama shit happened, that stream was more entertaining to watch than him just sitting and getting fatter everyday. </TEXT>
