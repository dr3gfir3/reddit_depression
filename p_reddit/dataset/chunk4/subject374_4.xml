	<TEXT> It confused me, I saw how popular it was so I decided to check it out, after reading I was like, "Wait what? This is pretty tame for the sub, nothing really bad happened, ending is still open... Is this real and that's why everyone loved it?"

I was just confused as to why it shot right up in popularity, the idea is nice, but I didn't feel the compelling urge to go check back in. 

I mean, tomorrow I'm gonna check back and see what's up, see if it gets interesting, but so far it hasn't really hooked me in. 

Or maybe it has just a bit.. Because I'm curious to see if there will be a climax. Saving my upvote until there's a bit more added.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's a regular human who is out for their own gain, not one who commits outright awful sins, they aren't so bad. Especially if they haven't managed to use their righteous attitude to gain a life of extreme luxury, because then they're easy prey. 

Humans filled with greed, undeserved righteousness, or are generally cocky and self involved can taste quite good. Bitter in the way of the darkest of chocolates, an undertone of mint that is intense enough to be felt long after the meal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You make a good point, around 9 decades ago or so, I used to go for the higher class type, but these days it's more difficult. Wealthy people are cautious about who gets close to them, and many have a large circle of people watching out for them and their money, even if they're relatively reclusive. Not to mention how publicized the deaths of people of that caliber are nowadays. Even if I went with someone and didn't decide I wanted to dine on them, but instead the people around them, eventually any human with extended contact goes insane. I can't help it. 

It would make it entirely too hard to slip out of their lives unnoticed, and then I'd have to entirely scrap my body, and I do enjoy running through a cycle of specific appearances. I suppose I could create a sort of "throwaway" body, but I enjoy being young and desirable. Then I have to consider the amount of time it would take to gain trust enough to enjoy the lavish life. I'd starve before I got close enough, and too many meals while working on that trust would make me even more suspect. 

From a human perspective, think of doing a dine and dash. It's a lot easier to get out of a low end establishment than it is from a 5-star. No security, less witnesses, and less people eyeing you down and sizing up your appearance. 
 
Similar is the bodyguard option, my client would die if I stayed too long, a sad fate I've once dealt with. 

I want for naught though, my mother is actually in an arrangement that will keep us quite well off for the entirety of our existence. But that's a story for another time. :)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to Drive a Boy Crazy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-19 07:37:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just found this typed up document in my boyfriends cell phone. It's kind of like a journal, but I found some parts a little bothersome. Alex has been sleeping for a while, which is the only reason I even have time to look through his phone. I wasn't trying to be nosy or anything, I just wanted to see the book he had been typing up for the last few months. Instead, I found this document titled Tell nosleep. I figured it was just some wild story, but he actually used my name, my likeness, and some pretty true information. 


Some of the ways he described me made me smile, my mother would be proud of the woman I have become. I'm off track though, so here is the account which Alex wrote up about me, which apparently is meant to convince you all of.. I'm not sure what exactly. That I drove him crazy? I'm not some psychopath. Regardless, here is what he wrote for you. 


---


Sorry if this all feels rushed, lately I've been feeling like something awful is about to happen, and I just wanted to tell people before it does. I'm really sick and just desperately need help understanding if my mind is lying to me. Maybe the people who were my friends will see this and realize that they abandoned me when a monster crawled into my bed. 


I'm pretty sure I've figured out where this all started, and unless my mind has entirely left me, then I'm pretty sure Luna has something to do with this. Luna has been my girlfriend for the past few months, she's generally really amazing, but the longer we're together the more I realize that something is *very* wrong here. To keep everything as accurate as possible I'm putting my entire experience with her together from entries I wrote in my journal. 


I'm guessing the real story starts around the time of this entry from the end of July, though I'm still not 100% sure how it all connects, or if it really does at all. 


**July 28th 2016:**


*Meg is going to break up with me. She won't believe anything I tell her. I haven't written about this yet because I thought it'd blow over once she realized that this whole thing was crazy, but now I've got to record it so that I'll never forget the lengths that some random crazy chick (who I don't even know), went to fuck up my two year long relationship.*


*I went to a party last weekend, couple friends were going and invited me to come along, I'm guessing this is where the crazy bitch got both mine and Meg's numbers. Not sure exactly how she did it, but the shit storm started the next morning. Meg woke me up freaking out, waving my phone around. Apparently I had been receiving messages non stop all morning, and she decided to check in case it was some kind of emergency.*


*Some random girl was sending me half naked photos, and messages about how she couldn't stop thinking about me. Suffice to say Meg was pissed, and she didn't believe that I had no idea who this girl was. She didn't say her name or show any identifiable part of her, so I didn't even have a clue as to who could be fucking with me.That's been my whole week, everyday there are messages from this girl. I tried blocking the number but then she started using a different one, she went as far to text Meg's phone to try and talk to me. Regardless of the blocking, messages asking to stop, and Meg actually calling and freaking out, this girl keeps insisting that her and I had some sort of intense connection that she can't ignore.*


*Meg already told me that she's ready to walk, she's convinced I cheated on her at this party, but she's the one who drove me home and slept with me afterwards. She won't believe a word I say otherwise. This is insane.*


**August 2nd 2016:**


*Meg's friend was here today to grab the last of the packed up boxes. It's been three days since I've seen her, and she doesn't believe that I stopped receiving the messages the day she left. The last time she spoke to me she told me that my new bitch had sent her a text the night after she moved out, something along the lines of Thanks for making room for me.*


*I don't understand why this is happening to me. I was perfectly happy.*


I'm gonna skip ahead so that you'll just be reading relevant information. Just so you're not confused about the locations, when I went back to school for the fall, around the end of August I moved out of my apartment and into a residence hall on campus. I couldn't really afford to stay through the semester at the old place without Meg helping with rent. 


**September 17th 2016:**


*I keep seeing this girl who's staying in a room down the hall, just barely though. She's always just walking by, or going into her room. I have this intense urge to talk to her, she's gorgeous. I walked by her room the other day and I'm pretty sure I heard her singing, she sounded like an angel. I'm going to try to figure out who she is, maybe she could be the first worthwhile distraction I've had from missing Meg.* 


**September 25th 2016:**


*Party last night was great, especially because I finally got to talk to the girl from down the hall. Her name is Luna and she seems even more beautiful when you speak to her. Fair skin, pale blonde hair, tiny, but with just enough curves to keep you interested. She told me that she's going to major in Psychology, which seems pretty cool. Smart and hot, I would definitely like to see her more.*


*She sent me a text this morning thanking me for keeping her interested enough to not leave the party early, I don't think she's really the type who enjoys big parties. Weird thing is, I don't remember giving her my number. I know I wanted to, but I distinctly recall being annoyed at myself for forgetting to ask for hers last night. She probably just asked someone else if they knew it. Brought back crappy memories of Meg though, but I'm probably just paranoid about getting into someone new.* 


**October 23rd 2016:**


*Luna is just perfect, I swear I've already fallen in love with her. It's like I'm under a spell, and I love it. From that first conversation at the party last month I've felt so much better. She's helping me forget the craziness that ended my last relationship, and also helping me to realize that Meg really took a lot of things I did for granted. I didn't deserve her mistrust. Luna would never do that. I know it's pretty soon after meeting her, but we're already in an official relationship.*


*Her face was so full of joy when I asked her, I think it's part of why that was the best day of my life so far. I know it'll sound crazy, but I could honestly envision myself marrying this girl. I am downright stricken by how wonderful she is. She thinks I'm working on writing a book right now, something I've always wanted to attempt, but I just told her that so I wouldn't have to admit that I'm writing about her in a very 14 year old girl gushing into a diary type of way. I feel ridiculous, but I've just never felt this way about someone.* 


**November 2nd 2016:**


*I swear I fall more in love every time I hear her singing in the shower, I have no idea what she's singing but it's the most beautiful thing I've ever heard. I asked her about the songs once, and she told me that her mother taught her them all. Apparently someone in her family actually created them, which I thought was pretty interesting. She never goes into much detail about her family, except to say that her mother didn't like to stay in one place very long so they always travelled around. I figure this is just something she's not entirely comfortable talking about just yet, it's pretty clear from her avoidance that she didn't quite have the American Dream of childhoods.* 


**November 12th 2016:**


*I swear my memory is going to shit, I'm so forgetful lately, but that's hardly important with what's going on with Luna right now. She seems like she's getting sick, she's had such low energy lately. So far none of the medication she's taken seems to be getting rid of this cold, but she keeps assuring me it'll pass. I've been sad, I miss hearing her sing these last few days. It feels hard to distract myself from the past without her regular bubbly personality filling up the room.* 


**November 18th 2016:**


*Luna is still sick, but she's cheered up a little and has been humming songs again. She told me she'll be better once she eats, but she's been so nauseous that she can hardly keep anything down. We're going to visit her Mother for Thanksgiving though, and she's really excited about it. Her Mom mailed us two plane tickets, and invited us to spend the holiday with her on the coast of Mexico. Luna has been telling me she misses the ocean, lakes just aren't the same. Plus Mexico will be significantly warmer than Michigan at this time of year, so I am especially excited to spend some beach time with my wonderful girl.* 


**November 29th 2016:**


*My memory is being kind of.. Wonky? I just keep forgetting to do little tasks, I'm not sure if I'm forgetting real memories. We had a good time in Mexico, I think. Little fuzzy on all the details, but I attribute that to jet lag. Luna's mom was really nice, she seemed to really like me. Luna looks a lot like her, and Mary looked so young they could practically be sisters. I'm over the moon that her mom approved of me, that means I'm one step closer to having this girl for the rest of my life.* 


*So, about Mexico, had a great time. The coast was beautiful, and after the first night there Luna didn't seem sick at all anymore. She told me her mom has a special recipe that always makes her feel better, I'm a little disappointed I never got to try that miracle meal. Luna spent a lot of time with her mother, they're really close. I think it's sweet, but it makes me even more curious about the secrecy over Luna's past. Other than that it was a pretty basic vacation. Visits to the beach, a couple nights of bar crawling, quality time.* 


*Halfway through the trip Meg texted me saying she missed me. Honestly I had pretty much forgotten that I ever even dated her, so the message threw me off a little. I mentioned it to Luna, and she laughed at the fact that Meg finally realized what she lost. I overheard her talking to her mom in another room afterwards, and for some reason something she said set off the little alarms in my head. Something along the lines of, I can't believe she'd say anything after all this time, it took a lot of effort to get her to make way for me and I'm not having my work ruined now.*


*Her mother's response was even more confusing, Perhaps you should return to the body of Jessica to keep her off. Prove your loyalty, facing the same issue with a better outcome would definitely keep him prepared. The conversation kinda freaked me out and I stopped listening. I can't help but wonder if the body of Jessica is referring to someone dead. Who talks like that if it's not about a dead body?* 


*I guess being there cleared my head because my memory cleared up a little. Realized some weird things though, like where the fuck is my roommate? I haven't seen him since early October, but I can tell I've been forgetting a lot of basic things. Maybe he has a girlfriend he's been staying with, but for the life of me I can't remember him telling me that he was leaving. His stuff is still here, and the policy here has you pay for the entire year in the hall, so he's wasted a lot of money to pay for a room that he's only spent a month in. I forgot all about him for a while, apparently absence does not at all make the heart grow fonder.*


*Besides that, I've been missing a lot of class without realizing, and I've hardly spoken to any of my friends in the last month. It feels like everyone's avoiding me. Ever since that conversation I heard, I keep wondering if Luna killed some girl. I know it's crazy, but just the way they were talking in secrecy has me paranoid for some reason. Luna is too tiny to kill anyone though, how's a tiny little 51 blonde going to get away with killing someone?*


**December 5th 2016:**


*I've been split in two since returning from Mexico. One part of me is sappy and in love, just missing the sound of Luna singing in the shower. She's been so busy and distracted since we came back that she hasn't spent a lot of time here. The other part of me is paranoid and suspicious, and slightly convinced that I'm going crazy. Why exactly has she been gone so much? It's just making me wonder more about the whole Jessica's body conversation.*


**December 9th 2016:**


*I've been having this recurring dream for a while now, and I'm not sure what to think of it. I'm falling, and slowly a voice fades in. It's Luna's singing. I fall until I hit water, but it doesn't hurt. The entire dream is just me falling and then sinking into this water, all to a soundtrack of my girlfriends voice. It ends abruptly with a feeling of panic, and a flash of shark teeth coming straight for me. It makes me more sad than afraid. I'm stuck with this overwhelming feeling of despair, and the only place I've heard her sing lately is in my dreams. I think I'm just missing her too much. I wish she was around more.* 


**December 15th 2016:** 


*Luna has been around a lot more again, and I'm overjoyed! Her singing fills my heart with happiness, and eases my paranoia. While I still have concerns over the conversation I heard last month, I figure I'll just approach her about it later. She's always been so understanding, I'm sure I just missed a key part of their discussion.*


*In other news, her mother has sent us tickets again! She's staying in a different part of Mexico right now, but we'll still be close to the beach. Nothing like a warm vacation to perk up the Christmas season! I can't tell who's more excited, Luna and I are really happy to be spending the holidays together again.*


**January 5th 2017:** 


*Still in Mexico. In the hospital actually. I got bitten by a fucking shark. I suppose my dream was a little prophetic, maybe my mind was telling me that the ocean is dangerous. Just a bite on my shoulder, not super deep, and apparently healing quite fast. More of a shark nip than a bite. I pretty much blacked out during the incident, because the last thing I remember before waking up in the hospital was just swimming at the beach.* 


*It's not really a big deal, some stitches in my shoulder, maybe a scar to tell the tale later. Pain meds have me loopy, but I'll be able to go back to where we're staying with Luna's mom tonight. Maybe it's just because I'm high, but I decided to ask Luna if she knew someone named Jessica. She looked surprised, and then sad. Apparently Jessica was her cousin, who drowned in lake Michigan. She told me she's been visiting the lake a lot lately, unable to keep her cousin entirely off her mind this time of year. The explanation satisfied my curiosity, and I felt bad for listening in before. Obviously eavesdropping is like a game of telephone, you're bound to mishear parts.*


**January 8th 2017:**


*Broken telephone once again, I really need to stop being so paranoid and pessimistic. I'm happy with Luna, happier than I've ever been in my life. It's like just because I think she's too good to be true, my mind is trying to find the flaws that break the illusion of perfection. I don't even know why this conversation bothered me, it was weird more than it was suspicious. Maybe her and her mother are delusional, talking about random nonsensical things.* 


*This time it was just odd. Her mom was complaining to her about deciding to be blonde, yet I was fairly sure they were both natural blondes. I'm not satisfied with this body, I didn't have time to perfect it. Mary had said.*


*Well, that's your own fault. I told you we were coming, and I like mine. It's adorable. Plus, it's not like you're the one who's stuck with it constantly, you'll change as soon as we leave. I mean, it could have just been some regular girls chitchat over looks, but the tone was weird as hell. God I am so paranoid. I need to ask someone for help.* 


This is the day I decided to start compiling my situation for you, after all the weird things that have been happening I thought I should seek out help from a community that knows about all sorts of scary shit. And the sicker I get the more afraid I become. From here on out I'll be writing my journal entries directly into this document. I'll be posting it for you all when I either have answers, or have too much information to fit in a single post. 


**January 23rd 2017:**


*I can tell I'm getting sick, it's been coming on since before we left Mexico. I feel so weak lately, I have no motivation to do anything, or talk to anyone. I haven't been back to classes yet, even though we've been back in Michigan for over a week. Luna has been bright and happy again, she's been singing to try and cheer me up. It hasn't really been working, I'm in pain and nearly out of medication. I've been having that nightmare over and over, waking up so violently that I've torn my stitches open so many times. It seems like my shoulder isn't healing at all, and it's come to the point where the wound doesn't hurt but the rest of my body aches.*


*Maybe I've got some sort of infection, but I'm becoming even more paranoid lately and just really don't want to go to a doctor. What if it was the hospital that did this to me? I know it sounds crazy, but how else can I explain this? Luna has been so worried about me, I'm terrified that I'm going to scare her away. I'm going insane and I don't know why.*


**January 26th 2017:**


*I'm seeing things, I know it's not real, but I'm so afraid. Why am I so sick? Everything hurts.* 


**February 3rd 2017:**


*Luna says I have a fever. I could swear she smiled when she said it, but instead of her dazzling smile I saw a mouth full of jagged shark teeth. I'm going insane. My shoulder hasn't been healing, I'm too afraid to have a doctor look at it. Thank god Luna knows how to do stitches. Why does Luna know how to that? I don't know anything anymore.* 


**February 5th 2017:** 


*My girlfriend is a shark. Did she bite me? Did she bite me with her shark mouth? Why does she know everything? I don't understand.*


**February 9th 2017:**


*My fever is down, I'm feeling a bit better. I realized a big thing I had forgotten, I haven't talked to my mother in forever. She's all I've got family wise, but she wouldn't answer my calls today. I told Luna about it, and she looked at me like I was crazy. Apparently I had a huge fight with my mom back in December, and she's been refusing to talk to me since then. Luna didn't know what it was about, and I can't remember. I feel like she's lying to me.Can't trust sharks. God what is wrong with me?*


**February 15th 2017:**


*Why is my angel a shark? Why am I sick? I think she's keeping me sick. Her teeth terrify me. Am I awake? Why am I here? I keep dreaming of the inky depths of the ocean. Did the ocean make me sick? Is Luna a monster? Is she a shark? Please help me. I need to post this as soon as possible, I can't stand how sick and crazy I've become. I'm so tired, I'll post this in the morning.*

Alex didn't wake up the next morning though, he's been in a coma since that night. The fever took hold of his mind and made him see things, but not what he thought. It's funny how the mind can betray you, how a siren's song can be so hypnotic that your mind becomes compliant to whatever the ancient language requests. 


Normally a mother would tell you not to play with your food, but mine taught me that everything tastes better once it's been stirred around. 


Time to take a dip, fade out of Luna and erase the body that was the girlfriend of Alex. I do miss the ocean, I think it's best to meet my mother on a coast for while, I've fished these lakes too much the last year between Luna and Jessica. By the time I get there I'll be a 56, leggy redhead. I wonder what the boys of California will think. 


I told you I'm not a psychopath, I'd have to be human for that.

	<TEXT> Okay so, I'd start out with "Police officers are a blessing... " right off the bat, that whole section has a different tone than the rest. I'd end the paragraph right before "Now my town..."

I'd start the second paragraph with, "My name is Daniel Merc." Followed by "Now my town.." And everything else. 

Also I didn't read it all. Hard to look at on mobile when it's just one big wall of text, so definitely split up into paragraphs. I read as much as I could though, and your writing seems good, and I'd love to read the rest if you have a copy somewhere that is broken up to make it easier on the eyes. From the part I read, it seems interesting enough so far, but I'd like to be able to get through the entire prologue to give you a full opinion. Good luck c:  </TEXT>

I should eat your brain to gain insight for my "Girl falls in love with the cannibal that ripped out her abusive father's throat" story. 

I like writing from a male perspective, but I am an old man deep in my soul. I find it hard to relate to the majority of girls my age anyways. Disconnect makes it easier to switch sides. Also, girls are hot, so I enjoy being a vulgar young man at times. Or the father that everyone wishes they had (until he kills his children).  </TEXT>

Also, I am only 5"1. Would kill to be average height. *Literally kill.*

	<TEXT> I just find myself really paranoid as new things are trying to get passed. I attended most of high school down here because the schools are free to anyone, but I've been hearing that Trump wants to take that out of play. 

I live here with my family, My step mom and three younger brothers are Canadian, Her husband is American and we just haven't been able to afford citizenship. If the school stops being available to my siblings, then we have to leave the place we ran to for safety. 

I'm constantly worried that something will come into play that will make my eventual citizenship harder, or more expensive, or entirely unattainable. I personally don't have a lot here other than a boyfriend in another state, and the family I live with, but I don't want to leave. I'd rather attend nursing school here once I can afford it. Not to mention the fact that my family can't help me get a Visa for school due to the cost/living requirements. 

This new president just makes living here a constant worry for us, we never know when something might get put in place that'll wreck the lives we've built here. 

Also, thank you about the names c: 

I can see why people might mistake you for a guy based off the user name though, I generally avoid basing genders off of usernames because most are fairly neutral or not made to stand for the user, but instead for their interests.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The article was interesting in itself, but I just found myself slightly annoyed that everything is under the blanket title of "creepypasta". 

I've always found Nosleep has it's own separate kind of tales. It's more realistic and immersive in general. Nosleep is nosleep and creepypastas are creepypastas. Not to say that I haven't read some interesting creepypastas before, but I find that you find a lot more terrible quality creepypasta posts than you would nosleep posts. Just two separate entities IMO. 

Random rant ended. 

It's super cool that you got to be interviewed though! That must have been an interesting experience c:  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I barely even know my issues other than anxiety andbbeing depressed for 5+ years.  I'm not sure if I'm even coping, the only thing that really keeps me from entirely lashing out and going off the wall is the fact that I'm afraid of other people knowing too much. 

I guess my coping method is to generally not trust more than one person at a time, and when I feel the need to express my shitty memories I either talk to that one person, or attempt to incorporate it into a drawing/painting/story/etc. 

Even if I was to share, we're now in the age of mental illness being a joke. The fact that I'm young makes me less believable, makes it more likely that I'm just looking for attention and not actually fucked up by the way I lived for my first 15 years. Everything is just a big joke, and half the people who would consider it a real problem are the type to say, "It's all in your head, get over it." Or "The whole world isn't against you, so just stop thinking like that."

Blah, I feel like I'm ranting and I'm not even sure if I answered what you asked for. I apologize.  </TEXT>
