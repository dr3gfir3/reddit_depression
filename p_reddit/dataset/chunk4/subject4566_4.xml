 Anti-Trump demonstrator shot, say @PortlandPolice. @KelseyWattsKPTV says suspect is angry motorist blocked on bridge who fired 5 shots. 

Also, here's what this sub had to say about motorists killing protesters last night, with 18 upvotes:

[Remember, it's not murder if they started it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/5ccpjb/from_ppbs_twitter_due_to_extensive_criminal_and/d9vi4lo/)

Edit, this person says he was only mocking the person he was responding to, who got 95 upvotes for saying a motorist could kill a protester if their vehicle was damaged. I got downvoted for describing the "It's not murder" comment as a justification for roadside killing, with replies to me saying I was calling for too much restraint. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Putting a flawed, polarizing and weak candidate forward by using a rigged system to destroy the democrat candidate with broad and diverse support

Hillary actually got millions more votes than Sanders, and those votes were much more diverse. She had 60%+ approval until everyone falsely reported she was email-guilty, and never recovered after it was found that they had no case. If security services want to criminalize a candidate without having a case, they can do so with anyone. Sanders? The FBI would just leak that he's under investigation for profiting from embezzlement and fraud at Burlington College. Agents would continually leak to Fox News that he's about to be indicted. Reporters would speculate about indictments against Sanders whenever Trump screwed up, for "balance." Russia would hack his associates' emails, releasing them in a drip drip drip and distorting them on RT, with Assange constantly alleging the *really* big, *really* damaging one was always around the corner. These abuses of US and foreign power can be used to sink literally anyone. Criminalizing opponents is a preferred tool of autocrats because it works. Legitimize it at your peril. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comey's speech was not even remotely resembling the FBI's report, which came quietly on the Friday before a three-day weekend. It determined the use of non-State email to be common throughout State through multiple Secretaries and administrations. Her staff was given immunity in exchange for testifying about Clinton so that the FBI could get dirt on her without the staff needing to worry about incriminating themselves, but they still got nothing. The FBI found that she gave all of her emails to her lawyers who turned over anything with subject lines or search hits indicating they were work related. That resulted in a lot of false positives and negatives but was legal. The server was put into storage at a third-party company, unwiped. Much later, an employee at that company became concerned that the server hadn't been wiped and wiped it. He was given immunity to reveal who told him to wipe it. He said he acted on his own under the belief that it should have been done much earlier to comply with security protocol. The AG is irrelevant to the FBI's finding that there was no case. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because America is the oldest standing modern democracy. You can quibble about partial democratic bodies under monarchies or other older forms, but they've all since modified their systems, and in doing so, studied other democracies, including the world's most prominent one. Other democracies expanded the franchise to women and minorities before we eventually did, but they were nevertheless formed after the US. There's a common fallacy that because America is a republic, it's not also a democracy. It is both. Every democratic country votes for representatives who pass legislation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our current system gives the average white non-hispanic registered voter [81% more of a say](https://www.buzzfeed.com/johntemplon/how-the-electoral-college-screws-hispanic-and-asian-voters) in the outcome of the election than the average Asian American. You say this avoids dictatorships, but it has actually resulted in a man who vowed to jail his political opponent, pledged to sue his critics and change the laws to make it easier for him to prevail, said he alone can protect us, fanned fears of other races and religions, etc., because he was able to become president without needing broad and diverse support, just a narrow minority.

What protects us from tyranny of the majority is ensuring that all people are treated equally under the law. The electoral college prevents any such equal treatment. </TEXT>

Don't be the only killer in the crowd. Unless you or someone else is in *immediate* danger of being seriously injured or killed   a gun or brick being raised in someone's direction, say  don't create a death or serious injury where one would not exist without your presence.

You misspelled "every democracy on earth." Literally every other democracy in the world studied the American system and chose not to use the electoral college. Gerrymandering the presidential election so a minority of white rural state voters can overrule the diverse majority is not protecting minority rights, it's just flat out minority rule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it might trigger a recount by putting the margin within 0.5%, it would have to be a lot closer for a recount to be likely to flip the states. Even then, a blue AZ and WI would result in an electoral college tie, and there are threats of faithless electors.

Still, recounts would be another 2016 curve ball to make this just all so fitting.

Edit: As someone else has pointed out, Michigan is within recount territory, too. Again, it's all unlikely to change the outcome, but recounts are just another unstable factor to make this year evermore ridiculous. </TEXT>

Ominous innuendo for a year and a half that he's being investigated for profiting from embezzlement and fraud at Burlington College, agents "leaking" to Fox News that he could be indicted any minute, the rest of the media feeding the fire any time Trump does something wrong, for "balance." Russia hacking his associates' emails and distorting them on RT in a drip drip drip, Assange constantly warning the big, explosive one is just around the corner.

	<TEXT> You legitimize this at your own risk. Security services working to publicly criminalize a candidate they don't have a case against while staying silent on the other is not acceptable. One-sided kompromat by a foreign power that the other campaign is secretly communicating with is not acceptable. Bernie Sanders and any other candidate is vulnerable to this. The FBI would be perfectly free to leak ominously that Bernie Sanders is under investigation for profiting off of embezzlement at Burlington College for a year and a half. The media would then speculate about Bernie Sanders and an embezzlement indictment every time Trump was in trouble, for "balance," while Russia leaks staffers' emails distortingly presented by RT. Such abuses by US and foreign powers threaten our democracy and cannot be accepted. </TEXT>

Obama announced his net neutrality policy on [November 10, 2014.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=uKcjQPVwfDk) 

On November 12, [Trump said:](https://mobile.twitter.com/realdonaldtrump/status/532608358508167168) "Obamas attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media."

[Gallup said that.](http://content.gallup.com/origin/gallupinc/GallupSpaces/Production/Cms/POLL/tt3qxs_ku0kmbi7lxjc0kq.png)

 Now your saying that this article gave her historic unfavorables, over a year and a half ago?

That is what the numbers show. It is a clear, unambiguous cliff. Then the FBI decided to cry high and low that it was secretly investigating her for a year and a half when any reporter could just review case history and realize [they had no case](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/04/hillary-clinton-prosecution-past-cases-221744). Then Comey tried to justify himself by [abusing his power](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/james-comeys-abuse-of-power/2016/07/06/7799d39e-4392-11e6-8856-f26de2537a9d_story.html) with an unprecedented, sanctimonious attack on a political candidate he had no case against. And, of course, he stuck his ego on the scales one more time 11 days before the election, only correcting himself after 20 million early votes had come in. All along you had one-sided hacking to keep pretending there might be some horrible crime just lurking around the corner, the big scandal that was surely going to drop any minute.

It was garbage from beginning to end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, remember that Democrats just won the most votes for the sixth presidential race out of seven.

Also, just as everyone played the "she's equally bad" game with Hillary, they would have done so with Sanders. "He's a shouty, bad-tempered, dangerous extremist!" the media and the GOP would say. "He wants a new NATO with Russia, they're both Putin's puppet!" And just as they falsely criminalized her, they would have investigated and criminalized Sanders' alleged profiting from embezzlement at Burlington College and scandalized his refusal to release more than a summary of one year of taxes. Republicans only held their fire on Sanders to rough up Clinton.

Remember, Clinton had over 60% approval before email gate. Don't underestimate the ability of criminalization to sink a candidate, especially when assisted  by the nation's security forces and the media's insistence that both sides are the same. Security forces criminalizing opponents is a favored tactic of autocrats for a reason. </TEXT>

He claimed Hillary was at 4.4% in Colorado instead of 44%, while Stein was at 72% instead of 7.2%. The guy also said they weren't tracking North Carolina because they didn't realize it was an important swing state in September when they chose states. Also, they have Stein on the ballot in states where she isn't. </TEXT>
