	<TEXT> Yeah, I keep gauging the difference between an older 997 turbo, a first gen NA 991, or just going all out and murdering my bank account and picking up a 991.2 as soon as they start flooding the CPO market.

In my head it's all "280 horse power at 4500.  I just KNOW I'll feel that" yet I'm pretty sure at no point in time have I ever gotten into a tuned NA engine and felt "not enough torque this thing is slow".  A first gen base 991 still has a quicker 0-60 than my turbo'd C43.  Gotta keep reminding myself that whenever I start looking at sticker price and performance.   </TEXT>

I lucked into it because an SE was out sick and a sales guy needed **someone** to go along with them to talk the tech talk.  We hit it off, nailed the engagement, and when the sales guy went to greener and better paying pastures he called me up and asked if I was interested.   </TEXT>

The only 4C's I've driven (two) did not have the track package and both were a PITA as a commuter.

Not in sales, but from what I've been told by folks who would know, buying family vehicles from Avis/National/Etc is a reasonable idea.  Buying a Mustang or similar from one is not.

	<TEXT> Absolutely gorgeous coworker had an ex dump all of the pics he had of her onto FB.  I saw all of em.  She was mortified.  

I never brought it up, but we were having lunch one day and she mentioned "that drama from two months back" and how long it took for people to stop mentioning it, weirdos messaging her on FB (some of her pictures were pretty... creative.) etc.  I had forgotten and asked what.  "X putting those pictures on FB."

I remembered and said as such.  "Did you know about that?"  Yeah, I knew and got a good eye full but I knew it was an embarrassing situation so I tried as best I could to forget them.

I took the following as a compliment.

"Oh I'm not embarrassed if you yourself saw them, you're cool."

Dunno if it's an F1, just saw it in the office garage once or twice (his daily was a BMW X5 M, which I saw more often.  He also had a 911 Turbo).  But I don't think DeMuro has any McLaren's on his channel yet so maybe he'd be interested in whatever model it is.   </TEXT>

My dad used to do this back when I was a young child.  Just stare at the classifieds, occasionally call someone up with questions, maybe actually go kick some tires, sometimes buy.

I never got it, thought it was a waste of time, but by God here I am doing the same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Out of curiosity I checked out their site. Nothing seems worth the price tag. You can price up an MKZ with a 400hp turbo 3.0l V6 for $50k... with front wheel drive. The only other option is all wheel for another $3g's. They seem nice overall, but geez that seems to be a lot for a front wheel drive sedan.

Pretty sure the 400hp option is AWD only, FWD version of that is limited to 350hp.  </TEXT>
