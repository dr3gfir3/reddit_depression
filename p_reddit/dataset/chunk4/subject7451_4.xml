	<DATE> 2016-09-21 14:51:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the early 70s I read a book on Americana, which consisted of a series of articles, editorial cartoons, and similar material.  It may have been a compilation from Time or Colliers or something like that.

It was hard back and somewhat oversized.  I remember that it had some material about Native Americans.

Also I remember an editorial cartoon in which a child was in a store, reading from a list to a storekeeper behind a counter.  The list was really long and consisted of things his mother wanted him to buy.  At the end of the list, he said, "And my mother says with the change from the dollar I can buy some candy".

I have been looking for this book for 40+ years. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At the beginning of 2016, Easton announced that it wasn't going to recertify quite a few bats--clearly as a cost-saving measure which was unrelated to safety.  ASA rules require companies which decline to recertify bats to offer recalls; today I was told by Easton that it had opened a short window with no announcement whatsoever in which to return bats.  So upon learning last weekend that my bat hadn't been recertified, I immediately contacted Easton--only to be told the time period to exchange the bat had expired.  

Even worse, they took my name/number and said someone would call me back.  No one ever called.
  
My cost-saving measure: I'll never buy Easton again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [help] I can't remove an old theme! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-02 05:01:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm hoping someone can help.  Some years back I installed a theme, and now I can't remove it.  My reset to default theme is grayed out.  (As an FYI I think it actually was called a "background" back then, as it was used for my google.com page only.)

No matter what I try, the remnant of the old theme remains.  This manifests via a really ugly google.com page.

I have tried:  
(1) using the chrome cleanup tool;  
(2) uninstalling chrome, deleting a google key via regedit, and reinstalling chrome;  
(3) creating a new profile;  
(4) installing a new theme and removing it (the reset to default button activated only long enough to allow me to remove the new theme--reverting the google.com page to the ugly old (*not* default) theme);  
and probably some other steps I can't recall.

I would appreciate any/all suggestions about how to fix this problem.  I would think that removing every trace of chrome from my pc and then reinstalling it would fix it--I thought I'd done that in step (2)--but that didn't work.

Help?

[Edit: I found a workaround!  Posted in the comments.  I'm leaving this up in case others encounter this problem.]

	<TEXT> We're delighted to announce the addition of /u/Superkerfuz to our moderation team!  He's a great guy, a long-time Cowboys fan, and a member of our sub since before there even was an internets.  Welcome him and direct all requests for free loot to him.

Also, we are announcing a change in our policy toward memes! We've been discussing this since the end of the season, and the mod team agrees: it's time for memes! But in order to balance the interests of those who like/appreciate memes with those who come here only for news, memes will be restricted to comments only. 

**Any memes posted as top-level posts will be removed.**  
  
Additionally, all such posts will be subject to our other rules, so be sure they're clever, pithy, and on point.

We expect this to be an interim step until/if we implement tags. 

In the meantime, enjoy your newfound memesy-ness! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's been a rough week, and to try to find some peace I've resorted to watching one of the most transformative films I've ever seen--[Koyaanisqatsi](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/koyaanisqatsi-1983) (link is to Ebert's review of the movie (hint: he kind of missed the point)).  I first saw it many years ago now, when I was far younger and simultaneously more fearful and filled with hope than I am now.

I have seen so many ideals fall away as I've grown, as I've seen dreams, prospects, communities damaged by the simple facts of our humanity.  I wonder sometimes about love, why trust is more important, about motives and the senselessness with which we often think that anything we believe matters in the vastness of the universe.  I'm troubled; I admit it.

Sometimes it feels as though I am at the center of a great circle of connectedness and other times I feel utterly alone.

I dream sometimes that after death I'd be able to soar around and see the cosmos. </TEXT>

I'm not particularly concerned about whether she ever learns to switch-hit.  Thank you in advance for your thoughts!

	<TITLE> How important is it to know how to calculate cube/square roots? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-15 14:03:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My son is 9, in 4th grade, and very advanced at math. So advanced, in fact, that he's on the verge of completing an 8th grade course from a gifted   talented middle school.  He'll have done 6th, 7th, and 8th grade from that school during this school year.  He's ready for algebra and I fully anticipate he'll be ready for calculus by 6th grade.  

Mostly I've been teaching him, though to a significant extent he's self-taught.

In any event, he's recently begun studying cube roots, and this raised a question for me: how important is it to learn how to calculate cube roots?  Based on what I've seen online, while it can be done by hand, the method to do so is somewhat complicated, [akin to long division](http://www.wikihow.com/Calculate-Cube-Root-by-Hand).  Which isn't an issue in itself, if that's the way it's done.  This led me to my next question: how important is it to know how to calculate square roots?

He understands the concepts, and I'm wondering the extent to which memorization would help in the process.

Anyhow, I'm hoping a math teacher here could give me some guidance on how this concept is taught.  Thank you! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since XCom2 has come out, I've finally decided to play XCom EU!  I only want to use one mod--commander's choice (which lets me set the soldier class).  But every time I try to apply the mod I get the message "error patching upk".  I would appreciate help!

Game is in games\steam\steamapps\common\xcom-enemy-unknown.  Mod is in games...\xcom-enemy-unknown\patchergui\mods.

I am using patcherGUI v. 7.3 which I got from nexus mods.  I am using the upktools that came with patcherGUI.  I am using the commander's choice file which I also got from nexus mods.

I have indicated the correct directories in patcherGUI.  I disabled hash check.  
The debug log shows an error in the mod (apparently), down near the bottom.  I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to fix this!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This was going to be an /r/tipofmyjoystick kind of post, until by sheer chance I guessed at the name of the game I was going to describe.  As the game itself is 20+ years old, I suppose it would require the patience of a mountain to have waited so long to play this one.

But many years ago there was a CRPG which,  from what I remember, had very basic graphics consisting of a map which uncovered with every step you took.  You had a party, kind of like in Wizardry, and somehow you could outfit them with gear, buy/sell exit the maze (again like Wizardry) and then descend again to explore.  In retrospect, pretty much it was a Wizardry knockoff, only with less graphics and bigger maps.

Despite its name, it had nothing to do with Lord of the Rings.

I remember the game as great fun and hard as heck.

Anyway, as I said, while I was preparing this as a question, I took a wild guess at its name--and I was right!  It was a great/hard game for its time, and (drum-roll please): here's [a site](http://www.decklinsdemise.com/index.htm)  dedicated to it.

And apparently there's a [Grimrock mod based on it](http://www.nexusmods.com/grimrock/mods/44/?)!

So I guess a few people remember it.  Which is kind of cool.  

Edit: as a followup, I ordered a boxed copy of the original (could've sworn I had it around somewhere), and it's taken some configuring to get the demo to run on a Win 7 64-bit system.  Basically required using XP mode and tracking down a few DLLs.  But it works! </TEXT>

I don't think it was Spy Games, but maybe this is an excuse to watch that movie again.  Anyhow I'd appreciate your help if you have any suggestions about which movie this was. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been using a Kindle Fire HDX 8.9 for a long time, but I'd like to be able to add memory that doesn't involve Amazon's cloud.  So I've been looking to switch to a new device.  I could use you guys' advice.  Based on the reviews I've read, the S sounds a little better, due chiefly to battery life, though the S2 is lighter, maybe pixel density, and the aspect ratio.  

So this is pointing me toward the S, but so my question is: which size would you recommend?  10.5 is bigger than the Kindle, and 8.4 is a little smaller.  The difference between those and the 8.9 isn't enormous, but....

Mostly I used my device for reading, browsing, some games (Pixel Dungeon).

	<TITLE> Question about backpack weight (empty) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-11 15:20:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Typically I use my backpack to commute and as a carryon for trips.  For 7 years I've used [the Jansport Equinox](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G1QD4U?psc=1 redirect=true ref_=oh_aui_search_detailpage), which is listed at 1.6 pounds.  But it's starting to wear out so I have to find a new one. 

The [Swissgear 1900](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HFJA12?keywords=swissgear%201900 qid=1449843384 ref_=sr_1_1 sr=8-1) gets rave reviews on Amazon, but it lists at 3.2 pounds.  As that's double the weight of the backpack I've used for years, I'm hesitant to buy it.  So I would appreciate  any observations/opinions about just how noticeable this difference would be.  Also, I don't use a laptop, so the whole laptop aspect of that backpack is irrelevant to me--in effect it just would be wasted space.

I would like a couple more pockets than the Equinox had.  Also, the Equinox is pretty roomy--18 x 14.5 x 6.8--whereas the Swissgear 1900 is listed at 15 x 2 x 11.

Anyhow, thanks for any useful info/opinions youi can provide! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hard drive has disappeared </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-24 19:16:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I use windows 7 64bit with 6 hard drives; 1 of the hard drives is a Samsung solid state 840 evo (I think); the others all are western digital drives, ranging in size from 1 to 4 tb.  I have not changed any hardware or configured the drives on this system in at least a year.  Today, though, when I turned on my machine, a hard drive had disappeared.

When I boot, one of my disk controllers is a Marvell 88SE91xx.  4 of the drives appear in my regular bios screen; I'm not sure but I think the other 2 were controlled by the Marvell controller (the one that disappeared is 3tb I believe).  I am wondering if the Marvell controller may be reflecting the problem, because it seems to take a long time to initialize.  Only one physical drive appears in the Marvell controller bootup screen.

Before I jump to the idea that the drive has failed (would be the first time ever for me in 30+ years, so maybe I'm overdue), I'd like to check other possibilities first.  I don't think this drive is that old--3tb so it can't be SO old.  

But I haven't been able to find a good step-by-step troubleshooting guide anywhere.

I don't overclock or anything and that drive is mostly just kids videos so it hasn't been heavily used at all.  I'm thinking either software setting, cable, drive, controller.  Seems a little premature to swap out a drive and see if the Marvell controller sees it.  Machine hasn't been shaken or anything so I doubt connections would be loose. 

I don't even know where to begin as far as providing info sufficient for me to get help.  So I would appreciate your patience and guidance as to what info I should give.  Thank you.

	<TEXT> My desires are simple: a new Fire HDX 8.9 with a faster processor, more built-in memory, a swappable memory card, and access either to legitimate jailbreaking or more utilities--for instance, that let us change background colors and add our own lock screen images.

It shouldn't be that difficult to provide these things.
