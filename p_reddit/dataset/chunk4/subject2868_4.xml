	<TEXT> Great advice. I'd just add: decide what your primary gameplan is (don't go overboard with contingencies and "what ifs", just a single ideal path to a finish) and drill every component of it separately.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really like this answer. When I up my "intensity," it's definitely more about doing things that lead more directly to a finish rather than just doing things with more speed or strength. 

I.e., I will "insist" more, but will never "force" things more when I up the pace.  </TEXT>

Just because Kit doesn't feel that certain types of drilling are ideal for optimal performance at his level doesn't mean that it isn't right for some people.  </TEXT>

Whatever you do, ease your way into it and pay attention to your breathing, don't hold your breath or try to push out that last rep. Listen to your body - if something hurts your face or you feel pressure, ease off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agree with Kintanon as usual. 

You might also be tempted to lift heavy as well, but remember, heavy lifting requires core stability which requires strong air pressure in your respiratory system. 

But strong air pressure will DEFINITELY exacerbate this type of injury. Trust me, I've had more than one orbital fracture and related injuries. Even a minor fracture of this kind will take way longer to heal. Even things like blowing your nose or sneezing can reinjure you badly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Good training partners will have no problem with this - it all evens out in the end. I gladly will train light with people who are temporarily busted because I know they'll do the same for me. 

If they're that worried about rolling all the time they are doing it wrong - at some point that just becomes stoking their ego by wanting to constantly "test" themselves.  </TEXT>

If you must train, my best advice is to go to open mat and just drill stuff with no resistance, making sure your partner is fully aware that your face is completely busted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is similar to Ryan Hall's favorite back escape. 

Reaching back and controlling the head is what he does when he's stuck on the "bad side" - i.e., his opponent's choking arm is on the bottom. So the typical bridge to the mat and scrape them off won't work. He shows this in one of his Back Attacks DVDs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have to ask, the answer is yes. 

Try to work on controlling them with the sub locked in but without actually trying to finish. See if you can hold them in the sub for 30 seconds before you even try to finish. It will improve your technique. If you can control someone long enough, you WILL finish. So focus on that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Play guard until you are as confident on the bottom as on top. As a big guy with a wrestling background, you'll be miles ahead and it will be tempting to play to your strengths. 

So don't. Master a couple of different guards before you even try to start submitting or pinning people. Get to the point where you can sweep people at will, then learn a new guard. 

When you are on top, focus on breaking grips and moving smoothly instead of pinning and submitting. I promise it will help you in the long run.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mounted: Trap an arm, bridge and roll to that side. You need to do it before the other arm gets sunk in. Try timing it so you bridge and roll as the other arm is coming in. 

From the back: Use the mat to scrape them off of you - bridge and scoot to get your shoulderblades on the mat. Using your body to escape allows you to use both hands to defend the choke. 

The answer to almost every newbie question is "move your hips." Don't try to learn 100 specific escapes. Instead, if things are going badly, do a big bridge, a big shrimp to one side, then to the other side. Keep doing it until you've made space, then re-evaluate. Ideally you've made enough space to reguard. If not, keep shrimpin </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As others have said, the guy is a douche. This stupid shit is how BJJ will become McDojoficated. Aside from ego making for a lame training environment, I wouldn't trust him with my safety based on how you describe him (e.g., not tapping). 

I cringe to think what my professor would do to someone if they acted like this. Let's just say it would not be tolerated at my academy. 

TL;DR Talk to your professor - good coaches work hard to create a positive culture at their gyms, because it's the right thing to do for everyone's training, and because douchenozzles like this cost them students and money.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe it should be legal - you're using your leg to peel the other arm off, not to crush the bicep. The name is possibly misleading. 

The other issue you may run into is the ref mis-interpreting what's going on. This happens more often than you'd think (e.g. DQing people for perfect baratoplatas thinking its a slicer). If your opponent is a douche, he might also claim it was a slicer. My advice is to talk to the ref beforehand so he knows what you're planning to do. A good ref will let you demonstrate it to prove it's not a slicer.  </TEXT>

* Play control feels very "swimmy" like everything is happening underwater. There are weird changes in mouse sensitivity (too high or too low) from one place to another. Is this a mouse acceleration issue? Is it fixable at this point?

P.S. If you're just starting leglocks, I recommend learning all of them for MMA, not just IBJJF legal. I.e. including those that involve "reaping" (stupid rule) - reaps tend to offer much better control. Check out Reilly Bodycomb and combat sambo on youtube.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You made it to blue belt. It means more than you think. It means you are a fighter, in every sense. You dragged your ass to the mat enough times to make that happen. Depending on your country, you can hustle your way to jump through that eligibility hoop. If that fails, try this: http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html

Your responses here are all "I can't." If your definition of success is tapping guys who are younger and in better shape than you, prepare to "lose" - a lot. Time to redefine success to be more relevant to you. Redefine your win. 

* I made it to practice. You win that day. 
* I made it to practice automatically without having to argue with myself about it. You win 200%. 
* I asked a good question in class. You win against 95% of guys. 
* I successfully applied a technique they showed that day in class. You'd win against me with this one the majority of the time. 
* I lasted 15 seconds longer than last week. At that pace, you'll be crushing rounds in no time. 
* I got smashed for 5 minutes but didn't quit. 

Look at Caio Terra - you know how long he got smashed before he took off? You need to reevaluate why you're doing BJJ. If you're doing it to "win" rolls, you better believe you're going to defeat yourself. 

Stop looking for inspiration or divine intervention. Try meditation and inner peace instead. Feeling anxious? Redirect that into concentration. Feeling beat up and frustrated? Learn to love losing - you're miles ahead of the guys who didn't show up. Feeling anxious that you cant stop feeling anxious? Channel that back into concentration. Do it 50, 100 times until it becomes automatic.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You made it to blue belt!!!!! Are you kidding me? You have surpassed like 95% of people who start BJJ. 

No offense intended, but it sounds like your problems go beyond BJJ. Why not start BJJ and therapy at the same time? If you have a good academy environment, BJJ can be a great "real world" way to kind of test and evaluate your personal progress in therapy.

Either way, just start going back to practice. Don't think about it. Don't think about whatever skill level and conditioning you have lost by taking a break - BJJ is a marathon, not a sprint. Just put all of your focus into learning and applying the techniques. If you get frustrated, channel that mental energy into focusing on what you're learning. BJJ has changed many lives and could do the same for you. Look at guys like Terere!

Good luck and keep fighting.   </TEXT>

* You might be an amazing prodigy, in which case I wish you the best
* Your BB instructor might suck (teaching ability is more important than raw performance at this level anyway). Or you are physically superior in some way (age, strength, mass, etc.) Still, kudos to you. 
* "Stalemates" ... you might be stalling, which is not helpful to you and probably annoying to your BB instructor.
* Sandbagging. Happened to me, could be you too. I wouldn't expect people to hang with black belts until the senior purple and brown belt levels. 

I'm not saying you do brag in public. I'm saying you might be better off taking a more realistic view of your abilities. If I'm wrong, props to you. If you're hanging with black belts, even hobbyists, you should really be a purple.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the real world, all that matters is results. People are going to kick your ass with bad technique. Wrestlers are going to submit you from inside your guard. 

Bad technique works! That is liberating to understand. Bad technique actually works some percentage of the time. Your good technique will not always be good enough to match it. And your technique might not be as good as you think. 

Just keep going to class and stop comparing yourself to others. 

EDIT: It depends on how you define better. If you define better as winning a higher % of the time against comparable opponents, hell yeah he might be better than you. If you define better as applying good technique and laying the foundation for faster growth in the future, you might be better than him (or not!) "Better" is an unhelpful concept for you right now. Just try to do your techniques more smoothly and with more control every day. Non-obvious success rates will increase without your understanding for a while until they collectively yield more noticeable successes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally feel my professors sandbagged me a bit at every belt level. No judgement on them, as I'm sure they all had valid reasons. 

However, it made for some awkward situations in the past - not everyone is cool about tapping to a lower belt. 

EDIT: Despite this, I've never "read into" it much when I have caught higher belts. Often higher belts will get caught and tap because they let you get much deeper into advantageous positions than they would have done in real competition. The tap is still "real" but the situation was not, so to speak. If Jacare let me put him in a fully-sunk RNC, you better believe he's going to tap a big % of the time, if not 100%. But I'd never get there in a real situation. There's a lot of weirdness and politics that goes into belt ranks - I find it more fun to fight everyone the same regardless of their skill level, and I usually have trouble even remembering their rank afterwards.    </TEXT>

To avoid this, top guy would need to drop his hip to reverse-kesa style half guard (effectively walling off the path under his hips) and fight to get the underhook back. Even so, he's forced to react instead of being in the driver's seat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His face is being smeared sideways into the mat (twisted spine) and his hips are pinned flat to the mat (since he can't use his feet for base). 
There is no sweep here. 

I've been working the Electric Chair for years - it's a good move, but it's not magic. It has very similar mechanics to deep half - you have to time it properly and you have to maintain frames until the very second when you try to roll under. If you have no frames and just reach for their near leg to yank them over you, it's not going to happen. And anyone worth their salt will crossface you and generally make you wish you were never born. I love when new guys attempt this stuff on me without any fundamentals to back it up. I'm going to put a patch on my shoulder that says "learn how to make a guard before you try the fancy shit" so my crossface will remind them of this important life lesson.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> anytime. as riddic1985 alluded, Rob Kahn is Royce's very first black belt, so this shit is legit (of course the unconscious uke is also a good indication)

this is how I apply my crossface shoulder pressure from every situation now. to me, it highlights the fact that being on the bottom is simply mechanically inferior. people abuse grappling rulesets so that pulling guard seems advantageous, but the reality is that top position is almost always better.

now add to that the fact that this guy has a fundamentally unsound guard at that point - he locked down his own hips with the figure 4 on your leg, and he has no frames to maintain distance (which is why he's knuckling you to get a frame back). 

when my opponent is on bottom with immobile hips and smashed (no frames), that's my trigger to create shoulder pressure like this, which makes passing very easy. 

beginners get away with it a lot because their training partners don't capitalize on it. but really good players will make you pay for letting them into your space like this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely get what you're saying - if I had used better fundamentals (posture and I'd add grip fighting) I wouldn't be in the choke in the first place. In the immortal words of Kurt, I fucked up a long time ago. 

But in this case I'm using the "shit happens" school of thought - against someone with a very sharp cross choke, purple and brown level especially, the fact that you're in it means your posture was already broken and you have to reverse-engineer what they've done.

Looking for advice for when you're deeper into it. E.g. in guard I usually use an "amassa pao"-style frame to maintain posture, but against guys with long arms and good cross chokes it can be tough.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the defenses I have for this choke are pretty old-school and am looking to switch it up a bit. Can you guys share advice or videos? </TEXT>
