	<TEXT> What's your source for this information? Barcelona's tap water is as good as most other tap water in Europe. I know because I've been working with drinking water for several years. The only issue is the taste. The exception is people with very sensitive stomachs but then you're more likely to get sick from food and other bacteria.

	<TEXT> Welcome to Barcelona! 
1. Cool restaurants depends a lot on taste but you definitely need to pick a couple by the beach like Gallito (Spanish), Escriba (great paella for lunch by the beach), CDLC (Asian food primarily), Bestial (mix), vaso de oro (amazing tapas) and a bit more central Ciudad Condal (great allaround tapas for a good price). 
2. For entertainment it's probably a good with place real (Ocaa) and maybe flamenco around there even though it's obviously very touristic. Also look for concerts at musica de Palau.
3. Clubs. You will probably like the beach places like shoko, cdlc or pacha. Cdlc is free to get in before 1am I think. Note that most places don't fill up until 2.30/3am.
4. Water temperature depends on preference. A lot of people swim but it's pretty cold around 17 degrees at the moment I think.

Check out Foursquare which is one of the most reliable apps for tips in barcelona.

And watch you wallets, phones and hand bags. Unfortunately too many people get pick pocketed in barcelona.

Avoid plastic bottled water. It's bad for the environment and the tap water is clean (although it might taste a bit more of chlorine).

Enjoy your holiday! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are both great. Pick the one that has the greatest reach / potential for your target audience to start with. Or if you don't want to limit yourself write a web app instead that works for any platform. </TEXT>
