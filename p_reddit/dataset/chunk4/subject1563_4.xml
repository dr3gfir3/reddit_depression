I gave you the only advice that mattered, you are talking cock about your workjob influencing your writing?

Who the fuck wants to read something influenced by the dull technicalities of oh... scifi?

But seriously, when someone is that stupid as to make a career decision because two of their favourite authors did it for a while you are lucky I gave you any advice at all.

Seriously, it is quite poor, and I am a prose junkie so I get in a lot of arguments re paul auster or zadie smith and a dozen or 5 dozen more who are championed as great writers who can't write well.

Many many many people can communicate an idea, that is not all what truly great writing is about to me, it is the marriage of both.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a pure hivemind bizz about it, like there is about a lot of very average stuff on here. Breaking Bad is one of them. me and the gf had to give it about 4 chances and still we were giving up on some seasons.

There is loads of while not essentially plot holes (with a team of writers and loads of money they should not exist) but very stupid scenes which I thought were lazy. And to be honest most of the show is forgettable.

The characters were really not that great, walter is good sure, yeah, but the rest? Saul bugs me, he seems totally out of place, no wonder his show is going to be a comedy.

The hate to love aspect of skyler that is touted whenever I bring her up does not hide the fact that she is a dismal character, a dumbass and completely immoral. Her arc is baffling.

Jesse, essentially you hit the nail on the head. How he is not already in prison after the parties he used to throw.

Walter defeating cartel people (I know not directly) and local hoods and chicken man etc, there is only so much advantage being a high school teacher can give you.

Can't remember one snappy line of dialogue form the whole thing either. By now, we have forced ourselves through up till an episode or two ago, can't remember, just want to get it over and done with. </TEXT>

Trolls are fine, but a different opinion is totally justified. And what is more there should be no need to demand a reason why they have that opinion.

I like breaking bad as an entertainment, but good writing? No, not really. It's fairly simplistic for the most part. Very little surprised me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Irrelevant. For various reasons. Little Miss Sunshine was as patronisingly obvious a film as I can recall in recent years. Why would you want that? And whatever the studio decides happens will happen. What he writes will be rewritten and pulverised into some unrecognisable thing by the end of it.

This is a possibly a 2 billion dollar movie after games/toys are thrown in. You think it is going to be saved by the power of the writing from the same guy who wrote that irritating indie flick? Not a chance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's reddit. Simple answer. Just because it is called /r/literature means nothing. The same 10 writers are brought up everytime. The mods do an absolutely shit job on here, they are known to be some of the most arrogant on reddit. I don't know how many are actually on. Think it is alt accounts.

 We need a new literature sub. Books is quite general but this one is a joke. You can't have a discussion or a question asked without a fucking designated paragraph. Nothing worse than an arrogant mod system. Nothing. Admins should step in and remove them.

And if they have any balls they will leave this comment stand and not ban me.

	<TEXT> Okay, the term great is overused, but for what it is it is quite exemplary as a film. To accomplish that on the budget and on 16mm is pretty amazing.

As for the arguments about complexity, it is as tricky a film to get on the first go that I know of. So yes it can stand with that for me.

I will add that if I was to be quite serious about the use of the term great I would say it is misplaced about 99% of the time.

Overcompensation? Well you can only review what is in front of you. 

My annoyance is that it has become a standard reference point for anyone who needs to sound smart and recommend a difficult scifi movie to watch.

It has become one of those films that every TDK Nolan sucker throws out when pressured. 

I enjoy the fact it has a place on here, there are not enough interesting movies on this sub -let us all be honest now, the size of it has essentially rendered it a comic book movie site - so films like this should be endorsed, and sometimes, to get a point across to crowds you have to be very loud. </TEXT>
