 When was the last time that the U.S. economy was as healthy as it is today and Washington began to talk about a stimulus cocktail of tax cuts and deregulation and government spending? said Richard Bernstein, founder of an eponymous investment advisory firm in New York with $4-billion (U.S.) under management. The answer to that question is never.  

  

 Mr. Bernstein said that he recently spoke with one of Mr. Trumps advisers about the administrations pro-growth rhetoric. He wanted to know whether the goal was to spur nominal economic growth  which includes inflation  or real growth, which excludes it. He didnt get a response. I think thats the question every investor should be asking, said Mr. Bernstein. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The relevance is it was an answer to your question, "How is it different?".  The motivations to have a President serve your interests have to be much stronger than what a single senator could generate, so the amount of risk and resources another nation-state would be willing to commit would go up proportionately, no?

 Nah, Israel is a client dependent on us for financial, military, and diplomatic support. Their bigoted policies are at odds with our values.

 We share the greatest common interest with Russia: avoiding nuclear war and mutually assured destruction.

You're cherry picking and using it to motivate your reasoning.  I agree with the underlying sentiment about Israel in terms of specific policies and rhetoric from those in power recently and now.  But looking at it holistically and in defensive and existential terms, Israel has a major stake in keeping it's ally NATO formidable and the EU in tact.  Russia has the opposite interests. 

Of course both the U.S. and Russia share an interest in not wiping each other off the map.  So do we and Israel.  That's not a meaningful common interest in the sense I'm talking about.

 Every culture shares our racism, misogyny and xenophobia. They're common human values. It's our ignorance and hubris that invite the most mockery and ridicule.

Again, you're cherry picking and using it to motivate your reasoning.  Of course I agree demonstrations of the U.S.'s hubris and ignorance are not hard to find, but America as an abstract idea, or a meme in the scientific sense if you will, has a set of a values and ideas it is composed of that are incorruptible by those currently in power.  Trump could light this country on fire and people would still be able to remember what America once was or once stood for because it as a self-contained idea has a life of it's own, as do all ideas. In this sense, Trump is deeply at odds with the idea of America, and this is what I was getting at.  

 He's turning up the heat as he should. Everybody lies in the campaign. They're politicians. Insinuating treason and election rigging? That's another level.

He should not turn up the heat actually because it is to the country's detriment, and arguably his.  Trump is not a liar like everybody, he lies at a substantially higher rate than any other previous politician.  Whether or not his lying is pathological, the results are the same.  The consistency of his rate of lying and the sheer absurdity of many of his lies have also not been seen before in a President.  It's plain and demonstrable that this is true and the upshot will be that Trump will not make evidence-based decisions.

 I'm not interested in insinuations and "consensus opinions" of the "intelligence community." That's for chumps like the fools who voted for Trump. Show me evidence. Do you have anything on Trump? I haven't seen shit despite all the hysteria.

I can work up a list of all the coincidences, or circumstantial evidence, that needs to be explained away for this all to be nothing, but I completely forgot that one much more obsessive redditor already has a live document going: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DnQWKe9koRkG31bO3vGJdLjqlI5fPi4I7MRjWFTz3Y0/edit#  It's just an accounting of primary sources reporting on the coincidences, it's not a document purporting a theory.  Read the intro.  Or if you'd rather me come up with the list or if that list isn't what I said it is, let me know.

 Aw shucks, we better get those honest characters on the hill to do more good work! /s
Politics is most certainly a game for those who play. It's got nothing to do with honesty. The ends justify the means. Every fucking time. It's shameful and disgusting business.

I anticipated a reaction to the word honest but I used it anyways.  I don't suspect the media colludes on a local, state, national, and international level to report the same fixed story, narrative, or sets of facts or non-facts.  The logistics of it and the secrecy required for hundreds of thousands of individual humans to willfully mislead the public makes it an untenable irrational conspiracy theory, especially without evidence.

 Politics is most certainly a game for those who play. It's got nothing to do with honesty. The ends justify the means. Every fucking time. It's shameful and disgusting business.

Politics can be considered a game yeah but I was again talking more in existential terms.  I don't think it's disputable that it's a bad thing to collude with a foreign adversary to undermine the election process or advance their interests against one's own country.

 I'm with Jedi Mind Tricks in Trail of Lies about the difference in flavor: "conservatism, liberalism they divide the line." They're almost all lying SOBs. They'll do their "duty" to those who have them by the short hairs. The rest of us get nothing and like it. Have you even been paying attention? You get two choices (D) you lose or (R) you get fucked. Pick you poison.

You're conflating liberals to the Democratic party and conservatives to the Republican party.  There is a big difference between classical liberalism and traditional conservatism.  And as for the frustration with the binary choice between (D) and (R) and equating the two, I used to think this as well but that's not so obvious anymore because it's fairly clear that the two parties seek very different policies.

 That was fun.

I'm ambivalent about whether or not you're replying entirely in good faith seeking a constructive dialogue, but you've certainly committed a lot of your time and it has been decent fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I shouldn't have to spell out for you how it's different, but it varies wildly in two key areas: 

**The power of a President vs the power of a Senator**

Who has more power, a single senator, or the President?  Who has more influence, a single senator, or the President?  Who has a better chance of influencing foreign policy, a single senator, or the President?  Who does the international community listen to the most, a single senator, or the President?  Who has a better chance of lifting sanctions and warming relations, a single senator, or the President?  Who controls the military, a single senator, or the President?

**The difference between Israel and Russia**  

Israel is a long-time ally who shares the vast majority of our interests.
Russia is a long-time adversary who does not share the vast majority of our interests, and in fact has interests in direct conflict with ours.  Moreover, it is conclusive, according to the IC, that Russia did indeed hack and disseminate documents from private American citizens and institutions specifically to influence opinion in favor of Trump.  Meanwhile, Trump has not *one single time* criticized Putin or Russia.  Not once.  And the list of contacts between his campaign and Russian officials is not short and includes contacts that were not disclosed and were actually lied about. Do I need to do the work for you to show you the evidence which **suggests** a suspicion of Trump/Russia collusion is reasonable?  Because I gladly will.

Plainly, the benefits of co-opting a President grossly outweigh the benefits of co-opting a Senator, it's self-evident.  For someone so keen on using the term 'rudimentary', I would think this is something you would have determined yourself, as it's rudimentary.

But now I have to address the rest of the things you said.

 The hysterical reporting about Russia and the insinuations of collusion by Trump and his campaign are mendacious if there's not evidence to sustain the charge. **These claims have weakened a sitting President and the nation and made us an international laughingstock.** They should have never been publicly voiced without compelling evidence.

I don't mean to offend but it's clear here you are betraying your lack of awareness of the opinion of the international community.  To cultures that share our values, the US is a laughingstock because we elected Trump, period.  The rest is damage mitigation as a result of that disastrous decision by the populace.

 Since they have it's not surprising that Trump is hitting back at Obama with wiretapping claims. The precedent for fact free insinuation has been set. 

This is a patently false statement.  Trump began his campaign with fact-free claims and insinuations and has continued them to this day.  To suggest Trump is now putting out false statements only because the media is reporting about the Russian investigation is simply absurd.

 What concerns me the most is what these attacks will inspire Trump to do in response. He's nothing if not vindictive and his quip about Merkel demonstrates how much ammo there is to use against the Democrats. Just imagine what top secret information leaks could do to damage their legacy and prospects.

Here I agree with you.  But the investigation and honest reports about it should not be put aside in fear of Trump's reaction.  This isn't a game.  Again, **if** Trump colluded with the Russians, the consequences of ignoring it are FAR greater than the consequences for pursuing it and being proven wrong.  That is also self-evident.

 Politics is dirty pool - shameful and disgusting stuff. Trump's a natural and I expect that will help him to keep winning. Especially against feckless cowards like the Democrats on the Hill.

This is just opinion of which I will grant you is fine but only if you also consider Republicans similarly.  It's clear they are not doing their duty to check Trump.

	<TEXT> The circumstances of any contact between Schumer and Israel are radically different than the circumstances of someone's ascent into the highest position of power in the government while simultaneously receiving support (incidental OR purposeful) from the Russian government.  And is there evidence of Schumer and his aides meeting with Israeli officials and then lying about it both under oath and not?  

Either way, I think we are finally converging because yes I agree absent evidence no one should be branded a traitor.  But it's not a switch that flips.  The evidence has built up and suspicions of him based on what we know publicly so far are *reasonable*, which was essentially my entire original point.  The only nuance you added is that it would be unreasonable to declare him a traitor based on what we know publicly so far, which I was never disputing in the first place.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes we are entitled to a presumption of innocence and yes I believe in it.  But you need to add on top of that all of the evidence of the serial connections between Russia and Trump, where their interests aligned like policies on Ukraine, positions on EU, on Brexit, and the hack of the DNC, as well as the repetitive on-the-record lies from multiple Trump aides about who met who and who didn't.  There's a lot.  Therefore, the presumption gets eroded.  It's really not that hard to understand, and the binary choice you presented is not fair nor fully rational.

Is anyone suggesting he colluded with, I don't know,  Iran?  Hungary?  Turkey?  No... it's just Russia and for multiple compounding and connected reasons which has been developing for several months.

This is what I am not understanding about your complete dismissal of any concern of Trump's ties to Russia.  

You're not trying to get me to grant him the presumption of innocence because he has it, you're trying to persuade me he IS innocent. </TEXT>

Once again, a former acting director of 8 months who does not have access to all of the information cannot declare there is nothing to see here and expect to be believed or be used as some sort of final arbiter on the matter.

And every loose connection you listed does not have the long string of remarkable and suspicious coincidences that the Trump and Russia connection has.  The coincidences that need to be explained away total in the double digits.  If you can't see that, you're plainly not looking.  There's an enormous difference between thinking Ellison is a stooge for Saudi Arabia because he's Muslim when there's zero evidence of that and being suspicious of Trump because he has several aides meeting with Russian officials and not disclosing it, has aides meeting with Assange and apparently the "hacker" Guccifer 2.0, has been 100% consistent in praise for Russia and Putin, had policies on Ukraine changed in the RNC platform that conveniently help Russia, had his communications swept up in surveillance of Russian agents, etc.  

You're either being disingenuous or naive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did I state categorically Trump colluded with the Russians?  And did I do it in the capacity of a former acting CIA director on national TV?

Claiming with certainty that Trump didn't collude with the Russians is frankly just as bad if not worse than claiming with certainty that he did, and the consequences of being wrong are far worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a full list of proposed cuts to environmental programs by department, because he's getting them in everywhere. 

This one is particularly awful:

 Department of Homeland Security  
Proposed budget: $44.1 billion  
Total boosts: $2.8 billion  

 The DHS is one of the few executive offices that Trump thinks deserves a raise. And thats not because it encompasses FEMA, the federal backstop that saves (or at least, tries  sometimes) people from losing everything after natural disasters. No, most of the budget surplus goes to, you guessed it, border security and immigration. Unfortunately for the millions of Americans who live in flood prone regions, Trumps budget calls for cutting $190 million from the National Flood Insurance Program, another program that enjoys fairly broad bipartisan support. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the Washington Post's more [detailed article](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/new-details-released-on-russia-related-payments-to-flynn-before-he-joined-trump-campaign/2017/03/16/52a4205a-0a55-11e7-a15f-a58d4a988474_story.html?utm_term=.f593b573df68):

 The newly released documents show that Flynn was also paid $11,250 that year by the U.S. subsidiary of a Russian cybersecurity firm, Kaspersky Lab, and another $11,250 by the Russian charter cargo airline Volga-Dnepr Airlines. The cyberfirm said the payment came for a speech Flynn delivered in Washington.    
  ...  
 This month, Flynn filed paperwork indicating that he had been a foreign agent during the months when he was a top adviser to Trumps campaign. Flynns company was hired by a Dutch company owned by a Turkish businessman to do work related to Turkish government interests.  
 ...  
 The newly disclosed documents were released by Rep. Elijah E. Cummings (D-Md.), who is the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. He included the additional payments to Flynn in a letter to Trump, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and FBI Director James B. Comey, questioning whether Flynns fees violated prohibitions on retired military officers accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments.    
  ...  
  The emails show that in addition to paying for Flynns speaking fee, RT paid for business class travel and accommodations at the luxury Metropol hotel while covering expenses for Flynns son, Michael G. Flynn, who served as a chief of staff. After the logistics were nailed down, a staffer for Flynns speakers bureau wrote to an RT staffer, Im so happy we were able to work everything out and get you exactly what you wanted!  
 ...  
 In interviews, Flynn has dismissed concerns about the news networks Kremlin ties, comparing the network to independent U.S. outlets. Whats CNN? Whats MSNBC? Come on! said Flynn.  
 ...  
 According to Cummingss letter, the airline, Volga-Dnepr, was removed from a list of approved United Nations vendors in 2007 following corruption allegations against two Russian officials who steered contracts to the firm.

Tillerson: State Department funding 'simply not sustainable'
 Getty
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Thursday defended the President Trump's proposal to cut funding to the State Department.
  
 When speaking in Tokyo, Tillerson said the cuts to the department are important to fix the "historically high" budget, Reuters reported.
  
 "Clearly the level of spending that the State Department has been undertaking, particularly in this past year, is simply not sustainable," he said.

Thanks again Rubio and McCain for voting this rubber stamp through.  Tillerson must have channeled his best Wayne Tracker during the confirmation hearing because he completely duped them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  House Democratic Caucus Chairman Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.) offered the resolution Wednesday that instructs the House to request Trump's tax returns from 2006 to 2015, so the Ways and Means Committee can examine them in a closed session.  
 ...  

 As was the case in past weeks, Crowley tried to offer the resolution as "privileged," meaning the House would have to act on it within two legislative days. But Rep. Mike Simpson (R-Idaho), who was presiding over the House, ruled that the measure was not privileged, and the vast majority of Republicans voted to table Crowley's appeal of that ruling, 223-183.

 Rep. Mark Sanford (R-S.C.) voted "present," and Rep. Walter Jones (R-N.C.) voted with the Democrats, as they did on a similar vote last week. Knight voted with the bulk of the Republicans.

 This is the third week in a row that Democrats have offered a resolution on the House floor pertaining to Trump's tax returns. While none of those measures have passed so far, Democrats want to keep the pressure on Trump. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's not wrong in that Rand Paul did vote in Russia's interest here, whether or not Paul thought there were also other compelling interests.

 Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., on Wednesday accused Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., of working for Vladimir Putin after Paul blocked consideration of a treaty that would allow Montenegro into the United Nations.

 The only conclusion you can draw when he walks away is he has no argument to be made, he said.

 The senator from Kentucky is now working for Vladimir Putin, McCain concluded.

Funny that McCain sees Russia's interests in Rand Paul's vote but can't seem to bring himself to see Russia's interests in Trump's entire presidency.  Or maybe he does, but he's not letting his colleagues know publicly to this same degree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The manner in which the deployments  the first known of conventional forces to Syria  was undertaken marked a stark contrast to the Obama administration. Then, Army Lt. Gen. Stephen Townsend, the commander of the war against ISIS, had to get sign off from the White House about the precise number of troops and weapons he wanted to use. With the current deployment, the Trump administration has just left it to him to determine what he needs in Syria. That is, it appears the administration signed off on the ground combat missions but so far has left the details of how to carry out that mission  including those details the Obama White House demanded  to the commander.  

 The change has yet to be stated officially, and some inside the chain of command are unsure if this reflects a new approach or a new administration that has yet to iron out its process and staffing. President Donald Trump has shown great deference to those in uniform, from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, a retired Marine general, on down.  

 Its unclear where exactly each authority lies at this point in the new administration, one defense official told BuzzFeed News.

 ...

 While some in the Pentagon saw the new deployments as a commander-in-chief trusting his generals, others are quietly uncomfortable with the US military entering another country, uninvited. The administration has not sought a new Authorization for the Use of Military Force, known as an AUMF, in its war against ISIS, and includes nearly all deployments under the AUMF issued in 2001 in the wake of 9/11. Moreover, it is unclear what a defeat of ISIS, both a self-proclaimed state and also an insurgency, would look like.  

 Ill be honest. It makes me nervous, a second defense official said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  [Trump transition official and] House Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) confirmed the request in a statement.
 
 "The Department of Justice has asked for more time to comply with the House Intelligence Committees request for information related to possible surveillance of Donald Trump or his associates during the election campaign.
 
 "We have asked the Department to provide us this information before the Committees open hearing scheduled for March 20. If the committee does not receive a response by then, the Committee will ask for this information during the March 20 hearing and may resort to a compulsory process if our questions continue to go unanswered."

Looks like request granted?  The additional context in brackets is mine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  White House press secretary Sean Spicer last week argued CBO was way off in its ObamaCare projections.
"If you're looking to the CBO for accuracy, you're looking in the wrong place, he said.

 White House budget director Mick Mulvaney, meanwhile, argued Sunday on ABCs This Week that the CBO shouldnt even try to analyze the bill.

 Sometimes we ask them to do stuff theyre not capable of doing, and estimating the impact of a bill of this size probably isnt the best use of their time, he said.

Wow. </TEXT>
