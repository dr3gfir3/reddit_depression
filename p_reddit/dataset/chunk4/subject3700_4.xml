	<TEXT> The 1970's was about manufacturing job loss, which was mitigated by some European countries as well as America with job re-training and extended unemployment for displaced workers.  

The current age of automation is taking out retail, white collar, service, scientific, engineering, etc jobs.  This is a wholly different type of automation.  The only solutions floating around at this point are guaranteed minimum income, Trump's economic nationalism, and whatever the fuck the UK is doing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a wholly different animal.  

Trump can't escape this one, this one has multiple immediate implications.   One, Comey cannot continue as FBI director if what Trump says is true, but if Trump is lying what does that mean?  We haven't had the President question the motives of the FBI since Watergate.  Two, if what Trump says is true, there must be an immediate disclosure of the transcripts of his conversations to the House and Senate Intel committee. 

There are a litany of other implications and the Trump train has derailed.  Will the GOP get off the train and will they try to put this mess of a presidency on track again, or will they give up and execute plan Pence?

	<TEXT> She tried to tear herself away from him. The effort broke against his arms that had not felt it. Her fists beat against his shoulders, against his face. He moved one hand, took her two wrists and pinned them behind her, under his arm, wrenching her shoulder blades.She fell back against the dressing table, she stood crouching, her hands clasping the edge behind her, her eyes wide, colorless, shapeless in terror. He was laughing. There was the movement of laughter on his face, but no sound.Then he approached. He lifted her without effort. She let her teeth sink into his hand and felt blood on the tip of her tongue. He pulled her head back and he forced her mouth open against his.

	<TEXT> Intolerance leads to exclusion of others, tolerance leads to inclusion of others.  

In the most simple form the Paradox of Tolerance is that the intolerant will always exclude more people than tolerant people, even if the tolerant people exclude the intolerant.

Good read.    </TEXT>
