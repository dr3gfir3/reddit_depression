	<TEXT> Would you say it's the same kind of movement as using a BB? Do you use the bottom of the brush or  the side like Wayne Goss does?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you guys put on your loose powder? I kind of lightly brush it on. But I've seen some videos where they almost violently swirl it into their skin. And then Wayne Goss says to use a powder puff and dab it on gently. I tried that, but with a smaller thinner puff like one from a compact, but I felt like it was taking off makeup even though Wayne says it does the opposite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took physics in high school and we had to build a machine that could launch a squash ball a specific distance. It was a 2-day competition and your score would be averaged. You basically had to use your machine to throw the ball across a football field. You'd move the machine to where the ball landed and throw again. And again until your ball finally got to the finish line.

I had already been kicked out of my house and was living on my own with little funds to build anything substantial. Meanwhile, several of my classmates got together with at least one father who was an engineer and built several identical machines for the group.

After the first day of competition (where I did so very poorly), I asked the teacher what grade I would get if I sat out on the second day. He told me I'd get a 51%. I decided to compete on the second day despite being absolutely mortified at how awful it was going (it took me at least 5x as long to complete it). When our grades were posted, I ended up with a 49% ... LOWER than I would have gotten if I just sat out the second day completely!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rarely. The gatherings tend to be at their grandparents/aunts/etc with lots of extended family. I have been invited a couple of times when the gathering was going to be on the smaller side. That was definitely nice and appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know you were going for pretty pastel colours to go with your cake, but I probably would have decorated with unwrapped chocolates like M Ms or even just sprinkles. Seeing all those foil-wrapped eggs sitting on the cake is a little unappetizing.

That said, I love pastel colours and I like the rainbow stripes that you did!  </TEXT>
