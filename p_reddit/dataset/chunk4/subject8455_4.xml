	<TEXT> Talked to a devoted Christian friend, described all the happenings in your previous updates, and he said he was 99% sure it was a demon, since it possesses animal-like features (he said demons can only create a distorted and twisted version of human resemblance using both human and animal features to fill in the gaps). I don't know how much of it is true, but it might not belong to the Christian religion at all. It's way older, I'm afraid, you gotta dig way deeper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OMG dude! I actually spent the whole time reading this update with my mouth wide open, covering it with my hand! This is frigging scary!!! I know it might sound completely inappropriate, but you should consider being a writer!
Now, when you said "straight jacket", I'm thinking a delusional escapee. Do  you know of any mental institutions around? What bothers me though is how easily it got inside, and how it seems to do it around the same hour at night, thus saying "nope" to the human being option... Don't stay there alone, EVER! And do tell your roommate.
I hope all is good for now, take care! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If that story is true, and you're certain there was no one behind you whom you could see with your own two eyes, then it's most definitely some kind if entity. Keep your attention awake. Don't part from the other guys.
