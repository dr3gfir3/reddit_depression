	<TEXT> Historians may find themselves most mystified by the politicians who refused to say anything. Sen.Patrick J. Toomey is running for reelection in Pennsylvania. He is asking voters for their trust. Yet he will not tell them for whom he will vote in the presidential election. Apparently he believes, as Mr. Heck insisted last week, that his vote is a personal decision.

No, it is not a personal decision; it is a test of judgment. The politics may be difficult for down-ballot Republicans, but the choice, on the merits, is not. Mr. Trump is a menace to the nation. Many high-ranking Republican officials understand this. Some chose to act forthrightly in this knowledge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Republican nominee has shown little regard for the safety of journalists while stirring the crowd into an anti-press frenzy.  

His supporters taunts range from chanting CNN sucks to using anti-Semitic language and imagery (which have also been used to target journalists on social media).  

Reporters found a swastika waiting for them at the press table at a Florida rally, while a Trump supporter in Ohio called out the Lgenpresse, a Nazi term used to discredit the lying press.

Days later, in Phoenix, a Trump supporter chanted Jew S.A. at reporters. And on Wednesday in Miami, a Trump supporter accused reporters of selling out for a few shekels.

	<TEXT> Trump has vowed to run the country the way he runs his businesses, and Trump Toronto is yet another reminder that his businesses do not always run smoothly. Even before the bankruptcy, the Trump Organization was already mired in litigation over management issues with the projects owner, Talon Internationalled by Alex Shnaider, the steel magnate who is perhaps better known for buying a Formula One racing team and hiring Justin Bieber to sing at his daughters Sweet Sixteen. The project also faced lawsuits filed by middle-class investors who claim they were suckered into buying time-share-style units in the hotel with wildly overstated projections of Trump Torontos performance. Now its in receivership, which will produce new ownership and, quite possibly, a new brand.

Any chance Trump has "wildly overstated" his own projections of his ability to be an effective president?  God help us all if this shitbird pulls off the upset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> College publishers figured out that, to improve their margins, all they had to do were two things: raise prices and release new editions of the same text, forcing students to buy new textbooks even if, in many cases, they didn't need them.

Another factor? Improved printing technology, which led to more visuals.

In the 1960s, for example, it was somewhat uncommon for a textbook to have much in the way of pictures. Some books, like Knopf's History of the Modern World, had just a handful of pictures in their nearly 1,000 pages.

But by the 1980s, this changed, a change that at first was seen as generally positive for students, according to a 1986 study done by Georgia State University researchers Brenda D. Smith and Joan M. Elifson. The duo noted the picture-free material tended to be comprehended just as well as material with pictures, but students preferred the more vibrant option.

"Student preference proved to be overwhelmingly in favor of pictures," the researchers wrote. "Of the 145 students, 119 chose the passage with pictures, while only 26 chose the passage without pictures."

Soon enough, if you were a textbook publisher, you couldn't get away with just two colors anymore, and the number of pictures in textbooks increased dramatically between the 1960s and 1980s, and, with that, of course, also costs.

	<TEXT> The potential impact of these "small barriers" is exactly why there's so much controversy over the new wave of voter ID laws that has swept the country in recent years. Voting rights advocates say they can make participation harder, especially for the low-income Americans and members of racial minority groups who are less likely to have the identification required. Exacerbating the issue, confused or poorly trained poll workers have been known to demand even more identification than the laws in their states require. </TEXT>
