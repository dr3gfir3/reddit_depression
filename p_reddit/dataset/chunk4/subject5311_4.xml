	<TEXT> I really don't think so, especially since him refusing to pay for the unlock is technically theft of services. Me putting the keys in the car didn't do any damage, it would've been him doing any damages. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm honestly surprised how easy they are to open. Pretty much any Ford is easy and the same, new and old. Newer cameros are harder, you need a special tool for those. 
Toyotas starting in the late 80s lock themselves back and set off the alarm as soon you unlock them, so you have to time pulling the door handle just right. The rest are pretty quick and easy though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on the car. Cheapest is Chevy/gm keys which don't need a machine to program, those are 20. Next up is almost everything else, with a few exceptions, at 60. There are some that are more but it depends on the car really </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The key we include is just a plain metal one. For older cars that'll start it too, but if it needs a transponder then it'll only unlock the doors. If they want a spare that starts it, we can make one, but not for free </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rude guy, 10 minutes away, refused to pay normal price while I was there, probably broke his lock while I was gone, I wasn't going out there again.

On the flipside, calm woman with 3 kids, she was about a 30 minute drive away BEFORE the going in circles, she was nice about me getting lost when I called her and when I found her, she was happy to pay the full price even when i said she didn't owe me. 

Quite a difference

	<TEXT> That happened to me once, but it was because no GPS systems showed it in the wrong place, and she had a thick accent and wasn't great at giving directions. I finally found her after over an hour of driving in circles looking for where she's saying to turn. 
When something like that happens I just wouldn't charge them since it was on me, charging double is just scummy. </TEXT>
