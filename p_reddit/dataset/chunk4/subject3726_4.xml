	<TEXT> Thanks for your reply (obviously not a popular topic!). Yes the recipe I have suggests drying them in the oven, then preserving them in oil with a little vinegar. It still recommends keeping the jars in the fridge after that. I will try it - the toms are in the oven as I type! :-) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Bottled cherry tomato confit - storage shelf life? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-15 16:53:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here in the UK we're coming to the end of tomato season, so today at the market I bought a huge bag of beautiful cherry tomatoes - yellow, orange, red, black - they are so pretty! My plan was to confit them in oil and then store in jars to enjoy over the winter. I've made confit toms before, but I've always eaten them within two weeks, and I have just realised my recipe (and any others I can find online) doesn't recommend this method for longer term storage. One recipe does suggest drying the toms first, which will make them last longer in oil in storage jars - but it's unclear *how* long the shelf life would be. I don't want to be eating the toms at christmas - but a month would be a good time to keep them for me. Any experience of this/ thoughts to share? THanks in advance!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously the 'top ten of the 21stC' thing is going to provoke a lot of discussion - but I was really surprised that one of my suggestions - *Matha Marcy May Marlene* (Durkin 2011) - did not, as far as I can see, feature on anybody's list but mine. I only saw the film once. Am I over-estimating this movie? Has it become better in my memory than it really is? At the time I considered it an important American film with something vital to say about contemporary life. I also thought it's execution was superb. Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks so much for your helpful reply. I should have made clearer in my question - my daily fasting routine is purely for the all round health benefits research into fasting suggests can be gained - longevity - a strategy to discourage various diseases - well being etc. Even if I did not work out and exercise I would fast. My exercise routine and gym work out is very light and purely for general fitness. Sorry for not making this clearer - I have amended my post.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Daily fasting and working out in the gym question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-11 16:57:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello - can anyone help me with my question?

Background: For about two years I've been daily fasting, eating only between 3pm and 9pm every day. On my work out days I've been going to the gym around 2pm, working out on an empty stomach and eating afterwards. I'm going with the research that suggests working out on an empty stomach works well for men and increases testosterone.

Question: Because of my work schedule I'd like to change my workout time to the morning, probably around 10am. I'm worried about working out at this time on an empty stomach and then not eating till 3pm. I don't think I could handle that. Will my body adjust, and even if it does, is this a good idea anyway?

Thanks in advance for any replies.

Edit: My fasting routine is purely for general health benefits - I'm a 45 yr old man and am not fasting to improve results from the gym. This is a very general fitness question.

	<TEXT> Ha! This is very interesting. I took a long time to complete my best-of-21stC list, and honestly the first draft included both *Bridesmaids* and *The 40 Year Old Virgin*. Why did I discard these films in later drafts? I'm not sure why myself. Although I believe them to be stand out films (comedies or otherwise) of the 21stC, I could not class them as 'great' films along with *Amour* and *The Act Of Killing*. But even as I type that it doesn't sound very convincing. I'm stumped.  </TEXT>

My (fairly limited) experience of beef stock is hit and miss, but the best results I've had have been by roasting the bones first and then simmering very gently and uncovered for 2 to 3 hours. Just IMO, the inclusion of tomatoes has a transformative effect on beef stock.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK I'll make this short as possible. Second attempt at D Lebovitz's Chocolate Dulce de Leche tart (Recipe halfway down [this](http://blog.williams-sonoma.com/what-were-reading-my-paris-kitchen/) page). Making my own Dulce de Leche from goats milk. First attempt at tart OK but overbaked - too solid and cracked and dull on top. Second attempt - looks awesome, shiny and just set out of oven, so very excited - let it cool for about one hour - cut into it and the Dulce de leche starts to trickle out onto the table! Ten minutes later the Dulce de leche has vacated the tart completely. The chocolate part of the tart and the pastry are awesome and delicious. Now here'e the part that confuses me - when I made the dulce de leche and allowed it to cool it was *very* firm, and after a night in the fridge it was a struggle to get it out the bowl. At no point since it was made - warm, cool, or chilled, has it been runny enough to run and pool over a table top. So how on earth did this happen to my tart? I need this tart to work for me because it is **off the scale** delicious. Any ideas? Was it something to do with the goats milk (first time round I used cows). The recipe is for shop bought dulce de leche but I have never seen it in a shop and I doubt the ready made kind could compete with the home-made goats milk variety - it's just lovely!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I know you expect perfection, but these are written by humans and edited by more humans.

Yes I do expect perfection in a book. I expect every word to be absolutely perfectly correct. Cookbooks don't have that many words in them. You would think they could get the words they do have right. Novels - which generally contain many more words than cookbooks - don't seem to have a problem with this.

	<TEXT> How about one of my favourite cookery writers, David Lebovitz? His entire persona is a kind of 'I make this in my own kitchen' vibe. I'd be very disappointed if he wasn't as hands-on as he seems. When one of his recipes continues to fail after repeated attempts (has only happened once or twice) I get really stressed out! I love the recipes of Michel Roux Snr, and especially his little books 'Pastry' and 'Sauces' etc - but it's taken me years to admit these books contain several mistakes in the quantities, eg giving you double quantities for a pie filling. The British chef Mark Hix is another favourite of mine, but just this evening I followed a recipe of his that began 'melt half the butter in a pan...', and then failed to mention what you do with the other half of the butter!! People are saying 'it's not as easy as you think' but come on, that stuff is basic surely! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry if this is not an appropriate topic - mods please tell me I'll delete. I tend to find cookery writers that I really love and stick with them - but I get so terribly disappointed when one of their recipes just doesn't work, I have a hard time accepting the recipe is a dud. I usually assume it's down to my lack of skill, so I'll try the recipe multiple times, usually researching the dish to see if there's anything I'm doing wrong. Sometimes I end up getting it right, but sometimes I have to abandon the recipe because it obviously just doesn't work. This tends to put me off the writer in question and I end up 'divorcing' them and moving on to someone else! All over one single dud recipe! Anyone else ever feel 'betrayed' by a favourite writer? It upsets me when a recipe obviously hasn't been tested all that vigorously, or just written badly with vital information left out (this happens quite often I find!). Not to mention recipes that contain obvious mistakes. I mean, how hard can writing a recipe *be*?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes OK I'm being harsh. I guess I'm especially critical of those movies in the context of Scorsese's previous work. It depresses me that he has become such a technical director, making these highly polished, technically superb, but utterly soulless films. They're both boring and overblown, and he can only get away with it because of his celebrity. I feel the same about Spielberg. These directors have chosen such a lazy, self indulgent direction to take their 'late' work. But hey - he's Martin Scorsese and he has made some of the most staggeringly brilliant movies of the last 50 years, so I guess he can do what ever he wants! He could make another 20 dismal movies and he would still be awesome.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So does a director's public persona (or lack of one) influence how you think of their films (if at all)? 

Yes I think it definitely does. With a big celebrity like Tarantino an audience is going to have specific expectations before they go and see the movie. They're adding to information they already have from previous films and from the director's media celebrity; continuing a conversation. You can't un-experience this conversation, so you have a context already in place which makes it impossible to see the movie as if the converstaion had never happened. But this is especially true with Tarantino as his movies are really just self-promotion for his brand. Hitchcock is another example of a director who used his celebrity persona to promote his films. 

The downside of this is that celebrity directors can continue to attract audiences to substandard work just because of their celebrity. IMO Scorsese is an example of this. *Shutter Island* was a **Scorsese movie** and I think it's becomes difficult for an audience to see how bad a movie is when a big part of their minds are assuming it's great just because it's Scorsese.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes - it's such a subjective thing isn't it! For me, I don't really know what moral questions is raises. I read the film as a satire on the hypocrisy of ruling elites. It pokes a lot of fun at human beings and human society, but I can't see a moral question there. I think Malcom McDowel does indeed give a highly charismatic performance in the lead role - but ultimately his character is merely a cypher. The film makes no comment or judgement on him - all commentary is made on the characters that surround Alex and react to his behaviour. Some of the humour reminds me of *Carry On* films, which I personally detest! I find the initial violence in the film (especially the attack on the Alexanders) and Alex's character disturbing - nothing wrong with this of course but I can not bring myself to find the film funny after this initial violent sequence. Much is made of the 'artificiality' of the violence in *Clockwork Orange*, and for the most part this is true. The murder of the 'cat lady' for example is unrealistic and pretty funny in a way. The same is not true of the rape of Mrs. Alexander. This attack is too realistic for me to laugh at anything in the rest of the film, and in fact I find the jokes immature and in bad taste. But as I said - it's all very subjective! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking as a huge admirer of Kubrick, *Lolita* is one that left me completely cold. I put it in a catagory along with *Barry Lyndon* and *Clockwork Orange* of Kubrick films that just don't work. Something very basic these films have in common is they are all far too long. *Lolita* is rambling in structure and uneven in tone - by the end of it you feel like you've seen at least three movies. Kubrick was a master of what I call the 'environmental protagonist' - that is, a place (a building or location) that carries enormous charisma and becomes a dominant player in the drama. There are a few good examples, but the most obvious is the hotel in *The Shining*. His work excels when one or more strong environmental protagonists are present. *Lolita* doesn't have one, and in my opinion the absence of an environmental protagonist always causes Kubrick to lose focus.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's so subjective I don't think it's possible to answer such a question. But generally I find critic-led 'top lists' of movies very pretentious. There are certain films that hold an untouchable reputation, regardless of how well they have aged or how relevant they might be to today's audience. Collective critical opinion on cinema is terribly slow minded and conservative. Ignore it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Match Point is a better film than Crimes and Misdemeanors.

You crazy renegade you. Anyway, I have slept on it and this morning I thought of the best example I can give of a film that genuinely challenged me on an intellectual level and caused me to allow a point of view I would usually find obnoxious. It's *Viridiana*, the 1961 film by Luis Bunuel. If you haven't seen it, take a look. It totally pulls the rug from under an audience's feet on the intellectual level, taking an almost Randian turn towards the end that sends shivers down the spine. Bunuel expounds upon the hypocrisy of charity - empathy is a charade! I have volunteered for various charities over the years and this is a tricky POV to present to me in a favourable light, but Bunuel pulls it off. But then he was a genius. 

Edit: thought of a second example: *The Decline Of The American Empire*, Denys Arcand 1986. This film leads its audience to question the concept of knowledge itself.  </TEXT>
