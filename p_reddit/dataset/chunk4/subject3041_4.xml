	<TEXT> Very likely. He was just a normal looking guy sitting with a group of guys, so I didn't think he would have had anxiety or depression issues. Then I remembered that I'm a normal person too, so really you can't tell who does or doesn't have emotional issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole time he was talking to me I kept trying to figure out why he was doing this. I kept thinking he was trying to get me to invest in his business or talk about his role in student government or something. I couldn't be that exciting for him to talk to, why was he doing this? No one just goes up and talks to someone. I finally realized that he was just a nice person. I've been so blinded by depression and anxiety that i didn't think I was interesting enough for anyone to talk to me. </TEXT>
