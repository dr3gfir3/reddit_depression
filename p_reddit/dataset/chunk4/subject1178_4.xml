	<TEXT> Do bars count? If so The Devils Advocate on Advocates Close is excellent - a fat washed old fashioned was an unexpected delight. Worst? Probably the grapes, I though I'd try it to see if it was really as bad as it looked. Apart from the cheap pints it was entirely. Never again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few years ago as I was walking home from a night out I heard a lady yelling so, naturally, I went to investigate. A dude was wrestling with this blonde lady - a little way up the hill from where I was - trying to rip her dress off. "shit shit shit" goes my brain and split second decision of running up behind the guy yelling "OI!!" and as he turns flicking my lit cigarette in his eyes then slamming my elbow into his face. The guy falls over and smacks his head on the ground and is knocked out. I turn to the lady and ask if she's ok and then call the police. The police arrived rapidly to find me sitting on the dude, nattering away to the lass and then commend by stupidity/courage. Never felt quite so manly again.

Edit:punctuation 
Edit2: Gold! Thanks stranger, now I must find out what all the fuss is about! </TEXT>

Basically still struggling with the fact I'm not single anymore. Problem is (as a few of my female friends have said) I am VERY good at being a boyfriend and I sort of dive into that role really head on and now the Spanish lass is, as far as I can tell, falling in a big way for me. Which I don't think I want... What do? </TEXT>
