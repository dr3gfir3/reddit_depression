	<TEXT> Where are you from?

I am a Texan, and part of why I absolutely loved Hell or High Water was because it captured the character of Texas and Texans so well, and it did so without passing judgement on any of them. As a Texan, I can honestly say I didn't feel any of the characters felt like caricatures to me. From a writing perspective, all of the characters had believable and powerful motivations. No character was free of flaws or free of redemptive, honorable qualities. The plot dropped you right into the action without dwelling on exposition as many movies do. And the resolution was not a trite, happy ending. 

I also felt it was a wonderful second chapter in Taylor Sheridan's thematic "new frontier" trilogy. The first captures the current spirit of the border wars, and Hell or High Water captures the lingering cowboy idealism that still very much exists in Texas. </TEXT>
