	<TEXT> I must just be an idiot with no sense of impending danger

If you think that's possible, try reading the book the Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker. It's about situational awareness, trusting your gut, and having the confidence to put yourself first and not worrying that you might offend someone.

For example, if a man comes up to you in a dark parking lot and offers to help you with your groceries, if you don't feel comfortable with that, then don't be afraid to say no thank you and tell him to go away. Don't worry that he might be "offended." Your safety comes before his feelings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are definitely similarities. It's that you become so dependent on the other person doing things for you that you lose the ability to do things for yourself. But again, isolation isn't a factor. You can have a full and active social life and still be dependent on someone else to take of your needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is it the case now, that men don't feel equal, or included, or deserving. 

No, it's not the case. The case is that men devalue anything that women are heavily involved with. So once something becomes a pink ghetto, men want nothing to do with it. The solution for this is more feminism, not less, so that men come to see women as true equals to themselves.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One big thing to remember is that children are not miniature adults. They don't know the things adults know, they don't have much life experience and they aren't particularly logical - or the opposite, they are strongly logical, but based on their own bizarre rules. 

This is mostly for very little children, but it's a good example of what I mean by "bizarre rules": two halves of a broken cookie are not good. A cookie must be whole or they won't eat it.

Another thing is that children should be complex like any adult character - they shouldn't be total brats or total angels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When my immediate supervisor retired it seemed obvious that I was going to get his job since I subbed for him when he was out. Instead they gave the job to a man and refused to consider me. 

Sure, I get paid the same amount as a man in the same job as me, but I shouldn't have this job anymore. I should be a supervisor. 

This is one example of why there's a wage gap. 

Oh, and before you say, "Sue for gender discrimination," I'll say, "Great, go ahead and prove that's what it was and I'll do it." Remember, it's not what you know, it's what you can prove. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Institutionalization has nothing to do with being isolated. It's more the opposite. They get so used to being in an environment regulated by others that they forget how to regulate themselves.

In clinical and abnormal psychology, institutionalization or institutional syndrome refers to deficits or disabilities in social and life skills, which develop after a person has spent a long period living in mental hospitals, prisons, or other remote institutions. In other words, individuals in institutions may be deprived (whether unintentionally or not) of independence and of responsibility, to the point that once they return to "outside life" they are often unable to manage many of its demands;

	<TEXT> Don't rewrite anything unless the author asks you to.

Constructive criticism means being able to explain why you didn't like something. But very often criticisms do come down to personal taste. So the question is, is the author writing for you?

For example, my friend (A) and I critiqued our friend B's novel. We both disliked the opening chapters, but for different reasons. It was a genre that I was very familiar with, but A, not so much. We both offered B ideas for what kind of opening we'd prefer, so B had to decide - was she writing for a more general audience, or for an audience familiar with the conventions of the genre? </TEXT>

I don't know what you mean by "knowing better." You and I are are not Rabbi Eliezer, Moshe or Avraham. What they did isn't necessarily something we're supposed to be imitating. And as for Avraham, when Hashem told him to kill his kid, he didn't argue, he said okay and was fully prepared to do it. At Har Sinai we said naaseh v'nishma, not "tell me about it and I'll disagree with the bits that I don't like."

As I said in the other thread, you can certainly question if you want and who's going to stop you, but Judaism does not encourage the kind of questions being implied by the OP of this thread and the other one.  </TEXT>
