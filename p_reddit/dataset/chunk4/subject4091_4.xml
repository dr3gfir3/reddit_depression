	<TEXT> Discussing emotions is really important and I've always envied families that has that kind of bond. I came from a family that rarely discuss emotions. This is instead replaced by competition among other family members who all live on the same compound. This can potentially result to jealousy, insecurity, lack of contempt, and possibly anxiety. I see it in me and sadly I can feel my cousins are struggling from it too. </TEXT>
