	<TEXT> They look like someone literally just made a necklace XD They do feel like real bullets though :) Made of brass, I believe.

I tried to make my own before after buying a fanmade one, I used real bullets and this was the result:

The one on the right is the one I made. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah! I actually bought one from him before and it's great :) The official one is great for collecting... but as for wearing? Well, let's just say you have to be careful, it does get unscrewed very easily and I can imagine the tops getting lost easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's great! However one thing that I prefer with the fanmade ones over this is that the fanmade necklaces seem to be more sturdy? The bullet tips on this official necklace are all unscrewable and removeable for whatever reasons. It looks exactly like the game and it has a good weight to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You definitely should! Perhaps it's also a sign that the choice and the ending you chose was leading back to this song :) I'd love to see it if you ever get either one ^__^
I only added the quote so far around my ankle, but I'll see if I'll add the butterfly in the beginning of the quote like how it is placed in the "This action will have consequences" text ingame :)

Thank you! </TEXT>
