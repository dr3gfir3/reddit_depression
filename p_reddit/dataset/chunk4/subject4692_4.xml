	<TEXT> I don't mean to be rude, but if you can't even finish a well-written thought piece that is discussing the exact thing that you are doing, why are you even posting on here?

It is an article that discusses why the criticism that "XX study just proved the obvious" is problematic. The insufferable "questions" you speak of are examples of unobvious findings that the author is asking you to consider. By your logic, if we all just assumed that the obvious solution was always the truth (and it often is), no one would bother studying anything, and all the counterintuitive findings would never be discovered. It just doesn't make sense, and it isn't how science works. And don't ever forget that hingsight is 20/20 - the author notes: "[In fact, there is good evidence that most of us share a common cognitive bias in the form of the illusion of explanatory depth. This is that we mistake our familiarity with a situation for an understanding of how it works](https://thepsychologist.bps.org.uk/volume-20/edition-2/isnt-it-all-just-obvious)."

The goal is to not to confuse something making intuitive sense to you with actually understanding it. There is a big difference. I really hope you read it. Even the last two sections.

	<TEXT> I still do that as an adult :P

That's making a choice for the present vs. more distant future, though. Eating 2 bags of chips in one sitting likely has more to do with self-regulation rather than episodic foresight. The choice to continue the present bahviour (eating tasty chips) rather than regulate themselves to ensure their future self won't feel ill still suggests a focus on the present.

To link chip eating to this study, it's the same procedure as with the pretzels. You'd have to give the kids those 2 bags of chips to eat until their mouths hurt and they felt ill (not super ethical ;), then ask them if they would like chips (vs. water) tomorrow at the next session. It all has to do with how present states influence decisions about future preferences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. I mean, commenting rule #3 in r/science is: "Comments that only rely on the commenter's non-professional personal anecdotal evidence to confirm or refute a study will be removed. ex. "I do that but that result doesn't happen to me" Comments should be limited in personal details about you and scientific in nature. References to peer-reviewed papers in your comments will always be better received so always try to reference your comments if applicable." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a well-designed and executed study and a rather clever test of the hypothesis. Methodologically sloppy it is not (it simply wouldn't have been published if it were). With your videogame/ savings goals example, that seems to be more in the realm of self-regulation/ delay of gratification, which is a bit different. You are right though, young kids are able to delay gratification, like you did with your savings goal; ["4-year-olds typically choose the larger, delayed reward, exhibiting delay of gratification, whereas 3-year-olds typically choose the small, immediate reward"](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/dev.21249/abstract). Studies on episodic foresight have more to do with current states influencing predictions about the future. I guess my question would then be... what are some alternative explanations for the results (i.e., kids overwhelmingly preferred pretzels to water at baseline, yet when thirsty, anticipated that their future selves would prefer the opposite. Even more, they switched back to thinking their future self would prefer pretzels after having a drink of water in the present, and were not at all aware that their "thirsty" state was what was driving their choices)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is decision making, though, for a kid. The kids overwhelmingly preferred pretzels to water at baseline, yet preferred the opposite when thirsty. Even more, they switched back to preferring pretzels after having a drink of water, and were not at all aware that their "thirsty" state was what was driving their choices. This tells us that they are lacking in episodic foresight... that is, they can't discount their current state when making decisions about the future. They really can't think "hmm, I really enjoyed these pretzels today. Even though I had my fill and am thirsty now, I will surely enjoy them just as much tomorrow". This is actually a really clever design and a good test of the hypothesis. A bunch of [research](http://eden.rutgers.edu/~jprabhak/HudsonMayhewPrabhakar2011.pdf) has been done showing similar results using a variety of methodologies (some better than others). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technically, [caffeine content varies by roast level](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coffee_roasting#cite_note-12). Caffeine diminishes with increased roasting level: Light roast, 1.37%; medium roast, 1.31%; and dark roast, 1.31%. But it also depends on the roasting process, bean density, plant type, and also how it is measured. In the end, though, the differences in levels are likely negligible. Here's a [link](https://www.kickinghorsecoffee.com/en/blog/caffeine-myths-dark-vs-light) that explains it a bit more. And [another](http://redroostercoffeeroaster.com/learn/light-roast-vs-dark-roast/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, the relationship between lateness and general intelligence, and intelligence and depression, are generally strong and well established. More than [30 studies](http://www.medicaldaily.com/why-smarter-people-are-more-likely-be-mentally-ill-270039) have linked higher intelligence to mental health disorders including major depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, and others. 

As for the difference between correlation and causation, some things cannot be tested experimentally to establish causation - we can't really manipulate whether someone is a night owl or a lark, or whether someone is intelligent or not so much. So in these cases, there is nothing wrong with discussing the relationship(s) among these variables.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha - gotta feel bad for teens, though. In addition to the raging hormones, there is evidence that their circadian rhythms shift later as they age, so they are more alert later in the day.

	<TEXT> I really like how you phrased this... it reminds me a bit of Mark Twain's The Mysterious Stranger:

"For as much as a year Satan continued these visits, but at last he came less often, and then for a long time he did not come at all. This always made me lonely and melancholy. I felt that he was losing interest in our tiny world and might at any time abandon his visits entirely. When one day he finally came to me I was overjoyed, but only for a little while. He had come to say good-by, he told me, and for the last time. He had investigations and undertakings in other corners of the universe, he said, that would keep him busy for a longer period than I could wait for his return.

"And you are going away, and will not come back any more?"

"Yes," he said. "We have comraded long together, and it has been pleasant - pleasant for both; but I must go now, and we shall not see each other any more."

"In this life, Satan, but in another? We shall meet in another, surely?"

Then, all tranquilly and soberly, he made the strange answer, "There is no other."

A subtle influence blew upon my spirit from his, bringing with it a vague, dim, but blessed and hopeful feeling that the incredible words might be true - even must be true.

"Have you never suspected this, Theodor?"

"No. How could I? But if it can only be true -"

"It is true."

A gust of thankfulness rose in my breast, but a doubt checked it before it could issue in words, and I said, "But - but - we have seen that future life - seen it in its actuality, and so -"

"It was a vision - it had no existence."

I could hardly breathe for the great hope that was struggling in me. "A vision? - a vi -"

"Life itself is only a vision, a dream."

It was electrical. By God! I had had that very thought a thousand times in my musings!

"Nothing exists; all is a dream. God - man - the world - the sun, the moon, the wilderness of stars - a dream, all a dream; they have no existence. Nothing exists save empty space - and you!"

"I!"

"And you are not you - you have no body, no blood, no bones, you are but a thought. I myself have no existence; I am but a dream - your dream, creature of your imagination. In a moment you will have realized this, then you will banish me from your visions and I shall dissolve into the nothingness out of which you made me . . .

"I am perishing already - I am failing - I am passing away. In a little while you will be alone in shoreless space, to wander its limitless solitudes without friend or comrade forever - for you will remain a thought, the only existent thought, and by your nature inextinguishable, indestructible. But I, your poor servant, have revealed you to yourself and set you free. Dream other dreams, and better!

"Strange! that you should not have suspected years ago - centuries, ages, eons, ago! - for you have existed, companionless, through all the eternities.

Strange, indeed, that you should not have suspected that your universe and its contents were only dreams, visions, fiction! Strange, because they are so frankly and hysterically insane - like all dreams: a God who could make good children as easily as bad, yet preferred to make bad ones; who could have made every one of them happy, yet never made a single happy one; who made them prize their bitter life, yet stingily cut it short; who gave his angels eternal happiness unearned, yet required his other children to earn it; who gave his angels painless lives, yet cursed his other children with biting miseries and maladies of mind and body; who mouths justice and invented hell - mouths mercy and invented hell - mouths Golden Rules, and forgiveness multiplied by seventy times seven, and invented hell; who mouths morals to other people and has none himself; who frowns upon crimes, yet commits them all; who created man without invitation, then tries to shuffle the responsibility for man's acts upon man, instead of honorably placing it where it belongs, upon himself; and finally, with altogether divine obtuseness, invites this poor, abused slave to worship him! . . .

"You perceive, now, that these things are all impossible except in a dream. You perceive that they are pure and puerile insanities, the silly creations of an imagination that is not conscious of its freaks - in a word, that they are a dream, and you the maker of it. The dream-marks are all present; you should have recognized them earlier.

"It is true, that which I have revealed to you; there is no God, no universe, no human race, no earthly life, no heaven, no hell. It is all a dream - a grotesque and foolish dream. Nothing exists but you. And you are but a thought - a vagrant thought, a useless thought, a homeless thought, wandering forlorn among the empty eternities!"

He vanished, and left me appalled; for I knew, and realized, that all he had said was true.

	<TEXT> I did, no one replied to my comment (it likely got buried since I commented several hours after it was posted). I'm not really sure what you're saying, or why you're being so hostile. I just posted a link to different research that discusses some benefits that are correlated with being a night owl. I think it is important to share since many of the comments on the original TIL post were "well, I guess I'm fucked".
