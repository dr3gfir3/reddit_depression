	<TEXT> Hi guys, so I m reading The Stand for the first time.  I have read one fourth of the book, and so far I am taking it as a slick pulpy fiction, almost like sin city comic books in novella format. Do you think I'm reading superficially, and am missing out on things I should be paying attention to ? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, there is this scene between two guys where  a European guy tells an American why they are always unhappy. It is because the idea of American dream weighs too heavy on them. The essence is that it is the capitalism which says that anyone can achieve anything irrespective of luck and this makes Americans unhappy. These are not the exact words, it is what I understood from the scene. In-fact, it may not have been a conversation between two people but discussion between a group of Europeans. I don't remember if the film is Hollywood or not. But I can say with certainty that it is a renown movie. Thank you for trying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys there is an episode where Ross mimics phoebe, he begins with "ooh ooooh" and then some blah blah. Actually, I was thinking that Phoebe kind of bullies (maybe a strong word) him a lot, and this is one of the few times he kinda had her speechless. Help me remember it, have been thinking of it for a week.

Oh I found it on google, its 'the one where underdog gets away', the conversation goes like:


PHOEBE: Ooh, ooh! Why don't we invite her?

ROSS: Ooh, ooh. Because she's my ex-wife, and will probably want 
      to bring her, ooh, ooh, lesbian life partner. </TEXT>
