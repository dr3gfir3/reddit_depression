**Introduction to Alchemical Philosophy**

Penn LGBT Center, 3907 Spruce Street, Philadelphia PA

Alchemy is the quintessential hermetic science. It is a clear embodiment of the well known maxim from the Equinox: The Method of Science, the Aim of Religion. Furthermore it is the foundation for a great deal of the symbolic representation found throughout hermetic writings. A deep understanding of alchemical logic and philosophy is an invaluable tool to any student of the Hermetic Arts. The traditional alchemist is a spiritual scientist, one who investigates the laws of the material world to further understand and develop the soul. Please join Frater Marius for an introduction to alchemical thought, philosophy, and symbolic systems. There is a suggested donation of $5 to cover space rental costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually this motto predates the Wiccan rede, so in fact the Wiccan rede is a modified Thelemic declaration.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a morally abhorrent option that worked for me: call and tell them that you've been diagnosed with a brain tumor, and your doctor suggested that you stop using a mobile.  

Worked like a charm, never had such a nice customer service experience, and they even offered me free voice mail for a year. 

Enjoy, you sick bastard. </TEXT>

He just told us yesterday that he went up to a random girl as school and whispered in her ear "You smell different when you're awake."

	<TEXT> Our son invented the blowjob at about 5 years old: "You know what would be really cool? If a girl put her mouth on your penis".

Funny side note, his sister in reply said "Gross! the only way I'd ever do that is if you **didn't** want me to!" to which he replied "Hey, don't put your mouth on my penis." completely deadpan. </TEXT>
