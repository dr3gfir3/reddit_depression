	<TEXT> Yeah, that's what I thought. But 20% of sprint planning, ticket sizing etc. seems a lot. Imagine 1 day every week going into this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  intern, but I'm being treated like a full time developer

This is a good situation IMO. You could also probably ask your mentor or team lead to shield you from meetings and other fluff. I don't think they'd mind, given you are an intern and they'd want you to have a good experience so that you join the company later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't trust managers with code that much!

Anyway, I had one manager in the past who sometimes used to take up actual features in sprints and give daily scrum updates. Just one though, over last 6+ years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would you rather be *just coder*, who writes what he is asked to, than * jack of all trades*, where you can influence things a bit at a higher level? I agree that the latter can be frustrating at times, but that also gives you skills that will come in handy when you decide to move from coding to management etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was part of a startup couple of years ago and used to write lot of code like you. The problem with my startup though was that it didn't put lot of thought into thinking things through before starting to implement- this brought in lot of churn and probably contributed to the high percentage of coding time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In recent memory, the closest I came to implement an *interview-style* algorithm in my job was, guess what, recursion. I implemented Composite design pattern for an expression evaluator. But unlike an interview, I also spent a lot of time in writing unit tests and testing the code in production. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahah, I am a software developer. 

Last year, there was a period of about 2 months when I wrote *lot* of solid, complicated code. However, these days I am designing a large system, that involves evaluating bunch of technologies, writing a 10-20 pages long design document, getting it reviewed on 2-3 different forums and incorporating feedback. All of this *designing* and stuff easily takes up 3-4 months. Only then will I begin coding it up. </TEXT>
