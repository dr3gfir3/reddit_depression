	<TITLE> [Literary, Short Story Collection] Of Life, Death, Aliens and Zombies - my first book is finally out :') </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-01 04:18:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

my short story collection "Of Life, Death, Aliens and Zombies" is finally available to purchase from all major retailers TODAY, for only 99 cents.
Reddit has been pivotal for my growth as a writer and I hope you'll like my stories. Despite the title, the stories draw heavily from the likes of Bukowski, Fante, and my favorite, Denis Johnson.

The reception from early reviewers has been great - since I'm very bad at self-promoting, I'm calling Reddit to help me, and I have a gift.
From all the people that will buy and leave an honest review for my book, I will draft 10 at random, and give away 1 signed paperback copy to each of them, for FREE, shipping included. Just mark it with the #Reddit hashtag so I'll know where you're coming from.

Click [here](https://dariowrites.com/) to know where to buy my book, and help me spread the word!

Thanks   namaste,

Dario </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the artist (**biroski**, a great street artist/clothes designer that borrowed his talent to me) did a great job here - since the book is a short story collection, he collected different items relevant to the stories to make the central image. I like his style a lot and I love that he used only 3 colors, and kept plenty of space. 

Hope you like it as much as I do!

	<TEXT> I was in the VR premiere of the show in AltSpace. The producers seemed really cool guys and they definitely loved VR before making the show (so it's not a 'jump on the early bandwagon' kinda thing). 

When asked 'Will it be on the Vive?' they chuckled uncomfortably and said that the Vive is their favorite VR platform but then answered with the stock 'we want it on any VR platform, at the moment tho it's not there' which smelled like Oculus sellout. 

Now, mine is a wild guess, but I wouldn't be surprised if Oculus gave them money to keep it exclusive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the sales page (which is gonna be live the 1st of October):

The eight diverse short stories plus one novella that compose this collection are stories that some are afraid to tell - stories with a unique voice, shocking images, and dry prose - stories that might push you out of your comfort zone, spanning from tender and touching to shocking and horrific, without ever playing it safe.

Each one of them leaves a long-lasting impression - and will leave you wanting more.

Three of the stories were previously published in award-winning literary magazines, with five of them published for the first time.

The book also contains the first English translation of the best-selling novelette Impurit, which was Selected Work in February 2012, which was compared to works of authors such as Don DeLillo and Cormac McCarthy.

	<TEXT> How long ago did you buy it? What was your objective when you bought/built your machine? If you spent 1200$ less than 2 years ago and you cannot run VR... well there's something wrong with your build then :)

VR is first-gen (technically, second gen. Let's say, first commercial gen). It's expensive like it was the first iPhone. It will get more affordable with time but no one said "VR is for the masses" yet.

	<TEXT> Thing is, most people that are PC gamers would already have the rig to run VR headsets. 

Plus if you're working, saving up 900 euros isn't *that* hard in a long enough timeframe. Hell, it's the price of an iPhone. 

So PC VR isn't for everyone, but it's mind-blowing, nothing compared to mobile VR (for now). I don't think we'll see a gen2 before end of 2017 but I might be mistaken (and even then, the price will keep high for at least 2 gen more imho).

But, there's PSVR around the corner, so let's see how this plays out!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

first, apologies to the people I was playing with 30 minutes ago. I was DarioKan and I sucked, but in my defense, the game stuttered *badly*.

I don't want to refund as I'm sure this game is gonna keep getting better, and the few moments I could play, it was a blast. 

Yes, every other game plays perfectly. Yes, I tried verifying the game cache and putting an exception in Windows Defender.

I guess it's a CPU-bound thing, but I've never had issues with it. 

My rig:

i5 6400
GTX970 (MSI Twin Frozr)
16GB DDR4 Ram

any clue/help would be appreciated. I'll try to play again tonight! See you there soldiers!

**EDIT: it seems a pretty common problem. Yesterday I tried again with no luck, so apologies again to my teammates. I won't refund it hoping for a fix. Dante, I'm trusting you! :)** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

**EDIT: Solved it. The configuration.yaml was duplicated for whatever reason. Now it works perfectly. Time to connect it to homebridge! Thank you all for the suggestions/ help!**

I'm new to Hass, I wanted to use it with my Orvibo plugs which are apparently supported. Unfortunately, I cannot seem to make it work. Hass doesn't see the plugs at all.

Here's my orvibo part of configuration.yaml:

# Orvibo
switch:
  - platform: orvibo
    discovery: false
    switches:
    - host: 192.168.1.74
      name: Lighthouse1
    - host: 192.168.1.75
      name: Lighthouse2

Here's a log error I receive when launching Homeassistant:

Exception in thread Thread-2:

	<DATE> 2016-09-11 17:50:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys,

back from holidays, I wanted to finally try Onward. First launch, everything goes smoothly, I go through the first setup, then before I join the lobby everything starts to stutter badly, then flashing screens. I quit the game, try to launch it again, but now the 80% of the time it doesn't start, and the other 20% it just stutters or blocks the image, resulting in the game being unplayable.

I reinstalled Onward, reinstalled GPU drivers, did the whole usual shenanigans. All other games run fine, zero issues. It's just Onward.

Anyone that had a similar experience and fixed it? If not, I'll try again tomorrow, but then I'll be forced to refund :(

Thanks for your help

**EDIT** I've verified the game cache and it started. I'll remove it from the antivirus check as well, today I cannot play but tomorrow I'll make sure to try! Thanks to all of you. See you there soldiers! </TEXT>

Love/Hate has some great artists, I personally just tried Paul O'Rourke for a shoulder tattoo (a Mahakala). I brought my own design, Paul modified it and we agreed on it. Thick, old school lines, it looks gorgeous. 
So from my experience, I liked them a lot. 

I have a friend who's done a full sleeve there, plus more tattoos and his only complain is that he never got to convince them to use color :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of very important theories have been created on gut feeling. 
I'm not advocating that, science need to be proven and I agree 100% but I am just saying that our knowledge of physics is restricted to the 4 dimensions as we know them. Operating on a quantum level might open possibilities that were dismissed. 

If I told someone in the Middle Ages that I was writing by touching a piece of glass, and that what I wrote was sent through the air and received by someone else miles and miles away, that would have laughed so hard!

So I guess what I'm saying is that we discovered a real-time event no matter the distance; it's acceptable speculation to say that maybe this is a step towards exploiting that. 

There's a very good book by a Chinese engineer Liu Cixin that advocates for real-time quantum communication - it is called The Three Body Problem. It is SciFi but Cixin has a scientific mind so his speculations are all very plausible. It's a great read! </TEXT>

I do think that for now (gen1), VR is *mostly* for gamers and early adopters (plus Gaming arcades, and Educational experiences). 

But niche was the iPhone, and exactly like the iPhone, when it came out most people scoffed at it. But some saw potential, and with the App store + consumerization of goods (=lower prices) then people started buying it, companies started copying it, and fast forward 10 years, we all have a smartphone.

When I tried a 3D tv, I knew immediately it was a fad. A gimmick.

When I tried the HTC Vive, I couldn't believe my own eyes. That was exactly what was promised years ago (I survived the VR of the 90s).

So they're two totally different pieces of tech. Mark my words: VR and AR will be ubiquitous in 3 years tops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do have one. The HTC Vive. 
Immersion is already incredible. 

There's not a killer app yet for mainstream market, but I see the social aspect of it being a key factor for VR expansion (no wonder Oculus was bought by Facebook). If you try VR, make sure to try things like RecRoom where you interact live with other players and can play paintball etc. 

There's no nausea nor input lag with current tech. The nausea might arise if the locomotion implemented in-game is unnatural, because your brain sees movement but doesn't perceive inertia. Devs are working on different locomotion methods and tbh I've been nauseous only twice in months - and I'm an early adopter that tries every tech demo. 

You need to buy the headset which at the moment is 899USD, and you need a computer capable of running its screen @90 FPS - minimum requirement is a GTX970. People run their headsets with even lower spec cards but I would not recommend it. ATM there's no Mac that can run VR officially. But a custom-made PC to run VR will cost you ~800 bucks, so with 1800 bucks you can already try the future. 

It is more lightweight than you think, and comfortable to use for long sessions (sometimes I use it for 2-3 hours at a time and it's fine). 
Regarding children, there are no studies yet so I don't have an official answer. But I would simply use common sense now, which means, if your perception of reality is not yet formed, very little to no VR for you, and for short period of times. My kid is 13 and I have no issues with him playing longer sessions, but I wouldn't put a toddler in. 

The biggest obstacle right now is the content; since it's all brand new, there's very little available that's polished and more than a tech demo. But that's changing rapidly like the App Store in its infancy, and 2017 is gonna be the year of its boom. 

Regarding my 120 billion claim: http://www.digi-capital.com/news/2016/01/augmentedvirtual-reality-revenue-forecast-revised-to-hit-120-billion-by-2020/#.V76OTc9emaM

Hope that helps! I suggest you try a HTC vive ASAP. you'll be mind blown! :)

as per subject - I'm about to publish my anthology of collected works, titled "Of Life, Death, Aliens, and Zombies". This is the first step before publishing my novel "Dead Men Naked" (nope, not erotica :))

I would love to organise a pre-sales giveaway here on r/writing, as this community helped me a lot when I was finishing my novel one year ago. I was thinking of giving out 50 e-copies of the collection on a first come, first served basis. 

If I'm not breaking any rule, I'd like to do so. Calling the mods to understand if I can organise this, so I'll make a different post with more info, or not.

Thanks! </TEXT>
