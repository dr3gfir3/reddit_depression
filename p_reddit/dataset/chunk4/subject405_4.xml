 Jerry Z. Muller argues that the recent economic malaise, our first epistemologically-driven depression, is due to the unconscious incompetence of those entrusted with the global economy. Recognizing that conceptual errors (viparyasa/viparyaya) prevent clear insight into the working of reality, Buddhist philosophers emphasize the importance of epistemology as a means of transformation by overturning (paravrtti) our cognitive confusion. Accordingly Buddhist philosophy has developed tools to deconstruct our dysfunctional economic delusions and expose the dysfunctional assumptions that have spawned them. This essay examines 1) philosophical flaws in the reigning economic models; 2) the psychology of economics, now penetrating the digital world with its virtual economic reality; and 3) a Buddhist epistemology (anitya, shunyata/pratityasamutpada, an-atman) that resonates with paradigm changes in post-modern science, including functional counter-models from micro-lending to Bhutans GNH (Gross National Happiness) index and the movement of Engaged Buddhism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Summary by the author**

 The cornerstone of Epicurus physics is atomism: Epicurus follows Democritus in maintaining that our world is ultimately composed of atoms and the void. It is, then, somewhat surprising that the demonstration of the atomist thesis is apparently conned to three sentences in the *Letter to Herodotus*, our main source on Epicurus physics. These are the three sentences that I shall focus on in this paper. First, I shall argue that the standard interpretation, which takes the argument to be based on the impossibility of sizeless parts, is not the correct one. Then, I shall examine the alternative reconstruction of the atomist argument that focuses on the body void distinction. Finally, I shall try to show that Epicurus defence of atomism is based on the unalterability of the atoms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Abstract**

 Epicurus (341-270 BC) was, with Plato and Aristotle, one of the three great philosophers of the ancient world. He developed an integrated system of ethics and natural philosophy that, he claimed and many accepted, showed everyone the way to a life of the greatest happiness. The school that he founded remained open for 798 years after his death. While it lost place during the last 200 of these years, his philosophy held until then a wide and often decisive hold on the ancient mind.

 The revival of Epicureanism in the 17^th century coincided with the growth of scientific rationalism and classical liberalism. There can be no doubt these facts are connected. It may, indeed, be argued that the first was a leading cause of the second two, and that we are now living in a world shaped, in every worthwhile sense, by the ideas of Epicurus. </TEXT>

 Hafiz and Horace are both among the greatest poets of the world. Despite the differences and dissimilarities in their motifs, concepts, and notion infrastructures, they are somehow similar in their Epicurean notions. Both agree about notions on carpe diem, death acceptance, greed absence, drinking, and being happy leading the readers to perceptiveness and new horizons. It is attempted here to study the Epicurean notions of Hafiz as the presenter of Iranian thinking, and Horace as a versifier of ancient Rome. The following question will be answered in this study: What are the Epicurean notions? Which basic notions of Hafiz and Horace are common in Epicurean domain? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think the term Meaningful has any meaning at all.

I see what you mean and I mostly agree. But let's look at it in a different way: we cannot control all circumstances, but we can control ourselves to a degree, that is, the way we react to and deal with the circumstances. We are quite a bit into Stoicism here, but even as an Epicurean I think that there are Stoic teachings and techniques which can be quite helpful indeed.

Victor Frankl's book *Man's Search for Meaning* is certainly a book everybody should read at least once, but one certainly should not forget that suffering in a concentration camp was a tremendously extreme situation which different people deal with completely differently. I feel that using the word *meaning* in the context of concentration camps is rather obscene, too. However, in this case it is a survivor using it. Other survivors differ in what they have written about their suffering, many survivors feel ashamed or even guilty. These are personal stories of survivors and we who have never been in extreme situations like that (and hopefully never will) shall take them as such respectfully. [edit: But I think we shouldn't overinterpret them.] </TEXT>

 This essay looks at Nietzsche in relation to the Epicurean tradition. It focuses on his middle period writings of 1878-82  texts such as *Human, all too Human, Dawn*, and *The Gay Science*  and seeks to show that an ethos of Epicurean enlightenment pervades these texts, with Epicurus celebrated for his teaching of modest pleasures and cultivation of philosophical serenity. For Nietzsche, Epicurus is one of the greatest human beings to have ever graced the earth and the inventor of heroic-idyllic philosophizing. At the same time, Nietzsche claims to understand Epicurus differently to everybody else. The essay explores the main figurations of Epicurus we find in his middle period and concludes by taking a critical look at his later and more ambivalent reception of Epicurus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In my humble opinion, Epicurus' [Letter to Menoeceus](http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html) is one of the best summaries of Epicureanism and it isn't very long.

Buddhism teaches that we should learn to have a state of mind in which we are not being driven to and fro by our desires. This state of mind (or at least a similar one) is being aimed at in Epicureanism, too. We call that state of mind *ataraxia* or imperturbability which is the essence of Epicurean happiness. It is the state in which we are free of pain and anxiety and unnecessary desires (Epicurus distinguishes between necessary and unnecessary desires). According to Epicurus, reaching *ataraxia* is the goal of philosophy in the same way as health is the goal of medicine. In order to reach it we need prudence and modesty and resistance to any superstitions like aspirations of immortality.

 Epicurus (341-270 B.C.) is an ancient Greek philosopher, who holds that we should prudently take into account of all the consequences of an action in order to secure the greatest possible amount of pleasure in the whole course of life. Since such an important age-old thought of Epicurus is not visible enough in contemporary discussions of normative ethics, we here like to shed some light on his ethical thought in the hope to rescue him from oblivion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Summary**

The author of this paper describes different kinds of hedonism, Aristippus and Epicurus being the most prominent examples. He further explains Crvka ethics which may be called hedonism in Indian philosophy. Siddhartha Sadhu concludes his paper comparing Crvka ethics with the hedonistic systems of Aristippus and Epicurus.

Interesting: Siddhartha Sadhu calls Vtsyana, the author of the Kma-Sutra, a culture Crvka who, in the second chapter of the Kma-Sutra, is rather close to Epicurus in a way. Both advocate a refined hedonism. According to the author, the traditional Crvka view hardly resembles Epicurus' hedonism though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Epicureans use a very idiosyncratic definition of *hedone* indeed which has lead to major misunderstandings from the beginning of Epicureanism. According to Epicureism *hedone* is the highest good and therefore I completely agree that Epicureanism is hedonism. But I also understand that people who don't know much more about Epicureanism than the mainstream may have completely wrong ideas about Epicureanism, if it is called hedonism, since the absence of pain is certainly not the common definition of hedonism. </TEXT>

People certainly take different approaches to their religion, some prefer a more rational approach and others a more emotional one. If a certain approach helps improving his relationship with his mother and staying true to himself, he may consider choosing it. I think that [your comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueAtheism/comments/3w08kw/my_cousin_13_is_being_discriminated_by_his_own/cxsu573) is helpful and points to the right direction, although I don't fully agree with the part about Buddhism being a philosophy. Concentrating on Buddhist ethics and showing reference for the historical Siddhartha Gautama may help not to be confrontational without being self-denying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](https://www.academia.edu/19310135/Early_Buddhist_Teaching_as_Proto-sunyavada)

 This article argues that the search for a metaphysical foundation to early Buddhist thought is futile. For if the world of experience is a cognitive construction, as implied in a number of early discourses, it follows that thought cannot transcend its limits, and cannot attain an objective picture of reality. Despite this sceptical anti-realism, the Buddhas focus on the causes of suffering also suggests that phenomena  although constructed and ultimately unreal  follow a regular order, and so are in some sense objectively real. Two orientations to the Buddhas Dhamma can thus be identified, anti-realism and constructed realism, which are roughly equivalent to what the canonical teachings term no view and correct view. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The buddha was a mere man who pointed the way, kind of like a really good personal trainer. Worshipping him and treating him as some sort of divine being and praying to him accordingly goes against everything he taught.

One of Buddha's epithets is even *devatideva* which literally means "god above the gods".

 On the other hand, in western countries those who discover Buddhism later in life are much more likely to follow it as it was intended.

Thus all Asian Buddhists have got it wrong for about 2500 years and all scholars of Buddhism have got it wrong, too.

	<TEXT> Epictetus' words about the death of loved ones are extreme indeed, but don't forget that the Enchiridion is just a short compilation of Epictetus' sayings. I prefer the Discourses of Epictetus because there is significantly more context and he sounds much more like a human there. Epictetus says that these strong emotions are part of human nature and thus it is competely normal to experience them. We are no statues after all! However, it is expected from a Stoic to reflect on one's strong emotions at some point and deal with them accordingly. Stoicism is not as much about not experiencing strong emotions as about how to deal with them. </TEXT>

Even if we consider that only a small part of that is actively posting here, it may be rather naive to think that these are mostly trained mathematicians. I think that popular science articles certainly should have some place due to the different levels of our members, but they are often irrelevant to advanced mathematicians and belong to the kind of submissions we usually see many complaints about. Introducing flairs and the possibility of filtering posts certainly is helpful and may make this sub more interesting to a lot of users. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are more suttas containing a parable about crossing a river with a raft. The interpretations are different. You are right about the Asivisa Sutta, but not about other versions of the parable in other suttas. In the [Alagaddupama Sutta](http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.022.than.html) we read:

 "And what should the man do in order to be doing what should be done with the raft? There is the case where the man, having crossed over, would think, 'How useful this raft has been to me! For it was in dependence on this raft that, making an effort with my hands   feet, I have crossed over to safety on the further shore. Why don't I, having dragged it on dry land or sinking it in the water, go wherever I like?' In doing this, he would be doing what should be done with the raft. In the same way, monks, I have taught the Dhamma compared to a raft, for the purpose of crossing over, not for the purpose of holding onto. Understanding the Dhamma as taught compared to a raft, you should let go even of Dhammas, to say nothing of non-Dhammas."

	<TEXT> In the [Vatican Sayings](http://www.epicurus.net/en/vatican.html) there is a passage (#51) about sexual passion which is certainly applicable to drug consumption, too:

 [addressing a young man] I understand from you that your natural disposition is too much inclined toward sexual passion. Follow your inclination as you will, provided only that you neither violate the laws, disturb well-established customs, harm any one of your neighbors, injure your own body, nor waste your possessions. That you be not checked by one or more of these provisos is impossible; for a man never gets any good from sexual passion, and he is fortunate if he does not receive harm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is an interesting citation of Martha Nussbaum at /r/AskPhilosophy:

[Martha Nussbaum describes Nietzsche, the Stoics and Kant as part of an "anti-compassion" tradition. Who would be part of the "pro-compassion" tradition?](https://np.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/3ufmam/martha_nussbaum_describes_nietzsche_the_stoics/)

 Marcus Aurelius says, if someone is upset, and you know they have wrong values, you can treat them the way an adult treats a child  you can console the child, while understanding that the child is upset over nothing. Thats the Stoic view. In other words, you have to be consistent. You cant say Im going to get rid of anger, jealousy, hatred, but Im going to keep compassion, because its so nice. No, what they say is, the best thing to do is get rid of your unwise attachments to externals, so you wont feel compassion, but you also wont want to hurt people, or to retaliate against them. You will be detached. So Seneca writes to the young emperor Nero on mercy, saying you should be gentle and merciful, but in the middle of the letter is an attack on compassion. Compassion is this soft thing where you care too much about whats out there. And they think in that is the seeds of anger, jealously and ultimately cruelty.

I think she has a point (a big one indeed). Stoicism is often compared to Buddhism and Christianity. Compassion is an essential part of both religious traditions which sets them apart from Stoicism. I feel that the Stoic treatment of suffering people who are not capable in dealing with their pain and grief well enough in the eyes of the Stoic as childlike people being upset over nothing as cold and pretentious.

According to Martha Nussbaum, compassion is not only not part of Stoicism, for a Stoic it is even best to get rid of it completely. How do you reconcile the Stoic position on compassion with Christianity? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The debate on free will is an old one and it's better not to be too hasty. The Stoics were compatibilists and therefore believed that free will is compatible with determinism.

The article [Free Will](http://www.iep.utm.edu/freewill/) by Kevin Timpe gives a good summary on free will and the arguments for compatibilism and incompatibilism.

Last year we had a discussion on free will: [Stoicism and Free Will](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/2hp388/stoicism_and_free_will/). Read, for example, the excellent comments by /u/cleomedes.

	<TEXT> Neostoicism is quite interesting indeed. I remember that Michel de Montaigne mentioned Lipsius in his essays in a very positive way. 

 emphasis on mercy and forgiveness

Philanthropy was an essential part of later Stoicism, too, and we shall also not forget that the Stoics thought that people are doing evil things because of ignorance and blindness, which should result in clemency. Thus I think, that mercy and forgiveness are basically compatible with Stoicism. However, there isn't that big emphasis indeed.

Although early Christianity was influenced by Stoicism in some way, the Stoic school was closed by the Emperor Justinian I, because of being at odds with Christianity. The same happened to all other pagan philosophy schools. Which parts of Stoicism, do you think, are particular incompatible with Christianity (regarding moral questions)? </TEXT>

If you visit a book shop in Germany or Austria, you will find Homer most probably in a very old translation by Voss, of which even Goethe said that it is difficult to read (and he lived at the same time as Voss). This is a big hurdle to most people indeed. There are some other translations, but one has to know that and many of them are not being available as new anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't call you pedantic for pointing that out, since this is a major mistake indeed. The Iliad is about the anger of Achilles:

 Sing, O goddess, the anger of Achilles son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans. Many a brave soul did it send hurrying down to Hades, and many a hero did it yield a prey to dogs and vultures, for so were the counsels of Jove fulfilled from the day on which the son of Atreus, king of men, and great Achilles, first fell out with one another.

([translated by Samuel Butler](http://classics.mit.edu/Homer/iliad.1.i.html))

I adore Homer for his characterization of Hector, but he certainly isn't *the* main character of the Iliad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The transition is [intentional](http://tolkien.slimy.com/tlfaq/TolkienME.html#Tone).

The transition certainly is intentional, however I doubt that the linked explanation is complete.

The article describes the creation context of the book as it can be seen in earlier versions of the story contained in HoME. Tolkien reworked that earier parts completely and although the lighthearted atmosphere and language of the beginning is certainly intentional, it isn't due to Tolkien's earlier intent of writing a sequel for children.

The world of the Hobbits, the Shire, is an idyll full of joy and lightheartedness. That's where the story starts. The language reflects that. But finally, darkness creeps in. Frodo and some other Hobbits leave this idyll and slowly enter an archaic world full of myth and artifacts from ancient times. The language changes accordingly and becomes much more archaic and darker during the transition from the lighthearted idyll to the archaic world. </TEXT>

Ramanujan claimed that he had visions of the Goddess of Namagiri revealing equations to him.

	<TEXT>  Frances Collins led the project to map the human genome and also denied evolution

I doubt that. Francis Collins founded [The BioLogos Foundation](https://biologos.org/) which advocates that Christianity can be reconciled [with acceptance of evolution and science](https://biologos.org/about-us/):

 We believe that the diversity and interrelation of all life on earth are best explained by the God-ordained process of evolution with common descent. Thus, evolution is not in opposition to God, but a means by which God providentially achieves his purposes. Therefore, we reject ideologies that claim that evolution is a purposeless process or that evolution replaces God.

As the founder Francis Collins certainly does not deny evolution, unless he changed his opinion since then. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The pyramids contain some narrow corridors and one or more burial chambers, but apart from that they consist of stone. There simply is not enough space for storing much grain. Building the pyramids was so tremendously difficult that building them would be a challenge even today, if we wanted to build pyramids like those in Gizeh. And the form of pyramids is very inefficient for storing grain anyway. The walls of the burial chambers are full of hieroglyphs leaving no room for doubt that pyramids were tombs.

There is a lot of evidence for pyramids being tombs, but none for pyramids being grain stores. The idea that pyramids were built as grain stores is extraordinarily ridiculous. Ben Carson has been one of the best, most respectable and most famous brain surgeons during his active career as physician. As brain surgeon he deserves the greatest admiration. It is really sad that someone like Ben Carson, who certainly is not stupid, says stupid things like that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  i think its important to point out that liking what some people said or did doesnt mean liking their *school*.

That's certainly right, but that's not exactly what I wanted to convey. Well, we seem to be in broad agreement anyway. And thanks for your note about epistle 92.

Seneca, however, seems to be somehow a special case. While others like Marcus Aurelius just liked some of Epicurus' sayings, Seneca generally was very willing to adopt parts of other philosophies like Epicureanism, Platonism and other schools, such that Seneca can be seen as an ecclectic to some degree, although he clearly refers to himself as an Stoic. Seneca quoted Epicurus regularly, more often than it is expected for a Stoic, [his references](http://newepicurean.com/suggested-reading/senecas-references-to-epicurus/) sound surprisingly often like refering to an authority.

But then, all that should not blind us to the fact, that Seneca was a Stoic, that Stoicism and Epicureanism were (and are) opposed philosophies (although they seem to be much more similar to us today than to the ancient philosophers).

By the way, there is an earlier discussion about [Seneca's Letters and Epicurus](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/comments/29m0q3/senecas_letters_and_epicurus/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I originally thought Epicureanism was a philosophy steeped in self indulgence and gratification but that is far from the truth.

This is *the* most common misconception of Epicurus until today indeed. In fact Epicurus lived a rather ascetic life and represented a very considerate hedonism. Virtue plays a huge role, too, the main difference to the Stoics is that according to Epicurus virtue is necessary (but not sufficient) for a happy life, while for the Stoics virtue is sufficient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it was what the stoics themselves said and others as well about the epicureans.

You are not wrong, but at least for some of the later Stoics we have to differenciate more carefully. Seneca, for example, generally did not write about Epicurus badly: [Seneca's references to Epicurus](http://newepicurean.com/suggested-reading/senecas-references-to-epicurus/).

Marcus Aurelius also mentions Epicurus positively several times in his Meditations and [according to *The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy*](http://www.iep.utm.edu/marcus/) he

 did find time to establish four Chairs of Philosophy in Athens, one for each of the principal philosophical traditions (Platonic, Aristotelian, Stoic, and Epicurean).

Epictetus on the other hand argues against Epicurus and other philosophical schools, although not viciously like earlier Stoics unfortunately did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I would be grateful if you give some examples.

These are only some examples which spring to my mind:

* Karl Popper, Hans Albert and generally proponents of critical rationalism have written very influental and comprehensible books.

* On do not have to share all of their opinions, but there have been several Marxist philosophers who had a big impact on some parts of society.

* Existentialism is basically dead now, but its influence on Western culture in the 20th century was huge.

* Bertrand Russell is certainly a very good example, too, or Michel Foucault, who has been linked here some weeks ago by /u/parolang.

* Although I generally do not share all of his opinions, I read Peter Singer's *"How are we to live?"* several years ago and found it a very interesting read (it doesn't contain the controversial issues Singer is famous for).

I am sure that this list is *very* incomplete. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But first, why isn't Stoicism a religion?

I don't think that Stoicism is a religion and looking at the history of Stoicism, especially at its founders, makes this rather clear. This was a complete philosophical system of physics, logics and ethics. Stoicism is philosophy and certainly not just a philosophy of life, at least as long as it was a living tradition. In ancient days philosophy generally was not just for an ivory tower (which the best of today's philosophy isn't for, either).

However, there are certainly some religious characteristics, as we would call them today, especially in late Stoicism: look, for example, how Marcus Aurelius talks about what is *Allnatur* in German translations (I think George Long translates it as *nature of the universal*). These religious characteristics were rather unexpected by me, when I first read Marcus Aurelius (which was before I engaged myself in studying Stoicism). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **About the paper**

Lucretius tells us that the key to happiness lies in recognizing the indifference of the gods and the mortality of the soul. Vergil's Aneid shows us a world in which these principles are overturned. In the Aneid religion wins.

In the Dido episode, which Julia Hejduk discusses in her paper, Vergil employs Lucretian language and imaginary to contradict Lucretian doctrine. Dido's shifting relationship to Epicureanism is an important aspect of her character. Vergil portrays Dido's fall partly as a clash between Epicureanism and the supernatural imaginary found in the Aneid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **About the paper**

Julia Hejduk shows the Lucretian understanding of religion and how much it is found in Vergil's Aenead. Vergil continually brings to life Epicurean caricatures of religion. Vergil denies the truth of the Epicurean world view, but he recognises its beauty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  You should always be in control of yourself, and even if you feel powerful impulses, they should still be under the dictates of your reason.

This *always* is something which may have a strong deterrent effect to people not familiar with the details of Stoicism, because it is very virtually impossible for a human to be *always* in control of oneself. According to Epictetus it is quite normal to be affected by strong emotions, passions, at first indeed. We are no statues after all. However, a Stoic should reflect upon the situation soon after the strong emotional state has calmed down, obtain control again and act rationally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  good passions

What is a *good passion* (apart from being an oxymoron)? You most probably wanted to write *emotions* which are divided into *feelings* and *passions*. The latter are always bad because they interfere with ones ability to make rational decisions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the mistake isn't that it is the wrong word, which it isn't (at least *compassion* is what the word in the original languages means), but that it isn't clear enough that it is only unwanted as long it is a passion. It can also be a feeling, though, in which case compassion is virtuous. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Compassion to be an unwanted passion

The term *unwanted passion* implies that there is something like a *wanted passion* which is not the case at all. The problem is not compassion, the problem is passion. As a matter of fact, as long as compassion is not a passion but a feeling, it is virtuous like wisdom, justice, bravery, temperance and generosity. So let's have a look at [the FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_stoicism.2C_considered_as_a_philosophy_of_life_in_modern_times.3F):

 * Passions are emotions caused or reinforced by a belief that something not up to us is either good or bad; they are symptoms of mistaken beliefs about good and bad.

 * Feelings, emotions not accompanied by such a belief, may be pleasant or unpleasant, but not strong enough to affect ones quality of life, or interfere with ones ability to make rational decisions.

 * An impeccable character (Sage) has feelings, but no passions.

And especially

 * As social beings (such as humans) mature, their natural impulses expand from helping themselves alone to their families, cities, nations, the community of all rational beings, and the universe itself.

The point is, that passions interfere with ones ability to make rational decisions which is a really, really bad thing for a Stoic. Compassion is an emotion which can either be a feeling or a passion. While the latter interferes with the Stoic's capacity to help, the former motivates a Stoic to help. </TEXT>
