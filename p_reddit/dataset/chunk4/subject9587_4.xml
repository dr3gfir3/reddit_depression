	<TEXT> Sure thing, I don't have exact measurements because I just threw things together, but below are rough estimates

Ingredients:
Salt to taste
Pepper to taste

Chicken:
Eggs and flour for coating
Cooking oil (I used canola)

Sauce:
1 stick of butter
Half a bulb of garlic
A cup of parsley
Parmesan cheese


Chicken:
1) boil the chicken wings with slightly salted water until cooked
2) in the meantime, mix flour, salt and pepper into a small bowl
3) once chicken has done boiling and chilled, dip the chicken in the eggs then dip with the flour mix
4) deep fry the chicken wings (I used my cast iron without too much oil so I had to flip each wing after 1.5-2mins each)

Garlic Parmesan sauce:
1) prepare chopped Garlic and parsley for sauce
2) once the wings are done frying, melt butter in a separate pan
3) roast the  garlic and parsley slightly making sure not to burn the garlic 
4) toss the chicken wings in with the mixture and add on the Parmesan and mix

I served my wings by playing the wings, spooning the remaining sauce on top and adding more Parmesan, salt, and pepper to the top
