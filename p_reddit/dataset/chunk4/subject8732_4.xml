	<TEXT> Good point. Ill ask the lawyers on that. The thing is I am not translating for profit. And, to fire a lawsuit, they need to find that I actually did the translation which is highly unlikely (reddit isnt very popular among russians). Meanwhile I am going to translate stories from amateur authors in public domain. </TEXT>
