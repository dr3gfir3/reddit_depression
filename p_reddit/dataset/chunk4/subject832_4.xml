	<TEXT> I hope for your sake you only did one year before dropping out. God only knows how much debt I'm in, and I went to university BEFORE the fees went up. Also when I was at uni I had no idea the real costs of living. University is a pretty sheltered existence with no bills in my experience. It was a bit of a shock to the system when I came out and was taking almost nothing away from my paycheck each month. Granted that was a bad wage though.

Good luck with it man. You will need luck and a lot more to make this work for you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my god hot squash.

You know, people out there aren't like us. If I ever mention how I like hot squash, and don't drink tea or coffee I get stares like I just told everyone I shit in a bin instead of the toilet. They're savages, I tell you. It's so great to find another hot squash fan out there in a sea of coffee zombies.

Hot squash forever!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gosh, I get out of breath just reading that. Get some punctuation in there!

Can you not have a sit down chat about this with him, to explain why you have two brushes? Maybe he doesn't understand. Maybe discuss some alternative products for men designed for this; I saw another poster wrote about a couple.

You may be at risk of getting eye infections if you use this shared brush over your eyes. Maybe get another one and keep it secret. Only if talking to him doesn't work though; you shouldn't have to hide things from your SO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prague isn't a neighbourhood? Surely you can't class the capital city of an entire country as a neighbourhood and then use that as an argument against OPs point?

I'm sure neighbourhood has an affect on this issue, being in a less afgluent area will probably result in more of this behaviour, but thats not to say it will definitely happen. And vice versa with an affluent neighbourhood. You get creeps in every walk of life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its very hard for people in the crappy positions to take your viewpoint. I don't think it's fair for you to be all 'shut up special snowflake' when people feel down about their own existence, it's not like they can help it. It also doesn't mean they are thinking any less of other people that are working the same grade as them. 
Life can feel so futile sometimes. </TEXT>
