	<TEXT> This ought to make ANYONE question the validity, accuracy, and methodology of public opinion polls. I put a bunch of the swing states first, but I expect there are many other states that Trump *is* bringing into play, as he says. I also show a parallel with the Brexit, in that NONE of the 7 mainstream-media polls in Britain projected that "Leave" would win. The people knew better than the pollsters! As you read through these, keep in mind that the standard definition of a "landslide" is +5 points or more. **Email, tweet, and share this far and wide!

Of 7 cumulative polls conducted by media organizations, 6 predicted that Britain would vote Remain (by a margin of 0.5% - 4%), and the other poll, conducted by *The Economist*, had the vote tied. In the end, 51.89% voted Leave, while 48.11% voted Remain; a difference of **3.78% in favor of** ***Leaving*** **the EU.**

	<TEXT> Those articles actually reinforce my point: the fact that whatever Pence HAS said about foreign policy has been different, sometimes totally different, from what Trump says, seems to indicate that Trump never even talks with him about it. So, all the more so, where's the basis that Pence would be his foreign-policy advisor? In fact, in the 2nd debate, one of the moderators read a long statement from Pence about Syria and Russia, and Trump said flat-out: "He and I haven't spoken, and I disagree. I disagree." That instance is just another reason I disagree with your prediction.

	<TEXT> What are you basing that on? I've been following the election by spending many hours every day watching speeches, interviews, and reading articles and comments, and discussing things here, and Mike Pence has said just about absolutely nothing about foreign policy. Based on his speeches and interviews, he clearly covers the faith and family values area of Trump's platform--and of the Republican platform (what Ted Cruz was all about, and what GWBush also defined himself with)--while Trump covers foreign policy, jobs, trade, healthcare, and education. Pence's rhetoric is that folksy, midwestern, small-town, church-going, rural type; within U.S. Republican politics, it's an exact counterbalance to Trump's blunt-talking, big-city, competitive, businessman persona. In fact, during the primary, Pence expressed support for Cruz, then for Trump, then Cruz again, and then a couple months later, Pence was introduced as Trump's running-mate.

I bet even THOSE people were paid off to give him space to put on his act. I just wonder if he was hired by Scott Foval before Foval got fired, or by whoever replaced him. Recall in the first Veritas video how he bragged about hiring mentally ill people to disrupt events inside and outside. Chicago event, the Arizona highway-blocking, it's all fake as hell.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mike Pence has talked of "Clinton Corruption Fatigue" (see below), but the freakin tolerance and cynicism level of some people is so goddamn high, and the attention span and MEMORY span is so short, that I think all the most extremely shockingly damning videos, emails, and revelations will probably ALL come out literally TWO DAYS before the election, and I FULLY EXPECT the other side to release whatever they have (probably a video or audio track) then, too. Notice how Hillary has to keep very heavy-handedly going through her whole rigmarole of smears against Trump (McCain, disabled reporter, the distorted Khan story); even the people who fall for her dishonest demagoguing AND who care about it FORGET IT after five seconds.

	<TEXT> I think they are fewer than they may seem. We are here on Reddit, and Reddit is popular, but when you narrow down the entire monthly userbase JUST to the AMERICAN users who are at least 18 years old and who have ANY interest into politics, the number is a very tiny percentage of the ELECTORATE. It really is a bubble, or a circle jerk, as so many meta-subreddits are named. On a related note, I have found that the English-language subreddits about certain other large countries (such as Japan, Russia, and Germany) are overrun with comments from American cucks. I was once arguing with someone with German-flag flair who was furious about Trump (I forgot on what subreddit) and after a few exchanges, I was like "You're really from Germany?" and he said no, but then "I was there 2 years ago. I know what's like." And so it turns out that Internet discussion is often just another type of MMORPG -
