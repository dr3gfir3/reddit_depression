	<TEXT> Go to TH9. Lvl 6 troops and the AQ will make raiding a lot easier. Xbows and extra Wizard Tower, Archer Tower, and Air Defense will make your base stronger defensively. You'll have plenty of upgrades as a new TH9 to keep your loot low, so don't worry about getting destroyed on defense. I'm a th9 and still have 8 pink walls. With an exposed TH and keeping my resources low, I haven't noticed much difference in the rate of my base being 100%

It's stupid to spend all of your time just maxing your walls, the game will get boring. And besides, even if you have all skull walls as a new th9, anyone with lvl 6 balloons is going to 100% you anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After you get attacked, you should get a shield/protection. Ride out your shields before attacking again.

When I'm attacking, I try to avoid corner bases. It tells me that the person knows what they're doing. A centralized base is vulnerable from attack from everywhere, but putting your base in a corner allows you to group turret fire on people who try to attack from the corner. 

I'm not sure about the medal thing, but if you get 1* and lose some medals, you should be able to gain them back pretty quickly. You're not going to lose all that many medals exposing your HQ, if that's what you decide to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you break shield a lot? If you break shield a lot, you're going to get attacked more than necessary. Are all of your resource collectors lvl 7? Try to keep one resource at a minimum, either credits or alloy to make your base less attractive for attackers. Don't have more than one turret upgrading at a time. And lastly, if you don't care about medals, you can always expose your HQ and hope you get a snipe instead of a full on attack. I'm HQ7 Empire, but those are just some general tips that can help.

edit: What's your base layout? Is it in a corner? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [From wiki:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feodosia#Theodosia) It is believed that the devastating pandemic the Black Death entered Europe for the first time via Caffa in 1347, through the movements of the Golden Horde. After a protracted siege... they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of biological warfare. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach Europe from Crimea. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under Mongol control, so it is unlikely that Caffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. In addition, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well. </TEXT>

Suddenly? What about the Roman Empire? There was more trade and travel during the height of the Roman Empire than the 14th century. You're also completely neglecting the [Plague of Justinian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plague_of_Justinian) in the 6th century which may have killed  as many as 25 million people.

	<TEXT> Don't waste gems on boosting your elixir pumps or gold mines. It's much more efficient to boost your barracks and raid for 2 hours with BARCH. The first thing I would do is get the Archer Queen, that will help you with raiding, because you need to do a lot of raiding to salvage this base. Focus on splash damage defenses first, Mortars and Wizard Towers. Also, I'm only seeing 3 air defenses, you need to buy your 4th AD and upgrade those to at least all lvl 5. After that, you can focus on canons and archer towers. You should have at least like 75% purple walls too, and buy two more teslas. You should most definitely get a 4th builder too, having only 3 builders is just going to make it much, much longer to get this base to even a solid town hall 8 level. </TEXT>

I know some people play for 4 hours a day, but I'm not one of them. I can't play for more than 2 hours before I get sick of barching. And walls are more of a psychological deterrent than anything else. A th8 with all skull walls is going to get demolished by a th9 with loonian anyway.

	<TEXT> As someone with a fully maxed HQ6 currently upgrading to HQ7, there is literally no way I can prevent someone from destroying my base when they use 5 or 6 fighters. Both my credit and alloy levels have been over 500k as I prepare to enter HQ7, and I'm losing close to 100k of each every time I get attacked. So...please explain how it's about upgrading my base? Even a fully maxed base really has no chance when the enemy uses 5 or 6 fighter strikes. I think there should be some kind of Air defense to at least help against these attacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prioritize upgrading wizard towers, mortars and walls. You should be at least all purple walls. I don't think you need to start over.

edit: Also, if you plan on playing pretty regularly, I would get another builder. You should try and keep 3 busy at all times, and then have one free for upgrading walls. Also, get the Archer Queen, that will make raiding easier for you. Join a clan too, that way you can get war loot to help with upgrades. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, 3 level 6 ADs are going to tear apart dragons. You might be able to get 1 or 2 stars with mass drag, but not 3. Mass hog won't be able to do it either, especially since your hogs are lvl 1. Seems like you're out of luck. 

Balloonain maybe? But again, those AD are going to do a lot of damage. Maybe Giants and Wizards? Drop a group of like 20 giants, drop a few wall breakers to get them through the first layer, then drop a line of 16 or so wizards behind the giants to clean up. You can use barbs and archers to lure out the clan castle first.

EDIT: Use 2 heal spells for when your giants need it, and a rage spell to give your troops an extra spurt to destroy a tough defensive building or town hall. Have 5 more wizards in clan castle. </TEXT>
