	<TEXT> I agree with you to a certain extent, but I think the satire of the original is a comment on consumerism. It's about a man being turned into a product, and that's why it's important that the costume looks like a man-shaped machine, not like a man in a suit.

It would be interesting to see that same commentary updated to today as consumerism is still a huge issue. However, the costume looks like a man in a suit and all the comparisons in this thread are giving us men in suits - Iron Man, Batman etc. etc. So I'm not convinced they're pursuing the same themes. If they are, the costume looks like a failure. 

I understand they have also changed the company name to OmniCorp, from OCP (Omni Consumer Products - the clue is in the title, people!) so I think that hints at moving away from the consumerism angle.

Anyway, I'm withholding judgement until I actually see the film. These iconic characters are our modern fairy tales and are open to - and benefit from - reinterpretation. It will be interesting to see what a second take - without Verhoeven's obsession with pornographic violence and ridiculously overblown pastiche/satire - brings to the RoboCop myth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, it was Joaquin Phoenix's reaction. As far as I'm concerned, M. Night Shayamalan's shtick is not having a twist ending (I think he kind of got pressured into that after The Sixth Sense), but rather taking fantastic situations - ghosts, superheroes, fairy tales, the-creature-in-the-woods and of course alien invasion) and playing them for real. How would you react if you began to believe you were actually a superhero? What would go through your mind if you saw actual evidence of alien invasion on the news? His strength is showing those reactions in a very naturalistic and human way. And Phoenix's wide-eyed shock brings it home - think of the implications of what he's seeing: All bets are off and the world as we know it could literally be coming to an end right now. Terrifying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And there's Ellison's "I Have No Mouth, And I Must Scream" which basically consists of a twisted version of Skynet from the Terminator movies (Ellison successfully sued for a writer's credit), eternally torturing the survivors of the apocalypse in increasingly bizarre and horrific ways while artificially extending their lifespan and preventing their suicide. To explain the title would be to spoil the ending, but I'm sure you get the gist. Multiple-award-winning short story well worth seeking out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iain M Banks has a mean streak. The Hells in "Surface Detail" are quite unpleasant - actually, there's quite a lot of sadism throughout that one. And I can't immediately remember which Banks novel it is, but in one of them someone is sliced into micron-thick sheets while kept alive by means of a Technomagic McGuffin (TM) and laid out on the floor so that his interrogator/torturer has easy access to every nerve and fibre. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the accent is referred to as "Received Pronunciation" or "RP".

"BBC English" and "The Queen's English" are colloquial terms for "Standard English" which is a language. "American English" and "International English" are language variants or (less accurately) dialects. These terms refer to the words used - and by extension, their spelling - not the way they are pronounced.

There is (technically) no such thing as "British English".

Many East Coast US accents are often said to be "closer to the original accent" than RP. This is because the language of the English Court at the time of the colonisation of North America had features like pronounced terminal "R"s and sharper "A"s. This change is not because of phonemic shift in RP, but rather because the Court moved geographically and so its prevailing accent changed. 

Terminal "R"s and sharper "A"s are still strong in accents from the North West of England (eg. Liverpool) and the West Country (eg. Bristol). It is no coincidence that these are areas where a lot of emigrants to the US came from, especially as Bristol and Liverpool have long been maritime cities.

The US fondness for removing "u"s and similar simplifications of spelling come from Webster's efforts to standardise the language, starting with "A Compendious Dictionary of the English Language" of 1806. You have to remember that the concept of "correct spelling" was even then still relatively new - prior to the mid C18th, pretty much any spelling was fine. People argue to this day about the influence of Puritanism and American experimentation in education on the formation of American English variant spelling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw a TV doc on exactly this once, but can't for the life of me remember the title or  find a reference.

IIRC, here are some key facts:
- the BEFORE and AFTER are usually taken in reverse order.
- someone who has high muscle mass and low fat can VERY quickly put on "bloat" in the space of 3 or 4 hours by eating high salt snacks and drinking sugar-laden drinks.
- camera angle, lighting, fake tan/whitener, and baby oil are all used to define or conceal contours
- there is a legal requirement* that the model has actually taken part in the advertised program (or used the supplement, followed the diet etc) unless there is an on-screen disclaimer to say otherwise. However, there's nothing to stop you hiring a body-builder, bunging him or her a box of your snack bars and then claiming your conscience is clear. And there's no requirement to prove that the BEFORE and AFTER are actually taken before and after.

* Or advertising regulatory requirement. In the UK. </TEXT>

" The Laser Designator unlock on the Scout Helicopters has been changed from a Pilot Upgrade to a new stance in the Copilot seat (position 4). Like the CITV turret on the Main Battle Tanks, the Scout Helicopters Laser Designator is permanently available to players who have received the unlock."

	<TEXT> Not an expert, but my tuppence-worth: isn't there a difference between an injured being and one that is helpless and in the actual process of dying? There was a post the other day about a poisoned rat dying in agony and confusion and my internal reaction was, "well if that was me, I'd want someone to kill me quickly." I know, I know: unjustified anthropomorphism, but I naturally approach compassion from an empathetic direction. 

Anyway, my point is that the rat would die within agony-filled hours or days anyway and nothing could alleviate its simple physical suffering save euthanising or possibly anaesthetising. The bird could be nursed, its injuries treated to make it more comfortable, and food and water could be provided to keep it alive. In this way, its suffering could be relieved while maintaining its life. The rat's could not.

This opens a whole can of worms for me. Is euthanasia ever justified for dying, agonised creatures (and humans)? Where do we draw these lines? What about medically extending the life of a creature or human who is suffering agony? Is "withholding treatment" to "let nature take its course" just copping out? What about the patient's wishes - if the rat could talk and were pleading for an end to its pain, should we ignore it? The whole gamut of Medical Ethics lies spread before us.

I'm not sure whether it is "right action" or not, but faced with a creature suffering like this bird, I would first assess its condition to see if I or anyone else could relieve its suffering without harming it, but if that was not possible, I would end its life humanely. I understand the "existence is suffering" point and the analogy of killing a child to prevent future suffering, but I'm simply unable to see myself just watching a creature suffer its way to death for hours and then afterwards sitting back and thinking, "well, existence is suffering, and the suffering-density over time is irrelevant, so I did the right thing there." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you up to a point, but one of the better aspects of the prequel duels is that they actually use different styles. Now, I'm not in any way saying that their styles are actually based on real-world systems, but Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan use ELEMENTS of Italian and German longsword techniques, Dooku's style owes SOME of its distance-closing and cone-of-defence moves to Capo de Fero style rapier, etc. I only catch glimpses of it, and 99% of the "systems" are made up to make the fights look good (as is absolutely right), but it's there. And I study Western Martial Arts (read: medieval sword fighting), so I'm not picking up on a lot of the Eastern influences, I'm sure - Ray Park is a renowned Eastern Martial Artist, so I'm sure his techniques are influenced by Eastern staff and single-handed sword disciplines. And Yoda's constantly-moving technique reminds me of capoeira for people with tiny arms and legs.

It's like they moved from, "Let's have two guys smacking crap out of each other with lightsabers ... but on different obstacle courses," in the originals to, "Let's have two guys smacking crap out of each other with lightsabers ... but with different styles." Which is like an evolution from swashbuckler to actioner, or from samurai movie to Kung-fu movie, I guess.

It's pretty thin and it could have been so much more, but I still maintain it's there. One of those good ideas drowned in fluff. </TEXT>
