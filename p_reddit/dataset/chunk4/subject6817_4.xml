	<TEXT> Yes, $700,000 a year in tax benefits, but they will keep paying millions a year in income and payroll tax. How fucking stupid do you have to be to keep believing this shit.

What is a better alternative? Let them move to Mexico? Obama even said there was nothing to be done about it.

	<TEXT> Miners make very little with tx fees. The extreme majority of profits are from the block reward.

The whole point is that its cheap to send txs + you can send alot of txs, that means that in the future when block rewards are small you will make money off of tx fees. If people cant send bitcoin txs, but must rather use some proprietary system then bitcoin will not be bitcoin and miners wont make anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Also, if fees are allowed to drop wouldn't miners lose incentive to mine?

the point is we want more people to use bitcoin. If there are more transactions to put in a block, miners will make more money. This will offset the cost of more bandwidth and storage space needed for bigger blocks *(which is dropping every year and making the small blockers sound like crazy people who think we have reached the pinnacle of computational power)* </TEXT>
