	<TEXT> Here's my thoughts on it:

Read this book back in college and I thought the movie would never come out. Well, I just got back from a screening and I can't stop thinking about it in the way a chef's best dish lingers on your tongue. If you ever wondered where is God when people suffer, or beat your self up for failing to be good, this movie helps make sense of what you're feeling.

Apart from the message, the story of a Jesuit priest going to Japan to find a possibly fallen from persecution mentor is fascinating, augmented by every aspect of moviemaking that is shown with mastery including acting, cinematography, production design, editing, and costume. I will be very surprised if it doesn't rack up Oscar nominations. Nor is it inaccessible from self indulgence like so many independent movies, rather it is Hollywood auteur moviemaking that is a relic from before the era of the blockbuster and one of its finest. When Scorsese said that cinema is dead, he surely could not mean his own.

As one critic said, you don't watch Silence, you experience it and I can't recommend it enough. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> With it being known that the new Star Wars are liberally using CG and green screen, I believe Lucas' liberal use of it was artistic: its polished look reflected that it was set before the fall of the Republic </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Filmmakers do it all the time: a movie starts out bright and gets darker as it progresses, both with story, lighting and mise en scene.  

Also I'd like to point out for those who haven't watched the extras on the prequels that many sets (iirc 72), models, and existing locations (the govt building at the end of eps 1, Anakin and Amidala's retreat in episode 2, Uncle Owen' home, they rebuilt the corridor from a picture of one from episode 4 for the ship in episode 3).

Two more points: the ot had the equivalent green screen use in its use of matte paintings throughout, to name the ones off the top of my head, Luke and Leia's rope swinging scene in the Death Star, the fighter launch bay at the end of movie one, the exterior shot of Cloud City.  

And Lucas wanted to give audiences something new; as the founder of ILM, that was by delivering vfx that had been behind the hits of movies like Jurassic Park.  I remember from the extras that he had wanted to go with the Yoda puppet in the prequels but his team had impressed him with their CG Yoda and again, CG Yoda was in keeping with the polished look of the prequels and indeed broke ground for later CG characters such as Gollum and Caesar.  

Tldr: Lucas has pushed the envelope his entire career and with the prequels, has been misunderstood

An aside: I believe the pent up demand for more Star Wars was so great that anything other than nearly exact clones of the ot would have satisfied the fanbase which is why TFA was so popular, moreover when the prequels didn't give the fans exactly that (yes I'll be the first to admit it had its flaws but the shame is completely dismissing its highs, and it came from an older and more meditative filmmaker) Lucas had been perhaps too transparent giving fans an inside look at how the sausage was made so some of the magic was taken away, and so it was easy to armchair quarterback his decisions as a director which were reduced to his working with talented people when it is par for the course to have many bad ideas on the table to get to the good ones.

	<TEXT> Americas culture of tipping serversthe standard is now 25 percent in some marketsmeans that waiters in upscale restaurants are making far more than those in the kitchen who prepare the food

Theres a need, Chiarello said, to balance pay better for talented young cooks making near minimum wage with some of his waiters who are now earning $90,000 a year, as tips can total $250 a night. 

 While servers are rewarded for exceptional service, cooks end up making less to make their food great every time, Chiarello said.

 just as customers may unfairly penalize their servers with a bad tip if the food isnt satisfactory, they may also reward them when the food exceeds expectationsboth things the waiter does not control. So the tips dont correlate with whats actually going on at the restaurant.

 Chef Waxman said it doesnt make sense for a server in one market to earn a minimum of $15 an hour before tips, and one in another market to get $2.13, the federal minimum for tipped workers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My thoughts on Silence

Read this book back in college and I thought the movie would never come out. Well, I just got back from a screening and I can't stop thinking about it in the way a chef's best dish lingers on your tongue. If you ever wondered where is God when people suffer, or beat your self up for failing to be good, this movie helps make sense of what you're feeling.

Apart from the message, the story of a Jesuit priest going to Japan to find a possibly fallen from persecution mentor is fascinating, augmented by every aspect of moviemaking that is shown with mastery including acting, cinematography, production design, editing, and costume. I will be very surprised if it doesn't rack up Oscar nominations. Nor is it inaccessible from self indulgence like so many independent movies, rather it is Hollywood auteur moviemaking that is a relic from before era of the blockbuster and one of its finest. When Scorsese said that cinema is dead, he surely could not mean his own.

It's only playing in a few cities now but if you get the chance when it's released wider, I can't recommend Silence enough. </TEXT>
