	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Note:  I also posted the same question over at /r/videography.

I use A7S and edit with Premiere Pro CS 6. When I edit and color grade my footage everything looks just fine, but once I burn it to Blu-ray and play it on TV is looks really bad. It ether looks washed without any contrast out or blacks are crushed and bright colors are over saturated.
I realize that there is a difference between colorspace for TV and monitors. However I can't find any useful information on how to go about fixing the problem.
Is there a way to color for monitor for example and than export in REC/709?
Any information that would point me to the right direction will be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking in to upgrading my slider and I came across this little thing. It looks amazing on paper but I would like to hear what everyday users have to say about it. Online reviews that I found are mainly form bloggers that I assume get paid for their reviews. Is it really as smooth as online reviews say it is. Also how durable is track? Is there really a problem with the locking mechanism? 

I mainly shoot weddings so replacing my heavy 3 foot long Konova would greatly speed things up and allow me to shoot in much smaller spaces. 

For people that are not familiar with this slider, here is the one of the online reviews: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWhHPw14VYw </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-08-04 14:41:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Today he will attend $5000.00 per plate [fund raiser](http://www.newsday.com/long-island/politics/spin-cycle/donald-trump-to-attend-fundraiser-in-nissequogue-thursday-1.12129876) on Long Island even though he said numerous times that he is the only candidate that does not owe anyone anything because he is funding his own campaign.  

EDIT: I think that we can all agree that HRC is a corporate puppet of the highest order and that voting for her is essentially voting for personal interest. However it is well worth mentioning that out of [98 million dollars that Trump campaign raise so far](https://www.opensecrets.org/pres16/candidate.php?id=N00023864) (July 21, 2016) only about half (49 million dollars) was Trumps own money. Oldie101 already mentioned in this thread he will need at least half a billion dollars (I personally think much, much more) in order to stay competitive. It is obvious that individuals and organizations alike will be asked to donate millions of dollars at the time. Obviously majority of those large donors will want something in return. How can he raise all that money without giving in to special interest?  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-08-01 23:30:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We think about adding credit card option for our clients. 

Idea is to start accepting online payments by having actual check out page where clients can come to and make credit/debit card payment. We are starting to get more and more business form out of town clients and everything is done over email and telephone. 

So far we looked in to PayPal, Stripe and Chase ( we have business account with Chase )

PayPal - We used them for few smaller transactions and to be perfectly honest, I don't like it all that much. Also they have a limit where we can only withdraw $1000.00 every 30 days so that is not really an option.

Stripe - Our host SquareSpace is recommending their platform, but form what I understand they are a nightmare to deal with, keep you money on hold for no good reason and have no live customer service.

Chase looks good on paper, but they have a lot of requirements and virtually no platform that can easily be incorporated in to existing website. 

Is there decent affordable platform for photographers that will allow us to set up website checkout and maybe even mobile charging without making us jump trough hoops in order to collect our money.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking in to purchasing [Breakthrough Photography x4 6 stop or 3 stop ND filter](http://breakthrough.photography/product/x4-neutral-density/) to pair it with my A7S and 24-70mm Zeiss and 18-105mm Sony. Overall bloggers online are raving about it, but they are mainly talking about stills and there is almost no reviews form real non paid users. 

So with that said if anyone here is using them please share your thoughts! Added bonus is you are Wedding Videographer, because I mainly shoot weddings. 

Edit: In order to avoid confusion, their X3 series ND filters were renamed in to X4 so basically we are still talking about exact same thing!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We are located in Northern New Jersey. We have 7 two story buildings housing about 45 units and majority of owners live in the units. 

So with that said here is what I would like to know:

Where can I find list of grants, incentives, tax brakes, etc ... available in my region? 

Since majority of units are empty during the day, do electricity companies such as PSE G ( local NJ provider ) pay for surplus electricity that we put back in to the grid or do they offer any other incentives? 

What information should I gather before I start talking to solar companies? 

Is there a way to pass savings/earnings directly to tenants or will association receive all benefits? 

What are some reputable companies in my region that I should contact? 

What are things we should look out for? 

Any other advice that you think would be relevant for our situation. 

If you guys need any additional info please let me know! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-26 02:52:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In about 10 days we are going to Southern Utah for the first time. Plan is to take RV and get lost in wilderness for about 2 weeks. I will be taking my camera gear ( that consist of one full frame body, 3 lenses, and some accessories ) with me and due to short flight connections I won't be checking any luggage. 

So with that in mind what advice could you give me as far as the clothing and shoes? What are essentials? Do I need long sleeves and pants or can I get away with few pairs of cargo shorts and t-shirts? Also do I need heavy duty shoes and socks or Marrell Bare Access and pair of sandals will do? 

Finally any other advice would be greatly appreciated!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got of the phone with Cruise America and they give me a quote of $150.00 per day for 25ft RV and $120.00 per day for 30ft RV. Additionally there is a $0.35 charge per mile and insurance is included. We plan on driving about 1500miles in total. To me all this sounded to good to be true, and got me wondering why would they offer vehicle that would accommodate 7 for less than vehicle that would accommodate only 4. Additionally what are some must have accessories that we have to purchase/rent in order to make this work. Also, other than more gas money and harder to park, what are other less obvious drawbacks of larger RV? 

Based on information that I provided could anyone give me realistic estimate of how much would 10 day rental cost me. For what it is worth we are looking to pick up and drop of RV in Las Vegas and visit as many national parks in Utah as possible.  </TEXT>

Apparently in NYC there is a law saying that pregnant women can't be denied a drink. That got me thinking how often pregnant women actually do order alcohol.

	<DATE> 2016-04-28 20:13:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm looking for some advice on formulating late fee terms for the contract. As of right now we require full payment 6 month after wedding day or on day of delivery. Whichever comes first.

Problem is that some clients simply " disappear " form the face of the earth and year or two goes by before they " reappear " to pay the balance and pick up the video, albums, etc ... 

**Edit:** I see that my question caused some confusion, so here is the detailed breakdown of how we charge. 

Deposit ( Usually $500 )

Remaining balance is due at the day of the wedding ( only if they are not ordering wedding albums )

If their package does include wedding albums than we charge 70% of remaining balance at the day of the wedding and remaining 30% after 6 month or when they pickup the albums and video ( whichever comes first ) 

Now, problem is that recently few clients with albums in their packages who are avoiding/stalling final payment and delivery. 

I figured that if we introduce late fee in the future it might help reduce number of people that are stalling with the final payments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This happened last week. I'm form NJ and other driver is from Massachusetts. There is a minor paint damage on his bumper. At the time of accident we didn't call police, but instead decided just to exchange information. We started with the business cards, but than when it came to registration, insurance and ID he just said that he can't find his registration. Based on that I refused to give him any of my personal information other than what he already had on my business card. Just for the record he did take a picture of my license plate. 

Now he is calling me talking about filing a claim with his insurance or me compensating him for damages.

What are my options? Should I call my insurance company and tell them about it, or should I just let him deal with his insurance company?

Edit: For what is worth I was legally parked on the side of the road and I reversed my vehicle in to his illegally double parked vehicle.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-04-14 15:21:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My local TV station News12 New Jersey just reported that " Sanders had few thousand supporters at the rally in one of Manhattan parks " and than promptly reported that " Hillary's rally in Bronx community center attracted whopping 1300 supporters!!! " Than they concluded how Hillary is winning popular and super delegate vote by a large margin and that it is obvious that Sanders is just stalling the inevitable!  

Unfortunately they forgot to mention that Sanders had 27000 turn out for Washington Square Park rally and that he broke Barak Obamas record number of 24000 supporters. 

In my opinion that " minor hiccup " of not reporting numbers/facts on both gatherings make a Yuuuge difference! Even though we are not talking about national TV network, we are still talking about millions of people/voters these local TV stations are reaching daily. Average person who is not interested in politics, but still votes will register this information and never think about it twice. 

Point that I'm trying to make is that people who actually need to hear these numbers are not being informed. Random voter does not pay attention to difference between few thousand and 1300, but if they hear 27000 vs 1300 they will most definitely know who gets the popular vote and who gets super delegates!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Front page of this sub is being flooded by random personal questions regarding good real-estate agents, lawyers, doctors, restaurants, where to move, how to get from point A to point B, etc ... 

I'm all for helping people and I do answer questions whenever I have something to contribute. However if you look at the front page at this moment 10 out of 25 top posts are related to people asking random questions that simple google search and few minutes of research could easily answer. In my opinion this practice takes away form what this sub should really be about and turns it in to " let me ask locals because I'm to lazy to use Google my self ".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> June 7, 2016 - New Jersey Primary Election

May 17, 2016 - Voter Registration Deadline, last opportunity to register to vote in the Primary Election.

Even though you are registered voter in NJ you must register for Primary Elections. 

For anyone in NJ that is not registered for Primary, you can find [instructions](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/voting-information-party-declaration-forms.html) and [registration form](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/form_pdf/party-affiliation-form-070314.pdf) here. 

 **Important**  

1. You do not have to register as a Democrat or Republican in order to be eligible to voat in primary! 

2. You can register as Unaffiliated and still be eligible to vote in Primary. 

**Edit**

As /u/captainMoustache pointed out you must declare your party affiliation in order to vote in NJ Primaries. However if this is your first Primary you can declare your party affiliation at the voting location. 

Here is the quote: 

"Can I declare my party affiliation at the polls?
You can declare your party affiliation at the polls when you go to vote in your first Primary Election. After that, you may change your party affiliation 55 days before a primary election."


More information can be found on this [page](http://www.state.nj.us/state/elections/voting-information-voting-faq.html). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Regarding Bernies universal healthcare - Why is no one including his campagne talking about one of the most important money saving feature? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-02 18:25:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If we get universal healthcare that Sanders is fighting for we would should be paying significantly less for all other types of insurance. That is something that every single person and business in US can relate to! Look at your auto insurance policy for example I guarantee that largest expense on your policy is [PIP](https://coverhound.com/insurance-learning-center/what-is-pip-insurance) ( Personal injury protection ). Now I do know that in some states it is not mandatory, however I'm sure that most people still get it anyway simply because few broken bones or serious operation could easily bankrupt more or less any given person or small business. 

Take a look at what I pay every 6 month for insurance: 

Total insurance coverage Cost for six months: $715.00 

Bodily Injury Liability: $156.00

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury: $33.00

Personal Injury Protection - Medical Expense: $230.00

Extended Medical Payments: $1.00

Total for medical expenses is: $420.00 for 6 month period or 59% of my total policy cost goes toward medical insurance!!! 

Now multiply these numbers with the number of public and private vehicles insured and that number would skyrocket in to billions of extra dollars that we as a society could use to improve education, employment, work environment, infrastructure, standard of living ... 

That is just one of the reasons I laugh when I hear the argument " Yes, universal health coverage is a great idea, but overall it will cost taxpayers more money "

	<DATE> 2016-02-01 01:31:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Until recently I was mainly drinking draft beers, so I never really though about it before because my tab could not exceed more than like $40-50 for few beers. Some of my friends work in really high end cocktail/hotel bars so they got me in to some expensive top shelf scotch among other crazy cocktails they mix all the time. They always give out free rounds of drink. Sometimes is one sometimes is three and couple of times we were not charged anything. I guess what I'm trying to say is that they could comp me anywhere form $25 to well over $100-150 on any given night. I never question them while they are behind the bar and always tip really good. However few times when I asked about it when we see each other outside of their " office " all of them would just say don't worry about it ... 

Reason why I'm asking this is because I know how hard they work and I don't want them to get in to the situation where they have to cover the loss that my party consumed.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is a right sub to ask this question, or if I'm braking any rules so mods please delete my post if there is any problems ... 

Anyway, I'm doing a video edit for jewish wedding, during the ring exchange ceremony there is a part where Rabbi is saying something to the groom in Hebrew and than groom is reciting something before he takes the ring. Right before that part Rabbi pushed away the mike and they were whispering during entire exchange. I had a lav on the groom so I'm able to get fairly decent audio, but I'm wondering if should I include it at all since they are obviously whispering and no one in the room of 300 plus people present at the time can't hear the word they are saying. Also in between Hebrew conversation they are speaking in English about some totally random stuff that most definitely should not be included.

Someone please help! </TEXT>

Edit: Mystery solved! I asked the same question on /r/Judaism and here is what I found out. Rabbi was confirming with groom that he purchased the ring with his own money otherwise they can't get married borrowed ring.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When you are on snow keep your speed steady and use the brake only when you really must by slightly tapping on the brake pedal several times instead of slamming that sucker like there is no tomorrow. Try to alter your speed only with gas pedal by looking at the road ahead of you and slowly adjust your speed accordingly. Also I like to use GPS even on the roads I'm familiar with because you will be aware of upcoming turns, lane changes and possible slowdowns. 

Also, clean the snow from the roof and windows you lazy bums! 

And for the love of god, get your self a decent set of tires! Few hundred bucks that you save because " you are a good driver and it won't happened to you " is not worthy someone else's life! 

**Edit:** Most modern cars are equipped with ABS ( Anti-lock braking system ) so there is no need to tap your brake pedal several times. All you need to do is slowly apply pressure and car computer will take care of it for you much faster than you ever would. Once you hear the grinning noise DO NOT release the brake, keep the same pressure, noise is just the sign that ABS is working!  </TEXT>
