	<TEXT> how is this at all a conspiracy? 

Because the MSM/4th estate shamelessly advocates for Trump's assassination. [Consider this dickless shill for the NYT.](https://www.alipac.us/f12/ny-times-columnist-jokes-about-assassination-attempt-ending-trump%92s-campaign-329316/#post1493393) 

These ~~professional journalists~~ paid shills would never treat Obama, a proven traitor, in similar fashion. They would never suggest that Obama actually worked for foreign interests against the interests of the American people, as he did when he switched sides in the war on terror and willfully gave rise to ISIS. That's the distinction you fail to make. </TEXT>

Only by the grace of God is Trump still alive. We know that many on the political Left as well the Right want him dead, including those collaborators in the mainstream media who exert all their effort in an attempt to delegitimize him and paint him as a Russian agent. But the internet and the Truth movement has foiled their plan. Nobody's buying it. Therefore, they realize that if they do kill him, it will only backfire terribly on them. Character assassination is the best they can hope for in this information age.
