	<TEXT> I started talking with this new kid at our school a couple days ago. We get along fine, he's got some weird vibes to him but I figure he's just not good at talking or something. One day outta nowhere he starts talking about his shitty ex and how he can't even talk to her anymore. I ask him why, and he gets this weird-ass look on his face like he's constipated. After a while he finally says real chill,"Ohhh well, I kinda got mad one day and said I was gonna kill her....and her family...and all her friends...but nbd man, it's in the past." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Community college and then moving on to getting a real major sounds like a good plan and a lot more affordable. I'll talk to my parents about it tonight.

	<DATE> 2014-12-01 20:27:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a 17 year old senior in high school in Georgia. I plan on majoring in finance and I'm considering applying to GA southern because it's only about $3500 a semester for tuition, but my mom claims it's a bad idea because good companies only give kids from good universities a chance. Is this true? Can I have a good future (or at least a life above the poverty level with a job in finance) even if I go to a cheap college?


Some background and other things that kinda worry me: I've had some trouble with depression and was hospitalized as an outpatient for a period of two weeks last year. Will colleges (ga southern or any others I apply to) be less willing to admit me because of this?


I'm afraid I really just don't know much about this and I've gotten many very different responses from school counselors and other adults, so I'd appreciate it if I could get some advice on this. The last thing I want is to graduate with debt and little job prospects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man can and and do suffer from stereotypes and poor treatment, just as women can and do. Thing is, - and note, this happens at a greater frequency in third-world countries or people raised in a similar culture - women are generally viewed as second-class citizens. Women, as shown by surveys and studies, have less access to education and have more of a chance of being sexually abused than men in the world.

Am I saying men don't get abused? That female abusers don't exist? God no. Men can be very much abused and it's a horrible, horrible thing. The only point I'm trying to explain is that as a whole, globally, women are not treated as equal to men in many places, and this results in them having a higher chance of treated badly. That's why feminism is important - women and men need to be treated equally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Throughout my years digging in the trenches, I've fought many battles, but none so horrendous and heart-breaking as the Battle of the Skeleton-Man. Half man, half skeleton, he was a fearsome beast as tall as ten of my men and almost as wide as my mother. He came lumbering at us from across the hills in the east, his eyes glowing red in the night like a daemon of the old days. We gripped our swords and charged toward him, letting out our mighty battle-cry, but due to his height, we could only land blows to his feet like ants. My skele-bro in arms attempted to launch his sword into the beast's eye, but he was no match for the brute, and with a mighty smash, his bones were soon scattered around the battlefield. His skull landed near my feet. In agony, I fell to the ground and cradled his skull in my arms. "Oh skele-bro," I whispered, "Why didn't you drink your milk?!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, no, but I really admire people who are religious and actually "practice what they preach". Like I've got a friend who's a devout Catholic, but I'll be damned if he isn't the most polite, friendly, and helpful guy I know. He considers it to be his duty in life or something. Strangely enough, the rest of his family isn't really religious but they're downright awful people - several have got drinking problems,  his brothers are complete assholes - the list goes on. The guy's a real saint though, and funny too - I love him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had a lot of trouble with depression over the past two years, and my dad's struggled with it, when he was a teenager and even these days sometimes.


I tried to kill myself last Wednesday. It scared him a lot and I felt awful. But then other times he reminds me that I'm so selfish and awful, and how I can never give back. They spent so much money on me - hospital and antidepressants and therapy. It stressed my mom out a lot too. he's reminded me that it all depends on me and what I do in life, but just feels like I'm such a burden on them, I don't know what to do :(  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, she really just wouldn't take it well at all... I tell my dad because he went through it when he was a teenager and has struggled with depression. He made an attempt on his life as well when he was young and so is familiar with how it feels, while my mom is not, so he's more understanding. There's also the fact that my mom goes on lots of trips where she's in another country, and in the past when she knew I wasn't doing well, it really stressed her out, and she's already stressed by work in general. She's gone from 7 in the morning to 7 at night, and then from home she sometimes works until 10. Overall, we must don't want to put more stress on her than she's already got. She's said in the past that she wishes we would tell her about these kinds of things but for the sake of her health, we don't.  </TEXT>
