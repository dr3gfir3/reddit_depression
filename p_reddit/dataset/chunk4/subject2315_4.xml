	<TEXT> I know others have pointed out all of the fish/fishing references, but I haven't seen mention of the many uses of water as a theme, as well as feet. This might be a stretch, but the astrological sign Pisces symbol/constellation is two fish swimming in opposite directions, it is a water sign, the body part ruled by Pisces are the feet, and the word Pisces itself is the plural for fish in Latin. This could mean nothing, but wondering if anyone else noticed these things? 

Also, I'm rewatching the series now and I noticed in episode one, the nurse tells The OA that she has hypothermia. Further along in the series, Hap also mentions that The OA was almost hypothermic after she's been in his ND contraption. Any theories about these references? 

Also, I cannot recall a series that has ever moved me the way The OA has, like ever.  </TEXT>

Least favorite part about this post: American after American echoing the same unfunny, not witty whine over the American President's Motorcade and 'teh traffics' it cause, in true American "I have first world problems, waaah" fashion.
