	<TEXT> We Bought a Zoo. I found almost all of the characters annoying and idiotic, as well as some scenes where the father acts like a bad parent and we're supposed to agree with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not really a fan of Pewds, mostly because I don't usually get his sense of humour. In this video, however, I didn't find it that uncomfortable.

I mean, sure, he's calling things "gay", but almost all of the time, he apologized for it. Keep in mind, that the majority of the jokes that he makes can be taken as offensive.

He's made jokes about black people, Asians, women,  and rape, to name a few. I don't exactly see the problem with him making jokes about a game being gay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I first watched it, I was completely disappointed in it. Rewatching it, I found that the first half was a good sci-fi movie, but the second half fell apart with way too many plot holes. </TEXT>
