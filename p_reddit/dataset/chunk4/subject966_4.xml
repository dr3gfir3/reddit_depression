	<TEXT> Neil and Del are the most antithetic duo you could put into a John Hughes movie and still make it a functioning story line. While I think both John Candy and Steve Martin gave their best performances in this movie (The Jerk might have been the best for Steve; it's a toss-up for me), every single character that's introduced is nearly perfectly adversarial to how Neil was feeling at the time i.e. the jolly rental car lady vs. his incredibly irate demeanour. And even with all of these dynamics working against each other at what seems like a constant rate, the characters never lose their believability. It may be the greatest holiday comedy ever made because there are just so many damn good jokes in it. </TEXT>
