	<TEXT> Speaking as an atheist, I do not find what /u/TotallyKnackered said to be absurd. Both religions share a hatred for the LGBT community. Suggesting prayers for your own victims of oppression is purely part of the political game to deflect and take advantage of rising Islamaphobia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everytime I hear someone wanting to wholesale ban a population based solely on religion this quote from Martin Niemller comes to mind.

"First they came for the Socialists, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Socialist.

Then they came for the Trade Unionists, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Trade Unionist.

Then they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out
Because I was not a Jew.

Then they came for meand there was no one left to speak for me."

Just replace socialist with Muslim and well...there you go. This line of thinking has led to the absolute worst tragedies this world has every seen. This line of thinking has led to the worst atrocities the US has ever committed on its own soil, from the Native American genocide, to the Red Scare, to the internment of US citizens with Japanese heritage. Banning a group based solely on their religion goes against every fundamental belief and value our nation was founded on. Falling to the level of our enemies is not how we win, it is how they win. Our war against terrorism is as much a war against extremists as it is a war against ourselves. A test on whether we can uphold the values we hold most dear or whether we cast them aside in the name of security. Is it really worth winning if we have nothing left by the time it's all over?

	<TEXT> To help clarify Rothkopf's argument, he is saying that she can't just run as the anti-Trump. That's what the other Republican candidates did and it lost them the race. The argument is that Clinton needs to make this about her and her policies. She needs to offer something new to show she has learned from her past mistakes and energize her supporters. If she were to keep hammering Trump it would legitamize him and his words and focus too much attention on him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You keep saying that, but offer no source or any argument. 

Really, the closest it could possible get is subsection f, but given the fact her only supervisor is the President and her ability to determine what is appropriate kind of muddles the argument and would rely quite a bit on interpretation without any guiding precedent. However, if she does get indicted under that section it will literally open up the entirety of the federal governments ITS to prosecution anytime anything is hacked. 

"...through gross negligence permits the same to be removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of his trust, or to be lost, stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, or (2) having knowledge that the same has been illegally removed from its proper place of custody or delivered to anyone in violation of its trust, or lost, or stolen, abstracted, or destroyed, and fails to make prompt report of such loss, theft, abstraction, or destruction to his superior officer"

So unless you want to back up your claim of calling my statements old debunked arguments, I am inclined to say you in fact are the one that does not know what you are talking about.  </TEXT>

He has no idea how to run a giant organization. He has flipped positions on so many topics so many times there is an entire subreddit dedicated to tracking it, /r/Donald_Flipping_Trump. Whenever he is under any serious pressure he reverts to slander and name calling. He is no master business man. He inherited most of his wealth and came from a wealthy background. If you want to look at great businessmen why not people like Bill Gates, who came from a modest background to become the world's richest man. Not Trump whose business philosophy revolves around strategic bankruptcies. There is absolutely nothing in his past to suggest he would be a capable leader, let alone lead the world's largest organization.  </TEXT>

Maybe this will be like all the other jumps in human productivity and we will find new ways to work. Maybe not and we will be faced with chronic unemployment with nearly all economic activity in the hands of those with the means for production.

Literally every example brought up from Petraeus to Snowden to Manning and everyone in between willingly and knowingly shared classified materials with persons not authorized to access those materials. Nothing she did was illegal. What she did was an unwise attempt to protect her privacy from Republicans who have been running Clinton smear campaigns for decades. Don't forget that the Citizens United decision was about the ability of CUPAC to advertise for a film dedicated to taking her down. Honestly I can say I would have done the same thing if I were in her position.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not even close man. This has been happening since the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Middle East has no coherent identity. Think Europe and the Thirty Years' War. Their culture is smacking up against modernisation, globalisation, and intercultural contact like never before. Fear of the unknown is driving people towards conservatism and the belief that the past is better than the present and the only way to live a safe and prosperous life is to harken back to the rose colored past. But not everyone agrees on what past to follow. Turkey obviously supports the Ottoman history, Iran Persian history, and Sunni's the era of massive caliphates (which were all Sunni). This is causing everyone to fight with each other while trying to establish dominance and make others follow the best way, their way. 

If anything we only accelerated the collapse of a single country. I blame Libya on France. It is naive to think Saddam would have lasted forever and passed down the country to one of his sons (who were all terrible leaders by the way). The Arab Spring would have come and Iraq would either go the way of the rest or become like Syria. At least now we can get troops into Iraq. If Saddam was still in power we would probably be seeing massive killing of Shias which would goad Iran into invading and probably involve Saudi Arabia and it would just be a giant clusterfuck of Middle East countries fighting each other. Honestly, I think it is more tame now than it could have been had we not blown up one of the kettles early. </TEXT>

Islamists are literally **the only** organized political opposition force in every Middle East country. There is no way to not assist them. It is better to have them as fair weather allies than have no hands in the mix at all and let it be a slugfest with Russia, Bashar, and Iran on one side and the Syrian Sunnis on the other. If you are looking to start a series of Middle East genocides...well that's one way to do it. </TEXT>

If you can't do that it means either (a) there aren't many people that agree with you or (b) you aren't an effective leader/organizer.

	<TEXT> Politics is 100% about creating divisions. It's about defining what makes one party different from the other. Stark contrasts are what gains the attention of voters and drives them to the booth. How about you tone down this dumb narrative about being controlled when you can go out and make the changes you want to see. I'm tired of seeing people just complaining online. If you think it is so bad take it upon yourself to do something. Otherwise you are a lazy fuck that deserves whatever shit you get.

 In addition to Secretary Clinton, eight former Department employees declined OIG requests for interviews: (1) the

Deputy Chief of Staff for Policy to Secretary Clinton (2009-11) and the Director of Policy Planning (2011-13); (4) the
Deputy Chief of Staff for Operations to Secretary Clinton (2009-13); (5) the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Strategic
Communication (2009-13); (6) the Director of the S/ES Office of Information Resources Management (2008-13); (7) a
Special Advisor to the Deputy Chief Information Officer (2009-13) who provided technical support for Secretary
Clintons personal email system; and (8) a Senior Advisor to the Department, who supervised responses to
Congressional inquiries (2014-15). Two additional individuals did not respond to OIG interview requests: the Deputy
Secretary of State for Management and Resources (2011-13) and an individual based in New York who provided
technical support for Secretary Clintons personal email system but who was never employed by the Department.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am certain you don't know what populism is. It is and always has been bad. It is a means to *control* an apathetic and ill-informed electorate, it is nothing more than ill-conceived political strategy. You get people riled up enough and they'll let you do anything....hmmmm....that brings to mind Venezuela and Brazil. I wonder how they are doing?  Or maybe the populism tearing apart the EU and supported by Russia?

Sanders is extremely far left and I am a moderate...more honestly a neoliberal so on policy Clinton is 100% the best option for my political views. Giving away shit that we can't afford is how we destroy our democracy and everything we as a nation have built over the last 240 years. Taxing ourselves into oblivion isn't going to help either. All Sanders plan will do for me is throw me into a hole I will never get out of. The entirety of my savings budget will go to new taxes. How will I build a better future for myself then? How will I afford a home? 

Have you not seen how poorly Sanders has run his campaign? I know this is like beating a dead horse but he is completely responsible for the disruptions at the Nevada Democratic Party convention. He did not train his operatives well enough to be able to handle the procedural complexity of the convention. How many people were late? Why were most of them Sanders supporters? The convention was slated to start at 9 but delayed 30 minutes in order to accommodate as many as possible. Then they get all in a huff when they can't follow the rules that had been posted on the state party's website for months! If he can't do that, what hope is there for his management abilities in the White House. But please, point me to his managerial successes.

Are you sure we have been paying attention to the same campaign? How many times has Sanders gotten red in the face with frustration? His whole fucking platform is about being pissed off and playing the victim card! His whole coalition is supported by pissed off people. Please try to convince me he isn't!

	<TEXT> How about all of his policies? His egotism? His poor management skills? His anger and dismal understanding of reality? The fact he thinks he is always right and anyone that says otherwise is just part of the system bringing him down? Fanning the flames of nationalism and populism? He has absolutely NONE of the qualities I look for in a leader. How will he put a cabinet together? What will his NSC look like? What is his management style? What will his NEC look like? How will he pick ambassadors? How does he plan on handling a sharply divided congress and increasingly polarized poetical landscape? How will he deal with the constant accusations and attacks from Republicans? My guess is he will just explode with anger like he usually does. He does not have the temperament to lead. Being an "honest and upstanding" person does not mean they will be a good leader. This isnt some friend you're picking. This is the manager of the LARGEST and most complex business in the world. He doesn't have the friends or political capital in the beltway to make it work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calm your horses. I said no such thing about regulatory agencies. Corporations serve one purpose: to make money. Therefore it is the government's responsibility to prevent harm from profit chasing. I fully support government regulations, but not whole sale government services. I'm on the side of private-public partnerships. When devised properly these can increase accountability and efficiency if there is enough competition. My view is the government should set the rules and allow private industry to do most of the work. Certainly, there are areas that won't work well when privatized, things like FEMA and the prison system. Government has a tendency towards inefficiency and inertia, which is fine. I prefer it that way actually. This just means we need to be smart about how we do things so as to keep politics out of services as much as possible. The Federal Reserve is a good example of this though it too has started succumbing to partisan pressures and needs some reform. 

I have seen plenty of videos on the convention. No where did I say violence, you did. I said disruptions which is clearly evident. I'm not sure how much experience you have in highly procedural meetings like a convention, but they start at a predetermined time, not when everyone gets there. The convention actually started 30 minutes late in an attempt to accommodate as many people as possible. If you don't follow procedure to the letter it doesn't matter what you do it won't work. Everything was posted on the state party's website with plenty of time for people to educate and prepare themselves. Not effectively communicating that information is on the hands of the Sanders campaign. If you know you have a lot of novice activists in your campaign you should know you need to expend more resources on training and education. The fact the convention went the way it did is because of how ill-prepared the Sanders coalition was.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are falling behind? Want to follow that up with some sources?

The big thing many Sanders supporters seem to miss is that a lot of Americans don't want a socialist style government. You say we have a corruption problem, but before we tackle that you want to bloat the government doll with a huge number of expensive services that would hand out billions of dollars worth of contracts. I'm sure that will work out well! The simple fact is, I, like many other Americans, don't want the government to be in charge of those things. You have to remember congress controls the purse strings. Let's just say Sanders wins along with a supermajority of far left Dems. He expends all of his political capital his first two years jamming his agenda through congress and elicits a massive backlash and loses control of Congress. What happens to his agenda then? He will be blocked at every corner and we get more government shutdowns than we got with Obama because that is the mandate that brought in congress. Okay say he gets through 4 years but now the Republicans claim the white house and congress. They start rolling back his agenda or making his programs so dysfunctional the electorate wants them to get rid of them. Now we are left severely diminished after years of political infighting without our government capable of doing anything. There is no long term outcome that is positive with a Sanders presidency. He is not ready to be a leader. Just his comment on the Nevada convention is enough to show that. Regardless of what your opinion on the matter is he basically said he agreed with the disruption of the process and played the victim card. That is not what a leader does. A leader organizes his coalition and provides resources for them to be properly prepared. He is 100% responsible for what his followers do. By not strongly condemning the disruptions and telling his supporters to follow the process, he showed extreme weakness of character and acts like the dictators of the world that blame America for anything that goes wrong.

	<TEXT> Every politician is kinda scummy, politics is inherently that way. Just think of office politics, do you like the person who is best at it? Maybe not, but they can get shit done. Hillary is a very typical politician. Her platform might change election to election, but she will fight for that platform if that is the mandate that brings her to office. That much I trust about her. I know what I cannot trust about her too. She will be under a microscope. She won't be able to get away with jack without screwing over her chance for re-election and the Democratic Party's chance for power. That's the good thing about a politician beholden to a party, there are more constraints on power.

 I am also a moderate. I don't think the government has any business providing many of the services Sanders wants to add to the government doll. Government agencies are much harder to keep accountable than private industry. There is just way more chance for corruption when you enlarge the services offered. Additionally, you lose efficiency and gain inertia. Just look at the VA for an example, Sanders certainly didn't help there by protecting the people in charge from being fired. [\[1\]](http://www.militarytimes.com/story/military/election/2016/02/18/sanders-va-firing-problems/80506664/) [\[2\]](http://watchdog.org/255459/bernie-sanders-va-whistleblower/) In my opinion, free university would reduce the accountability of the students getting degrees. There would be even less motivation to get a meaningful degree if you aren't footing the bill. What good is a population full of humanities degrees? STEM degrees I can get on board with at the very most subsidizing. I really think the emphasis should go on better trade schools and apprenticeship programs combined with better high school career counseling. The government should also allow student loans to be discharged through bankruptcy. The current system just distorts the market and leads to massive inflation. I could support a single-payer healthcare system, but we need to slowly transition to it first through something like the ACA. Then slowly increase the coverage of Medicare and Medicaid and remove the [barriers](http://www.pbs.org/newshour/making-sense/medicare-allow-price-gouging-prescription-drugs/) that prevent the government from negotiating prescription prices. 

In foreign affairs, Sanders is just plain wrong. American involvement in the world is absolutely necessary for stability. The balance of great powers leads to stability. Perceived weakness can lead to potentially dangerous confrontations. Just like with the Cuban Missile Crisis, except this time it will be more Chinese land reclamation and navigation limits in the South China Sea. Iran will become more aggressive in the Straight of Hormuz, Russia will further destabilize the EU. NATO, will be toothless without strong American backing and would be unable to act as a counterweight to Russian revanchism. China will continue to take advantage of Africa and bully its neighbors in Asia. There will be no one to force China to clamp down on North Korea. Without the US, Japan and South Korea are enemies. The left is falling in South American and with it any friendly faces to the self-described socialist. Clinton is the only one in the race with the experience and capability of maintaining US supremacy to promote a liberal rules-based world.

	<TEXT> Were you there? Are you misrepresenting the facts? What would make your perspective right, then? Because you are pro-Sanders? Because he can only do good and this is just his supporters fighting the evil of the system? I've seen multiple videos from several angles and it is always the same thing.  Being the loudest doesn't make someone right. Having the most energy doesn't mean you have the most support. I'm tired of the hogwash coming out of the Sanders campaign making every loss and every slight seem like the entire establishment out to get him and his followers. In fact, it is his followers' inability to follow the rules, plan ahead, and formulate a plan that fits into the rules. This is a rules based system and ANYTIME people threaten that just because they lost and aren't happy is a travesty. Might as well give China the whole fucking South China Sea! While you are at it ,let Russia take the Donbass, South Ossetia, and Abkhazia! 

The system is just fucking complicated and hard as shit to make work your way. You have to build support and learn the rules. This takes time to do properly. You can't just have a big campaign and a bunch of stump speeches and say this is a revolution! That has to start down ballot. It has to start with *actionable* support. How do you think the Republican party has gained so much power? They played the long-game....like the 30 year long game. They slowly built local support into state support which allowed them to progressively draw more favorable districts. That patience has put them in a very good position. You and every single other Sanders supporter is completely naive in thinking one presidential campaign can do anything. Especially from a candidate that backhandedly supports violence. I would never vote for Sanders now and I would never support him in office. I would work my fingers to the bone to prevent that man from ever sitting in an important office again. He has no place in American politics just like Trump has no place in American politics. I hope you learn someday not to get swept up in the empty promises of a populist. Maybe this country will be better then. </TEXT>

We fight ideas with ideas, not chairs, vulgarities, and death threats. I for one lost all respect for Sanders after his response to the ruckus his supporters caused. He essentially, said it was acceptable to break down the democratic process into a maelstrom of screaming and violence. It is a real shame, people think he has great character, but that is just who he plays, that is the character he wants you to see. He is absolutely no different than any other politician. He just goes after the populist sentiment that is easy to capture, but impossible to control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The term of material science is structure-property relationships. How does the structure of the material affect its properties. This goes across the fields of chemistry, physics, and engineering. Chemists are interested how monomers (repeat unit of macromolecules) affect properties such as degradation, kinetics, material properties. Physicists are interested in how the universal properties of macromolecules dictate their structure and affect the larger scale properties. These are things such as chain stiffness and architecture. Engineers focus on how processing and design can make the same material better. One example would be how crystallinity affects gas barrier properties.

Polyethylene is arguably the simplest polymer (macromolecule) but is used in a vast range of applications from grocery bags and milk jugs to orthopedic implants and bullet proof vests. The only difference is the molecular weight and amount of branching.  </TEXT>

These are basics of Robert's Rules. Conventions don't necessarily follow these rules, they follow the rules of the last meeting then offer up changes before proceeding. To me this just sounds like people didn't go to the effort to learn the rules beforehand.
