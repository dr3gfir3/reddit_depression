	<TEXT> "Freely donating" my ass. The church will deny you a temple recommend for not giving 10%. Which means, according to their beliefs, that you won't be able to be with your family in the afterlife, as you won't be able to perform the necessary ordinances in the temple. 

Do not pretend as if the church doesn't use their doctrines to manipulate members into opening their pocket books.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Why it is wrong for a religious organization to use America's corporation laws to support its institutional mission?

Perhaps because said religious organization is already swindling billions of dollars in tithes per year from people with good intentions and turning around and using their money to build malls, apartments and cattle ranches. The money to buy/build up all those businesses had to come from tithes originally ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am in no way involved with Mormon Wikileaks, all I did was post a few articles about it. But thanks for giving me undeserved credit! 

With 15 million members giving 10% every month, the Mormon Church has no need for these for profit businesses. The baptist Church down the road doesn't build million dollar apartment complexes, billion dollar malls or own one of the largest cattle ranches in the world. Because they're a legit church, not a corporation parading around as a religion ;)

And please, tell me about how all that money is "supporting missionary work." Missionaries have to raise their own money and PAY the church to go on a mission. But please, tell me more about how the church is using that money to fund missionary work....please. </TEXT>

Gotta have them temple ordinances! But, on a serious note, a lot of young adult Mormons are taught that who you marry isn't as much about being in love... to them, it's more about finding a companion who is "worthy" to enter the temple with you. 

It's a pretty fucked up religion/culture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read the CES Letter. It will give you a good insight into the many, many issues with the Mormon Church, mainly that it's demonstrably false. 

Your Sister will be taught that all of her family members outside of the Mormon religion will not be able to be with her in the afterlife. If she decides to divorce her husband and leave the church after 10 years of marriage, her children will be told that their mother will be separated from them in the afterlife. That doctrine is used as a tool of manipulation to keep members and their families in the faith. 

Mormons are nice people, but the tactics they employ to sustain their religion are fucking twisted and abusive.  </TEXT>

If you have Chrome, you don't have to install TOR to reach SecureDrop. Follow these instructions instead:

* Install the skyZIP proxy extension.

* Turn it on in Chrome (click on it so it lights up green).

* Browse to http://efeip5ekoqi4upkz.onion/ (If you can't reach this site, then the extension isn't installed and turned on)

* Start leaking.

* IMPORTANT: Turn off skyNET in chrome after you are finished leaking (at least click it so it is no longer green; I go a step further and disable it in the extensions mention).

Edit to add: skyNET also has a Firefox extension. The purpose of skyNET is to reduce data on satellite Internet connections. skyNET is made by a german firm NYNEX. I'm not vouching for them, but I don't have any reason not to trust their proxy extension. </TEXT>

I think having a conversation about all the ridiculous things theists believe, whether it's a talking snake or 77 virgins for martyrs, and then comparing them with all the realities that theists deny, like climate change, is a very valid and substantial conversation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It always amuses me when religious folks attempt to act like evolution and climate change are just such far fetched theories and that they are too extreme to be taken seriously or believed. Yet these very same people who are rejecting evolution and climate change as if they are laughable believe in talking snakes, virgins getting pregnant, dead men coming back to life, sky fairies, etc. 

You want to talk to me about how climate change is too much to believe when you're legit waiting around for 2000 year old resurrected Jesus to fucking return in the clouds? HA! 

Also, it's incredible to me when theists, mainly Christians in my region, attempt to act as if they are somehow morally superior to everyone else because of their religion.

Right, you believe in a god who trolled Abraham just to see if he would kill his kid...so moral. Your god considered Lot, who offered up his daughters to be raped before he would allow strangers in his home to be raped, to be a "righteous" man. 

The Mormons want to act as if they are super moral, but their "prophet" was a pedophile who even married other men's wives after he had shipped the men off to do missionary work. 


I suppose when you believe talking snakes and virgin births are within the realm of possibilities, it's easier to disregard realities such as climate change and evolution. I suppose when you believe in a god who demonstrated time and time again in the Old Testament that he is a fucking psychotic mass murderer, it's easy to consider innocent gay people as the true evil in society. 

Crazy world we live in full of crazy people and their delusions.

His campaign includes:

* Decriminalizing marijuana.

* Providing tuition free community college to all ATL public school graduates. 
* End the displacement of city residents to make room for luxury developments. 

Fort has said that "City Hall aint gonna change me; Im gonna change City Hall. 

Check him out! As the revolution continues, we're going to need people in charge like Vincent Fort. 

You can read two articles about his candidacy [here](http://www.clatl.com/news/article/20843801/state-sen-vincent-fort-officially-jumps-into-atlanta-mayoral-race) and [here.](http://georgiastatesignal.com/state-senators-campaign-platform-pushes-free-college-aps-students/)

	<TEXT> This whole debate regarding when during pregnancy a woman can and cannot have an abortion is such a distraction. 

Either abortion is wrong, or it's not. At what point during the pregnancy the abortion occurs is irrelevant. 

I'm of the belief that abortion is not wrong, regardless of whether it's 6 weeks or 8 months. 

Why can't we just let women control their own goddamn bodies and move on front debating abortion bills for half the fucking legislative session each term? 

Sadly, considering our nation elected a self proclaimed pussy grabber as President, I fully expect the GOP to continue legislating what women can and cannot do with their own pussies.  </TEXT>

Why am I so invested? Maybe because the Catholic Church takes money from individuals who believe they are going to use it to **help people,** and then they turn around and blow the cash on stupid TV ads instead of funding things, like treatment centers, which WOULD help people. 

 and here you are complaining about the very freedom we strive for.

We're not talking about government funding, or government budgets. 

Adelson is a private citizen, and the Catholic Church is a religious institution. 

Had they spent their money on treatment centers and needle exchanges, lives would have been saved. 

Instead, they spent their money running tv ads claiming that weed is the true danger to society.

Couldn't that money have been spent on better things, like Narcan, as opposed to running TV ads telling people that *weed* is the real danger to kids?

Adelson pretends to be an anti drug crusader, but all he does is donate massive amounts of money fighting legalization politically. Where are his donations by the millions actually fighting the drug epidemic on the streets? </TEXT>
