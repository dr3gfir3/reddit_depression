	<TEXT> The high school tests don't seem to have the "experimental sections" like grad school tests, but wouldn't they be able to get data over the millions of test takers and multiple versions year to year? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in a state where all high school juniors take the ACT.

Some of my students will be taking it tomorrow. Considering tests such as ACT / SAT / SAT II / AP are usually proctored by teachers and are offered at schools (though grad and professional schools seem to offered at testing centers) and that many tests are multiple choice, why are standardized tests so expensive? I know there's research and development and grading costs for essays / written portions, but at $50ish per test ($90ish for AP) these tests seem pricey for what they are.
