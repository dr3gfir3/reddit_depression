	<TEXT> I believe the plan was one season of each(Daredevil, Luke Cage, Jessica Jones, Iron fist) and then get them together for the Defenders. They wanted to establish their characters before just throwing them in a team. What happened was Daredevil did so well we all cried out for a second season! Now the Punisher was so good we want more from him too. You can't rush these things.   
I'm hoping once defenders starts there won't be anymore individual series unless it's for a new character. </TEXT>

Never done a level one challenge in a game? With a little imagination the battle system in XII can create some unique situations. Try a playthroughs with just Vaan and Penelo.

Alot of people I told about the game they wrote it off as just a GTA clone but it was so much more than that. Also from what I understand it was the sawn song of the company Pandemic which is really a crime. GTA with the Assassins Creed climbing mechanics is what this world needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you joking? Batman isn't Daredevil, he has insane technology from Waynetech and other devices he's stolen from other corporations and villains. Teleportation devices exist in DC. It was a wishful thought I don't know why you're on a crusade or what your point even is. I've seen a panel before of Batman over Superman on a planet with a red sun. I thought it was pretty cool, sorry for expressing an opinion. I learned my lesson. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Never mind that, how about the fact that this game is based off of death and cycles and yet there is NO necromancy. Reanimating recently slain enemies to fight for you would be awesome. Also there should be some form of special summons when choose that path. </TEXT>
