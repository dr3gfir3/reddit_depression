	<TEXT> I'm not saying it can't be, or that they shouldn't - just that I think it's pointless. There's no one governing body of flags, so theres no actual body or institution you're taking a stance against, so it accomplishes nothing (in my opinion).  I guess I view it as quite a petulant act. Like burning a football strip because your team lost.

Back to my earlier example - if I received an unjustly high phone bill, I'd rather contest the phone company, see a lawyer, go to citizens advice, etc, than I would burn my phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but the problem with a man with a gun on his hip is that that man can snap and carry out these attacks, a society where guns aren't readily available makes it much harder.  

What do you mean by gun free zone? Like a campus? The issue there is that people typically buy or carry their gun from outwith the gun free zone and meander into the gun free zone. So I don't really think that adds any credence to your point. It's like saying the majority of speeding tickets happen in lower speed zones that have just come from a higher speed zone, therefore you shouldn't enforce a speed limit because people still speed.

I can debate all day with you but I doubt either of us will change the others mind, plus I have no vested interest in this as I live in a relatively gun (and gun crime) free country.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ?? Nice one. By that logic, you've used the word "the" a fair few times - was that on today's word of the day calendar? Deflection aside, you still didn't respond to my point? What about every other mass shooting where the perpetrator still has time to kill/injure multiple individuals before the police/an armed civilian can intervene? I'd argue you only need your police armed because your civilians are armed, and even then armed civilians do more harm than good.

Well without those statistics your point is conjecture.

	<TEXT> It doesn't say he wasn't out to hurt anyone. Also, your point is moot as there's loads of American mass shootings where, despite the abundance of guns, the response is much longer and scores of people are injured/killed. Just because all your police carry guns it doesn't mean they can physically travel any faster than anywhere else. 

Where I live the police station had a lock up with guns but nobody carries them, if there's an incident the police in the station get them and head to the scene - these are the same police who'd respond to a crime where guns aren't needed. The only difference is they don't carry them in perpetuity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you know he's straight? I don't mean that in a belittling way. I just mean, if you say you were labelled correctly by the majority of the staff, maybe some people identified you as trans - perhaps he's one of them and just doesn't care?

You have two options:

1. Tell him in advance, and if he bails, it'd have never worked out anyway?

2. Tell him after a few days but then you run the risk of him bailing once you've grown attached.  But you may change his attitude to trans people in the process!

It's a toughie... </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  this. If things are so bad and your choice is "either career or transitioning" - why don't you choose transitioning? Why don't you move abroad, somewhere where it's easier or more socially acceptable? If you have no friends, etc, you have literally nothing to lose.

I don't understand making a post to tell people you're going to kill yourself, it seems like a cry for help more than anything. I can't talk for your life or trauma you've been through, but for me, if the choice was ANYTHING I could try, or giving up, I'd try something new. Unless you're claiming to have tried every possible thing you can, them you're just throwing in the towel early.

Ps what server were you on on WOW? Wonder if we ever crossed paths! </TEXT>
