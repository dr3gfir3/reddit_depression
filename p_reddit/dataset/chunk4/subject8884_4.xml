	<TEXT> Wow. The two team F1 pictures you've drawn (this one and the UHC let's go race cars one) are my two favorite pictures from you! You've somehow managed to catch their expressions perfectly just as I imagined them. Keep up the great work! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know you don't mean harm by the comment, but different people deal with stress differently. Guardax is a great guy and worked very hard for this community and might have his own reasons and problems with taking things the way he does. We don't have to agree, but we have to at least respect his decision and not take the motive behind it lightly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to reiterate that I feel like there's nothing wrong with not being the loudest voice in the group. You're an amazing guy who is hilarious and extremely kind and respectful to others and work well in multiplayer situations. For example, your commentary during Friday Frag Fest (another thing I wouldn't miss for the world every week) or Team Ca$h Money, and your Quake Live with Coe are probably my favorite series from you 
I guess the thing is to do collabs with a smaller group of people. But maybe there's not that many problems as there are only a few big group stuff on the server once in a while. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm subscribed and watch your videos, but I tend to go with other perspectives when it comes to group events as you are usually not the most vocal of the group :/ Not that there's anything wrong with that, it's just that I would rather watch your solo/ with BTC stuff where you'd have more room to be heard.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is very well drawn! However, I do feel like the expressions coincide more with the characters of their skins than the Mindcrackers themselves. Nonetheless, they're great and adlington is particularly friggin' adorable :) </TEXT>
