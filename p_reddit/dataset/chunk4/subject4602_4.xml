	<TEXT> Idk about you, but I get some hardcore chill vibes from every song on HYF:

Force Ten
 We can move a savage grace in the rhythm of the night...

Time Stand Still
 Summers growing fast, nights growing colder...

Open Secrets
 I guess we all have the feelings...

Second Nature
 It aught to be second nature...

Prime Mover
 The bass soloish thing+the optimism in the chorus+everything about this song

Lock And Key
 We don't wanna be victims, on that we all agree...

Mission
 It's cold comfort for the ones without it...

Turn The Page
 Dat intro

Tai Shan
 The outro with everything at 100% and the clever use of a sample from Time Stand Still

High Water
 The water takes me home... </TEXT>

I know I'm going to get one some day but will I still play my Schecter? What if I love my Jazz more and my Schecter just collects dust like my Yamaha RBX-170 has? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well first off, Ged straight up said that they have demos. The first evidence of these, that I can remember, is Moving Pictures. It was posted not long ago here actually. We have one album's demos already (Power Windows) and him saying this makes me think that we may get demos. This is also brought up by the head of the company that now owns Rush's catalog saying that he's excited to get stuff out that they haven't been able to before.

Second, Al saying, "And thats why well know when were done." Just going to leave it at that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have one about Rush, specifically Alex Lifeson (the guitarist). Back before their debut album, I think sometime in 71-73, they used to play a venue that would get pretty violent and rowdy at least once a show. At this specific date, Lifeson had just got his tonsils(?) removed thus was stoned on pain killers. It still hurt though, so one of the other guys suggested that they get a little...uh...*soup* to ease the pain.

So there was a Rush show where Al was sitting in a chair, with gnaws, stoned out of his mind on pain killers and weed while watching numerous fights break out as they were extra rowdy that night.

Bonus fact: one of the songs they played that night was an early single of theirs called "You Can't Fight It".

	<TEXT> I'd like to add on to this with Promise Land which is pretty alright, but then nothing until their newest release, Condition Human. I forgot I had it on my phone and, I think it was Guardian that started playing, that made me think I had some new Dream Theater or a prog band I forgot for the first 40ish seconds. Put jabs to Tate like the line in the chorus of one song, "[R]Evolution calling" and all of the title track sounding like Suite Sister Mary. It's great and I'm excited for what's next. </TEXT>

The only band where I've kinda been able to stand it is Opeth but I prefer Heritage and Pale Communion while older albums like Blackwater Park and whatnot are still enjoyable in my eyes, it's not nearly as much as the newest two and hopefully Sorceress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not true. There's a rumor that they did it at the Massey Hall date on the CoS tour, but Alex has said somewhere that he has no memory of playing it and there has been no evidence whatsoever of it being played during that tour, in fact, the opposite really.

If it was played that'd be awesome, but I've done extensive research into it and have found that they most likely didn't play it. </TEXT>
