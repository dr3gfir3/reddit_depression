	<TEXT> First off, i think bran will see more of them and bloodraven, when he gets the chance to plug into another weirwood. Because, damn, i will be so disappointed if thats all we get to know about them and the whites. Surely theres more to come from them. 


So anyway, from what we know so far, the CotF are getting everything they deserve. Their plan to fight off the the andals(or the first men?) is to somehow create a monster to unleash onto the world? Sounds dodgy and obvsly something went badly wrong. Whatever happened in the mean time with bloodraven has led them to here, all hopes resting on Bran, who obviously has to do something important. Although for some reason they haven't told him what that is yet. Then before you know it, its too late. They didn't tell bran that he could accidentally give away his position that would allow the whites to instantly be upon them. And now they're all dead? This doesn't seem very well thought out. 


I'm really hoping there are more of them somewhere. Maybe on the isle of faces, maybe elsewhere in the north. I just can't believe they are that useless when it seems they've been planning things for a long time.  </TEXT>

More tension was added through wanting to know more about him and the CotF but time running out. I think we will learn some more, when bran finds another weirwood. Maybe no words will be said, but i can see a raven popping up and showing him the way etc.

Why was he so taken aback? What did he think woudl happen? it wasn't like a chance meeting or whatever, he had no answers at all. How about making it clear that hes offering up a massive fucking army that shes desperate for?! Seems like they twisted it competely round simply to prepare for whats to come later in the season. fucking nonsense.

	<TEXT> Its a solid theory, but you did leave out the sandsnakes, who are currently on the loose in KL and will surely have some impact. Whether through assassination or through a dornish army rocking up at some point. 


My main problem with this is the HS knows that Tommen would tell cersei everything. He also knows that the Tyrells have the biggest army by far in town and could easily wipe out his thugs, however many there are.


 All his talk from the HS about not caring about his own life etc is obviously bullshit, he wants to be the kings number 1. He needs cersei gone, so i think a double/triple cross is on the cards. Although all that will entail is a trial by combact. Throwing  a theory out there. Possibly a trial between of the lannisters vs the tyrells. Did they kill joffrey or not. </TEXT>

Not many good points on this episode imo. Very dull, yet more scene setting for the end of season episodes with frustrating things left out or unsaid.


Meereen was great, it created an odd but interesting dynamic between those characters. Kind of made last episodes little scene even more pointless tho. Ramsay is now a full on pantomime villain. 

Everyone saying that stuff has happened off screen can eat shit, cuz Davos still didn't (still doesnt really) know what happened to stannis and shireen etc. Unashamedly terrible writing. 

The letter scene. The less said the better. Jesus christ, compare that to the book! Its like they gave up trying to match it, so just sat them round a table. 


Dany is now a full on pyschopath. This may well be the start of show dany finding her targ routes, by becoming a ruthless, genoicide loving pyromaniac.  </TEXT>

IMO there is a mass of evidence for the umbers using Rickon to trick Ramsay. It makes sense of their otherwise inexplicable actions. HOWEVER, the show has time and time again has shown us that logic and reason and things making sense, mean absolutely fuck all.

 Ramsay has been 'gifted' with absurd plot devices throughout the show, so i have very low hopes for this conspiracy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i'm really not sure what to make of Kevan atm. He is instantly likeable for his 'i'm not taking any shit from you' attitude, and has some brilliant put downs to cersei. But is he actually doing a very good hand.....uh......job?



Ahem.



Reluctantly keeping this show based. And maybe the answer to this is (frustratingly a more common occurence in GoT) we will have to guess the rest of the story so it makes sense, and never see what he's actually done as hand. However, so far, he doesn't seem to be that great at it? I mean, the queen is forcibly locked away at the hands of religious militants in the kings own city. Along with the queens brother. A Tyrell family, who not only seems to feed the capital if not a large part of westeros(?), but also has the largest army sat around doing bugger all. Kevans own blood, as cersei rightly put it, was murdered how long ago now? With the distinct possibility of an instant war with Dorne and a direct threat to tommens life. Still no action.
 As far as they are aware the Boltons have done the dirty marrying sansa, uniting the north. What news from the wall is reaching them? as they don't seem concerned at all about either the wildlings or the whites. 


How long before he takes action?

I think she will somehow put Tommens life in serious danger, and not try to help him as she thinks his death is enevitable anyway. Jaime to the rescue, probs killing her in the process.


Although i think cersei will have turned on Jaime by then anyway, as she is starting to in the books. In the show its not happened yet but with the riverlands story coming up, its probs set to. In the show Jaime is indirectly responsible for the deaths of how many lannisters? He killed his cousin, was kingsguard when joff died, let Tyrion out who killed Tywin and did (could do) nothing to save Myrcella. In show Cersei should already hate him, and i don't think it will be long before she cracks.  </TEXT>

Its infuriating how they build up characters, plots, in order for you to give a crap about them, but then instantly drop every ounce of logic surrounding that, in order to push their nonsensical story forward. Or more likely, for shock value.  </TEXT>

Haralds reaction was ridiculous unless he was in on it somehow and for some reason. It still doesn't explain why Roose would taunt him, but hey, its the show. 


I hope your right, but i'm not sure the show cares enough to perform intricacies like this anymore. It would go someway to explaining the apparent plot holes though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Ramsay bastard snow just stabbed his daddy to death infront of Rooses long serving maester and the head of the Karstarks, their biggest ally (in terms of numbers), to become Lord Ramsay Bolton. Shit move son. To celebrate this, he then feeds walda, walders niece(?) and son to the dogs. Seriously Ramsay, you're not one for politics are you. 



Now i have many problems with this. One, is that i really like Roose Bolton, in the show and moreso in the book he is absolutely ruthless. I'm sure many book enthusiasts will have a problem with how ridiculous this scene is too, but this is the show, so i'm going to try and take this on show terms only. 




Ramsay is a maniac. Roose is fully aware of the shit he gets up to and even specifically cites the 'games' he's played during this scene. So why constantly taunt him? Other than to shove the obvious foreshadowing down the viewers throats, this makes no sense. Roose is a smart man, he knows how crazy Ramsay is and what he could gain from killing his newborn or himself. This is an unnecessary plothole in my eyes. 

.

However, continuing on imagining that this move makes writing sense, Ramsay should now have put himself in a really really shit position. Roose Bolton, who united northern and allied with the Freys, to take the north from the Starks is now dead. Ramsay, the well known nutcase, is now running things. Walda Frey is dead, Walder Frey is not an idiot. Ok, lets say no one knows how she died, somehow no one saw them or heard the screams or had to clear up the body. Or lets say that Walder simply doesn't care, which is passable. But he certainly won't do any favours for Ramsay, anyone riding north (say an army pissed at the boltons) will have free reign. 

The now head of house Karstark just witnessed the death of the warden of the north at the hands of his son and apparently couldn't care less. Either this makes no sense, or Harald is way smarter than his dad. Going against Ramsay in this situation would certainly end him, so best to keep quiet, but damn, he was cool about it. But really, what reason has he to continue to work with Ramsay now, a known lunatic? Someone who, even knowing that the Lannisters are likely coming for them, just decided it would be a good idea to attack castle black? If i were a Harald i would be planning a return home with all my troops as quick as i could. The same could be said of the Whitehalls, who we don't know much about, except they are long allies with the Boltons.  The main point here being that Ramsay is a known by all, now beyond doubt, to be an irrational pyschopath. Even if they didn't suspect Ramsay of killing Roose, which would unavoidably come out, they all have reason to mistrust Ramsay and doubt his ability to rule. Remembering, they are now supposed to be in Ramsays service. 



Maester Wolkan the Bolton Maester, would know all about Ramsay. Its safe to say that he would be slightly unerved if not a little agrieved at Rooses death by his bastard son. Another bad move by Ramsay is not to kill him immediately. I'll be amazed, even for the show, if he doesn't send some ravens informing other maesters of what has happened. 


.


What comes of all this i guess we'll wait and see. Even if the trailer for ep3 gives us a clue, i cannot see how any of the other houses or Rooses men would stay loyal to him. Whether they ignore this and just run with it, or he loses troops making winterfell vulnerable, theres a few plot points here that don't add up.

I agree though, disappointed with that convo. Its maddening, but they do it all the time. The conversations shown are just enough to push their plot along rather than being a realistic discussion.
