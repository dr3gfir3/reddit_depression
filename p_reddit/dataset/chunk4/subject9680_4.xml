	<TEXT> I just think vaping is a disgusting habit and in my experience, there's a big trashy culture of people really into vaping that goes along with it in my area. I personally don't smoke or drink but am generally more accepting of people who home brew or make their own wines. It's not a knock on people who in general make their own products at home.  </TEXT>
