	<TEXT> Holy shit, did you date my ex? See my post history. He dumped me when I got cancer and afterward I found out he'd been engaged to someone else. He also played mind games and harassed me demanding my forgiveness and later said he'd already forgiven himself. 

People like this are hopeless. It's actually very sad and pathetic ... for them. You need to understand that he attacked you again because YOU WON. You moved on with your life, did better things, and he can't stand it. I guarantee you he's lying about both the cancer and the dog. He knew the dog story would upset you and he used it like a weapon because that's how these people operate.

The only winning move is to not play his game. Keep being awesome and count your lucky stars that you escaped this psychopath.  </TEXT>
