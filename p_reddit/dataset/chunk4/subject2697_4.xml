	<TEXT> That's fair. I think of the ACA as a bandaid. And costs really were spiraling out of control already. Keep in mind that a lot of what's driving up costs is that a lot more people can actually afford healthcare. Before, they couldn't afford to go to the doctor. We lived in a society where it was relatively inexpensive for someone with insurance because the pool was those that could afford it. Now the pool is bigger. Someone's gotta take that burden. The public option would have heavily mitigated this, but alas.   </TEXT>

Reconciliation couldn't fix this due to the Byrd rule, because the amendments you're suggesting would fall under entitlements. You'd need the 60 votes, and Scott Brown winning Massachusetts was the straw that killed the attempt to force the amendments later. Keep in mind Republicans signed a fucking pledge to get Grover Norquist's money refusing to increase taxes. Even if it was for something as beneficial to every American as healthcare reform. They couldn't stand the idea of Obama being the guy who saved healthcare, so they gutted it, shat on it, and Dems salvaged what they could, but it was lost. Dems only had a supermajority for a few weeks and Harry Reid and Obama ignorantly thought that they could get Republicans on board. The level of obstruction was literally impossible to foresee unless you go in assuming Republicans are racist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obamacare makes relatively healthy people skip preventative care because of the cost, it's shit because insurance companies were involved forcing us to pay for shit we'll never need and not capping costs.  

Preventive care is free under Obamacare. Diagnosis is not. Getting a physical is free. Getting a physical but then mentioning something unrelated will lead to the visit being charged as a normal diagnostic visit. Interestingly, this is because doctors figured out how to ask questions to change the visit from a wellness check to a diagnostic visit, allowing them to bill it differently. One of those protections that was stripped out of the bill. I'll admit I don't like it either, but people put far too much blame on Obamacare and not nearly enough on the fuckwits upcharging for the same services and blaming Obama. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Insurance companies are leaving Michigan, so there's less competition, driving up prices. Had there been a public option like the Dems wanted, the premium spikes wouldn't have been nearly so severe.

In recent years, however, premiums have jumped  including by 17% in the last year as the number of insurers offering plans has declined. In many cases, those increases are covered by federal subsidies,reducing the impact on individuals  but those subsidies must be borne by taxpayers.

http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2017/03/13/obamacare-replacement-hits-michigans-working-poor-hardest/99142552/

Keep in mind that even with these jumps in premiums, if there was no ACA, premiums would have been far higher. 

http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-premiums-20160726-snap-story,amp.html

Forbes has a dissenting article that's worth reading, but I think it delves too far into the way it was without really looking at projections. 

https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/07/28/overwhelming-evidence-that-obamacare-caused-premiums-to-increase-substantially/amp/

Finally, over a million more people in Michigan have insurance that didn't have it before. For some these people, who can now afford healthcare and were previously going without, this is life or death. Remember that one of the biggest changes in the ACA was an insurer couldn't deny coverage on the basis of preexisting conditions. Prior to enactment, you could be dropped for having whatever the insurer defined as a preexisting condition. Your premiums have gone up, but people you know with cancer and *diabetes* can now afford healthcare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What state are you in/who do you work for? I can almost guarantee it's because either your state is fucking you over or your company is because they didn't like the bill to begin with. They "can't afford" the hit so they're passing it on to you. Which is obviously wrong. 

Face it we're paying more for monthly rates and getting extremely shittier coverage, it used to be a viable option to visit the ER if there was an issue. Now it's wait till the Dr is open on Monday since it will cost close to $3k to just walk into the ER. 

Well, maybe don't go to the ER unless you have an actual emergency. Shit like that was viable, but definitely contributed to the costs spiraling out of control. 

Not to mention all the increased paperwork we have to keep track of and keep on file with our Dr. 

That was going to happen no matter what as doctors are trying to integrate all records systems so patient care can go from doc to doc and things don't get missed in the records. We started upgrading our systems right around when the ACA was implemented, so makes sense that they're conflated, but they're not really related. This additional paperwork does have a purpose.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was working in the Senate at the time. Healthcare was my issue. I read the entire bill front to back several times as I'd often get asked about particular sections by constituents. My favorites were the ones that would say they've read the whole thing and talk about a specific provision that I knew didn't exist. So I'd ask them to tell me where it is, but they couldn't, but they were sure it was in there because of Fox News and a small but growing outfit known as Breitbart. One of the darkest days in my office was when the public option died. The three of us on healthcare (me, an LC, and an LA) along with a couple other interns who had worked their asses off promoting this thing were given 30 minutes to mope by the Chief of Staff, then it was back to work.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That tracks. Georgia turned down the federal subsidies that were offered to the states to prevent/mitigate exactly what happened to you. Keep in mind this was essentially free money from the Feds to reign in healthcare costs and Georgia said no. Most of the people who report their premiums rising like yours did live in states that refused the subsidies. The ACA itself didn't hurt you (though it originally had protections against this that were stripped by Republicans in 2009). It's Georgia refusing to implement it properly and turning down money as a fuck you, in addition to the insurance companies taking advantage of this, that's biting you. 

Source: Worked in the Senate when the ACA was passed, my job was to know what was in it and communicate that to constituents. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They said they'd vote for it if those protections were removed (in many cases, Republicans were the ones drafting the amendments that were stripping the bill of protections from industry abuse). Then they said they couldn't vote on it. 

Also, in this specific case, OP's state of Georgia refused federal subsidies that would have offset his costs. The problem is with insurance companies and his idiotic state government, not the ACA.  </TEXT>

"This is a disappointing day for us. Doing big things is hard, he added. All of us, all of us  myself included  will need to time to reflect on how we got to this moment.

Ryan said he would be conferring with fellow Republicans about how to proceed in the coming days, but he warned that were going to be living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.

Mr. Trump, in a telephone interview moments after the bill was pulled, blamed Democrats and predicted that they would seek a deal within a year after, he asserted, Obamacare explodes because of higher premiums. The president said he did not fault Mr. Ryan and said that he was pleased to move past his first legislative fight. He maintained that he was merely going along with the House bill.

No, Trump. This is your failure. You get to own this along with Ryan and the rest of the GOP.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uses the ideal gas law to spectacular effect. PV=nRT. From this you see that pressure (P) and temperature (T) are directly proportional. Therefore, by increasing pressure using a fixed volume container and a liquid that will expand as it gets hotter (phase change), you naturally increase the pressure. Normally as you increase temperature in an open container like a sauce pot, this won't happen and the liquid will evaporate (decreasing "n" or the amount of stuff in the container). "T" is inversely proportional to "n" (and in case you're curious, "R" is the constant and doesn't matter for our purposes, but is PV/nT).

So in a pressure cooker, you have a situation where P must increase, due to the liquid becoming a gas in the sealed container after it rises above its boiling point (assume 100C or 212F and the liquid is water, it'll be around there anyway). Because the pressure is increasing at temperatures over 100C, and pressure and temperature are directly proportional, you don't need the temperature to be as high to cook the food in the same amount of time (so you can achieve "high temperature effects" with food at a lower temperature that would typically burn at a higher temperature in an open container). Furthermore (and more to the point of how a pressure cooker is used) if you raise the temperature to the level at which you usually cook the food, it will require less time to cook than it normally would at that temperature. This is not ideal for things that already don't require a lot of time, like sauting or frying, but it's useful for something like stock or soup or braising, where you hold a thing at temperature for a long time to extract flavor or break it down. 

Going back to rice, by putting it under pressure, you can cook it much faster. This is basically a more extreme version of putting the lid on the pot and letting it simmer till done. Also, due to the nature of a pressure cooker, it's nearly impossible to screw it up and overcook the rice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 57-year-old radio jock allegedly filled out ex-wife Kelly Curtis' mail-in ballot for the 2016 presidential election, forged her signature  and then stuck it in the mail, the criminal complaint states.

. . . 

Curtis' ex inadvertently tipped off elections officials to the potential fraud when she called from her new home in South Carolina to find out if she could vote there while still registered in Colorado.

"Ms. Curtis called to ask how she could vote and an election worker informed Ms. Curtis that her voter record had shown she already returned her mail ballot," Weld County Clerk and Recorder Carly Koppes wrote in an email to NBC News.

Koppes, who is also a Republican, wrote they alerted the authorities after concluding "the signature was questionable."

He's looking at 3 years jail and a $5,000 fine. Hypocritical moron.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lawyer hired by the family of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian whistleblower who died in jail, has been injured in a fall from his Moscow apartment.

Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, reportedly plunged from his-fourth floor apartment Tuesday as a crane was lifting a large bathtub into his home. He is now in hospital with serious head injuries, according to a statement from William Browder, Magnitskys former employer at the Hermitage Capital Management firm.

Gorokhov was due to represent Magnitskys mother Wednesday in a Moscow court and is a witness in a U.S. money laundering case.

Either there's a long string of *really* unfortunate coincidences or some highly shady shit is going down.   </TEXT>
