	<TEXT> Yeah we think this haunting is localized to the ground underneath.  In addition to some residual elements but mostly Poltergeist related. I say that knowing other root causes are still being ascertained. http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/SEP-certification2_zpsejh0tu96.jpg </TEXT>

Suffice to say they left with a lot of info. The US teams just concluded their investigation last week and left with data as well. There is a land element to it thats being researched and explored.

It was two months ago Keith Linder (Seattle) got in touch. He claimed he was being subject to paranormal phenomena in his home. He claimed his home was haunted.
Previously many people had attempted to assist Keith, nothing seemed to work and not even an exorcism made any difference as the disturbances would continue. A TV show who used Keith's story for one of their episodes concluded " there was no evidence". 

Determined to prove his home was haunted he turned to Don Philips and Parapsychologist Steve Mera for help from the UK. 
Prior to their arrival Don had promised Keith if his home was haunted he would show it to be, this Don managed to do with minimum effort on his part. Becky was amazing, with her vocals witnessed coming straight out of the air on x3 occasions. 
Both Fox and a reporter were also witness and testimony to the voices of those unseen.

During this visit the vale between paranormal separated during a visit to another location away from Keith's. Top tier a supernatural occurrence transpired between Don and a very negative force which even took Steve Mera out of his comfort zone during a visit to a Native Indian burial ground.. Further details on this may be released later but at this point that has not yet been decided.




Don has a sustained reputation for evidence gathering and his communications with the unseen. With the first 10 minutes of arriving at Keith's the spirits began to engage with him. Day one was focused on preparation for the investigation but although the investigation hadn't began vocal responses where captured by Don. Each following day the evidence accumulated and Steve Mera and Don would analyse it.
Despite what was stated in the past, we can confirm that Keith's home was host to genuine paranormal activity.

This clip is only a behind the scenes look at the media coverage side of things and is not intended to highlight evidence. Further evidence will become available shortly.

We would also like to thank Keith Linder for his hospitality   Patty for her assistance, both made us very welcome and our stay comfortable. This was the first time we had visited the US and it won't be the last, we plan a return visit in the near future.. In the meantime a full documentary of The Bothell Poltergeist is currently underway. Further more Don Philips has assured Keith that at the time of their visit, there was no negative entity dwelling there.

The out of sync audio and skipping video footage has been left as is. This has never occurred before and the cause remains a mystery, camera diagnostics came back without issue.

Follow Our Journey On Phenomena Project via the website / Facebook. We have been asked to investigate strange occurrences in Romania next.. Thank you for supporting this project. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  This is the attention I've been trying to raise and introduce to the Paranormal community for 3 years. 4 years in fact. The one Ghost Adventures took light of and missed.

S.E.P and the Phenomena Project. Both UK based flew to Seattle and investigated the house for 5 days. Averaging 19 hrs each day. Left with tons of evidence.

When complete it will be made public to the world.

	<TEXT> Agreed. Fr. Roy even said Exorcisms or religious rituals generally dont work on Poltergeists.  Thats not to say a Poltergeist is stronger than a demon. No one can kill a demon. An exorcism when applied successfully does not kill or murder a demon. It just vanishes it. An exorcism on a Poltergeists simply wont vanish it because we know so little about why its there in the 1st place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats a fair question.  Its been said and I believe this 100% with the activity heightened as it was in 2014. Not now and now for the majority of 2015. But 2014 activity was heightened moving out at that time would not mitigate the problem. Matter of fact it would make it worse. It would follow us and haunt both houses.  Thats a strong possibility. 2nd reason and it might be a wrong reason but its my reason and I will die by it.  I believe in God and his Christ. I'm no saint by any stretch of the imagination. I have my faults. My sins. But neither played a role in me getting this house. This is my 1st house. It took my whole life to get a house like this. The house is a beautiful home. I can't attest to the events prior be it the land the house was built on or the people who came before me. All I can attest is to myself, and my girlfriend. We worked hard for this house. Me especially. Running just seems to knee jerk too easy.

Doesn't mean I havent been sh* less. I have. We have. But being scared out of your mind can only do two things for you. Loose your mind or Deepen your faith.  I chose the ladder.

Obviously if I had children or pets. This would be a different scenario.  But its just me and my GF.  GF not wife. And I asked her does she want to stay. I'm staying or better yet if I leave I'm leaving on my own terms not the terms of the Ghost, Demon, or Poltergeists.

But it has not been easy and that decision weighs on me daily. Now that the house is quite I can breath a little bit and share this true story. But when we're being attacked. Being tormented. Its extremely hard. Emotionally and mentally.

And lastly when I do leave. I want to provide the next home owner information I didnt have. odds are the next home owner will have children. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes contacting the previous tenants was something I began doing in 2012, and finally succeeded in 2014.  5 families have lived in the house prior to us.  One came forward and stated the house for them was "crazy" and a "living hell" I was able to catch up with them after I got their mail. I then found her on Facebook. Below is a tidbit of that conversation.

Keep in mind the violence has subsided for the most part. We did dial back the cams and the Christian elements AFTER WE realized it might be and is a Poltergeist vs. a Demon.  The evidence and the patterns just point to Poltergeist and Poltergeist are notorious for fighting back at you with your own weapons perse. That and the previous tenants comments sort of helped us reach that conclusion. There is still noises, knocks, occasional door opening and closing by itself.  The violence has subsided.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been moment of fear.  GF was scratched 3 times.  We've woken up and discovered the sheets underneath us ripped to shreds.  On the time line you will see Jan 2013 I had a fall.  We never attributed the fall to the ghost because by Jan 2014 all the 2012 had subsided. But when the entity came back March/April just weeks after i finally mended from a patella tear knee surgery the thought or idea got revisited.  It was a bad fall. I fell from the top stair of my home. It took 4 ambulances to get me out of the house I'm 6"5 1/2.  1st 3 vehicles were just to small.  But anyways the other moments of fear are the rib cage pokes while sleeping.  The feeling of your personal space being invaded-something invisible standing very close to you.  When lights go off during while showering and the door slams-yeah those are very nerve wrecking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello "getinthegoddamcar" The workings of Poltergeists whole heartedly resemble the workings of an angry teenager or human period. The name Poltergeists means "Noisy Ghost"  aka Poltergeist a ghost or other supernatural being supposedly responsible for physical disturbances such as loud noises and objects thrown around. Example:  http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2975035/Poltergeist-maliciously-terrorised-home-four-months-writing-threatening-messages-hurling-knives-bullets-rooms-attempts-exorcise-FAILED.html </TEXT>

As I mentioned before when events began to happen early you ignore, shrug off, scratch your head, and then the WTF moment occurs. An object levitates or gets thrown.  

Then comes the moment where we begin reaching out to friends, co-workers(sensitive to this subject matter) church, clergy and friends.

The links, photos, videos below are the reactions the Poltergeist gave us to us carrying out others suggestions. Many of these suggestions people heart was in the right place. Its important that I mention that.

1st Bible burning
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140331_021627889.jpg

All the lights in the hallway(ceiling) were yanked out. Wires exposed and the glass light fixture-exploded
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140329_233000205.jpg

Floor beneath the exploding light fixture. Thats a Bible on the ground. This Bible in the coming days would be burned. For now its just thrown off the book shelf and all bulbs and glass exploded. All at once. Mind you.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140329_232954380_1.jpg

Broken Glass/Light Dome Fixture or Disk Shaped I should say.
About a 1.2 inch thick. 3 of them in the hallway exploded

2nd Bible Burned
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140406_114946652.jpg
Went missing off the hall book shelf. Found hours later on the kitchen island-scortched

Shredded Bible on the hallway floor. Interesting enough the black wire you see is a wire to a hallcam. The camera did not catch the event unfolding.  Power loss to the hallway and office happened prior or must have happened prior.
http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140601_155025158.jpg

I know because when I came home 3-4 black printer papers was in my printer tray.  Pwr loss triggers the printer to print test pages.

This is my hallway on a typical day. Minus the hammer present.  Bible on the shelf. A candle(white candle) and a Sage tray.  We pray, recite the Lords prayer and keep the Bible open typically to Psalms or Proverbs.

This Bible is now missing . But it has been manipulated as the next link will show.

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/IMG_20140701_220119775.jpg
see the Bible. The chair has been split in half and the stem rested on the Bible. Open Bible mind you.
Upside down cross written on the wall. The cross that was in the hallway on the wall is stabbed into the office wall.

The entity took the sage stick and with the ash end wrote a upside down cross on the office floor.  Many sage sticks go missing. Some has self lit themselves.

Hallway. Bible, cross and prayer documents are thrown on the floor. Cross , Bible and prayer documents are now missing

(FYI) That step ladder is the step ladder BUMPS paranormal team witnesses being teleported. Its listed in their report.


See the hole in the hallway, middle left of the pic.  The scattered debris on the floor is a sage tray. Went projectile, was launched and lodged into the wall.  The stem left that hole. Tray exploded on impact. I was in my office when this happened. Objects travel like missiles

Cross hung above every doorway in the house. This is the same cross that was inside the 1st Bible when it caught fire. This cross came from Jerusalem. Its now missing. Look closer u can see the burned edges

same night we came home to discover weird puddles of water on the kitchen floor.

Advised by some to keep buckets of water mixed with salt in every room.  This plate and the water therein would get tossed and thrown

http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Oct16th_BedroomD.jpg

This Bible is now missing. You've seen it in the office.
Its wet because the bucket of water we had in the bedroom was poured over it.  I was in the shower. when I got out the shower this Bible was in the doorway soaking wet. The bucket of salt water was missing or empty I should say. Plate would later get thrown and destroyed and the Bible is now missing.

Same cross that went missing and re-appeared in the washing machine while on. This was Halloween night. Same night cross on the wall was burned. Same night the puddles of water appeared

Look closely you can tell how much of it we actually used.

Cross and Biblical card thats hung above the bedroom door is taken. is missing and is replaced with "Die KL"  Necklace was given by friend who ventured to a Indian Reservation while in Arizona on vacation.  Necklace is a means for protection. The card was given to me a patron inside a Christian Bible store.  No one knows the ink or solution used to write "Die KL."

A paranormal team watching and monitoring the home 24/7 even with me there or when I'm at work or out of town on business finally get the best lead of all this apparition posted up on the masterbedroom door.

GF and myself were raised in the Baptist church. Deep southern roots Such roots you cling to when something albeit remote and usual occurs.   Things suggested by friends, family, paranormal teams and clergy include saging, house blessing, cleansing, spraying holy water, anointment of house and ourselves. This and more we tried and with the addition to the cameras and video cams. Activity spiked and took off.

That too some speaks of Poltergeist. I end with  quote of Fr. Roy. The priest who did the 1st exorcism on the house and who is still engaged with the case.

"  I do think that what is left is probably poltergeist.  I think the Native American spirit or demon is gone or at least placated.
 
Peace,
 
Roy"
