	<TEXT> The scandal is that the small business owners in large part were people that already supported the Conservative Party. Labour could have done the same thing asking small business owners that were on its mailing list to sign a petition then get it printed on the front page of The Mirror. 

The problem is that this is a front-page story but it isn't news. The 5000 figure is impressive but arbitrary. It doesn't prove that small businesses would be better under a conservative-led government.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If this election campaign has seen anything change, its the credibility of The Telegraph. In 2010, the paper had a great broadsheet reputation having recently released expenses files. Now its little more than a Tory rag. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why isn't 'astronomy' called 'space geography'? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The stars are only as mysterious and wonderfying as they are because we think astronomy are for nerds (ie scientists). On the other hand, geography is not taken seriously and it needs to raise its profile. 

'Space geography' accurately reflects  the actual nature of the subject (ie study of the extraterrestrial). It adds so much more perspective and it sounds good too.

	<TEXT> If Kate gives birth in the next week or so, the conservative-supporting papers will go mental (Daily Mail, Telegraph, Sun, Times). That would drown out political splashes, which would downplay the idea that Labour could be backed up by the SNP. If such a prospect isn't perceived such much as a catastrophe, the Tories one and only attack line will be redundant. 

Do you think this could be a significant factor in the general election campaign, how do you think Murdoch will react? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it were the case that voting SNP would be the best way to replace a Tory-led government with a lasting progressive administration, why would a man who told his journalists that ["the 'future of company' depends on stopping Miliband becoming PM"?](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/election-2015-murdoch-tells-sun-future-company-depends-stopping-miliband-becoming-pm-1497507) have our best interests at heart when he backs Sturgeon?

	<TEXT> There was a similar scam that was big in Britain last year. While libertarians can't morally object to him trying to make money by deceiving people, the fact that he's using his name as a congressman to make money makes you question how ideologically pure his crusade really was...
