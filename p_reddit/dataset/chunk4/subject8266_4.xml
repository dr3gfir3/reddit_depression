	<TEXT>  I never lost interest merely because the character was black

I didn't lose interest when the character wasn't Latino, but I woulda read one if there were one when I was a kid. I don't think the idea is to exclude all other books at the expense of representations of POC, but to make sure if a kid wants to read about a kid like him, he could. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article:  
  
**"The CCBC tracks how many books are published by and about people of color every year. Since 1994, it has had categories for black, Latino, Native American and Asian Pacific Americans, who make up a combined 38 percent of the population."**  
  
Plus, babies in the US is about [50% POC](http://www.npr.org/sections/ed/2016/07/01/484325664/babies-of-color-are-now-the-majority-census-says), so a growing diversity in children's literature would be appropriate. Children like to see their experiences reflected in their literature. Nothing wrong with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It turns out some people are interested in books that reflect their experiences. Black kids wanna read about black kids, latino kids want to read about latino kids, etc. If the population is 40% non-white, but 90% of the books available reflect a white experience...it might be frustrating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) I can almost guarantee you're not going to be an exclusive audiobook consumer. You're gonna find yourself with some time on your hands and want to get engrossed. But you don't want to just sit there and listen. You're gonna pick up a book, maybe the same book, but maybe a different book. You're gonna have one audio, and one physical book going. As far as being a good writer, being a good reader is essential, but it isn't exclusively required. What matters most of all is how much time you devote to the craft of writing.  
  
2) I prefer both, and do both. </TEXT>
