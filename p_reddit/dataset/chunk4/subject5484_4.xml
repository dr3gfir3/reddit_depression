-inequality is the source of most societal ills (everywhere), and it is more affordable and just to address these issues than to just leave the poor to fester

-you should be free to do and live however you want if you're not hurting others.  Even if it's not how I would live, I have no business trying to legislate or limit the freedoms and lifestyle choices of others.

-my country has a gun problem.  No ifs and or buts about it.  While that doesn't mean I'd ban guns, the people who want them need to be part of a solution rather than just a stone wall. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, and I think Flynn's motivations can be analyzed in a similar way.

Based on what we know right now, Flynn is almost certainly going to go to jail.

Either:

a) He's defecting and going to turn over everything on Trump and his administration.  He is at least historically a Democrat, so this is possible.

b) He's trying to help Trump and his administration by falling on his sword and using the immunity offer to see how much evidence there is against Trump and his cronies.  If they already have the goods, then there's no point in giving him immunity.  Also, if he gets jailed but Trump avoids prosecution, then he's gonna get pardoned down the road anyway.

c) He's desperate, knows he's going to jail, and is trying to get immunity out of self-interest simply because there's nothing else he can do.

I hope it's a), but I'm afraid that's too optimistic in this shitstorm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, it's funny you ask cuz I haven't lived there for 20 years. ^^

At the same time I know it's there via friends and that it's always been the better part of America over McDonald's and Hollywood.

But let me have a whack at it:  In Chicago, there's an ongoing production at a place above a funeral parlor called the Neo-Futurarium.  It's 30 plays performed in 60 minutes.  You get a menu of each skit name and then the audience screams out which one they want next.  You roll dice to see how much you pay to enter, and  if they sell out, they order out free pizza for the audience.  Every week they roll a die, and next week there will be that many new sketches in the production.

It's cool, fun and done by people who love what they're doing more so than becoming millionaires.  IOW by true Americans that the world seldom sees.

This may be less than street cred in Toronto, but I worked with the brother of the singer in Broken Social Scene. </TEXT>

The British are not so "keen" on being asked "how are you?" all the time.

They're more reserved, and you only ask that to your friends.

This is all good and clear that they want their space.

Then, you go out drinking with them for an evening, and the next day they're calling you "mate".

O.O

And I'm like, yeah, I might have blacked out at some point after 15 pints but I don't remember the part where we became "mates".

And then they're all like "Relax, I'm just taking the piss out of you."

And I'm like the fuck you are!  I'm not into water sports, so just stand the fuck over there.  What time is my flight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was a major mistake when the mandatory taping of everything said in the White House was ended.

It provided such a vivid and enriching window into history and truly put country before administration.

At much the same time, if we still had it, it would add a level of accountability that we lost when it ended.

Nixon was far more candid in the oval office than he was out in public, and the taping only made it harder for him to pull off his crimes.

And while I'm far from a fan, he was better than the current president on pretty much every level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Money can buy you security.

If you're poor (or in debt), not being financially secure can be a source of immense stress.

Don't get me wrong.  Escaping poverty and debt is a great feeling, but there's a difference between feeling secure and feeling happy.

Once you're financially secure, money has far more possibilities, but there are few clear options in terms of what will buy you happiness.

People get lost in the labyrinth of consumerism buying stuff that they think will make them happy.  And consumerism is just the adult version of childhood Christmas.  Every year you get all of those new toys and you're buzzing with all the new things to play with.  Come March, the buzz is gone and you probably already want a bunch of new crap that has come out.  That money-oriented happiness is very fleeting.

Go camping

Go on a trip

Take up a new hobby

Explore a current hobby further

Learn something new

Learn a new skill

Help other people

Be kind to other people

Spend quality time with friends and family

These things cost very little, make you feel better about yourself, and generate something criminally underrated: fond memories.  Of all the toys you got for Christmas, how many of them resulted in a fond memory beyond opening up the present?  Maybe a few, but most probably not.

So again, money is very important if you don't have enough.  Our culture seduces people into thinking that we never have enough and always need more.  But more seldom buys happiness so much as it breeds a desire for more.

And then let us return to the original statement about poor kids.  FFS let their families have health care and stop letting those who are beyond financially secure yap on about how we can't afford to do so.  We're not giving those kids money to spend on whatever, we're helping them achieve security, and those who are not poor or in debt can still get a sense of satisfaction that this government spending may not be buying happiness, but it's buying the second best thing: relief.

I've been poor and in debt.  I'm not now, but money has always been more about security than me being happy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crispbread inspiration? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've gotten into eating a slow carb diet (as opposed to low carb, only eat wholegrains).  With fluffy loaves of white bread now a thing of the past, I have to say I really enjoy eating crispbread, and wanted to ask for new ideas about how people use it.

My obvious mainstay is simply as a cracker substitute.  I dip and scoop into soups and stews.

My innovation is inside out sandwiches.  Because crispbread is so crumbly, it doesn't work well in the position traditional bread does, so I apply/wrap my sandwich ingredients around the crispbread, which is now in the middle.

I'd love to eat more of it, and hope y'all have other ideas about how to incorporate it into cooking. </TEXT>

Nowhere but here.

Really, the Dems lost by the slimmest margin imaginable, and look at what's going on.

To win again, the Dems need to a) show that they aren't a bunch of Russian buttnuggets and b) show that their interests are in country before party.

That's all they need to do.  They could still screw it up, but I sense that this presidency is going to push Fox and anyone else who blindly supports it back into the cave from which they sprang. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not that I don't want them, but I also don't consider it mandatory to have them.

Put another way, I respect the premise of having kids too much to just "go for it".

-haven't met the right person

-enjoy my life as it is

-grew up surrounded by divorce in both my and my friends families

-I require myself to settle down into one place and successfully nurture a pet before trying to raise another human being

-can always adopt; there are more kids than families to raise them properly

But bottom line: If someone doesn't have kids and doesn't want to, leave them alone and do not harangue them to have kids.

It's their business, not yours.

I don't care if you're a mom, a dad, a sister, an uncle, or some government official.  You are not entitled to pressure people to have kids.

Just in case anyone missed the key point:

Anyone having kids is the business of those who choose or choose not to.

If you're unhappy about someone else's choice, go adopt another kid for yourself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ahh the 80s...They look so cartoonish now, but yet it was all so serious then.

Politics:  People were in the bliss about Ronnie while he shot us into the deficit stratosphere.  There was this continuous imminent sense that WW3 would break out and result in total nuclear war.  Three very different movies cover this very well:  The Day After, Threads, and Testament.  Threads wins.

Music:  New Wave in the early 80s and hair bands in the late 80s.  The summer of '83 was a great summer for music, and I spent nearly every day at the local pool swimming and listening.  Duran Duran, Safety Dance, Electric Avenue, Every Breath You Take.  Half of the 80s classics came from that summer.  The fall would give way to Michael Jackson, Madonna, and Prince on the rise.  At the other end of the spectrum, Def Leppard would kick things off, then Van Halen, Motley Crue, ACDC and Aerosmith would make a resurgence only to be topped by Poison, Bon Jovi, and Guns N Roses.

A focus on outlandish production led many 70s class acts astray into far cheesier territory.  Clapton and Genesis come to mind first, but there are many more.  I love the Ramones, and I love the anti-Reagan sentiment of Bonzo Goes to Bitburg, but I hate that the lead-in features hand bells...

That all said, I would only come into contact with my favorite music from the 80s in the 90s:  My Bloody Valentine, The Pixies, The Cure, and the golden age of hip hop.

Movies:  Blockbusters came of age, as did sequels.  This amazing thing called a VCR meant you could watch all of this at home, and there would be lines at the local video rental shop every holiday weekend.  You definitely were meant to rent.  The first time after we bought a VCR, I recall going to the video shop and seeing Raiders of the Lost Ark on sale for $85.

In terms of actual movies, Lucas and Spielberg dominated in a time before more critical lenses got focused on both of them.  David Lynch was the indie darling who made edgier things like Blue Velvet and Wild at heart.

TV: The earliest 80s stuff truly embraced some serious redneck culture.  Believe it or not, BJ and the Bear was a TV show, not some kind of homoerotic porn.  Truckers!  Smokey and the Bandit was about driving a truck full of beer across the country while being chased by the cops.  People loved it.  The Dukes of Hazzard!  About "good ol' boys" driving a car around and messing with the stupid, corrupt police.  This all gave way to the A-Team, the Fall Guy, Knight Rider, Magnum PI and MacGuyver, shows that were all in one way or another based on Popeye, where the good guys beat up the bad guys.  More serious issues, like how the cocaine trade was a serious problem, got fashionably if not flippantly covered by Miami Vice, the king of mid to late 80s TV.  At much the same time, we were thoroughly entertained by the Cosby Show.  Seems a bit more sinister now and totally unfair that Lisa Bonet got kicked for making Angel Heart, a truly great 80s indie movie.

I won't touch day or evening soap operas, but they were there.

On Wheel of Fortune, you had to go shopping and spend your earnings after every round.  If you $80 left, you had to buy a dog statue or something else you really didn't want.  Some stay-at-home dad learned how to game Press Your Luck and eventually just stopped playing because he'd won enough.  One of the best resurgences of the 80s was Jeopardy!, which is still going strong and one of the most intelligent things you'll ever see on American TV.

Fashion:  In high school, my morning ritual included rolling my pants into a cuff and doing up my hair with mousse on the sides and hairspray up top.  I spent more time in the 80s primping than probably the rest of the decades that follow combined.  Girls permed their hair so that it stuck straight up at ridiculous lengths.  One girl in my high school earned the nickname "Dynamite" because it looked like a stick had just exploded in her face.  Did that deter her from daily having 18-inch bangs and side hair radiating out from her face?  Not at all.  She thought it was cool.

Consumerism: Along with the VCR, it was cool to have a walkman.  All music was on cassette.  Atari 2600 gave way to Commodore 64, which gave away to the NES.  Floppy disks were actually floppy, and you went to arcades to play super-advanced games for a quarter a pop.

Fun fact: the 80s hated the 70s.  So much hatred for bell bottoms and halter tops, and just this sense that it was better to be in the 80s than the 70s.  The 90s kind of disagreed with the 80s hate and embraced the 70s.
