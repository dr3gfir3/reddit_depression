	<TITLE> Nervous about carb intake on vegan diet - M/22/245 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello r/veganfitness, M/22/245/6ft, first time poster long time lurker. I posted this question to r/vegan and was sent here a few times so here I am!

I have lost about 85lbs in the past year and have recently kicked it into high gear, splitting my MWF into 45-50 minutes of cardio and spending TR with a trainer. On those TR days we hit major muscle groups with a lot of body/weight training. My weight loss has definitely picked up since I started this new routine back in early December. I've noticed a ton of more muscle tone and am losing weight on average about 3lbs a week. My goal is to be just downright nasty fit, a dream I've had my whole life and I can begin seeing a faint glimmer in the distance.

I've thrown around the idea of going vegan/plant based for awhile but never really got into it. Recently read Finding Ultra by Rich Roll/listening to his podcasts and am ready to make the move. However, I have one major concern. I've been eating at a calorie deficit obviously (around 1,500-1,700 a day) and have limited my carb intake to about 20-30g. While looking into a vegan diet I've noticed that a lot of the recipes are very high carb. Now I know these are still very healthy foods that are very fiber rich but the high amount of carbs makes me nervous. Will I still be able to lose a consistent amount of weight on a vegan/plant based diet? I know the ultimate take away is to keep the calorie surplus but dammit the carbs make me nervous, I've always been told to equate high carbs with weight gain. 

TL;DR: Trying to cut, worried about carbs on vegan diet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh definitely and I think that's where my fear stemmed from, I was never taught good carbs vs. bad carbs just no carbs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Killer. Absolute killer. But it seems like I've been doing it all wrong so the carbs are going up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See the only reason I had even started restricting my carb intake was because my father, upon being diagnosed with Type II, was told that a lower carb intake equates to weight loss, etc. However, now that I'm reading through this it seems that's not always the case. Thanks for pointing this sort of stuff out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello r/vegan! I wasn't sure if this post should be included here or r/loseit so I came here! Hope I'm not overstepping my bounds!

 I've lost about 85 pounds within the past year through rigorous diet and exercise. My diet has largely been focused on staying in my calorie limits of 1,500-1,700 calories a day/20g of carbs. My exercise is a five day program, two days doing extensive body/weight training the rest cardio. I've been losing, on average, about 3.2lbs a week. Since I've really got into the fitness mindset I've been reading some fitness/health books, specifically Finding Ultra by Rich Roll and and Meat is for Pussies by John Joseph. I'm fully convinced a vegan diet is the way to go. I'm ready to change.

and I know vegan foods such as whole grains, veggies, fruits, etc are all very, very healthy I get it yes okay. However, most of them are very high in carbs which I try to avoid. My question is, can I switch to a vegan diet and still expect to lose weight at the rate I have been? I know it may seem like a stupid question but that's the only thing holding me back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Over ate a little on some sushi. Calorie wise I'm still totally fine but pushed into the 70g of carbs when I normally stay between 15-20g. Thought about it the entire way home...went home, changed and went to the gym. I'm a man obsessed ya'll.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine's a little darker than going to the zoo but dammit, it really pulled me from where I was. I had always known throughout college that I was gaining weight steadily but I guess never really came to terms with what was really happening. Eventually one night I left a party early. I never felt comfortable in public and quickly became too ashamed/embarrassed of my body to go out. Once I got back to my apartment I had a complete meltdown...started throwing everything in sight, crying hysterically...all over my weight, it had literally taken control of my life. Took a look at myself in the mirror and punched it, cutting my hand all to hell. There was a moment, and I can still remember it, that I contemplated taking a broken piece of mirror to my stomach. That was the night that I changed everything about myself. Since that night I've lost 85 pounds and am well on my way to being healthier and happier than I ever have before. It was an ugly journey but the sun is beginning to shine! </TEXT>
