	<TEXT> Identifying that she needs help is part of being compassionate. It doesn't automatically turn her into a person who can't be reasoned with. Offering compassion for him should include workable solutions to his situation, otherwise it's just like saying, *sorry dude, I feel bad for you, but I'd run away.* He clearly has feelings for her, otherwise he wouldn't be asking here. Walking away from her would hurt him just as much I'd venture, even if she does need to address her problems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's probably time to talk to her about getting some help for her anxiety and clear self esteem issues. Trouble with both of those things is that they're irrational and really unkind to the person experiencing them, which in turn causes that unkindness to project onto folks around them. You shouldn't be an emotional punching bag for her, but tell her you want her to get some help so she can at least breathe a bit. You can be supportive, but don't enable it by letting it chip away at it any more than it already has. At the end of the day, if she won't seek help, then you'll have to make a decision as to what you want to do. You can help and be supportive to someone yes, but if they refuse to seek help for themselves independent of that, then it's okay to tell them that it's not fair and you need to think. She obviously realises she's being difficult to be around right now, but knowing that and doing something about it, are two very different things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not nice to be on the receiving end of that, but her behaviour seems like she's battling with mental health issues that need addressing. Her reaction to some of the sounds you make made me think of [Misophonia](http://www.misophonia.com/symptoms-triggers/), but that's just off the top of my head. It seems like you're trying to be accommodating, but you're both struggling with this to the point where it's adversely affecting your lives. Her stress levels are clearly elevated, and yours are because otherwise you'd not be posting here.

	<TEXT> Yeah it's very typical behaviour for someone being controlled like that. You might have to wait a little longer, but usually victims will defend their abusers for a while before they reach their wits end. I'm so sorry you're having to witness it, it tends to strip away much of who they are as a person. Even if they don't respond to your requests, [don't close the door ](https://burningworlds.wordpress.com/2016/12/27/dont-close-the-door-relationship-violence/) .

	<TEXT> It's a perfect example of non physical relationship violence. She's abusing him basically. Unfortunately, it's hard for people to break out of a cycle of abuse because of the control their abuser has over them. Perhaps if you and a couple of your friends were to approach him gently and offer some information.

	<TEXT> That's not how poly works love. All parties need to be poly, otherwise you're just being incredibly selfish. Unless you're just trolling, your relationship isn't going to last because he's clearly monogamous, and you're not.

That, or you don't love him like you used to, and want to be able to have fun elsewhere whilst you rely on him for stability. As a poly person, it's folks like you that ruin it for those of who know how to do poly for real.  You're getting negativity because you're being a total shit. Have your sexuality, but you can't have him too. 

This reeks of troll though, it's a whole bunch of straw men alllll lined up.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not the reaction of someone who is merely infatuated. It's entirely possible to love someone you've never met, especially if you talk to them constantly and share things about yourselves that show vulnerability. Unfortunately it doesn't always end well, which is pretty much the scenario here. 

His ghosting her is really insensitive though, he could have at least said goodbye. It's not fair that the OP is flailing on her own, and he has his life to go back to. 

OP, do you have a circle of friends to lean on for support, or was this one of those situations where you kept everything secret because of his being married? Even if it was, if your friends love you, they will at least try and help you with this so you're not alone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps you could focus on the post rather than defending your pedantry, and derailing things by mentioning the age of consent being different in some places. The OP used the term pedophile, which implies that the age of consent is above the age of fifteen where they are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Truthfully, you're probably not going to be able to make a whole lot of sense of your thoughts and emotions surrounding this, because your brain is probably trying to feel ALL THE THINGS at once, AND try and rationalise things in a way that you can work through it. It seems like you're in the *numb* stage right now, where you cry a lot, but can't decipher what you need to do. That's entirely normal. 

It's also not unusual for people close to offenders like this to stick around, because when you form attachments, it's hard to immediately turn your back and release them. You're likely having the same issues now. You can only handle things like this in small chunks. It wouldn't be a bad idea to seek out therapy to help you work around it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a white person, I can only comment about how white folks behave around black people, and my usual response is to facepalm, and say '*white people gonna white.*' We're pretty bloody awful, and very blinkered to the point where many of us don't get it because we don't experience what you do every single day. People on the thread comparing being poor as 'colour' frustrate me, because as much as race, class, and social status intersect, they're different experiences. I can only imagine how exhausting and defeating it must be to encounter this every day. You deserve to live without discrimination, and I'm sorry we contribute to that.  </TEXT>
