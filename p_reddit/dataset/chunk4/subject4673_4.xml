	<TEXT> Every time I watch it, it cracks me up. This was carell's break through role i think. I know he was in the daily show and was in bruce almighty a bit but this is just tops. Steve carell is a comic genius. Amazing cast: steve carell, seth rogen, paul rudd, romany malco, jane lynch and elizabeth banks. Credit to judd apatow who makes funny and heartwarming movies. It is a feel good movie about an awkward subject. It is about to become my reality except for the collectibles, a full time job and a house. One of the funniest movies i've ever seen. It is relatable. I watched it in the cinema and everyone was laughing hard throughout the movie. Very quotable and lovable! Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never heard the story of desmond doss before this movie came out. Such a powerful and inspirational movie. It was bloody, brutal but also a beautiful movie. He was the first conscientious objector and he stuck by his morals. Mel gibson really knows how to make thought provoking and meaningful masterpieces. Andrew garfield gave the character strength and a sense of vulnerability. It had an amazing nearly all aussie cast. Hugo weaving is just so intimidating in all his roles. One of the best! Sam worthington was good too. I just love teresa palmer. I get lost in her beautiful blue eyes and she is just unbelievably stunning. The cinematography, sound editing and everything were top notch. You are immersed in the intensity of the movie. It was so realistic. Any other movies like it? </TEXT>

I know it is hard to feel sorry for a drug lord but i felt a little bad for him. The movie had a great cast and a great story. It is based on george jung's life as a cocaine dealer. Penelope cruz was nominated for a razzie for her performance but i thought she played the role well. Johnny depp was at his best. Ironically the director-ted demme died of a heart attack from cocaine use. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never watched the original but the remake was quite disturbing. It was gory, violent and brutal. The rape scene was hard to watch. Sara paxton* was great in the movie. I accidentally said sara foster who is also hot. Sleep deprivation. She has that innocence about her and was perfect for the role. I have a crush on her and monica potter. So beautiful. Garrett dillahunt was menacing as usual. He always freaks me out. Aaron paul was nuts. Kill or be killed. A different kind of revenge movie.  </TEXT>

I usually don't like movies that take place in one day but collateral is one of the exceptions. Michael mann is a genius when it comes to shoot outs and action. Heat remains his best movie in my opinion but collateral is up there. Tom cruise was clinical, relentless and determined. Jamie foxx was also great as the taxi driver. I try to run like tom cruise.

Everything was done exceptionally. Choi min-sik is a menacing villain. That guy freaks me out. He plays the bad guy perfectly because he is no longer a human. He is a monster. Probably one of the scariest guys i've ever seen in a movie. He plays the most depraved and evil characters. </TEXT>

It was intense and made me sad. The part where ellen page was gutting a pig and making ribs was truly impressive and gross. She learnt how to do that in real life. It wasn't what i expected but it left me speechless. Hope evan rachel wood and ellen page work together again. </TEXT>

It was like an arcade game with music and a story. Michael cera played the part perfectly but he always does the same type of roles. Crushing hard on ramona flowers. It was a fun movie and had a pretty slick cast: michael cera, mary elizabeth winstead, aubrey plaza, brie larson, anna kendrick, chris evans, jason shwartzman and others.

They really haven't made a name for themselves and are known for one role back in the nineties. She is attractive and could play anything from a lawyer to an Israeli soldier.

	<TEXT> I haven't really watched any werewolf movies and i heard about ginger snaps. It was not what i expected even though i knew it was about werewolves. It was dark, crude and funny. Katharine isabelle is a hottie and she has depth. Emily perkins played the awkward shy teen really well. I can't wait to watch the second and third part of the trilogy. Hope i can find it on dvd. It was a horror movie with a difference. It didn't follow the same formula like others. Are there any other good werewolf movies? </TEXT>

It is scary that it is based on true events. Some people are just fkn sick and are depraved. Poor girl. Dreama walker is cute and underrated. Her manager was a bitch. There were a few red flags that they ignored. </TEXT>

Vincent cassell was a loose cannon but he plays those deranged characters so well. Naomi watts was great too. I really like her. The movie had an authentic feel to it.  </TEXT>

He has such depth and can really scare you too. Total man crush on him too. His best movie in my opinion is eastern promises. He stepped it up. He made me cry in the road. That was intense. Gi jane was pretty decent too. I am not a fan of the lord of the rings but he is one of my fave actors. I haven't watched a few of his movies yet. I'm planning to watch his whole filmography. I hope he wins an oscar one day. </TEXT>

The ladies were interesting and had to do the unthinkable to survive. The monsters were terrifying. It is the only movie that really scared me. I don't get scared easily.

Aaron johnson was scary and good in it. Can't get past how great jake gyllenhaal is. He never lets me down. He has to be in the running for an oscar soon. Amy adams was quite breathtakingly beautiful in the movie. Complex movie! </TEXT>

I felt some charles manson vibes while watching it. It had a hitchcock feel about it. Joel edgerton looked menacing, creepy and unsettling. He is very underrated. Jason bateman and rebecca hall were also great. The absence of a soundtrack made it more eerie and really set the tone of the movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has a stellar cast: jessica chastain, tom hardy, shia labeouf, jason clarke, mia wasikowska and guy pearce. It is filmed during the prohibition era and it has you on the edge of your seat the whole time. Guy pearce played the villain so well. He was so creepy and malicious. Gives me the creeps. The soundtrack is amazing too. Got to give props to nick cave for that. I think it is john hillcoat's best movie along with the road. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She is a fiery red head and all of her movies are amazing. She kills it every time. Her new movies sloane and the zookeeper's wife look so good. I don't know what more she needs to do, to win. I hope she wins one in the future. She is like the leo dicaprio of the oscars. She brings such tenacity, grace and beauty to her roles. I really like lawless. I've got my fingers crossed for her. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The first one was intense and by the end of the movie it leaves you in shock. They destroyed her will to live and took everything from her. The second one was different and had some themes of human trafficking and it shows how strong she is to keep on fighting. The third one was a disappointment. It didn't have the same intensity as the first two and it was more tame in comparison. I like these revenge/vengeance movies. It shows how messed up some people are and how far we will go, when we are pushed to our limits. What did you guys think of it? </TEXT>

He is a cold blooded killer with no conscience. Killer cast! I really like ray liotta and winona ryder. I am going to watch the interviews of kuklinski to analyze him.

It is very stylish and it is about revenge, strength, risk taking and getting back what was taken from her. The characters are interesting and the storyline is good. I hope there will be a sequel.

	<TEXT> She dominated the seventies and eighties with her blaxploitation movies. She was pretty much the only black actress in those times and she was the leading lady. You have to admire her strength and conviction. She also never ages. She looks the same now. I haven't seen all her movies but i really like the prison themed ones. They were funny and had lots of action. Surprised she never became a big star in hollywood. She will always be remembered for her iconic roles and changing the face of black cinema. </TEXT>
