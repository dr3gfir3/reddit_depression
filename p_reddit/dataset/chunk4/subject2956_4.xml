CCTV footage shows a motorcycle driver with his 5 year old daughter being knocked down by a 20-meter-long truck waiting at the traffic lights in Taizhou, China. The child was thrown under the trailer while her father was trying to pull his daughter and the motorcycle out. The toddler escaped with minor injuries when the truck stopped. According to the local police, both vehicles violated traffic regulations.

	<TEXT> Good job OP. Didn't know Hegel and Marx had any views at all about India. Mueller had never visited India AFAIK and Monier was a Christian bigot. And these two dudes had so much influence over colonial views of Hinduism which persists to this day. Husserl I know nothing about.

I suspect the whole concept of Brahmanism itself is a colonial one, giving prominence to the Vedas and focussing on a specific set of rituals as the whole of Hinduism. These European "oriental" experts, few of whom had ever visited India, probably found it easier to find Indian equivalents for the 19th century European concepts they were familiar with - Christianity=Hinduism, Bible=Vedas/Gita, Priest=Brahmin, Nobleman=Kshatriya, Serf=Dalit. This just does not reflect the far more complex situation we have here. For example, they tend to completely sideline the huge number of people for whom Lord Ram and the Ramayana is the primary source of religious belief or certain gods and belief systems in TN which probably predates the Ramayana and the Vedas. For me, everything is Hinduism. They saw Brahmins as representing the whole of Hinduism. The attack on Brahmins is just an attack on Hinduism.

Despite the European contempt for our caste system (and it deserves contempt) the 18th/19th century European serf was probably in a worse condition than the Dalits here. I used to read a lot about Indian history and I suspect neither the Dalits were as powerless as these experts would like us to believe nor the Brahmins as influential. There are a lot of incidents which talk of protests by caste groups demanding better terms from castes which employ them. And also conflict between caste groups, like right-handed and left-handed castes. There also seems to have been a lot of movement within the caste systems. For example (so called) lower castes and tribal groups gaining prominence during the Vijayanagar era.

Looking forward to your post on Bishop Caldwell now. </TEXT>

And as for you OP, you seem to be the Subbu Swamy of this sub. You are doing a good job of complaining and protesting about everything, but I think you will be a horrible mod. I do believe the mods might be deleting too much to maintain Reddiquette here, but that is something that can be discussed with them. Did they delete something that triggered this post?

	<TEXT> Kissing and making out among themselves is a second choice. Usually the men prefer harassing and molesting women they have no chance of getting, to boost their own self-esteem. The fugly women turn in to sour-grapes feminists and convince themselves all men are evil. One thing common between molesters, feminists and liberals is a very low self-esteem. It is not surprising many so called liberals turn out to be molesters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah! a clown/jester/troll. I remember when I was a kid we went on a school trip to the zoo. Some of us kids stood outside the lion's enclosure and threw peanuts at them, hitting one male lion in the face and pissing him off. We were so thrilled that we repeated the same thing with the elephants. We must have been about 3 or 4 feet tall then but we felt so powerful and strong. It didn't even matter that the animals could have killed us with one swipe if the bars weren't there.

Now that I am all grownup I think it was all silly, but who cares when you are a dumb, stupid, powerless kid whom nobody gives a shit about. Any sort of attention is worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you zoom in you will see colored dots on the gif. This is because of a process called error diffusion the gif maker would have used to make the 256 color limitation bearable. The gif also has a low frame rate (usually 5-15 frames/sec) to keep the file size manageable. But it is still a very well made gif, probably uses a custom color palette. 

Wish I could explain that better but it is morning here and now I have a boner to deal with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did that once with [this gif](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/43iuu7/did_i_say_you_can_stop/), it wasn't easy at all. I downloaded the video, converted it to a gif using ffmpeg, ended up with a huge file which had color problems and it was a pain uploading to imgur. Took me 30 to 45 minutes to make that post. Respect to all the reddit gifgineers who make all those long gifs without any color problems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Long answer:

There are two types of files we call gifs. The older gif format (which is from the 80s) is actually an image format with multiple images packed in a single file to form an animation. The files are huge because there is very little compression and the quality is very low because there can only be 256 color values in the gif. The newer gif format what we call a "gifv" is actually a video file without sound. It is as efficient size wise as any other video format. It can also contain millions of colors, so it is high quality.

Gfycat and Imgur primarily host the new "gifv" format. You can enter a Youtube address and starting time and they will convert it to gifv files of less than 15 seconds and they absolutely do not allow longer gifvs. But to allow people to host their older gif format files on their servers, they allow you to upload old gif files directly from your computer. Since these files are already in the gif format they can be any length you want it to be. Gif specialists on Reddit use this loop hole by downloading videos and converting them into the old gif format on their computers and then upload these huge files to Imgur. Imgur in turn would optimize these files by converting them to gifvs. It is a long process which requires special software and a lot of time and patience. It is definitely not for somebody who make a gifv of interesting videos they come across on Youtube in a few minutes and post, which is what most Redditors like me do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imgur and Gfycat have a 15 second limit unfortunately. Most redditors won't click on a video link because of the sound and the length. You won't find video links at the top of this sub or most others. It is always difficult choosing between these two choices. I posted the [video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tDQw21ntR64) in another comment, maybe you would want to check it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read an interesting history behind this. After MGR died, the party tried to completely sideline her by making MGR's wife the party chief. They openly called her a whore and even pulled her sari in the assembly. She is supposed to have gone through hell during this period. After that, she split the party and won the elections using the anger against Karuna after Rajiv Gandhi's assassination. The party people who had treated her so badly before her win, went back to her and shamelessly started kow towing to her, calling her "Amma". She took most of them back, but demanded absolute subservience.

She is silly to have promoted this sort of behavior, but I am more disgusted by the people who do the actual kow towing. There are absolutely no self-respecting people left in her party. Even the ministers have very little power, she rules through a set of handpicked bureaucrats. The positive side to this is that the ministers and MLAs are so scared of her and her absolute power that very few of them are corrupt. There is still a lot of corruption in TN but most of the money probably goes to the party and her circle. Ruling through bureaucrats and the top cops directly has also made the administration much more efficient. This is the reason she is still so popular. The downside is that there is nobody to run the party after her. The BJP might have a big opportunity here if they manage to find some charismatic leaders in the long term. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article describes the Nehruvian era more accurately than anything I've read before

"Marxist historians, Macaulays colonially-seduced bureaucrats, faux secular intellectuals, compromised journalists, and sycophantic politicians worshipping at the altar of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty."

"Left-leaning povertarian economics"

["Nehru was colonys child and allowed himself to be swayed more often than was good for India by the Anglo-German charms of Lord Mountbatten"](http://i.imgur.com/gb9EiA1.jpg) </TEXT>
