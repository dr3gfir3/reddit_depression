	<TEXT> Go to dear stage in akihabara. Its 1000 yen in and is basically a live venue where the staff are wannabe pop stars and perform multiple live sets every night. If you don't care and "j-pop" is as specific as they're willing to be, dear stage should do the trick. 

If there is a particular j-pop act they want to see, good luck with that. Tickets for anyone even moderately well known are gold dust. Especially the bigger acts, where ticket sales are allocated by an actual lottery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, myself and another redditor are in the process of putting together a comprehensive guide to akihabaras maid cafes, so i think i might actually be able to help someone here for once. 

If you want something a little more chilled out than the usual maid cafe spectacle, Honey Honey is the one you want. Its got all the novelty with none of the mayhem and unlike just about every other maid cafe, the food is actually pretty damn good. 

If you WANT the typical o.t.t act, i'd recommend @home cafe. Its menu is set up to make it the easiest and most efficient experience for newcomers, and some of the maids are fluent in english. 

Hope that helps! Any questions, just ask :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Strange problem with 2009 macbook </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Macheads. I need assistance. I bought a second hand macbook pro, its in good nick, but was cheap because the disc drive doesnt work and It didnt come with OS installed. I dont use cds and i was planning on using my boot disk anyway. 

I checked with the staff that this was possible, he showed me the mac booting up from an external boot disk and showed me all the info on the internal disk. 

At present, it boots from my boot disk no problem and runs beautifully. But the internal hard disk isnt showing up in the finder, thus not showing up in super duper either, so i cant clone my external to it. The internal drive shows up in disk utility, but thats it. It looks like i can erase it if i want, i havent because im not sure it will help, but the repair options are all greyed out. 

Any ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, my band here in Tokyo have just released our first single. We're called Clarity, the track is called In The End. Genre is hard rock, in the style of Saosin or Coldrain. We're just starting out, we would really appreciate it if you'd give it a listen and, if you like what you hear, share it around a little.
