The subsequent radioactive fallout  some of which fell as far as Wales  resulted in the Exclusion Zone being formed around Chernobyl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A hospitality tent has been erected just inside the gates of the Chernobyl nuclear power plant near Pripyat in Ukraine. The tent has many windows, to ensure everyone gets a good view of whats about to happen.
These guests are here to witness the final stage of a 30-year clean-up job that has been underway, on and off, since one of the plants reactors exploded in 1986. The Chernobyl disaster still casts a pall over nuclear power. And other serious accidents, such as that at Fukushima in Japan in 2011  the only other incident to be classified a maximum Level 7 in the seven-point International Nuclear Event Scale  are weighed against it.
It also set in train a series of measures to ensure nuclear safety around the world. Now the whole site is about to be encased inside a vast structure known as the sarcophagus, sealing in some of the most dangerous waste material in the world for at least 100 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe was quoted as saying on Sunday that his ZANU-PF party and the people saw no viable successor to him for general elections in 2018.
"They want me to stand for elections, they want me to stand for elections everywhere in the party ... The majority of the people feel that there is no replacement, successor who to them is acceptable, as acceptable as I am," he said in comments to state media ahead of his 93rd birthday this coming week.
