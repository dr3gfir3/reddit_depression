	<TITLE> Why I feed the courier: an open and honest discussion. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Everyone. I'd like to create an open and honest discussion about why people feed the courier. This is a safe space for people to express their thoughts and feelings on the topic. Please no insults or flaming, and keep an open mind and open ears. Thank you.

I occasionally feed the courier. I am not proud of it, but I admit it. I do it primarily because it makes me feel good. For a brief moment, it feels like I control my teammates and they view me as a god. I'm not trying to ruin the game or anything like that. I also think people overreact to a courier feed. 1 courier feed hardly decides a game, and I think weaker players use it as en excuse for their own poor playing. Those are just my opinions, and I welcome yours. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a huge dota fan and apparently that has made me not worthy of protection from my local police. There is this policewoman who i like so recently i kept calling in crimes so i could see her. I called in a Meepo invasion, an invoker meteor crash, and a pudge attack. The police have become totally grumpy and say if i make one more fake call they will arrest me! Anyway, my neighbor put on a Juggernaut mask and came into my house and beat me and robbed me! He said he was gonna come back tomorrow for more stuff and more beatings!!! If I call the cops and say Juggernaut is beating me up, they will arrest me, and if I don't, my neighbor will beat me and take more of my stuff!!! What can I do? I have nowhere to turn!!! Please help me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too had a similar experience with a different company during air travel so I know how horrific it can be. I recently took a flight to the annual Jar Jar Binks convention in West Horton, Ohio. I did not want to pack my Jar Jar costume as it is extremely expensive, but it wouldn't fit in a carry on, so I had to wear it. First, the search at the airport was a human rights violation. The airport security was very rude, and made me give up the two blasters I had on, then got mad at me because of my elaborate costume, saying it took so long to search it held up the line. Then when I finally got on the plane, the stewardess said I couldn't wear my Jar Jar mask, and the two people sitting next to me (I was in the middle), grumbled because my costume took up too much space and had stuff sticking out. After takeoff, I got in the aisle, put on my mask, and danced and yelled to entertain the other travelers. The stewardess tried to stop me but I ran screaming down the aisle, and then dove into a bunch of peoples laps. I was restrained for the rest of the flight. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Everyone complains about Peruvians and others, but what have you done to help? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm so tired of people complaining about Peruvians ruining the game. First off, yes they have bad internet and computers. So what? If they lose the connection just pause it. If they feed or spam, take the opportunity to try and help him mature. These people live in poverty, they need our help, not our disdain. I had a Peruvian named HapJak on my team, and he died 5 times in the first 10 minutes. Did I freak out? No, I talked to him. I trained with him. I wired him money to help with his bills and family. A friendship formed. Now he is 6k MMR. I was invited to his village for his birthday, which was a great time. I ended up being intimate with a beautiful Peruvian woman. Be helpful, it pays off. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA Do not accept Dota tournament invites from HapJak </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> HapJak invited me to a mid level dota tourney so I agreed and we met at a train station. Unfortunately, I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. Then HapJak kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said he will email me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I agreed. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA Don't use HapJak's MMR and LP Service, they don't protect personal info. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-09 01:23:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I recently enlisted the services of HapJak's MMR and LP Service to both get me out of low priority (I fed the courier a few times) and raise my MMR 1000 points. He said it would take 5 days and cost $175. I told him I didn't trust him and I would only pay after he was done. He agreed, but said he needed a copy of my drivers license first. I took a quick scan and sent it over. The next day he didn't even start playing my account. Then the second day came and went. The third day I get a phone call from West Youngton police, saying a left my license at a message parlor. I told them I don't live anywhere near there and I had my license on me. Turns out HapJak had used my license scan to make a fake ID and then sold it. The guy who bought it went to an Asian massage parlor and requested a handjob, and then ran out without paying, dropping the license during his escape. Protect your personal information people! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: The player HapJak is NOT a real pro scout, do not believe him. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-07 14:39:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was approached by the individual HapJak over Reddit who told me he was a pro scout and I should invite him over steam to watch me play a ranked match. I agreed. He told me he wanted to assess my leadership abilities by seeing if I could convince the other players to participate in my online persona. I was to say or chat "Am I original?" and all the other players had to say or chat "yeah yeah". Then I had to continue with all the lyrics to the chorus of the song backstreets back, e.g. "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The other players refused to cooperate and the situation deteriorated. Ending with me feeding the courier and my team losing, and me getting reported. I later found it through Reddit that he ISNT EVEN A PRO SCOUT. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had a professional scout checking me out and my chances were ruined by other players in ranked. My persona involves that I ask questions either over chat or in the mic and I need the other players to respond with a"yeah yeah". For example, I'll be like "am I original?" They say "yeah yeah". "Am i sexual?" "Yeah yeah". The questions come from the song backstreets back. Anyway the other players would not say "yeah yeah" no matter how much I asked or explained. The scout said without that showmanship I can't go pro. How do I deal with people who flat out refuse to cooperate? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I very much enjoy playing dota 2 but I have an issue I was hoping somebody else may have worked out. I'm a very religious man and adhere strictly to the church's guidelines. However I am also a very skilled dota player, and through normal play, I often go on "godlike" streaks. This is of course blasphemy and not acceptable. I asked my priest and he said it was ok as long as when I get a godlike steak I say "praise Christ" over mic or chat. This makes the godlike comment about HIM and not me. However he also said at least 3 of the other 9 players must also say "praise Christ" for it to work. If they don't, I must immediately feed the courier. As you can imagine, most other players won't cooperate and flip out when I feed the courier. It's making it very difficult to play a full match and I'm getting a lot of reports. Had anyone else figured out a solution to a problem like mine? </TEXT>
