[Project Loon is a research and development project being developed by X (formerly Google X) with the mission of providing Internet access to rural and remote areas. The project uses high-altitude balloons placed in the stratosphere at an altitude of about 18 km (11 mi) to create an aerial wireless network with up to 4G-LTE speeds. It was named Project Loon, since even Google itself found the idea of providing Internet access to the remaining 5 billion population unprecedented and "crazy."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Loon)

Prerequisites:  
1, core version 0.13.1 released in July, including the miners activated segwit (isolation witness) are available;  
2, classic releases new version is based on core 0.13.1 version, including for miners active segwit (isolation witness) and 2M hard bifurcation;  
3, core violation of the Hong Kong expansion consensus agreement, not in August 1, 2016 release includes new versions of 2M hard bifurcation.


Making process:  
1, over 75% of the mine pool owners and operators of power miners Optional Optional day expansion of convening the meeting;  
2, the meeting reached a consensus: all participants ore miners in pools or expansion route choice will work hand in hand;  
3, select a pool of mine as "Terminator";  
4, released "Terminator Plan" content.

Program content:  
1. Participating mineral pool, miners reach consensus on expansion: 90% or more operators to activate 2M force bifurcation hard to count more than 95% of the force activation segwit (isolation witness);  
2. Participating mineral pool, miners to achieve consensus on the expansion, will be unified planning, unified action, act in unison;  
3, select XX meeting mine pool to "Terminator";  
4, in addition to the "Terminator", the participants all mineral pools, within 30 days the miners core program switches to the latest version of the classic, complete 2M hard bifurcation, segwit (isolation witness) Operator support force;  
5, if and only if more than 75% of the operator support 2M hard on finalizing the diverging after "Terminator" complete support for 2M hard bifurcation as soon as possible to ensure that there are more than 90% of the force operator support 2M hard bifurcation;  
6, when the 2M hard fork is activated, the 28-day grace period, the pool of participants ore miners will do everything possible to inform all the miners, exchanges, wallet developer / company, core wallet users, other start-up companies and other completed core switching procedures to ensure the smooth progress of the bifurcation hard, to avoid unnecessary losses generated;  
7, activate segwit (isolation witness).






Description proposal:  
1. The proposed plan is valid only after three preconditions occur;  
2, which is a majority of the miners to mine the main pool of the proposal, there are different opinions may ignore this proposal, will be idle, bored when I was nonsense;  
3, expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, both parties after a long discussion over, except for a few extreme person, most people agree that the following points:  
(1) We need to 2M hard bifurcation, but requires enough force to support the operator to ensure that Bitcoin will not be split;  
(2) We need to isolate the witness, in order to achieve Bitcoin kernel better scalability and compatibility;  
(3) We need lightning network, in order to achieve Bitcoin-second transfer capability.  
4. Select the Always use classic classic does not mean that later, if the core in a subsequent compatible version adds support for the classic, the miners can then select the core;  
5, core and classic are open source projects, developers fate is freedom, when the miners selected classic, I believe there will be many core developers turn to classic provides code;  
6, the battle line expansion, isolation witness, 2M hard bifurcation debate lightning network has been trouble for too long, please do not argue with me here their advantages and disadvantages, and I do not want to waste time on these topics and the energy;  
7, one of the core design of bitcoin miner is considered the future direction of the force decided to Bitcoin, "talk harm the country", the expansion of the dispute has been debated for too long, continue to argue it is empty. "Hard work and prosperous," better than a perfect plan executed powerful miners was time to act to end this dispute it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if I like the wording of "take over the government", maybe "prevent tyranny" is a better phrase.

Either way...

Total US population: 319 million people

Total active duty and reserve military personnel: 2.1 million people

Small arms in the hand of 300+ million people sounds like a pretty huge game changer to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I can understand the concern if thats the case, however I'd hope that people serving in such important positions were mentally stable to begin with.

Perhaps, or perhaps not, they were mentally stable to begin with, but as someone slowly but surely completely loses their mind over the course of their service, are they really going to go see a doctor when doing so could very easily end their career and ability to feed their children, especially when they know that they're too far 'gone crazy' or 'institutionalized' in their service to got a comparable job outside of their current service? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Copy/paste I made from a while back about how as of Januray 1st, 2016, the state of California can confiscate virtually anybody's weapons for virtually any reason](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/3yz24k/a_california_gun_statute_going_into_effect_on_1/cyikf70?context=1):

I went through [the new law](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201320140AB1014) and picked out specific portions that I feel are an extreme threat to any free society:

Section 18155 details grounds for issuing an "ex parte gun violence restraining order":

(E) A conviction for any offense listed in Section 29805."

[Section 29805](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=PEN sectionNum=29805.) is a fairly long list of misdemeanors. I don't believe that any misdemeanor should allow the government to take your weapons.

(2) In determining whether grounds for a gun violence restraining order exist, the court may consider any other evidence of an increased risk for violence, including, **but not limited to**, evidence of any of the following:

Notice the "but not limited to" part. They're basically granting themselves authority to consider anything and everything they want.

(C) Any prior **arrest** of the subject of the petition for a felony offense.

Note that it says "arrest", not conviction. In my opinion, that is insane. Even if it said "conviction", why would non-violent felonies be considered grounds for confiscation?

(F) Documentary evidence, including, but not limited to, police reports and records of convictions, of either recent criminal offenses by the subject of the petition that involve controlled substances or alcohol or ongoing abuse of controlled substances or alcohol by the subject of the petition.

Got caught smoking cannabis? No guns for you. Also, they provide no explicit definition (or reference to an explicit definition) of "ongoing abuse of controlled substances or alcohol".

(G) Evidence of recent acquisition of firearms, ammunition, or other deadly weapons.

Bought a weapon recently? That's grounds for confiscation!

Further excessive use of the phrase "including, but not limited to" throughout the bill.

From section 18150:

 (a) (1) An immediate family member of a person or a law enforcement officer may file a petition requesting that the court issue an ex parte gun violence restraining order enjoining the subject of the petition from having in his or her custody or control, owning, purchasing, possessing, or receiving a firearm or ammunition.

I think there is significant potential for abuse here. Have any issues with an immediate family member or a law enforcement officer (or perhaps a government that you've angered)? Hope they don't use this against you. Oh, but you're a totally sane person, right? Well, you haven't shaved in a week and they knock on your door at 6 AM while you were still sleeping, so you're all groggy. Your rank-and-file policeman interprets your lack of a clean shave and your grogginess as evidence that you must obviously be mentally unstable, and they search your place and seize anything they don't approve of. Nonsense like this happens; for many it's not just some what-if scenario.

Part (b) (1) of section 18155 appears to be things that most people would consider legitimate in justifying a confiscation, but then part (b) (2) immediately goes on to grant themselves the ability to consider significantly less legitimate things, and they explicitly say that they can consider whatever they want with the "but not limited to" part.

Domestic shootings are horrific and tragic, but I am not overlooking them in my opposition to bills and laws like this. Loosely worded legislation regarding Constitutional rights presents a monumental threat to a free society. I do not pretend to know what kind of government or society we might have 10, 50, 100, or more years from now, or what intentions that government might have.

Please excuse the sensationalism here: Ask Anne Frank and her family (or about 100,000 other Dutchmen) how they feel about Dutch census data, which included religious affiliation and was initially collected for non-malicious purposes.

To me, the right to bear arms has very little to do with personal defense. The 2nd Amendment was not included in the Constitution to protect against individual theives or attackers or because people go hunting. It was included, 224 years ago, because they recognized the potential threat of a tyrannical government. It is (again, excuse the dramatic tone) a doomsday provision that explicitly states the right of the American people to stand up against a government that has stripped them of most or all of their other rights. I certainly do not know what our government will turn into or attempt to do over the course of the next 224 years.

Arguably, the intent or 'spirit' of this law is good, but ultimately that does not matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I understand we have this difference but we can be more specific. Maximum utility can mean different things. You are referring to maximum use as a currency OR to the maximum use cases. There can also be "What is the optimal use?" Which might not be as a currency and might only be one thing and not many things.

Yes it is undecided at this point.

It might be that having only the big players use it is optimal, and then the users you speak of will seek alternate options.

I'm not totally disagreeing here, even if I do still think it's a bad idea to limit use cases of Bitcoin, but what I definitely *am* saying is that while the Bitcoin community bickers about what they think the optimal use cases and block size of Bitcoin should be, other coins are making massive strides and innovations in areas like smart contracts, DAOs, and more.

What I think is important is to think about the existing fiats and how governments will be forced to print higher quality money in order for it to stay relevant.

Exactly this, and it applies to incumbent cryptocurrencies just as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think it can be shown that bitcoin is far better off without attempting to keep bitcoin cheap to transact. I don't think this is best for the world.
 
 
 
 the important point to consider is how many users will be driven to alternatives as Bitcoin transaction fees rise.
 
 
 
 this presupposes that number of users is what is important. And this presupposes bitcoin's optimal use is as a coffee money (or at least cheap to transact). 

I think this is where I see things fundamentally differently.

I think that driving away users for *any* use case is a bad idea and damages the overall utility and value of Bitcoin. I think that users will find maximum value in cryptocurrencies that provide maximum utility. In short, I think Bitcoin is being destroyed in both utility and value as long as its transaction throughput continues to be intentionally limited, and that until something changes, users and value will continue flowing out of Bitcoin and into altcoins.

Obviously, others do not feel this way. Only time will tell who is correct, or who is correct to what degrees. </TEXT>

Same end effect ultimately.

It makes me sad because I've been so excited about Bitcoin, but it's clear that Blockstream has hijacked Bitcoin and is driving it into the ground, whether or not that's their intent.

Bitcoin may fail, but cryptocurrency will not.

MOD:

Hi, you've been banned for repeatedly posting opinion/analysis pieces and editorialized articles. The new submission page and the sidebar say very clearly that this sub is only for straight news reports. If you agree to follow the rules, we can lift your ban in a week's time. Does that sound fair?

ME:

That's fine.

I will avoid anything that could be considered opinion/analysis.

For what it's worth, I haven't changed any titles, though I do notice that sometimes the title of an article will change later on.

Using my only post in /r/worldnews in the last 96 hours as an example (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4jc39x/swedish_govt_spends_millions_telling_citizens_to/), the title of my post and the title of the article are exactly the same.

If I'm not understanding anything about the definition of 'editorialized', please let me know.

In any case, thanks for modding and taking the time to talk to me.

MOD:

You can read more about the rules here: /r/worldnews/wiki/rules

In this case by "editorialized" I wasn't referring to the title, but the article.

It's not an opinion piece per se, but the article contains hints at the opinion of the author such as "Yum". It's clearly not a straight news report.

Please respond to this message in a week and we'll lift your ban again.

So posting an article with the word "Yum..." in it appears to be the straw that broke the camel's back.

Guess I'll message them in a week. </TEXT>

If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for /r/worldnews by replying to this message.

I've only made a single post there in the last 96 hours. (https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4jc39x/swedish_govt_spends_millions_telling_citizens_to/)

I sent them a message 90 minutes ago and no response yet:

Hi, thank you for the notice. Can I get some feedback on this? Anything I can do differently?

Are they doing some sort of a purge or is there a more reasonable explanation? </TEXT>
