	<TEXT> Fair enough. A couple of these I could see people making this argument and everyone has different opinions. I haven't read Twilight or The Davinci Code, but certainly these would at least be a step above those in a literary sense, right?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk if you are looking for more modern books but here are some classics I was addicted to.

- Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes
- And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie
- East of Eden by John Steinbeck
- Animal Farm by George Orwell
- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
- The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas

Some may disagree with some of these being classified as page turners, but I was so immersed in all of these and felt I needed to see what happened next. Its safe to put And Then There Were None in the page turner category though, no doubt.

	<TEXT> I read IT back in high school. It took me study hall for the entire year to finish it. Now I can't even seem to remember much of it at all. I loved it at the time though. Besides that 11/22/63 is the only one i've actually read by him recently. I fully intend to binge some more of his stuff one day cause I tore through that one. I could definetely see The Shining being a great audiobook option for me. Even 11/22/63 spooked me at times and its not even one of his horror novels.  </TEXT>

Very Interesting about the Abe Lincoln one. The Vampire part in the title would normally turn me off for whatever reason as well. What's really funny is I saw the movie years ago and remember thinking the same thing going into it, but being pleasantly suprised. I will have to check it out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Plot twist: I am an English teacher. 

Just kidding. I'm not. I just noticed this about my list. In all honesty the reason for that is because most the books I have read and can actually recall are classics because I decided to do a reading challenge with a friend of mine when I got back into reading this past year. Before I started I hadn't read much in years. Once I finally finish I will work on diversifying my portfolio with some more modern stuff a bit more. I really did love all these I listed though. 

Thanks for the reccommendations. I will check out all of these! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually read Huck Finn already and part of the time I did listen to the free audiobook they had on Audible. Elija did do a great job. He actually played Huck in the Disney movie back in the early 90's. It's pretty cool he got to revisit the character by doing the audiobook at an older age. 

I might listen to the Tom Sawyer one narrated by Nick Offerman one day. He seems like he would have a great voice for that type of book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't be mad at me, but I actually have this already on my audible account from a trial I had recently. I haven't listened to it yet nor watched the movie but have heard it's thrilling. Now you convinced me that I really need to jump into it. 

If you're wondering why I'm looking for more when I haven't even finished all the ones I own: I no longer have a paid audible account because I wanted to save money. Over on eStories I have a couple credits on my account that i'm trying to use so I can cancel that as well. But I figured I might as well not limit myself to suggestions that are only available on eStories because eventually if I get into a better listening habit I will most likely invest in audible again.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help deciding on an audiobook. Any that are must listens? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-04 16:39:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a couple credits saved up that I need to use and can't for the life of me decide on what to spend them on. I normally prefer to sit down and read physical books and tend to get easily distracted when I listen to audio, so something that is rather easy to follow and engrossing would be great. Whenever I see a book that I want to read in audiobook I don't pull the trigger because I'm worried it would be better read in its physical form. So do you have any that you would say enhances the regular book's reading experience? 

Here are some of my favorite books so you get a better idea of what i'm in to:

- East of Eden by John Steinbeck
- 11.22.63 by Stephen King
- To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee
- The Count of Monte Criso by Alexandre Dumas
- Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes
- And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie
- Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck
- Animal Farm by George Orwell
- The Giver by Lois Lowry
- The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky

EDIT: I haven't been a heavy reader for very long, only getting back into reading within the past year. I've been doing a reading challenge that includes catching up on a lot of classics. Because of this my favorite books list seems to be heavily favored towards classics, but I enjoy anything, just haven't read as much modern literature yet! 

Thanks in advance for your help!

	<TEXT> Hey, I can tell you're a good writer. You should try to keep writing your thoughts down as a way to express some of your emotions if you haven't already. Even if you keep it private, it's still a good way to prevent things from being bottled up. You could also try talking to a therapist, they can be very helpful, but that is entirely up to you. 

I don't know how old you are, but when I was in high school I use to be deathly shy around people and couldn't for the life of me start up a conversation. I used to think too much about it, I was scared other people would think I was weird if I said the wrong things, and by not speaking at all I thought I could prevent this, but I most likely gave people the exact impression I was trying to avoid. I was lonely. I couldn't stand living like that anymore so when I finally went to college, instead of commuting to and from school as I initially intended, I decided to force myself to live in the dorms on campus. This way I would be surrounded by people that I would have to interact with one way or another. It wasn't easy and I was petrified at first, but It ended up being the best decision I ever made in my life. I met some of my best friends that I still hang out with years later. If those same people went to my high school, I would have never started talking to them. The lack of cliques in college was a dream come true for me. We were not very relatable, the only thing in common was we were college kids trying to figure our lives out, but somehow, over time, we clicked. Everyone is alike in a sense that we are just people, carrying flaws that we hide below the surface, but above the surface we display only the highlights of our lives on platforms like social media. Everyone you see on Facebook is most likely hiding the things that make them unique from everyone else because of how they think they will be perceived. I'm no longer afraid of what people think of me because as long as you're not being a complete asshole or creepy as fuck, nobody will care for more than a couple seconds If you say something silly or stutter. Nobody thinks as much about a person's flaws as much as that person does themselves. 

So my advice to you, try to get out and get involved in something that interests you. Anything at all. Doesn't matter what your age is or what the activity is, just get out there. You like books? Find a book club online and join. Like to collect antiques? Go to a convention and ask someone about their treasures. I know it will be extremely difficult at first to take that initial step, but once you do you will not only feel good that you did, you may just meet people you can relate to and form a relationship. Hey, you may not like what you participated in at first either, these things take time, but by making an attempt at it you will feel accomplished and may work up the confidence to try it again. You are certainly not alone on this.

As for books, I haven't read all that many yet that address the topic. One of them you may relate to, which someone posted earlier, is Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky. I think it captures the protagonist's anger of not being able to relate to most people, but he finds comfort and hope in a pair of upperclassmen. He also has a love for books and finds an unlikely friend in his English teacher. The audiobook by Noah Galvin was also good and I thought it brought out a lot if the emotions of the book. 

Head up, OP... things will get better if you choose to make them better! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Books similar to East of Eden by John Steinbeck? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-03 22:56:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I loved so many things about this book. I'm not looking for necessarily just the good vs evil type of story, nor the biblical aspect, but rather other things that captured me I would love to see in some other books.

Things I loved about it:

1. **Character Development and Connection** - The way the characters and their families were built up. I liked how it dedicates entire chapters to a story about a specific character, then brings them together so you feel like you know every one of them very well. The book also demonstrates each persons flaws and has them sometimes learn from their mistakes throughout the book. When the book is over you feel like you're saying goodbye to people you actually know. 

2. **The writing and prose** - I love Steinbecks writing. The way the sentences capture the surroundings and just make you feel like you're with the characters wherever they go. It is just a pleasure to read-- effortless and elegant flow.  Chapter 3 of East of Eden might be one of the single best chapters i've ever read, and when I read it thats when I was hooked. So far I have also read Cannery Row and Of Mice and Men and plan on reading basically all his other ones, so i'm moreso looking for recommendations on other authors that may be comparable. 

3. **The words of wisdom** - Basically the way it commentates on problems we can relate to and offers a new look on things. For example:

 "In human affairs of danger and delicacy successful conclusion is sharply limited by hurry. So often men trip by being in a rush. If one were properly to perform a difficult and subtle act, he should first inspect the end to be achieved and then, once he had accepted the end as desirable, he should forget it completely and concentrate solely on the means. By this method he would not be moved to false action by anxiety or hurry or fear. Very few people learn this."



Suggestions don't need to be as sprawling as EOE either. It was cool how the first half is focused on the father's life and then the second the life of his sons. However, it's not essential in what i'm looking for. 

Looking forward to ideas! Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read Five Presidents by Clint Hill recently which was fascinating to me. It covers Clint's time in the Secret Service from I believe 1958-1975. He's most known as the guy who jumped on to the back of JFK's limousine in an attempt to shield the president and first lady moments after the president was assassinated. While it doesn't go into a ton of detail about a single specific event, it does offer an interesting perspective from inside the White House and some details on a variety of the major events during that time. One interesting part for me was reading about the more human side of the presidents that he got to know from working so closely with. 

It's very straightforward and simple in it's writing, so you won't find anything extravagant there. However, his story still sucks you in and gives you a general knowledge of the major events during that time as well as an appreciation for the U.S. Secret Service. I also loved the photos that the book included.  </TEXT>
