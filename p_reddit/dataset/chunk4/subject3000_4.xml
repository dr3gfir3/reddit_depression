	<TEXT> A piano falling on my foot from 42,000 feet. It must land solely on one of my feet.

Completely possible, VERY improbable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This always confused me, Fox News is typically very conservative but the network itself usually has quite liberal shows.

The Simpsons

Family Guy

American Dad ('till TBS)

Futurama (at one time)

Glee

And I could go on and on.

	<TEXT> Off topic but I knew a lady once who'd keep diluting her dishsoap with water. To the point it was obviously just water in the bottle and she'd insist "it's just as good", I think in a year she literally only goes through 2 medium sized bottles. Needless to say, I never ate off her dishes/silverware. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was my first thought. Companies rarely (if they're smart they don't) pull games with years and lots of $$ put into them for no reason. This game has been a concept since 2007, and has been actively worked on since 2012 IF memory serves me right, so they didn't just pull the plug cuz "hey I'm bored, time to cancel a game or two". Unless they're Konami of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't understand this, don't get me wrong it's your opinion which is absolutely fine. But I own both systems and a PC and would rather there be no exclusives. Even when I only owned one console I wished there was no exclusives. I'd rather consoles/platforms sold on their OS/features and hardware rather than games being locked to them.

But you're entitled to your opinion, it's just one I have never understood and don't think I ever could. I actually commend Microsoft for the play anywhere intiative and it has strengthened my faith in them as a platform developer (XBox/Windows). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just replying to my comment instead of editing, I'm glad you got help/clean. And I'm sorry your ex couldn't be more empathetic, alcoholism runs in my family (I personally believe addiction is/can be genetic) and I try to avoid it for that reason. I drink only a couple drinks a year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Makes more sense now, like I said I wasn't trying to take any shots at you or AA and I figured there had to be a good reason but with no explanation for it it just seemed... Kind of rude I guess? But thanks for explaining, I now have a better understanding. I have a good friend who use to be in AA and still has a sponsor. He's 6 or 7 years clean now I believe but his liver is pretty shot but I've heard from him how AA helped him a lot, so I definitely think it's the answer for some and is a positive thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh, it just seems odd as by deeming someone (such as my dad) not an addict would dismiss/invalidate a ton of people who had addiction problems with alcohol.

I'm not taking a shot at you or AA or anything, but can you provide more insight on why they work their terminology that way? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My bio dad was an alcoholic for..... Most of his life, drove him and my mom apart, and him and all his girlfriends and another ex wife after. He is currently ~~5 years clean at age 58, says he woke up one day and just decided he didn't want to be an alcoholic anymore. He still has a beer on his birthday and New Years Eve so only 2 beers a year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't worry I caught the joke, kinda obvious when you said 37 FPS which is an odd number (I've seen people say 30 and 60 but not something oddly specific like 37, or 42) and used 1 FPS lower from the 38 you replied to was.

But sometimes...

The joke

	<TEXT> I felt like an idiot yesterday. Now I've always known Mark Hamill played Luke, and I've always known Mark Hamill voiced the Joker (IS the definitive Joker)... But for some reason I never made the connection between them being the same Mark Hamill's till now. I don't think I'll ever let myself live this down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This (and the comment above yours)! By all means weed should be legal, but I just hope people understand we haven't done much experimenting with super high doses of THC/weed. So yeah know it's hard to OD, but be responsible because bare minimum you could have an extreme panic attack, or try pushing the boundaries enough with edibles or dabbing and you may become the first OD. The last thing we need to give the anti-pot crowd is someone actually ODing on it, they'd eat that up like nothing else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Happens to me all the time and it's usually not a big deal/irrelevant. When talking about society as a whole I usually try to remember that the US makes up a relatively small part of that whole.
