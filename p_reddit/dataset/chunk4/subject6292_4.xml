	<TEXT> The point of life is to live it. My philosophy boils down to two words: Be. Enjoy.

Be the best you that you can be. Make yourself proud of you, in whatever small way you can. Be conscious, always, of what you REALLY need to be happy, and go after it - even if it's not what the world around you says it should be. You are gloriously unique, and no one else can tell you what that means.

Enjoy yourself to the best of your ability. Even in the most trying times, there will always be one thing that brings a smile to your face, or a smirk, or bemused sigh. Hold on to anything that brings you joy with a fierce grip, and if that's somehow gets torn away from you, don't mourn. Get your smile back. There's always something. If you can't find anything to enjoy, you're surely not doing something worthwhile.

Be. Enjoy.

But, above all else, *don't quit.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm... This is a toughie. Should I go with 7 years ago, when I had to wait by myself at home for a plumber to show (he never did) during a raging thunderstorm that killed the tv signal? Or maybe  6 years ago, when I turned 21 in my second week of basic training? Or perhaps when I was trapped in a military field training center for two weeks straight while my then-wife visited her dad five states away using the money I left her for emergencies, five years ago? Maybe four years ago, when I was in such a fog of antidepressants that I could barely function? Or, three years ago, when the woman I was divorcing refused to allow me to see my daughter for three months straight, centered more or less around that day? Perhaps two years ago, when I spent the entirety of the day sitting in a courtroom stressing over the final results of the custody hearing and the inevitable fallout regardless of the verdict (I won, fyi). And let's not forget last year, when I was locked in another training course that had me too busy to notice, and then my new wife miscarried the day after.

This year was pretty cool, though. Calm, quiet, boring. Wonderful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Suddenly, the banana leaps out of its peel, hurling it to the ground at my feet! It catches me mid-stride with perfect aim, and before I realize what's happening, I'm on my ass.

I stare in bewilderment as the pale fruit innards lands on the sidewalk, sprouting spindly arms and legs at the last instant. It hits with surprising grace, and I realize it's grown a face as well. It glares at me for a moment before drawing up to its full height (meanwhile providing me a good reference point for nearby objects).

"Hello," it snarls at me. "My name it Chiquita Banana. You ate my brother. Prepare to die!"

It leaps into the air with a battle cry that shakes me too my core, and I instinctively throw my right arm up in defense. My timing is off, and I feel a wet impact on my palm. A moment passes, and nothing happens.

I look around, and spot the banana lying in the grass, half smooshed and split in two. I breathe a sigh of relief as I wipe the pulp off of my palm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A week or so after new years day, I found an unused smoke bomb on the ground while waiting for the bus. I pocketed it for later, thinking nothing about it. Around lunchtime, I happened upon it in my pocket while digging for my lunch money. Didn't show anyone, but my friend noticed and asked me about it. I explained that I found it that morning, and wanted to use it when I got home, and the conversation moved on.

Half an hour after lunch, I was called to the principal's office. Apparently, someone had overheard me say that I had a smoke "bomb that I'm going to set off later," and reported me. When I revealed the tiny little firework to the principal, he looked at me with a pitying expression. I only got one day for that, but it was by far the dumbest reason for detention I ever had. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to work at a dairy queen. When I was brought into the kitchen for the first time, they ran me through the process of food prep for the day. Everything was fine until they placed a five-pound lump of ground beef into a metal bowl, filled it with water, and placed it on the stove. I asked what they were doing, and they explained that this was how they made their tacos. They leave the waterlogged meat on the stove for hours, not even completely covered, and basically boil it. Then they drain it, add a spice packet, and set it out on the line.

Exposed raw meat, sitting for hours just above water that never reaches a bacteria killing temperature. 

I couldn't serve that in good conscience, so when they weren't looking, I dumped the meat onto the stove and cooked it up properly. Took all of ten minutes. No one else ever cooked it that way, though, so to this day I won't order DQ tacos.

Of course, it might have just been done that way at this particular location. Also, it's been about six years, so maybe it's improved...but I still wouldn't risk it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was walking on the track around the football field at school, talking to some friends, when I suddenly had an image flash across my mind in vivid detail. It was an eyeball, outside of the socket. The iris was amber, with a starburst pattern and gold flecks. It was stitched up across one side with thin, translucent grey thread. It swelled briefly and then ruptured, starting at the stitches, and then exploding across the iris, which shredded like cotton fibers being drawn apart. Milky fluid spurted out, followed by a flow of red, yellow, and green chunks.

Then I blinked, and the image was gone. It took less than a second, but the details imprinted on my mind. I don't know where it came from, and don't know what it meant. I've never had a repeat occurrence, but it was so surprising that I have never forgotten it. </TEXT>

Locked his own species in an endless cycle of war and death, stole a magic time box, traverses time and space either causing genocide or destruction. Regularly upsets the status quo, provoking revolutions and violence. Kidnaps innocent people with promises of adventure, often throwing them into life threatening situations which they may or may not survive. Destroyed the universe - rebooted it so no one knew  - destroyed time - it got better - and worst of all, only cares about the consequences if they directly, immediately, and negatively affects someone he personally knows.

All in all, though, I love him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I understand where you're coming from (to a limited degree), I also feel that there is very little reason to complain about a situation or difficulty you decide to impose on yourself. If the barrier between you and your goals or desires came from a self-decided imposition or discrimination, then you've no foot to stand on - at least, by my reckoning.

This is how I feel whenever I see things that start with some form of "I want to, but..." The choice you make is yours. Either accept your own decision, or consider the fact that it might be worth revisiting, if it bothers you.

That said (and sorry if it sounded rude or inflammatory, not my intent), there are other options for you to experience the game in some way; however, most of these ring hollow when you lay them beside the actual gameplay experience. It's sort of like watching baseball/football/sports on TV when you could be a part of the action yourself, if only you weren't so lazy/afraid of pain/afraid you'd like it/reasons.

Okay, rant aside...

**TL/DR:** In gaming, as in analog life, there are certain things you will never experience if you don't step outside your comfort zone. Some are worth it, some aren't; but you'll never know what's what until you try. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been following this game since its infancy, and was one of the first to make my purchase when the stores opened (back when Wollay first launched it and nobody could log in). I played it with glee for several weeks before becoming bored, but I still felt I got my money's worth. This, by the way, in spite of the fact that I only played solo. It was a unique experience, albeit with a bit of a learning curve to it, and undoubtedly the most polished alpha game I've yet played.

Fast forward to last week. My daughter has gotten old enough that she wants to play games with me - by which she means, watch while I do everything for her. Cube world has shiny cartoony graphics, so I fired it up. After she spent ten minutes directing me on the character creation, I got to play a different class than I had before - warrior instead of mage. I had to completely rethink my approach and strategy, and all the while my little girl is watching with glee that I can't get from her with Minecraft or Trove or, hell, even Mario. 

TL/DR: Cube world is still fresh from a different approach, and my child enjoys playing it with me better than any other well-funded, big name, or franchised game out there.

TL/DR v2: Quality over quantity, anyday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd like to help if I can. Can you describe the problem a little clearer? Are there particular files you cannot find, or are you missing the entire cubeworld directory?

If the directory itself is missing, the only troubleshooting step I know is this: have you already run the launcher for the first time, and let it install fully? This may seem like a stupid question, but I'm pretty sure that this game works that way; just downloading the launcher isn't enough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This may just be me, but... It wasn't so much that it was boring, as it was disconnected from itself. I mean, each scene by itself was fine, but there was very little linking the story from point A to point B other than "By the way, go over there." I think it had a lot going for it, but it wasn't put together well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the reason why a former coworker was late, as he explained it to our boss. I will interject my observations, as I was present for the events he describes.

"I got a speeding ticket, it was bullshit."

First part true, second part not.

"He said I was going sixty in a fo'ty-five, but I tol' 'im my dash said fitty, so he dropped it to fitty-five"

Written in the same manner as he spoke. I was driving behind him, and witnessed the whole event; he was going *at least* sixty. I watched the cop turn around from heading the other direction to stop this guy.

"He singled me out because I'm black."

Two problems: first, his windows were tinted almost, if not actually, illegally dark. Like, 90% tinting. No way to tell he was black, if you don't stereotype based on the car's decorations. Second: the cop was black. I politely pointed that out to the guy.

"Yeah, but if I was white, you know he wouldn't have stopped me."

...cute.

"I tol' 'im, I ain't seen no speed limit sign, it was knocked over"

The cop had started to turn around to chase him down 50 yards past the speed limit sign.

"It ain't my fault, man."

Yeah. Totally.

What's worse, when this guy went in front of the judge later about the ticket (two months late for his court date, mind), he went in his military uniform and said "I don't really want to pay for this ticket." His own description of events, mind. The kicker? The judge let him off.

What. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The world is an exciting and unpredictable thing, full of interesting people and events which, by and large, go completely undocumented. There are people in this world who have a story to tell, but for some reason or another are unable to tell it themselves. That's where I come in. There's nothing special about me. I'm not rich, or privileged, or even that good looking. I've always been good at blending into a crowd, and I like it that way. My name doesn't matter, because the tales I tell are not about me. They are about those people I see while wandering through this life, people whose stories deserve to be told. However, if you must have a name for me, you can call me the narrator, the storyteller, or perhaps even simply the Watcher.

This is the story of Helen. She wasn't my friend. We'd never even spoken, in fact. The only reason I know her name at all is because I overheard it the night I noticed her. 

I spend a lot of time in my local bar these days, sipping on the same glass of poison from when I arrive to when I leave. There's no point in getting drunk to me, because if I do I lose track of the world and the faces around me. I've always been more of a people watcher than a people person, so I like to keep lucid and loose. What better place can there be to find a good story than where people go to let themselves out, the place where they peel the plastic veneer off of their faces and reveal who they truly are inside - and what demons are haunting them.

I'm not certain, really, what drew my attention to Helen in the first place. She wasn't anything like ugly, though certainly she'd never brighten a room with her smile. Average height, average build, brown hair in a style that, at the limits of my imagination, I can only describe as normal. She wasn't dressed to impress, didn't order fancy drinks. She was the sort of person who only went out of her way to not stand out, and perhaps that's what drew my attention. 

She appeared to my eyes at the bar, with the sort of expression you'd normally find on the spiritually troubled - as though her world had recently been turned upside-down and she was finding it hard to reconcile her troubles with God - if, in fact, she even believed in God. Perhaps she was just struggling to reconcile with herself.  It wasn't terribly hard to imagine, in this cruel world, that someone as plain as her might get overlooked regularly - accidentally forgotten, casually ignored.

She started the night with a straight shot of whiskey - a hard bite to dull the apparent pain in her heart. She downed a second, got the third mixed with cola on ice, and went to sip it at an empty table near me, facing away.

I noticed her straight elbow-length hair had a dent in the middle, which made me think she usually wore it up. Tonight, however, it was down and hanging free  a bit unkempt, even. Something had probably changed recently to make her break the trend. Maybe she no longer felt a need to maintain her appearance? If so, then why? My curiosity was piqued.

As I sipped on my drink, I saw her pull out her cell phone and start flipping through old pictures. Her back was to me, so I could clearly see the faces on all of them. There was a common one, a handsome fellow who shared almost all of his shots with her. His effect on her was unmistakable, because in each shot she wore such an unbelievably vibrant smile that her unimpressive face was transformed, beaming with a joy so pure as to bring awe to the heart of the most callous person.

Helen took a drink, and something splattered on the screen. I thought perhaps she spilled from her glass, but then she turned her head to wipe a tear from her cheek. I was beginning to get a picture here, a sense of her story. The man in the picture was loved, very much, and she lost him somehow. This was the source of her sorrow, the reason she appeared before me this evening in pursuit of mind numbing poisons - a feeble attempt to overwhelm her sorrow with a worthless mindlessness.

She sat there for some time, thumbing through the pictures beneath silent sobs and an ever increasing haze on her thoughts. Eventually, through some combination of nerve and alcohol, she started to delete the memories from her phone, destroying what I imagined to be the last link to her past with that man. When she finished, she carelessly tossed her phone across the table and downed the rest of her drink in one swig. She motioned to the bartender for another, then slumped over the table, shaking with silent sobs.

I had to wonder what had happened. How long ago had she lost this man, who she clearly loved so much? What had happened to him, and did he know how much she cared?

Her drink sat unnoticed for almost ten minutes before she pulled her head off the table. She took a quick sip, then gripped the glass with both hands on the table in front of her, head bobbing slightly to the music. I could tell that the liquor had taken its toll, that she was beyond caring what else there was in the world. To her, there was nothing but the thoughts in her head, which had become just foggy enough for her to bear.

Then he came in. The man from the pictures. At last I knew, the reason for Helen's sorrow. He walked in, every bit as handsome as he was in the pictures, and there on his arm, coming barely up to his shoulder, was a handsome young woman, with brown hair, an average build, not unpleasant features, and a quite youthful face that looked too much like Helen to be a coincidence. Here it was - this man had ended up either cheating on her, or dumping her for her relative - younger sister perhaps. 

None of them saw each other for the first few minutes. The man and young woman sat two tables away from Helen, oblivious to her presence as they downed their first round of drinks. It wasn't until the man said something that made the young woman laugh loudly that Helen jerked herself out of her stupor. I was still sitting behind her, so I couldn't see her face, but by her body language, she'd just adopted a most malevolent expression.

She downed what was left of her drink in one go, then rose unsteadily from her seat. I watched, transfixed with morbid curiosity, as she half stumbled toward the couple, toward the man who had wronged her so absolutely. She knocked a chair over as she approached, drawing the man's attention. His smile melted quickly at the sight of her.

"Helen?" he uttered, clearly surprised. "What are you doing here?"

She stood still for a moment, swaying slightly under the influence of the poison in her veins. Then, with a terrible crash, she shattered her empty glass across his temple.

The man dropped. The woman screamed. Helen shrieked, a terrible sound, filled with anguish, loathing, and a most terrible sorrow. The other patrons went silent at her cry, frozen in shock as the man slumped over to the floor, and a pool of blood slowly spread out from the wounds on the side of his head.

Before anyone could react, Helen stormed out of the bar. At that moment, the song on the jukebox ended, and there was a terrible, strained silence as everyone remaining struggled to come to terms with what they had just seen. Then, the young woman - Helen's sister, perhaps - screamed again. 

"Somebody call an ambulance!"

It didn't take long for things to get moving then. The bartender made the call, some other patron came up and bandaged the man's head, and the rest of us were ushered out for the night in short order. I at least had time to finish my drink, but no other stories presented themselves to me that night. 

As for Helen... well, as unfortunate as it is, this is the very reason I decided to share her story. The very next morning, as I read my newspaper, I came across a story of an unknown woman who had leapt in front of a moving eighteen wheeler in the early morning hours. The driver slammed on the brakes, which had made the trailer swing around and park itself inside of a nearby coffee shop. The woman had died instantly. Under the headline, there was a picture of the ambulance workers moving the woman on a stretcher, and I recognized the sleeve of Helen's blouse just barely visible from under the sheet.

Helen lost her dearest love to one of the other people she loved the most, and this caused her such sorrow that it cost her the last thing she should have held dear - her own life.

You should know that I share the stories I see not based on sorrow or pain, but on merit. Helen's story needed to be told, so that she might live on in your minds and hearts.
