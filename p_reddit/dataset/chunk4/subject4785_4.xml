	<TEXT> Hi there! I'd love to start up an anthro or humanized MLP: FiM role play. This would be a one-on-one role play, and you can be an OC or existing character. I'm looking for literate female partners, or guys that are willing to play female characters.
I'd like for the role play to start clean, then we'll see where it goes!

	<TITLE> In "District 9," a man is sprayed in the face by a foreign substance that turns him into one of the aliens he despises and mistreats. Would the same happen to Donald Trump if he sprayed himself opening a bottle of Tapatio? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's not real grammar. It's about a made-up term. I'm curious what the community thinks. I get I'm new and you consider yourself a reddit guru, but it doesn't mean the question doesn't deserve an answer. </TEXT>
