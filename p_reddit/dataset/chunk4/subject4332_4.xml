	<TEXT> I really can't stand the way Gargano yells into the mic.  I would tolerate his show when Macnow was on but now that he is off that show, I listen to music at work now instead.  Gargano's whole gimmick, talking about his kids - the 'violations' the cuz stuff - fuck that noise.  WIP really seemed to go all in with him when they did the format change at 94 WYSP. He was the one that announced the changes, it appeared to me that they were grooming him to become the replacement for Angelo when and if that happens.

I think the main reason WIP is set up the way it is, is due to the fact that the general Philly sports fan cares a LOT about Philly sports but when the teams are out of the running, they don't care.  So what does WIP do?  They try to make you listen when the teams are out of season or out of the running.  The whole water cooler concept.

I listen to Missanelli from time to time - he's another one that yells into the mic too much and also does the whole violation thing.  I guess I'm too old for that stuff but it seems like 4th grade to me. 

The people I enjoy the most on WIP in no particular order:

Ray Didinger - always enjoy hearing him speak on football.
Jody MacDonald - always fair even though he's a New Yorker.
Glen Macnow - he does the best job of talking about non-sports issues when things are slow.
Rob Ellis - another one with a high level knowledge of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think they won't because that would eliminate their ability to complete the money grab that they are conducting in NYC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I figured it had something to do with the programming in the ipac.  So if I follow this guide [Ipac and Jpac interactive programming   test mode](http://www.ultimarc.com/interact.html) I should be able to reassign the keys to something that is mappable right? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Assigning Keystrokes in MAME </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I have a question that I'm hoping someone can answer for me.

I have a CP I purchased pre-made from North Coast Custom Arcades several years ago:

http://www.mameroom.com/Products_QuadController.asp

I mated it to a MKII cabinet and have MAME and Daphne running on an old PC I cobbled together.  I played with it for a while then lost interest in it.  Now two of my kids are keen on playing it and want to see all the old games.

I've managed to assign keystrokes for many of the games including Tempest and Centipede.  One game that is giving me issues is Asteroids.  I can't get MAME to recognize any of the key presses (rotate left, rotate right, thrust, fire, hyperspace).  The key I would like to use for hyperspace is the same key I've assigned to fire in Tempest so I know the key can be assigned and is working.  When I try to manually assign the key in Asteroids by hitting Tab then selecting input for this game it does nothing when I press any of the keys that are laid out specifically for Asteroids.  When I look at the keys assigned for Tempest the fire button is assigned to MOUSE BO.

Any idea on what I need to do to assign the keys for Asteroids? You can see the buttons I'm looking at in this image:

They are the two buttons to the left and three to the right of the twister.

Thanks for your help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a larger size.  If you mention to the guy that I ordered the poster without the fight song he should be able to tell you what dimensions I went with.  Otherwise you will have to wait until I get home from work today to measure it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm very curious to see the responses here.  I have a 14yo son that is having a very difficult time finding things that interest him.  He is bright, has serious musical ability but no real 'desire' to expand it beyond what he has currently.  He does well in school but has serious issues with self motivating to do the work.  If we didn't stay on him he would never get anything done as he would get focused on his one true interest (Pokemon) and spend every waking moment, playing the games and watching youtube videos about them.

My wife and I really wonder what he's going to end up doing in 4 years when he graduates.  I don't think he will have an option for 'government support' and even if it allowed him to live with us - what is he going to do when we are gone? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The artist is very easy to work with.  I asked him to make some changes to the layout of the Eagles poster (I took out the fight song and replaced it with the championship years) and he shot me a proof in less than 24 hours.  I got one for my son and bought one for myself for the mancave. </TEXT>
