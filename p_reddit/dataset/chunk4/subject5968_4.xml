	<TEXT> Juuuuust got the Chopper drop I guess as a consolation gift for getting absolutely clubbed by some japanese guy. 

Just looking at it, at level 1 it's already most of the way toward being as good as my lvl 13 stock Tomcat-A. 
Should be a fun plane to fly in; the question is, do I shelve my stock A model in pursuit of buffing out the Chopper-A, or do I stick with my standard?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, if not for the fact that Captain Snow just happened to be available to fill an empty position as the #4 pilot, not only did Chopper destroy a government owned aircraft, he also destroyed military biological property by getting himself killed.

If you think I'm kidding on the second part, consult the UCMJ that governs the real world U.S. Military and you'll see that any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine that inflicts bodily damage upon themselves, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can actually be tried and punished under UCMJ laws. Yes, you heard right: if a military member gets themselves hurt or killed for a stupid reason, they can actually be punished for it after the fact. 

Let that sink in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished in the top 5,000. First event I've participated in. I played a couple rounds today and realized it's almost pointless to play outside of events. No fuel bonuses, shitty rewards, and almost no good rooms open. Hopefully next event goes well. 

How much stocked fuel should I add on top of the 30 units I already have? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> clear the map before everyone else does and time your attacks to be the guy who finishes off the last target in any emergency mission that pops up. Sounds basic, but that's what I'm watching all these other high MR guys/girls do. Seems to be that whoever tags the last TGT kill on any emergency mission update usually MVP's the match. 

Some clubber rolled into a room the other day with the ADF-01 or whatever and had the multi purpose burst missile as his SPW. It was like watching art; homeboy just hung back and absolutely demolished the map in about 4 shots. I was stunned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That mission is also extremely buggy. I got stuck in a room where, no matter how low I flew (and I made it down to less than 100 feet, attempting to flee), the missiles always tracked and destroyed me. THEN, to make matters worse, the whole thing bugged and I got stuck in the room for a solid 10 minutes after the mission time ran out and the whole thing was over. 

Just death, after death, after death. I had to unplug the entire PS3 to make it stop. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember reading a story somewhere about the Wendigo and that it tended to possess people and then suck them up into the sky. Interestingly enough, as the person grew gradually more possessed, their stride lengthened significantly, as if they were learning to walk/run in great leaps and bounds rather than their old, normal gait. Eventually, those great big steps led to them leaving the ground and never coming back down, although their voice could clearly be heard on the wind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For real, though. 

I'm an EMT and an Army medic, and I'm constantly telling soldiers, "if you feel your body start to tell you anything, whether it's 'feed me', 'lay down', 'I'm thirsty', 'I sense something dangerous': LISTEN TO IT." 

We have this kick-ass left over animal instinct that tells us to eat when we're hungry, be quiet when we sense danger, and RUN when we know we're in trouble.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think OP has stressed this enough, but the message is pretty clear: DO NOT GO ON HIKING, CAMPING, OR BACKPACKING TRIPS ALONE. 

Always have a buddy/buddies, tell someone when you are leaving, where you are going, who else is going with you, what time/day you plan to return, and what to do/who to call if you don't come back on time. 

I don't have any particularly frightening tales from my times when I've worked at boy scout camps and roamed the Ouachita National Forest, but I do have a story to back up my statement I made above. A friend and I had planned a Spring Break backpacking trip into the Ozark Mountains along the Buffalo river valley in the western part of the state. What we failed to realize was that the weather was as bad, if not worse, than it had been the previous year, when a group of campers had been flooded, overwhelmed, and drowned by a rapid rise in the water level of the Buffalo River. 

On the second day we were out, we probably hiked around 11 miles and came to a stopping point on a well-established trail about 3/4ths of a mile from the river and atop a ridge that was easily 30 to 40 feet above the water level of the river. 

We made camp, cooked some food, and climbed into our tent for the night at around 8:45 or 9:00 PM. I woke up at about 2:30 AM freezing and wet, and realized that loose items in the tent were either completely soaked or *floating* in about 2 inches of water that had crept through the tent flap. Then I heard the rushing sound of swift water moving past our campsite no more than 30 feet from the tent. 

I got out of the tent and saw that the river had risen *at least* 25 feet in the time between us calling it a night and our startled awakening. We broke camp, gathered what trash and gear we could that wasn't submerged or actively floating away, and made for the trail head that was about a mile distant. 

This is all a very long story to make a very short point, I apologize. But when we made it back to the trail head that led to a bridge crossing the river, we realized just how much danger we had just escaped from; the river was flowing *over* the footbridge leading back to the parking area and the only place on the trail head and it's small picnic grounds that wasn't filled with water were the unisex latrine huts. My friend and I spent a very cold, damp night sleeping next to a literal shit hole, waiting for the water to recede so we could get back to my truck.

Had I been alone on the trip, like I had been planning to be originally, things could have gone very differently. I don't know if I was more alert that night because I subconsciously knew that I needed to keep my friend alive, as well as myself, but I am sure glad he was there with me, and that we told people where we were going and when we planned to be back. 

TL;DR: always have a contingency plan that will allow people to begin looking for you if you go missing in the woods. Communicate, communicate, communicate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> rooooooooger that on the 12 gauge. I'd love to be able to afford a short-barrel, short-stock 12 to be able to strap to my hiking pack or just sling across me when I go out. Knowing that I have that protection would definitely help me sleep better and travel with less stress when I'm out there.
