	<TEXT> Hey. So I've been downvoted a lot, and my current replies will probably garner more, but I think this comment is the worst. I've seen people shouting at strangers, screaming, pissing, puking, dropping trash and food all over the TTC since I've lived in Toronto.

But yeah, fuck the music, amirite? Those people are literally Hitler. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> An Open Letter to a Subway Bully (or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Call Strangers on Their Bullshit) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-09 04:36:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT, 24 hours later, amidst a hail of downvotes:

Nice to know how you all feel about defending people with disabilities against assholes. Carry on, /r/toronto

---

Fuck you, Subway Bully.

You must have heard, from half a car away, the blues riff singing out from your target's phone, as it had for the last three stops. Maybe you thought, "Well, it isn't that loud. But damned if I'm not going to make a statement." Maybe you truly thought that it was too loud. How can anyone know what went through your mind.

I heard it too, those soft, quiet songs. Blues guitar and harmonica colliding to make beautiful, lonely tunes. I know my mind. I thought, "Shit, I've heard that one already on this ride. Get a better shuffle," and was annoyed, but didn't look up from my book. The Listener asked of the people around him "Do you like this song? What about this one?" with eagerness. He was excited to show off his catalogue. His fellow passengers encouraged him. "It's nice," they told him, "That one sounds great."

From down the car, with me between you and him, you alerted the Listener to your feelings. "Hey, can you turn that off? We can all hear it!" The Listener, taken aback, muted his song quickly. His friend (newly made, or not? I never found out) coaxed him to turn it up ever so slightly, even quieter than before. You, Subway Bully, began gesticulating wildly. I speak no sign language and, clearly, neither do you, since I could read you signals loud and clear. "We can ALLLL hear you. Turn it off!" you mimed, gaining titters of amusement from your cohorts (they were also old enough to know better).

The Listener, now confused, chose to ignore this stranger flailing at him. Angered, you stand, walk a length closer and raise your voice, "We can all hear it, maybe you can shut it off now." 

When I told you, then, that maybe it wasn't bothering everyone else as much as you, you became angry at me! "His music is annoying" you said with disdain. "It's public transit, it should be quiet." 

I was confused. "The only thing annoying me is you shouting." You told me "Then go back to your book!" More words were exchanged, as you exited the train. With you claiming politeness, while I claimed you a dick.

My stop was next. But in those brief moments between, several people apologized to The Listener, and thanked me. I was upset. Why now, when the Bully had left? Why not then, when he needed your help? I apologized to him then, and suggested similar artists, and left, angry.

Does it really take a man like me, who hates confrontation? Who literally cannot even remember the correct, PC term for someone who is mentally handicapped? Whose library of off-colour humour should be left to a university when he dies, so vast and inappropriate it is? Does it take a man like me, then, to step between a bully and a mentally handicapped person in public? That is what really makes me angry.

In closing, Fuck You Subway Bully. Sideways, dry, and angry. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Questions about Rescue Diver course </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-07 21:58:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was thinking of getting my s/o this course for Christmas, since she has been wanting to upgrade. Since I am newer to the scene, I was hoping someone could clue me in.

I have spoken to two dive shops (both PADI certified). The first offered me a one-day DAN course (225CDN) in advance of the full rescue diver course. Is this necessary? I feel from reading online that the St. John's or equivalent first aid course serves the same purpose?

(edit: I guess the unspoken question is: are these guys just trying to get more money for a not-entirely-necessary course?)

The second shop just offers the full, multi-day course for ~500CDN. They didn't go into too much detail regarding the contents of the course.

Any info on helping her achieve this next step would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey. I was in essentially the opposite position last year. And I am still super-new, but for my two cents: 

My s/o had previous dive experience, and wanted me to join. I did my open water checkout, and wasn't terribly enthused (borderline frightened), but didn't want to dismiss it out of hand. With our certs in hand, we went on a liveaboard for 3 days of diving, me not knowing how I would come out.

Absolutely loved it. Being in the pool (and in my case a small lake) is no way to judge how you will feel about diving. The moment I got in the water and figured out how to apply my new learning in an actual environment vs. a shallow pool or murky lake, I was in forever. Complete gamechanger, getting out in the world. I was able to get over my misgivings and then some. 

Reading your other comment, she should be prepared to be tired *after* the dives for sure. We were beat after each day, barely having time/energy to eat and drink the permitted amount of beer.

Luck may have something to do with it, as well. We saw nothing but bloody parrotfish our first day, but I accepted the experience as being enough. That said, when you see a turtle or a shark come into view, it really makes it all worthwhile!

I know where she is coming from, I've been there, so please feel free to quote me, a stranger from the internet, in your drive to convince her. And good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Other people have said most of what I would say. For boiling water, a Jetboil is excellent. Or a small compact stove (for those delicious raviolis).

Better tents, and the shelter that was suggested are huge. Our first time at a music festival we made a lot of good friends just by having a shelter everyone could hide under from rain/sun.

Another thing: Choose who you go to festivals with wisely. I've been to a few, and sometimes you get a real turd in your group. If they're a dick, why have them back? Be honest about it. Don't let someone bring your good vibes down. </TEXT>

Jorge Luis Borges was a master of the form, and wrote many that sucked me right in. Just on the edge of the fantastic, and beautifully written.

Stephen King also has quite a few collection. Different Seasons has a few longer stories for you to lose yourself in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might be a bit of a time investment, but Robertson Davies' Deptford Trilogy might interest you. Been a few years since my last re-read, but it follows three boys growing up in rural Canada from boyhood, to manhood, to late adulthood. One of the characters, Paul, goes on just such a journey, but I think his story doesn't play out in detail until the second or third book.

One of my favourite (set of) books.

	<TEXT> **Annihilation by Jeff Vandermeer**

Boring. So boring. I don't know. I saw it on /r/books and some 'best of' lists. It dragged. The narrator was almost completely unlikeable. Sometimes a story that drags on can be saved by relatable, or at least interesting characters. I just didn't care. What was the point? I know there are two more books but I have *zero* interest. I almost put it down. I almost threw it out the window or left it on the subway with a giant 'Don't Bother' sticker on it. Was there supposed to be tension building? Dread? I felt nothing! Narrator wanders through swamp seeing weird-ass stuff. Narrator reacts like robot. Nothing is revealed. Cliffhanger for the next book? Non-existent.

0/5 living writings on the wall.

That said, feel free to try and change my mind. </TEXT>

So not really dependant on the movie. More just location, and the culture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I work with epoxies frequently. Nothing fancy like these, more industrial coatings. And there are meatheads who don't wear respirators. They are meatheads. And it shows. All kinds of protection should be worn. And people should be trained to use whatever poisonous/carcinogenic/mutagenic products they are working with.

	<TEXT> When an author uses words that a character wouldn't use, usually based on their country/region (like /u/arch_maniac mentioned).

For example, in The Long Earth, Joshua uses a few British words that I don't imagine an American would say. Specific examples escape me, at the moment, but it really took me out of the story. I felt I was hearing the author(s) speak, rather than the character. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on your trade. As a painter, we pull 32/hour, nowhere near 150k. But you are dead on about the "work stability". Seasons and construction phases affect many guys, but if you are in the GTA, work is usually steady. Speaking to your other comment, -35 is a no-go for many trades, usually considered too cold to safely work. Well, if you mention that, you may risk the ire of the foreman/super/owner, but that's your choice, I suppose.

And dude, if you are sick of faking it, educate yourself where you can. </TEXT>
