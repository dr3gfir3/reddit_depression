	<TEXT> Seriously, the n4 is my favourite phone ever, if not for the lackluster (nonremovable) battery/camera and expandable storage I would have stayed. I'm still running the latest MM Chroma build and it flies!

I've used my friends' nexus 5, galaxy s6 edge, note 4, iPhone 6 and 6S, and I "upgraded" to the LG G3... but damn I miss the n4 as a daily driver. If not for a broken back, it would be the most beautiful phone. The dev community behind it is great, rooting is a breeze, troubleshooting and tinkering with ROMs/kernels is great because of the pure personalized OWNERSHIP. Non-nexi are locked down to what an OEM allows them to do, sure skins and shortcuts, S features and whatnot are. Not to discount the OEM skins and their additional features, useful as they are, but a Nexus experience is something to behold. 

I'd be lying if I weren't slightly waiting for my G3 to be sent for repairs or something so I can boot up the n4 again haha.

google/nexus program pls make n4x but like removable battery/dope camera/expandable storage pls goob </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AVancity reportsays therefugeesexpected to arrive in B.C.between now and the end of Februaryare expected to generate $563 million in local economic activity over the next20 years. 
The credit unit found that immigrants tend to strengthen the economy in their new communities because they often purchase goods and services within their local community networks.
The report also points to immigrants being highly entrepreneurial as they are 30 per cent more likely to start a business than non-immigrants.
Refugees also report higher rates of self-employment than both other immigrants and people born in Canada, according to Vancity.

	<TEXT> Aristotle thought that consciousness resided in the heart, the brain being a cooling mechanism for the blood. Descartes theorized Mind-body dualism, suggesting the pineal gland was where mind-body interacted after studying the circulating cerebrospinal fluid, later dissection. Andreas Vesalius proposed the brain was made up of seven pairs of 'brain nerves', each with a specialized function.
