	<TEXT> I have my air roll bound to my left analog stick on Xbox One controller. Took a while to get used to, but now that I have it down I can rotate my car and angle it the way I want the ball to hit it simultaneously.

If you're looking to improve on aerials/walls/redirects I personally would recommend giving it a shot! It's helped me improve on my mechanical skills tremendously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have mine bound to my left analog stick so while I'm rotating my car I can also control the angle where I want the ball to hit. It's like having double control with just one buttonS

It's helped me soooo soooo much and since I've learned it I can't myself to bind it to any other key. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're rotating, getting clears and making saves, you're getting just as many if not more points as someone always ball chasing and taking shots. A save is 30 points and a clear is 20, on top of 10 for an aerial hits you get for saves and whatnot. That gives you tons of opportunity to score points even as a backline/support player. 

People who ball chase will obviously get points for taking shots and hopefully making them if they're not too toxic. Just saying your philosophy isn't as one way as you may think it is </TEXT>
