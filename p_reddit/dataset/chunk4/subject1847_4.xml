	<TEXT> What type of business did you engage in?  Computer Software

When did you set up your business?  I founded my first software company in 1998 (sold in 2001), next 2002 (sold in 2007), and current founded in 2009.

Were there other similar businesses when you set up your business?  yes.

What problem did you have to face during the initial years of your business?  For the first company it was the financial difficulties of getting started.  It is capital intensive to get going. 
 
How did you solve this/these problem/s?  I funded my first company personally and did not take pay for 3 years.

How is your business doing now?  Current business is growing fast and with that a whole new set of issues to solve.  :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can offer the reverse:   My Mom.

In kindergarten my mom was brought in as a substitute teacher.  At first I was excited because, well, it was mommy.

But when I tried to go up to her and hug her she pushed me away and said "Not here.  Here I am your teacher."

It confused the hell out of me for a long time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what OP is aiming for here is something along the lines of Joss Whedon's super-PAC and anti-trump PSA yesterday.

Let's say you *love* RDJ.  Absolutely love him.  Oh, and you are a huge Trump supporter.  Are you offended when someone you really love as an actor and respect for publicly rebuffs essentially your core political (and possibly religious) beliefs.  

Are you able to separate the art from the perceived slight from someone famous that you really like?

At least that's my take on OP's question.

EDIT: I thought of some examples that might clarify - Jane Fonda and The Dixie Chicks.  When someone that is a fixture in pop culture comes out forcefully against something that you might support how do you reconcile that you still like the artist?  In the two examples provided both parties paid handsomely for having views that were contrary to their core audience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I visited Venezuela in 1999.  On the way from Caracus to a seaside resort we passed a family on the side of the road.  They were totally naked and trying to sell a bunch of bananas to passing cars.  Standing next to a banana tree.

That one humanized the situation for me because in Caracus the slums on the hills are simply overwhelming.  Unbelievable people have to live in that squalor and the higher up the hill you are the more "successful" you are because we all know what rolls downhill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 52yo here just to state my opinion.

When I was younger I fell into the "credit" trap and it is even worse today.  "Oh, you need credit so that you can develop a credit score".  Bullshit.  

Once you have credit history and a credit score all that does is drive more offers of credit that drive you deeper and deeper in debt.

"Oh but I'm very conservative and I always pay it off every month".  Until you don't.  "Just this once I can let it roll over because I have out of the ordinary expenses this month for x".  Before you can blink you will *always* have debt - and more debt.

I realize that when you are young you need that bit of help it feels like to get things "greased" and moving in the right direction.  We have all done it.

But the sooner you realize that debt is the devil, PAY IT OFF! and then never do it again.

"If you can't pay cash for it, don't buy it."  My dad told me this but I didn't listen.  Finally once it sunk in I got out of the hole and we never used credit for anything ever again.

Amazing how much stress that relieves from your life.

Advice is worth what you paid for it. :) </TEXT>

The swearing is bad enough but then I have children and I do realize that in the heat of a moment sometimes you slip.  This is beyond that.

And in my opinion the more damnable behavior is bringing race into a situation where it has no business.  If this had been a white person screaming "look at those poor black people kids!  Look at those money-hungry poor black people trying to steal from us" this post would explode. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well what I got from the video was:

- She says her son didn't ding the door but clearly her son admits it and even points to where on the door he hit it.
- She does say OP yelled at her before recording but would love to hear OP's side of that.  I find it a little hard to believe that OP was flying off the handle one minute and then calmly dealing with the situation for the next six.
- She screams obscenities in front of her children as well as making multiple racist statements about OP and his family.

My wild guess is that her boy dinged the door and OP said something about it.  She got belligerent and started screaming and making a scene and that's when OP decided to call the police not to report the damage specifically but also to deal with the unhinged woman.

OP - care to answer some questions people are interested to know about what happened exactly before the tape was rolling?  </TEXT>

That said, this is the list of ALL 4-star generals, past and present: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_States_Army_four-star_generals

Now for my apology.  I was incorrect.  I went to the link above expecting to find my Uncle Tom and he was not there.  A quick google showed that I was incorrect.  He was a 3-star general.  Here's his wiki entry: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Tackaberry

Regardless, I did confirm the total number of "living" stars in the family is correct at 11.

Seems both of us made incorrect assumptions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh at every family get-together there are always some very interesting discussions and that's pretty much what I distilled here.

Those that are older see the military through rose-colored 1940's glasses.  They don't seem to understand the world is much different than it was back in the WWII days.  Conversations always turn to the sacrifice that was made and thus the solemn duty to provide world-class pensions and health-care.  While I appreciate people's service they chose the military just as anyone chooses a job.  And while they should have good benefits they shouldn't somehow have something beyond what the rest of America has.  

Then for the younger crowd there is still a defense of military culture but you can sense from them that they do not agree with the endless wars and engagements that are driving so many out of the service and they do believe that the military needs to be re-invented for the 21st century.

Of course they want bigger budgets, larger pensions, and better healthcare.   They just don't seem to understand that nowadays NO ONE other than government employees have a pension and healthcare costs are skyrocketing for everyone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 4 star general in the family and a total of 11 stars.  I'm not one of them.

The waste and fraud in the military is not a reason to keep throwing more money at the military.  Especially when you consider that the reason we are wasting so much money is on unnecessary wars and "outsourcing" of military work to for-profit companies.  Companies like Haliburton.

Which was run by who?  I can't remember but seems it was someone that just might have had some influence into starting these wars in the first place and then outsourcing the vast majority of support operations to a company he was the former CEO of.   /s 

Edit: Also, retired military are worried first and foremost about their pensions and healthcare and ensuring that those are protected and growing benefits for them. </TEXT>

Military spending has been the rise for decades with the *only* pull back being since the Iraq withdrawal over the past 4 or 5 years.

	<TEXT> I'll break them down as Stupid Kid Scars and Old Person Scars.

SKS:
- back of head where I held my breath and stood up to see if I would pass out and fell on a glass coffee table
- left hand where I punched a glass window out
- left shin where I slide into base and there was a piece of glass
- left eyebrow where I fell on metal edging of a sidewalk
- left index finger where I cut it off on a meat cutter working at a pizza shop
- right hip where socket rebuilt after a car accident

OPS:
- nape of neck to mid-back from four neck fusion surgeries
- left knee from knee replacement

I had a lot more fun getting the SKS ones but the OPS ones are usually late life fallout from being a stupid kid once. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are agreeing to it.  If portions are deemed unenforceable so be it but it would cost someone he sues a lot of money before the whole things is thrown out.

Have you ever been involved in litigation?  People that haven't seem to think it's like traffic court - show up and state your case.  It doesn't work that way.

If there is a venue clause and he files against someone in, say, NY state and he can find a way through his "irreparable damage" clause to create an inflated claim over $75k he gets this filed in Federal Court.

The defendant (most likely out of state) has to answer the complaint.  To do that will most likely require either NY counsel directly or two lawyers - one in the defendants local access area and an attorney licensed in NY to server as "local counsel".

When you are the defendant there is no such thing as getting an attorney to take a case on "contingency".  That means defendant will have to fork over a retainer fee that will most likely be north of 10k.  And that's before a finger is lifted.

And it only gets uglier from there and without "loser pays" tort reform even if it is eventually thrown out the defendant is not going to get their attorney fees back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can tell you from experience it makes no matter whether or not a court would uphold his side.  

Our legal system, when used by the wealthy is basically just a big bully enabler.  He can ruin anyone that he wants simply by suing them and they are immediately going to be financially damaged.

Further, I didn't read the whole thing but is there a venue clause int here they are agreeing to?  I would suspect there is.  These unwitting people that volunteer and sign this have no understanding that if he wants to sue them over something, and the venue is set (bet it's NY) the defendant will most likely be out of state and will have to hire NY counsel to even try to defend themselves - which will be very, very expensive. </TEXT>

In college I hollowed out my very "neat-freak" roommate's bar of soap and filled it with red rite dye.  Then plugged the hole back with  a plug of soap.

It must have been two weeks later when he came storming back into our dorm room soaking wet in his towel with red streams dripping off of him screaming at me.

Until my mid-thirties I could recall the most minor detail of any meeting that I ever had.  I could tell you who attended a business meeting, where they sat, what each person said, etc.  It was a very useful tool in my line of work.

Now 52 and while people still comment on how great my memory is I find that the details are just not there anymore. 

Sometimes I don't even remember a meeting that happened.  And if I do remember it now it all seems "fuzzy".  The context is still there and the overall recollection of what was decided but the "visual" step-by-step, detailed memory simply isn't there any more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some years ago I became friends with a couple of co-workers and we started going to lunch together.  One was a woman that I had a crush on (now my wife of nearly 20 years :P) and a guy slightly younger than me.  He was really cool to hang out with and a good conversationalist.  We all got along great and enjoyed hanging out after work sometimes too.

One day it was just the guy and me having lunch.  I noticed a gay couple at the next table and they were kissing.  I must have made a face or something because he asked me if I had an issue with it.  I told him that I didn't but seeing them kissing in public made me uncomfortable for some reason.

I guess the timing seemed right so he dropped on me that he was gay.  I told him that it didn't bother me and he was my friend and his revelation didn't change him in my eyes at all.

Then he said "If we are going to be absolutely honest with each other, I think you are really handsome and I have a huge crush on you".

Being kinda of a nerdy computer guy that was never popular with women I was actually beyond flattered that someone of either sex would say that to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It actually is very easy and inexpensive.

The flat LED round fixtures (large) are about $70 at THD or Lowes.  Dimmer is $15.  You can basically do a room for $100.

It is also very easy for the DIY'er.  You really don't have to know much about electricity to do it right.  

1) turn on the light
2) turn off the breaker and make sure the light went out
3) remove the old fixture.  In most cases you will just see two coated wires and the ground.  If you see more than that it might be beyond your abilities unless you have a little knowledge of electrical work.
4) rewire the new fixture matching to the existing wires
5) pull the switch.  If there are just the two coated wires and ground you are good to replace it with your dimmer.  As with the fixture, if there are other wires you need to do a little more work with a voltage meter to know what you are dealing with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but rather than an "up/down" stopper you can use a drain grate like OP.

Another example is light-fixtures.  We went through the house and removed all light fixtures.  Light fixtures always seem to become "dated" as tastes change.  We went with flat round LEDs for all ceiling fixtures.

The are plain, low-profile and really light a room up.  We put them all on dimmers so that light level can be controlled to the occasion.

We use other furniture, rugs, and wall hangings that are easily moved/replaced to provide the color and character that we want in a room. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is so cool!

We have been building out our dream house for the past few years and are constantly asking the question "why do we have to do it that way?".  

It just seems like there are so many building "norms" that people just become accustomed to so they never think of a different way to do things.

For instance, I love your drain.  No stopper.  We removed stoppers from our bathroom sinks because once we thought about my wife and I could not think of one time in 30 years that we ever filled up a bathroom sink.  But you know what?  Over thirty years I have had to clean those damn things out over and over.  Why have them?

That's just one of many "norms" in houses that if you are willing to think outside the box and create something that works for you and you are happy with - Go for it!

Dare to be different.  :)

Great work OP! </TEXT>

I have learned a boat load about horses just by listening to her stories every night.  I know a forelock from a withers.  I have pulled a foal out of a mare (never thought I would do that!).  And every night she tells me about what she did in the barn or on the trail and she lights up, so I love listening.

Conversely, when I come back up to the house from our lake and I just caught a 10+ bass and I'm all excited telling her about it I can see she is happy to hear because she can see I'm happy.

	<TEXT> LOL.  This hit home.  

My wife and I are both software developers.  That's how we met.  So not a "hobby" but definitely a big part of our intellectual lives.

We still find ourselves sitting together sometimes discussing code ideas but that doesn't happen as much any more since I'm really not allowed to code much anymore.  She's still deep in it so sometimes she'll ask my opinion and we'll do some design-on-the-fly.

For the record, worked our pretty well.  We have founded, built, and sold two software companies and we are on our third now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any thing can work it's really a question of personalities.

On problem that can occur is that men are "problem solvers".  If you add an "A" type personality it can get dicey.

So your SO is an accomplished photographer.  You can be interested and "dabble" but you need to make sure that you don't start trying to "become the expert".  When you start telling her how best to compose a shot or what exposure to use, etc. - that's when it will get tricky.  

But if you aren't an A-type personality and you can approach your partner's passion inquisitively, sure. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about using whole pine logs as beams. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-15 23:38:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi.  I recently found this sub and love it.  You guys are a wealth of information.

So I am currently building a "hobbit house".  I have completed the excavation and I am starting to think through the superstructure.

I have been clearing a different area where I am building a lake cabin and from that work I have probably a dozen extremely straight pine logs that I have cut to 30-35'.  They are anywhere from 12-24" in diameter.  I also have some random oaks that I took down - not sure what I'm doing with those yet.

The roof will sort of a low-slung A-frame.  My thought right now is to have the largest of the pine logs act as the main center beam and then have "ribs" coming into that with mortise and tenon joints.

So question - what's the best way to remove the bark from a pine log efficiently?

Since I am not cutting the logs I assume I don't have too much to worry about with regard to twisting, correct?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

My daughter rode her whole life to so me and the boys would go along to the shows when they had them to watch my daughter.  But now that they are grown it is *strictly* my wife's thing.

And once she tried to "train me".  1 day, 1 ride, 2 sore balls - nope this sport is not for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Point taken.  

I think your example works for a couple that likes to hike or cycle together - something like that.

But what I was trying to convey is that something that is *important* to you and that you spend an adequate amount of time pursuing is what you should do separately.  If you have some "hobby" that you do once or twice a year that might not give you the "me time" needed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How thick of a layer of epoxy does this provide? 

I am finishing an office in my detached garage and still trying to figure out what I want to do with the floor.  

I want to do something unique so I've been wondering if there was a way to put down material (like I've seen someone use pennies) and then cover it with like a 1/4 of epoxy. 

Is that doable? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sucks.  

Horses are a very labor/time intensive hobby but then so is motorbiking so as long as you guys organized your "me time" to occur on the same days I would have thought that would be a match made in heaven.

I have a lake and get out there bass fishing when I can in the evenings.  Always nice to see my wife ride by on a horse and wave to her.  We're both having fun and then we regroup up at the house for a Mount Gay and Coke later to "debrief". :)

Sorry things didn't work out for you man.  You had the right idea but the wrong girl.  :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like my first wife (note: now ex-wife).

When your hobby is "spending time with your partner" you are setting yourself up for a co-dependent relationship.

My second (and final!) wife was 180 degrees different.  We love to spend time together but we also both enjoy our "separate lives".  She has her horsey friends she hangs out with.  Me?  I'm more of a loner so I really don't want people around me when I'm having "me time".  But I do go on "Guys Weekend Outs" a couple times a year with my old college buddies and she actually gets excited for when we are going and to hear the stories when I get back.  

Hope it works out for you but hopefully you can get her to understand "me time". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great point on the internet but honestly I don't want to be stuck inside even with the internet.  I live to be outside building something, fishing, or just wandering around the woods.  When I can't physically do that I hate the idea of just wasting away.

I work just because it is hard to unplug in my job.  You get sucked in and before you know it 7 years has gone by (at my current job).

But like I said, several things in the past couple of months have started to make me take stock.  I have never been one to care about money and "keeping up with the Jones" so that makes it a lot easier to think about the next stage of my life.

I won't ever need to worry about money so I really need to start worrying about ensuring I enjoy every minute and every day I have left.  For a long time that had been my motto but lately I've found myself too focused and stressed about things that are out of my control (the election for instance) and I just need to take this opportunity to step back from my job and find a better balance.

Thanks for listening.

Amazing what one hour with a stranger can do to help crystalize your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks.  He really was a nice guy but I have to tell you this conversation along with several others lately are really making me start to take stock of my life.

This guy had happy vibrant life.  He was born and raised in rural GA but when he was younger he lived in Atlanta and was a construction manager.  He told me many stories about their lives and there were a lot of parallels to mine.

I was born in a small farming town, lived a fairly happy young life, grew up, moved to cities for work, and then 20 years ago began a shift to the suburbs, and then 4 years ago - to our dream place - a large horse farm in the country.  I'm 52 with the medical problems of a 70yo.  Too many surgeries and damage from my younger, carefree years.

But I'm still commuting to ATL for work.  I putting in 4 hour daily commutes plus long work days.  For what?  I've made my money.  I have all I need.

Now I look at this man and see someone that had a similar trajectory and now is tired, broken, and in pain.  Living his life pretty much locked inside his house.  What kind of life is that?

So I guess in my rambling way I'm saying "is this what we all have to look forward to?" and if it is then I DAMN WELL want to make the most of my next 20 years before that is my fate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your *main* hobby.  To be married for a long time and have a happy marriage it is important that each partner has something that is "theirs".  It's fine to have shared hobbies but everyone needs something that they can call their own.

Definitely show interest in your partner's hobby but because it is not something you have a deep focus on that allows you to ask questions and learn while your partner feels more "in control" and owns that conversation.

Obviously you will have the same situation in reverse for your favorite hobby.

For instance, my wife breeds and rides horses.  I hate them.  But I enjoy hearing about the fun she had with her horses in the evening.

I love comic books and fishing.  She enjoys hearing my stories about the things I am passionate about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL. That was a rollercoaster.

So I agreed to drive up to meet the guy on Saturday morning. He sounded pretty old so I figured it might be better for me to go visit him to see if he had anything good rather than wait for him to come to my place with the books in tow for a trade.

We agreed to meet in the parking lot of a small grocery store near where he lived. I saw an old man sitting in the black Ford Explorer that he described and pulled in next to him.

We made small talk. I didn't want to appear too anxious so we just chit-chatted. He was 74 and in failing health from a work place injury that had broken his back and the subsequent surgeries. He had trouble getting out of his car and needed a cane to walk.

It was clear he didn't get out much and relished talking to a stranger. We talked about life's trials and tribulations for about 20 minutes. I was getting anxious when he finally mentioned the comics.

I asked him how he came to have the comic books. He told me these were his personal books he bought when he was a kid (OH SHIT). He said that he had always tried to get his kids and later his grandkids into them but they never did (ME TOO!).

At this point I was stoked. A cache of comics from the 50-70's that this guy bought and kept his whole life. Then the doubts started creeping in.

He said that the tote were all he had left. He told me when he and his wife moved from NC to GA 20+ years ago he wasn't really caring anymore on the comics. He had two long boxes with all of his favorites along with this tote. Then to add insult to injury he told me that some months after they moved his wife said "what did you do with those boxes of old comics?" That was when he said it hit him that they never loaded the long boxes and he had left them in their old house (NOOOOOOO!!!!!).

I'm worried but, hey who knows. Let's get a look in that tote. We go around to the back of his Explorer and pop the back. Big blue tote with a plastic lid. I slide it forward, hold my breath, and open it.

That was when I felt the crushing feeling. The first thing I see is an old 10 cent Walt Disney missing its cover and a stack of the smaller Archie "digests". I move those out of the way and start pulling out stacks of books - most in fairly ragged shape, a few in plastic. Mostly DC - almost entirely 70's (.15-.20 covers).

I leafed through as we continued to discuss our mutual love of comics. I found a few that I had copies of and when I would find one I would show him and we would talk about the comic.

Ultimately there was nothing in that box worth keeping but as we shook hands to leave I could just see that this tired, beaten down man actually spent an hour talking passionately about something that had, at one point, been a very important part of his life. And now in the end game, he was, I think, just happy to spend a few minutes with a stranger remembering younger, happier times.

I haven't touched my books in 15 years. I'm just getting to a point in life where I have a bit more time to look back and them and remember simpler times. And now I realize that I better enjoy them for what they mean to me and start to think about finding someone that will care for them and enjoy them when I no longer can or want to.

TL;DR: Old guy lost his passion for comics when life beat him down. Spent an hour talking with him about comics and I think he had the best day he has had in a long time. </TEXT>
