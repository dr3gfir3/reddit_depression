	<TEXT> I went to college "with" Zooey Deschanel. I never knew that until my friend mentioned it. He used to see her in the cafeteria, where he had a crush on her from afar. She was pretty goth (or at least wore black clothes and heavy dark eye makeup, not atypical for a theater major.) His friends made fun of him for his crush, and nicknamed her "Dead Girl." </TEXT>
