	<TEXT> My brother's response: 
"I completely understand that mindset as I went through something similar. I also, found the idea of God hard to believe. But as I looked at the entire universe, I also found it hard to believe that we human beings are the most sophisticated and advanced beings in existence. I also found the theory of evolution as the origin of species to not be completely conclusive although I do not find it completely nonsensical as many religious people claim it to be. I found myself torn between to beliefs and neither one was conclusive enough to satisfy me. The concept of God is still, to this day, one that I do not completely understand. But Ive accepted that I just simply cant. God is a more advanced life form. The actions of life forms are normally difficult and often impossible to understand and explain by life forms who are not as advanced. Surely animals do not understand how we as humans accomplish the things we do. As frustrating as it is for me as someone who likes everything explained and understood clearly, I have to accept that not everything can always make perfect sense. That doesnt mean we cant ask questions and try though. As far as the mall, Im assuming youre referring to the City Creek Mall in downtown Salt Lake. The church, partnering with another company (and without using tithing money), did buy and rebuild a struggling mall. The church has several investments which help them pursue good purposes. Not a lot can be done in this world (good or bad) without money so I see nothing wrong with the church being smart with their money if they use it for good.  Also, in doing so, they helped support the economy of downtown Salt Lake and provided who knows how many jobs. Major cities struggle when the economy struggles and the Church took action to help keep the inner city from falling into a state of poverty. If a government had done this, they would have been glorified. Anyone can take pictures of mansions and post them on the internet. I have actually met someone on my mission who had been to President Monsons house and talked to his wife there. She was completely surprised that it was in a typical neighborhood. It was a very modest house. My advice to you as that you research both sides. Of course you will find several things against Joseph Smith and the Book of Mormon. I researched a lot of it. That has always been the case with the truth. People found ways to portray Christ himself as a bad person. But have you read the Book of Mormon yourself? Research both sides before making conclusions. I would suggest checking out fairmormon.org and searching questions there too. It discusses the accuracy of several claims. I have first hand seen the good the church does in the world. When the disastrous flooding hit Germany, missionaries stopped proselyting completely in the affected areas and began assisting. I have seen the principles taught in the church change peoples lives. Whether or not they are true, they have brought families closer together, they have made people happier and given them hope. These are not bad things. I have met some of the best, most selfless people in Germany and they are this way because of the principles of the gospel. The church teaches its members to go about doing good. And the church wants nothing more from their missionaries accept that we develop love for and serve the people."

	<TEXT> This was my email to him: 

"At first I just stopped believing in God, but still had the mindset if "if any church is true, it's the mormon church." I just found the concept of a God hard to believe. Then looking into church history I found some troubling things. From what I've seen, Joseph Smith was really not a good person. At all. As well, there are many many historical inaccuracies in The Book of Mormon, and, honestly, it just doesn't seem to be well written. I know the church does some humanitarian work, but not as much as others. And they also do things like they just built a $5 billion mall and  the 15 all live in like these mansions in SLC. I guess the biggest thing is just the historical inaccuracies in the Book of Mormon." 

I really didn't know what to say or how to word it, so I probably didn't get my point across very well and that's probably horribly written.

They started talking about the snow. 
Son: "How can anyone think global warming is real after this?"

Dad: "Ya know, there are actually people that say that Global Warming will lead to a second ice age." 

*both burst out laughing*

Dad: "and the fact that the scientists have switched from calling it Global Warming to calling it Climate Change shows that it's a hoax."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really delving into Matt Morris and 2003-2005, I'm not so sure that he did. I mean they did say he did on MLB Network, but I'm beginning to question. I think you might be right. Chris Carpenter joined in 2003. But an injury made him not pitch until 2004. In 2004 Matt Morris (only at age 29) had already declined significantly from his 2001 glory year. Matt Morris WAS the ace of the staff, but no longer was when Carp joined. There was such a big leap in Carps pitching from 2002 to 2004, so Matt Morris would have to have been one hell of a teacher and Carp would have to have been one hell of a fast learner. It seems more likely that, if he learned from anybody, that it would have been Woody Williams. But honestly, to me now, it looks more like many factors just suddenly allowed him to tap into his potential. 
Please correct me if I'm wrong, or if you have any other insight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, ages really don't have much to do with it. While usually it is the case that a younger guy learns from a veteran, it doesn't have to be. Matt Morris was the ace of the staff at the time and two years is still plenty of time to learn.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I heard them talking on MLB Network about the Cardinals pitching over the years saying how strong it's been. They said "Michael Wacha is learning from Adam Wainwright; Adam Wainwright learned from Chris Carpenter; Chris Carpenter learned from Matt Morris; Matt Morris learned from Daryl Kyle, and so on. It just keeps going back." That got me thinking, who do you guys think will be the one to learn from Michael Wacha, if anyone at all?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if they try to claim that he was talking about them separately, he still contradicts himself with the last two statements about The Lord. Are they just chill with the fact that this quote makes The Lord and God look like ass hats? The things people will believe....

Now when I read the quote I always see Joe F Smith looking like the awkward kid from a t.v show that's talking to the girl he likes and is just contradicting himself, going back on what he says over and over, always saying the wrong thing, and is putting his foot in his mouth. So I just see Joe F standing there red in the face, sweating, and shaking with this, scared, nervous, and embarrassed look on his face (because he knows he's making an ass out of himself) saying the quote.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see it now. 
"... a soul already in the Church ... is just a little dearer to the Father, if possible, than is one who is on the outside."
-okay. Kinda makes 'The Father' seem like a douche canoe, but whatever. 

 "Of course, the Lord is no respecter of persons"
-Um, doesn't that writ the previous statement null and void? If he's no respecter of persons then souls wouldn't be more or less dear to him based on their standing with the church, right? 

"but he [God] no doubt loves those who obeys his voice and who are willing to walk in his truth, more than he does those who fail to do so."
-what? Now he throws 'respecter of persons' out the window and goes back to the original point? If this is the case, then wouldn't The Lord be a respecter of persons? Also, this statement makes The Lord look like a complete dick hole. 

Another question: 
He starts out "...is just a little dearer to THE FATHER..." 
Then right after he says "Of course THE LORD is no respecter of persons." 
The way he says it he has to be talking about the same person/being, right? But 'The Father' would be God and 'The Lord' would be Jesus, though.........right? Am I missing something?

	<TEXT> That's what I was wondering. I guess just the statement in general. It makes no sense to disagree with either of those (according to mormon doctrine); however if I had to choose one, it'd probably be the "he wants some more" because disagreeing with "God loves Mormons" makes even less sense. But still like if God doesn't want more Mormons what the hell is my brother doing spending 2 years of his life and $10,000 trying to convert people in Germany?? </TEXT>
