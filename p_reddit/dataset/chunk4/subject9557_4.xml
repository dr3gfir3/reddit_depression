	<TEXT> They have a terrible shortage of priests. It is so bad most are not allowed to retire.  This is a self inflicted wound.  All they would have to do is allow women to be priests and allow priests to wed.
 
"Worldwide, the number of priests in 1970 was 419,728. In 2012, there were a total of 414,313 priests. While the total number of priests worldwide has therefore remained about the same since 1970, the Catholic population has nearly doubled, growing from 653.6 million in 1970 to 1.229 billion in 2012.[2] In 2012 the global number of candidates for the priesthood also showed its first decline in recent years."

I listened last night was amused by how both have their own plans for bringing jobs back.  We are on the cusp of an automation revolution and that is what they should be discussing.  How can either of them claim to have a plan to bring jobs back when so many will be replaced?  Is it their age?
