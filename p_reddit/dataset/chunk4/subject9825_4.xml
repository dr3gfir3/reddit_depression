People in Arizona, Florida, and Michigan are going to have different issues, and Trump was able to appeal to them all this election. Without the EC, a candidate could run on issues only appealing to voters who lived in or near cities. That would be far less representative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We should absolutely keep the Electoral College. It allows for far more representation than a popular vote election would. Why would a presidential candidate care about the problems that a farmer in Idaho has, or a cashier in Vermont has, if they only needed to campaign in urban areas? Having the EC means that candidates are required to appeal to voters of a wide variety of ideologies. 

However, I would definitely support adding in a clause of some sort saying that the EC is nullified should a candidate get 50% of the vote and lose the EC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  What is the definition of "can survive?" Does that mean reaching a gestational age equaling the lowest ever recorded, on the chance that this particular one could also? Does requiring the use of the best medical technology and expertise available count? Even if that bankrupts the mother and family?

If the baby can survive, it should be treated like a normal person would be in regards to this. The earliest viable birth was 21 weeks, 5 days, so as far as we know, that is the earliest point a fetus can be considered a "person" and should be protected (meaning not be able to be aborted).

What if science advances to the point where a fertilized egg can be reliably extracted and grown into a health baby in a lab? Does that mean abortion becomes effectively illegal at any gestational age?

I would hope so. Abortion is a heinous act, and ideally there would be NO abortions, because when you really get down to it it is the ending of (what could be) a human life. Really the only reason we allow it is because we recognize that women have the right to decide what they do with their body, and their rights trump a bundle of cells' (to a point). If a woman's body is able to be taken out of the equation, there is really no reason to allow abortions at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is not true. So you're either dumb or a liar.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/October_Surprise_conspiracy_theory

After twelve years of mixed media attention, both houses of the US Congress held separate inquiries and concluded that the allegations lacked supporting documentation.

http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/26/reagan-s-october-surprise.html

The theory has never gained real legitimacy, and it seems that there are still new holes are being found in it.

You can either continue to live in your little bubble or you can actually listen to evidence for once. Your choice.

Fair.

Reagan negotiated with the Iranians, breaking the Logan Act.

That is a conspiracy theory. If you believe that, I have a pizzagate story to tell you.

Bush 2 was helped by his brothers bullshit.

Bush was elected by ~500 votes in Florida.

Trump is helped by the Russians.

That is still a developing story. We don't know anything yet.

	<TEXT> Yes they were. Let's take a look.

Truman-Pretty good. Saved millions of lives by dropping the bombs. Truman Doctrine was great.

Eisenhower-Best post-WWII.

Kennedy-Died before he could do anything important.

Johnson-Would be a great president were it not for Vietnam.

Nixon-Would be the greatest (China, ending Vietnam, etc.) were it not for Watergate.

Ford-Good guy, but didn't do too much. Also pardoned Nixon which many agree was a bad move.

Carter-Total disaster of a presidency.

Reagan-Helped end the Cold War. Got us out of stagflation. One of the greats, evidenced by the biggest landslide in history.

Bush I-Great. Continued Reagan's legacy, oversaw the end of the Cold War, Gulf War, and knew he had to raise taxes, sacrificing a second term for the good of the nation.

Clinton-Pretty good. Rode the internet wave and a good economy. But he disgraced the office of the presidency, which knocks him down a few pegs.

Bush II-Disaster.

Obama-Better than Bush but nothing too notable.

So of the 12 post-WWII presidents, Reagan and Bush I are better than *at least* 8 of them. </TEXT>

Not really a lot of evidence for this? "The past 3 presidents" isn't really a strong sample size. 

this was after 8 years of a very unpopular Republican administration

True, but Obama has been one of the more popular presidents of the past few decades and his "successor" still lost. It on the candidate more than the previous president.

The Dems could have run a potato with a D next to it and won.

And Hillary will lose to Donald Trump. McCain lost as bad as he did because Obama was a force of nature and he had Palin as VP. McCain absolutely would have stood a chance against Clinton. </TEXT>

The only check it has against popular rule is the freedom of electors to defy the popular vote, but I don't believe this will ever happen so it's entirely a theoretical benefit.

Direct popular vote is inferior. Tyranny of the majority WOULD be an issue without the EC because then candidates would only need to appeal to people in large cities. The President needs to appeal to ALL people in the country. This is balanced by giving those outside of cities slightly more voting power.

That's not what the Senate is. State legislatures used to choose senators back in the day but now they don't, now it's the people in the states that vote. This makes it just a screwed up way to allot votes totally out of proportion to population, according to arbitrary geographical lines that we can't change. We already have the House to represent local interests. There is nothing special about states with smaller populations that makes them especially worthy of disproportionate representation. (It's incoherent to say that the Senate is "a check on the federal government" since the Senate is part of the federal government.) I do think a bicameral system where the Senate is chosen in a different manner from the House is a very good idea, but two-per-state is a completely unfair way to do it, a way that seriously compromises the legitimacy of our government. States as corporate entities already have an extremely powerful check on the federal government, namely their own governments, which have their own very potent powers including taxation and police power.

The Senate was literally founded as a check against both the House and the Federal Government in general. The UNITED STATES is a UNION of STATES, and as such, they are each equal, regardless of population, land area, resources, etc. Without the Senate, only a few states would determine the direction of the country, which is intolerable. The people of Alabama are going to have different priorities than the people of Connecticut, and the Senate exists so that ALL people of the nation are heard EQUALLY.

This is a huge issue. If you don't think so, you're not informed.

You misunderstand me. Gerrymandering *could* be a huge issue, but as of the present it is not. In the 2012 elections gerrymandering was estimated to cost the Democrats only 7 seats, or ~1% of the House. It is hardly a problem.

 Judges are appointed by a partisan official, the president. Other countries don't do it this way.

That is literally the point. Each of the 3 branches is a check on the others. The checks on the SCOTUS (Judicial) are that the President (Executive) nominates and the Senate (Legislative) approves.

For decades, presidents have completely ignored the supposed power of Congress to declare war because it seems that it doesn't mean anything at all.

I agree with you there. But, that is not a problem with the Constitution itself.

You aren't being serious here.

I am. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  STATES DO NOT HAVE RIGHTS.

Yes they do. 10th Amendment.

The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, **are reserved to the States respectively**, or to the people.

Those are rights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Electoral College is a terrible system of representation

So what would be a better one? Direct democracy? Hell no. That's how you get things like Brexit. People often don't know enough to make the best decision and tyranny of the majority is a real issue.

The Senate is an even worse system of representation

Why? The Senate is how states have a check on the federal government. It's a great system.

 Doesn't protect against gerrymandering

Not an issue.

Doesn't protect voting rights

What? Yes it does. There have been several Amendments regarding voting rights.

The Supreme Court has no explicit power of judicial review (it gave that power to itself)

Alright I'll give you that one.

Lifetime court appointments lead to justices trying to stay on the bench until a president they like is elected

Lifetime appointments maintain the integrity of the Court as part of Checks and Balances. If they were rotated out every few years it would just be used as a tool by the current President.

Partisan appointment of judges

Not sure what your point is here. Care to elaborate?

Unclear which branch controls war powers

Yes it does. The President is the Commander in Chief and the Legislative Branch declares war. Simple as that.

The First Amendment is too vague on limits of free speech

"Congress shall make no law...abridging the freedom of speech". Not vague at all. NO LAW ABRIDGING.

Unclear on separation of church and state

I agree with that one.

The Second Amendment is so badly worded that we're still arguing about what its literal meaning is

"A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed". It is worded perfectly. "Well regulated" meaning in working order. "The People" meaning everyone who wants to. The wording is fine. The problem is Democrats not liking the wording.

Unclear what "cruel and unusual punishment" is (a word like "unusual" is begging for changing interpretations over time)

Agreed.

Unclear how much of the Bill of Rights can be applied without resorting to the Incorporation Doctrine

Agreed.

Doesn't say whether or not a state can secede

Agreed.

Unclear if the Senate has the right to refuse to even consider officials that the President wants to appoint

Not unclear at all. Nowhere does it say that a vote or hearing MUST be held. The Senate must consent to an official for him to get the job. Very clear.

Unclear on rights of non-citizens and rights at border crossings

Agreed.
