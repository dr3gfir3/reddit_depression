	<TEXT> Firstly, I think this is bullshit. It's what smarks want to hear, but Austin has said on his podcast on a few different occasions that schedule conflicts get in the way of him doing more with WWE. That's why Jericho did one of those episodes instead of him.

Secondly, Ambrose has been awkward and unlikable on every podcast I've ever heard him on.

Thirdly, WWE should pony up the dough to give Austin a weekly or even daily talk show a la Tuesday Night Titans and watch the network subscriptions go through the roof. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all. My Nikon D600 stopped accepting lenses with their own aperture rings today. No matter how much fiddling I do with the ring, the contacts, or any moving parts on the mount, I continue to get the flashing fEE error indicating the camera and lens aren't communicating properly.

I tried the aperture ring lenses on other camera bodies and they work fine. I tried a non-aperture ring lens on the broken body and it works fine. So it has to be something with the camera's aperture "ring" that is rotated back when the lens is mounted. To the naked eye, everything seems fine. I tightened a loose screw in the mount but that didn't resolve it. 

By chance has anyone had this issue before? And if I have to send it in for repairs, any recommendations on a reputable place?

EDIT: I found [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ne7cB0sXgK8) which looks to be exactly the issue I'm having. Even though I have a D600 and not a D7000, the part is probably the same. I'm going to try to make the repair myself next week and will update. </TEXT>
