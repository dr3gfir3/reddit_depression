	<TEXT> I live in Austria and I wanted to buy the 1070 but no matter where I buy it, the gtx will always cost me 500 which is about 550$. This seems unreasonably priced to me. I think gpu's are in generall more expensive in Austria compared to the us, but which graphics card will give me as much power as the 1070 for a cheaper price? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As an Austrian I would say that the time right before WWI has been a somewhat golden age for our country. During that time Vienna was next to Paris the center for Artists. People like Sigmund Freud, Alfred Adler, Stefan Zweig, Lenin, Hitler and (IIRC) Trotzki were living in Vienna around 1913. 

Edit: I just added Hitler to the list since it is interesting to know IMO. I dont think that he contributed very much for the Austrian Golden Age... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Upgrading my old Pc and getting a new monitor. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-21 20:15:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My current three year old Rig is:


Intel Core i7-4820K CPU @ 3.70GHz

GeForce GTX 660 Ti

X79A-GD45 Plus (MS-7760)

8 GB Ram

265 Gb SSD

1TB HDD

Sharkoon BD28


And I am going to replace my 660 with a 1080. Here comes the main question. Am I able to play on a 4k monitor games on highest settings? Or should I just get a 2560x1440 monitor? I have to confess that I dont really understand 4k... does playing on a 4k monitor mean that every game is going to be more demanding? Or could I just switch the resolution in the settings to something lower than 4k and play every game "normal"? What are the downsides of 4k monitors? Well these are the queestions. And last but not least I would be glad if someone could recommend me an awesome monitor - now that you know my rig- at a budget of 500 (570 $). 

TIA </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Specs (pc is 3 years old)

Intel Core i7-4820K CPU @ 3.70GHz

GeForce GTX 660 Ti

Mainboard: X79A-GD45 Plus (MS-7760)

8 GB Ram

265 Gb SSD

1TB HDD

Tower: Sharkoon BD28

Cooling: Corsair RM 650

My plan is to change my GPU with either a 1070 or 1080 and to overclock my CPU. As some of you recommended to me, but I need some further help since I don't now much about building a pc:

Why is the prize range on the 1080 so high, what is the big difference between a 1080 from EVGA and a 1080 from zotac (for example) ? What is the founders edition? Should I stay away from it? Which version of the 1080/1070 would fit best for my specs? Is it a good idea to purchase graphics cards from amazon? 
TIA :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes gaming. I have to play games like the new Tomb Raider and BO3 on medium setting to avoid low FPS. It would be awesome if I could step into the VR-World with my PC. Which grafics card would be the highest I could build into my pc? Will it overheat if I build a 1080 in? Or is a 1080 useless with my current CPU? Should I wait for the new Amd Flagship instead?

I either want to build a new one entirely or upgrade this one massively. My budget is about 1500 (1700$) I dont know anything about building a pc but if it's possible to upgrade my current one I would prefer that ( and what are the disadvantages I will have to cope with if I just upgrade my current one) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wrote this for the greenlandic subreddit some time ago and I think it might be helpful in this regard:

It's not easy to distinguish the dialects of Kalaallisut/Inuvialuktun/Inuktitut/Inupiaq but I'll give my best, maybe this will help to get a better overview of the Inuit languages.
Greenlandic:


Kalaallisut is the standart dialect of the greenlandic language and has it's origin in the western part of Greenland, it's virtually identical to the standart greenlandic. (50.000 native speakers)


Tunumiisut is spoken in east Greenland, some people see it as a distinct language but it's generally considered a divergent dialect of Greenlandic. (3000 native speakers)


Inuktun is spoken in the northernmost part of greenland (surroundings of Qaanaaq) and is a dialect of the Canadian Inuktitut and Kalaallisut. (800 native speakers)


Canadian Inuit languages: Unlike the languages spoken in Greenland most of the Canadian Inuit languages have in addition to the looped cursive Cree syllabics.


Inuktitut is by far the biggest language of the canadian Inuit languages, it has many dialects such as: Inuttitut, Inuktun, Qikiqtaaluk niginiani, Qikiqtaaluk uannanqani... (34.000 native speakers)


Inuvialuktun is sometimes considered as a dialect of Inuktitut and has several (sub)dialects such as: Siglutun, Inuinnaqtun, Natsilingmuitut, Kivallirmiutut... (2000 native speakers)


Alaskan Inuit languages:


Inupiaq is distinguished in north Alaskan Inupiaq (Qawiaraq) and northwestern Inupiaq. (9000 native speakers)
