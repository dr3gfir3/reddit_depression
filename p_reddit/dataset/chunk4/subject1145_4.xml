	<TEXT> It's a against California state law to share a booth, but it's really at the clerk's discretion since the police don't want to go in the establishment. I didn't mind enforcing the rule so the booths would be full. The weird thing is is that this entertainment form is the easiest way to cheat taxes as a business. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was working at an adult bookstore. Some guy blew up about not being able to share a booth in the back. "I'm going to tell all my friends about this!" He yelled. "Okay." "You'll run out of all your business!" And all I could think about was how the conversation would go:  

Pervy McSwervy: Yeah, this guy kicked me out of that porn store next to bar, across the street from the Home Depot.  

Friend: Oh yeah? What happened?  

Pervy McSwervy: I tried to share a booth with someone. The clerk came out and banged on the door with a rolled up magazine.  

Friend: And kicked you out?  

Pervy McSwervy: Yeah. I'm never going back there again. (tears up) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Goldberg never loses. He just keeps racking up wins. Then Undertaker dies on an episode of Raw. Next week we see Goldberg fighting on Nitro, the lights go out, "You're Next" come up on the screen. Then there's a PPV match between Goldberg and Mysterio, Mark Calloway interrupts the match and gives Goldberg the Last Ride through the ring. At WCWs biggest PPV it's Calloway vs Goldberg with Goldberg losing. Calloway starts his own faction of champions called Deadman Inc. Deadman Inc feuds with NWO until Calloway meets Hogan and Nash in a Three Way Dance. Hogan goes over with help from Nash. Deadman Inc is made up of: Rey Mysterio jr, The Dudley Boys and The Four Horseman. Eventually Deadman Inc feuds with Sting; Flair gets the belt from Hogan and Calloway goes after Flair in fantasy...in reality Calloway becomes Flair's bodyguard and goes back to WWE as The Undertaker. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are several reasons:  

1. Marketing: If you have two options (1 product for 3.99 and 2 for 5.00) You'll pay the higher price because it seems like the better deal.  

2. It doesn't lose any money. Chicken nuggets cost less than an American quarter to make. If you take into account that a McChicken costs around.45 cents to make (this includes packaging, rent, labor and utilities). There's only one package used for Nuggets and the patties are smaller than the sandwich.  

3. Addiction. The sweet, fatty taste of McDonald's and other fast food chains is difficult to resist. Once you start eating fast food, you get cravings for it. McDonald's charges the same amount for each product because they know people will pay that amount for it, due to addiction. (One ounce of heroin is better than no heroin) </TEXT>

It appears there IS a difference between wholesome baking soda and Arm and Hammer brand; that difference is in the process of which the baking soda is made or mined.

	<TEXT> It WILL get better. This reminds me of two anecdotes.  

So I was at odds with my mother after living with her for a year or two during a transitional phase. I was supposed to have a good paying job but never picked up the phone to answer the call. I had already quit my job at Wal-Mart so I had no income. I eventually got a job...the job was cleaning up used napkins in the back of an adult theatre, but hey, it was something. So I decided to go back to school (military gives me money to live on Post 9-11). I eventually move out and quit my job. During school my mom loses the house that she used my trust fund to buy. I'm not talking about put stuff in storage; I'm talking about loses everything but what she can carry and move around with. I lost tons of journals, DVDs, pictures, books, all of my trophies(over 20). What I came to realize is that there are material things in this world that we attach value to. There are so many more important things than stuff.  

The second is similar. I was going to film school and living in my gf's mom's house. It was a terrible situation. My gf at the time was so controlling she'd manipulate me into living there when I wanted to move. Eventually things got so bad I threw some cups against a wall and they broke. I was kicked out. With a huge episode coming on I decided to use the money I saved up, bail from film school and travel, with the intention for suicide at the end of my journey. I met many people around me. When I was in Charleston I talked with someone I met in Nashville and she convinced me to check into the veteran's hospital. I was given inpatient care and came out better than ever.  

If I hadn't been in either of those situations then I wouldn't have been forced to make changes for the better. So I guess I'm just trying to say that sometimes we need (what seem like bad things at the time) to happen in order to make large, positive changes in our lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Ouch!* I thought as I was taken from my body up to the the sky and beyond the stars. It was surprisingly comfortable; bumpy but that kind of bumpy you can use to your advantage. *Guess I'm dead now* Fuck your fence, I'll piss where I want!  

**Get ready for the entrance exam**  

*Stopped doing tests when I was out of school* Probably why I had TB.  

**Grab a slammer** says this booming fucking voice. Fuck you booming voice, I'll go in to Heaven if I please.  

**GRAB a SLAMMER** and some fucking metal discs appear in front of me. 

*What the fuck am I suppose to do with this?* I eye the stack.  

**Grab one** and so I did.  

*Now what, Chuck?*  

Then all this smoke and music and lasers and lights and shit started up and through this thick ass veil of clouds some dude in a white beard and some sort of flowing robe came out, two hands up like he was Nixon or some shit. 

"Ladies and Gentlemen," How the fuck is Howard Finkle in Heaven? "Please welcome the entity known as the Guardian of the Gate," cue shitty techno music bounce, "the judge with the fudge...he's one bad Slamma Jamma...Here is...**SSSSSSSSAAAAAAAAAAAAIIIIIIINT PEEEEEEEEEEEETERRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!" and then this fishy smelling motherfucker stares at me.  

**Ready to be judged, son?**  

*What the hell is going on?*  

**Hell? Only if you lose! I'm Peter, no longer Simon. Which slammer do you choose?**  

I'm nearly shitting myself cause this guy is huge; so I pull whatever slammer I can from the stack.  

**The Gold Skull Slammer! A valid choice! Now I shall pull out my slammer: FORGED FROM THE TEARS OF THE HEAVENS AS THEY SWEEP AWAY THE FIRES OF HELL!!!** and suddenly I don't think I'm going to win whatever game this weirdo is going to play with me.  

A stack of round discs appears before us. *Wait are these?*  

**These are POGS, my man. We shall see if you enter eternal bliss or if you're forced to re-live the worst moments of your life.** I think about the time I pissed myself in third grade and almost recreate the event.  

*So how does this work?*  

**Simple! You throw the slammer down on to the stack of pogs. The ones you flip over are your points. If you have more points than me then you get to go into Heaven! But if I win then you are faced with eternal damnation.**  

*BUT I went to church once!* My head itches and I scratch it. This is how I get into Heaven? *What about all the good deeds and stuff? I moved a dead cat to the side of the road just the other day. Isn't that worth something?*  

**Nah brah. Now let's flip to see who gets the first toss.**  

So I flip my gold skull slammer and call heads. Its' heads and I choose to go first.  

**Good luck!** and he smiles this smile that makes it seem like he just saw someone rise out of their grave.  

I slam the Gold Skull slammer down on the stack. And fuck me! They all turn over! I get all the damn points!  

**No. No. Nope! You can't win that way. No winsises on the first turn!**  

*Let me in. I won fair and square.* this guy...  

**Nope, nah, uh-uh, it's not fair if I didn't get a turn.**  

*Are you fucking kidding me?*  

**Nope, no way! No how. You can't just win all the points the first toss.** I'm about to toss one at his head.  

*Just let me in.* Then I get an idea that helped me out on the playground many times. *No backsies. I won. We had a deal. Let me in.*  

He sighed, went to the cloud curtain he came out of and held them aside for me as I walked through, Gold Skull slammer in my pocket and a smile on my face.

	<TEXT> True hipsters aren't a derogatory term. They're the people that are the ones that find niche things and support them until they go mainstream. True hipsters talk about politics and religions at bars because there's no boundaries to discussions. Tue hipsters were ironic t-shirts because they're funny and no one else is wearing that t-shirt. True hipsters aren't  what you think a hipster looks like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly think you used your money incorrectly. Here's why:  

The "L" in Lady is nearly unreadable, which will cause your possible readers to skip to something more legible.  

The kerning between Lady and the author's name is too close.  

The life-like model in front of a badly animated background screams of mid-90s video games on Sega-CD (and no one likes Sega CD).  

Some good things:  

The "D" in Dragon is very nice.  

The font in your title is eye catching.  

The model conveys that it's a Steampunk novel.  

What I do:  

For me, I browse free picture sites (like pexel) to find something that fits the mood I'm going for. Next I use Picassa to put any filters I might want. Then I browse Picassa fonts to see what captures the title well. You can enhance the free pictures with photoshop and illustrator if you're savvy (Illustrator is a nice place to make some custom titles).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I walked outside. Something felt different. It wasn't the air or the sky or the wind. It was in that place that only the ones you let close can touch. It was a short walk to work but that day...that day it would be one of the longest of my life:  

I saw one guy beating up another to a near bloody pulp. The one doing the beating kept screaming, "I'm not the OTHER JOE NOW!"  

A short speed-up to the furniture store had me lookin' in the window. There was a black haired dame in there, with big brown eyes, she was making sounds with her mouth an' whisperin' in fella's ears. No foul play; just making lads fall asleep real quick-like.  

On the corner a couple-a guys were reciting Christmas Carols backwards, their tip jar was full. Then they sang a song about shooting water up a person's butt and sucking the poop out. I wasn't hungry after that one; neither were the guys making fun of the crooners by reading their lips in a terrible fashion.  

Right before I got to my place of work there was a blonde man in an alleyway. He spoke to me with a Swedish accent. "Hey bro...suck your dick for some adrev." I kicked him away from me.  

Something was going on in this town. Something big. And I was going to get to the bottom of it.

To evacuate,  
So I did.

	<TEXT> I think when Triple H takes over (probably in hundred years or so) there's going to be such a shift in the product. Promos are going to be Jake the Snake-esque in delivery and there's going to be a real "feel" to the competition side of wrestling rather than the entertainment. The UK tournament was great because it really felt like the Japanese protege guy went off-script and attacked his opponent. I guess I marked out. Tri has mastered social media and isn't afraid to change...he's less maniacal and in your face as Vincenzo but that cunning and manipulation work very well on a televised product.  

Take the greatest American Serial, Breaking Bad. Even when the hints are right in your face, they're subtle enough to keep you guessing. The execution of Triple H's promo against Seth Rollins speaks volumes about where the company is going. It's subtle because it's going to be. </TEXT>
