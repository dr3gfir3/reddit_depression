	<TEXT> My absolute favorite for me was Timothy Zahn's Thrawn trilogy. While reading it recently, my mind for some reason connected Talon Kardde with Tom Hardy's Bane... and it just worked so damn well! Oddly appropriate in the Star Wars universe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may be shocked to find out how many people do not realize that Nirvana's "The Man Who Sold The World" is a cover of a David Bowie song. According to the song's Wikipedia entry, Bowie was extremely flattered at first by Cobain's decision to cover it though over the years began to bemoan the decision when his younger fans would tell him how "cool it was that he covered Nirvana." Bowie's supposed usual response: "Fuck you ya little tosser." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ravenous is one of my all time favorite films. That rare pitch black comedy that still has its fair share of scares as well. Highly original and the bizarre score (co-written by Damon Albarn of Blur) is perfect.
