	<TEXT> yeah, but the whole point of this game is  not to suck so bad that you never get kills due to un awareness, this game just takes time managment, patience and awarness and you don't need teamates on casual unless they're a team of 5 that went on to casual to have fun by "beating noobs" but like i said this game is easy if you treat it more like every action that you do matters (not judging but you've probably never played vegas 1or2 and therefore have no idea what to do in the defend phaseor for that matter the action phase) </TEXT>
