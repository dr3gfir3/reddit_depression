	<TEXT> Ah, I see. That was because I made those comments before knowing the conditions. I was going off just a picture that basically just said "Look at this frostbite shit that took 6 hours. There is no way I would be able to make a shelter and do all that in those conditions. On the other hand, I would've never put myself in that position to start with. If being smart enough to not put oneself in those positions comes off to some people as arrogant then maybe that just proves my point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure what the Man V. Wild thing is but can tell you that your vast and generalized statements are as ever accurate as you think they are. As a former paralegal in the Marine Corps, I can honestly tell you that I couldn't hack it in those conditions without the proper equipment either. So my point is whether you're a Marine or someone who sits behind a computer all day is irrelevant. You wouldn't be able to "hack" it no matter what who you are if you don't have the necessary provisions. However, if you read my first post, my awe was in the fact that it got that severe in such a "short" amount of time. So your attempt to macho up over the internet by assuming I'm weak is falling on dead ears my fellow human. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Damn. Yeah, that would do it. Shoulda dug out a snow cave to protect himself from wind and snow then shoved his hands up his ass to keep them warm enough to not look like that....Or just listened to the weather reports and not gone out alone when a blizzard was gonna happen.

	<TEXT> Yeah, but in only 6 hours? I mean make a snow shelter, hide behind rocks/trees or something. I'd have to know the details but it seems like the will for self preservation would stave off that level of frostbite for at least 6 hours in a Canadian blizzard. Also, did he not see it coming? How does a blizzard just sneak up on someone? Was he incapacitated in some level before the blizzard? 

Edit: Easy there internet, I posted this before I knew what the conditions were. Obviously 6 hours is no small amount of time in those conditions and would fuck your shit up. Maybe one shouldn't go out alone, or ever, in conditions like those. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been wondering if the tea party was started just to get religious nuts into office so the powers that be can use them as a front, to make sure as many babies are born and birth certificates made, in order for tax and permanent debt purpose?

 It would be an excellent smokescreen. Everybody, including the pulpit politicians, thinking it's a moral argument when it's just a cover for as many people to be born into debt as possible.

 I've been thinking about this lately and wanted to get other people's perspectives on it. Thank you very much for any response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd rather vote for the evil idiot than the evil genius and here's why. I hate Trump as much as the next person but Hillary is evil on a whole other level that vastly overshadows Trump. 
Trump just says "politically incorrect" shit that a lot of people find offensive. Well, what the hell do you expect an old, white billionaire that lives on top of a tower to say? He has more moderate stances(for planned parenthood, gay marriage, no Iraq war, auditing the fed, against the TPP and other free trade,etc) than any of the Republicans still in the race.
Again, let me reiterate, I think Trump is a piece of shit but let's have some FUCKING PERSPECTIVE. Hillary would be waaay worse for this country and if anyone has their head in the sand and doesn't understand why I would say that, please do your research on it.  I'm not giving people shit for protesting him. Do your thing. Have fun, protest him, get mad and pretend you're doing something that matters so you feel better. That's fine and dandy. However, be honest with yourselves and realize that you're just protesting and getting riled up for PC culture and IT ACCOMPLISHES NOTHING, except feels.  
    Trump will destroy the broken republican party(the fringe right), as we know it. He is the monster on the loose that they created and if elected, it will lead to the dissolvement of the fringe republican right(neo-Libertarians) and make the party more centrist, which means no more candidates like Trump, Cruz, Fiorina, Huckabee, Carson, etc. That alone, along with multitudes of other reasons(in pocket of big banks/fossil fuels, Mena, Whitewater, 4 current Federal investigations, Clinton Foundation, Libya, Kissinger, intimidating rape victims, grabbing a staffers arm and making her cry, Chinese backers, free trade, Syria, etc, etc) are why 4 years of Trump would be better than 8 years of Hillary. Trump is a huge asshole but Hillary is a murderer and should be treated as such.

That being said...Go Bernie!

	<TEXT> You are part of the problem then, congrats.
Hillary is way worse. I understand you don't like how Trump says offensive things but that's all he does. He is more to the middle than any other republican left. That being said, I am a Bernie supporter as well as someone who thinks Trump is a piece if shit. However, 8 years of Hillary would be waaaay worse than 4 years of Trump and here is why. If elected, Trump would destroy and dissolve what we know of the Republican party today. It would force the fringe right to make their own party (Neo-Libertarians) that would just be mostly ignored instead of running the party like today. The republican party would have to come back to the center a good amount and that is what this country needs. If Hitlery was president it would decimate this country even more. With all her flip flopping on important issues in order to pander as well as being in the pockets of big banks and and big oil/fossil fuels, do you really think for a second that she wouldn't expedite the destruction of our country? Just think how bad a second term Hillary, that doesn't have to worry about being re-elected, would be. By the way, I didn't even mention how she is on trades (she'll support the TPP) or how she's a warhawk and a sociopathic, power hungry murderer. You think that's far fetched then I implore you to do some research on your own about it. Listen, I get that you think Trump is worse but please have some perspective. Trump panders to his base and says stupid shit but that's all it is. His supporters should be hated more than him even though I understand his rhetoric causes them to get riled up. But believe me when I tell you that if he is elected he will be more socially center (he's for marriage equality, planned parenthood, etc) than you think and that will lose him that redneck, racist fan base. 

That said, hopefully, it won't come to that and Bernie escapes the inevitable assassination attempt and becomes president but I fobt think it will happen. Anyways, if this is the scenario please vote with your brain and not with your emotions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's amazing that people are so willing to look the other way and still support her. I guess that's what happens when brand name is more important than substance. No wonder corporations hype up product wars. It's starts at home then the next thing you know people instinctively apply the same process to who they blindly vote for. It's all a game that we aren't really a part of. Oh well, our president is chosen for us anyways so it doesn't matter. But buck up buckaroo, you have 76 different types of shampoo you can choose from. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did you even read my post? I think Trump is a fucking piece of shit and hope Bernie pulls a miracle and wins. I just don't think its going to happen because the powers that be want Hillary in the oval office. My point is that there is a bigger game at play with more at stake but you can't see that from within your tiny box, apparently. I don't watch the news, unless it's to make fun of it, because it's full of propaganda and lies. You have no fucking clue what you're talking about or who I am. Look at my post history before making baseless assumptions. You are a dullard and a sheep.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why voting for Trump's jackass would be better than voting for Hillary.

 "She is a proven hawk. She has only made this more explicit by her recent praise for Henry Kissinger, a war criminal and zealous militant who is probably responsible for nearly four million deaths.

 2. If elected Clinton would taint the reputation of the Democratic Party with her corruption and dishonesty. This impact could last decades. (Long enough for seven Supreme Court justices to be appointed by Republicans, in a worst case scenario.)

 3. She is so conservative that it would shift the entire national spectrum rightward for her to represent Democrats. If we accept that Hillary's position on the spectrum is the left, we will have allowed the right wing to pull the entire national conversation drastically to the right. A Hillary Clinton Presidency would be a huge win for the right wing, despite all of the kicking and screaming they might perform.

 4. If America wants neoliberalism, I prefer it be under Trump, because then when we learn our lesson about how damaging this economic policy is to our very sovreignty, we will have somewhere to turn to correct our course. If we do allow Hillary to drag the national spectrum to the right there will be nowhere left to turn when we are ready to grow up and stop acting like the Somalia of the west.

 5. Thomas Jefferson wrote that a well-informed electorate is a prerequisite to democracy. To reward the unethical style of campaigning that Hillary has used both in the 2008 primaries and now in the 2016 primaries by allowing it to be a path to the White House would lead to more of the same. Candidates from then on would know that unscrupulous and devious campaigning is how to win. For Clinton's tactics to be rewarded, especially by Democrats, would undermine our very democracy.

 6. Hillary has shown herself to be corruptible. Trump would not be susceptible to the types of monetary incentives that Hillary has shown herself to be.

 7. Hillary Clinton's Presidency, and the corrupt means by which she achieved the office, would be taken by many to be emblematic of what we might expect should we elect a woman President. The sentiment that Hillary's presidency could be held to be indicative of what we can expect as a result of electing a woman to the highest office would work in direct opposition to the pursuit of true gender equality. This thinking may be wrong, but it would be common. The damage to the viability of the Presidential candidacies of honorable women who have the potential to be great leaders, such as Senator Elizabeth Warren, would be significant and long-lasting. Repercussions of the backlash which would result from this symbolic first being a monumental disaster would be felt in all areas of public life. Contrary to what Hillary might have you believe, her election would be huge step backward for egalitarianism.

 8. There is far too much disloyalty to the electorate inside the beltway. Bernie Sanders might have said this best when he said "Sometimes I think that the people in this institution and the White House are really losing contact in not knowing whats going on with the American people,...[The American people] hold this institution in contempt, they hold the Republican Party in contempt, they hold the Democratic Party in contempt. Hillary Clinton is not a variation from this theme. She does not represent the people. She has been an insider in the corrupt game we call "politics" for a long time now, as her surname can attest to. A second President Clinton would quintessentially embody the perpetuation of a dynasty of indifference to the will of the people.

 9. Her election would be deeply demoralizing for those who have a vision of a future for this country that transcends what focus groups and polls tell them. Visionaries are the architects of the future. We can do better than to darken their visions with Hillary's unique brand of dreamless cynicism.

 10. The Democratic party seems to be drifting ever toward the right. It's time for Democratic voters to wake up. If losing an election is what it takes to makes that happen, it will be worth it. I hope it doesn't come to that but it would be far more preferable than a gradual unrecognized slip toward conservatism.

 11. Because if the way she panders to demographics Hillary Clinton is a divisive figure; The opposite of what a leader must be. Leaders must bring unity to those they lead, they must find what is common and shared among the citizens, or they cannot lead effectively and risk deepening the fissures which make life more difficult for all decent people. Despite my opinions on his positions on most issues it is clear to me that even a nation unified under Donald Trump may have more potential to advance toward the goals we all share than a nation divided under Hillary Clinton would.

 12. Finally, and probably least compelling: For all of these reasons I've discussed, because she constantly underestimates the intelligence of the American people in her transparent dishonesty in its myriad forms, because she stands for so little but makes such a loud noise about it, because she is so remorseless for the many mistakes she has made, I find her to be deeply, grindingly, vexatious in a way a blockhead like Trump could never be."

	<TEXT> The people who support, support him are just morons and I don't get it (I do get it) but for the people who support him if he goes up against Hillary, things are a little different. They, for the most part, understand that 4 years of Trump is infinitely better than 8 years of Hillary plus it would be the nail in the coffin for the current republicant party.
