	<TEXT> MS and Sony are trying to push cutting-edge tech. It only makes sense that Nintendo would try something different.

Nintendo definitely seems to be moving into the luxury portable market with this console

True but since this is also a home console, it will help justify the cost. I don't know what Sony will do, but just releasing a more powerful Vita will probably not work so well. I don't know if they will try to answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any speculation on whether the console cradle actually has hardware in it, or is everything running on that tiny tablet that looks to be mostly screen?

Probably not. Having additional coprocessors would be a nightmare. It would be possible to have a more powerful SoC inside the base, but then it would double the cost of one of the central components of the console. So, realistically, it's probably mostly a charging dock with connections to the TV.

It might also contain a hard drive, or active cooling to enhance the tablet's performance when docked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm still nostalgic for the days of the GameCube and N64 when Nintendo was putting cutting-edge hardware into their machines, and my #1 hope would have been a truly kick-ass powerhouse

This is powerful mobile hardware. It will be the most powerful handheld gaming device. 

Technically, it will probably be similar to some existing high-end tablets, like the Google Pixel C, but the software and controller will be much better. They're not even really comparable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will probably be the X2. There is some speculation that it's similar to [the newly announced Parker SoC](https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoNX/comments/4z80yo/nvidia_finally_revealed_tegra_parker_x2_with_more). It has 1.5 TFLOPS using FP16. The chip will probably be slightly different, as this is aimed at cars.

Edit: While I couldn't find any hard numbers on Wii U performance, it's almost certain that the X2 will be more powerful. Estimates put the Wii U around [0.35 TFlops](https://www.techpowerup.com/gpudb/1903/wii-u-gpu) or less, although there are no completely reliable numbers. The PS4 has an estimated 1.8 TFlops vs 1.3TFlops for the Xbox One. Keep in mind that TFlops are not a completely accurate measure of performance.

Edit2: You're right that another possibility is that it will be X1 based (Maxwell) and similar to the [Nvidia Shield TV](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Nvidia-Shield-Android-TV-Review.166556.0.html) or [Google Pixel C](http://www.notebookcheck.net/Google-Pixel-C-Tablet-Review.158868.0.html). They used an X1 clocked at 2.0 and 1.9Ghz with 3Gigs of ram. Given Nintendo's reputation for using weak hardware (2009 GPU used in 2012 Wii U), the X1 might be a more realistic guess after all. But who knows?

Edit 3: [Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/what-we-know-and-what-we-can-guess-about-nintendo-switchs-insides/) is reporting on rumors that point to an X2. Eurogamer also has an [article](http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/digitalfoundry-2016-nintendo-nx-mobile-games-machine-powered-by-nvidia-tegra) pointing in the same direction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, it's basically a handheld with a dock? I'm guessing that the dock might contain some additional hardware that allows games to run at higher resolutions.

The games shown were "Wii U" quality, so it's possible that the console is roughly as powerful as the Wii U, in a handheld configuration. They might have more powerful hardware located inside the dock, which takes over when the handheld is docked. This hardware can probably render the game at higher resolutions, higher framerates and maybe with extra AA or AF, but I doubt that it will go beyond that. The game has to be able to seamlessly switch from docked to mobile, so it would be difficult to have too many extra features on the docked hardware. Maybe increased draw distances, or different shaders? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those were really bad design decisions IMO. High ground mechanics are intuitive and make the game much more fun. They probably should have kept some sort of unit selection limit, which had always been a design choice in previous games. The high DPS and high stackability of units made single deathballs the most powerful formations. And they completely did away with all the micro behind controlling units like mutas. The game could have been so much better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree but I would call these design choices, not balance. They based their balance patches on pro tournaments. 

I didn't know that they did that for casuals. I think both were big mistakes. Colossus are boring units once you get past the cool factor. Little ability to micro and go to unit in a very high proportion of matches (at least in WoL). The high ground change made the game much less interesting. I don't really see how those changes help casuals. Pros will be better anyway. There's still a high skill ceiling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to [Tilt Brush](http://steamspy.com/app/327140) sales data (given for free with Vive), the Vive has sold around 155,000 units since being released in April 2016. 

We don't have exact numbers for the Rift, but we know that Oculus shipped 175,000 development kits. According the [Steam HW survey](http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey), Oculus has a 30% market share vs 60% for the Vive. So that would put the Oculus CV1 sales at around 75,000. If you add the DK sales, that would put them at 250,000. You decide whether or not that's fair. Steam says that the DK2 still has a 10% market share while the DK1 is at 0%, so it's presumably not being used anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Overmind?

The way I understand it is:

Original story: Overmind wants to attack humans and assimilate Kerrigan to gain psionic powers to defeat the Protoss.

New Story: Overmind wants to assimilate Kerrigan to free himself from Amon's influence who makes him want to kill the Protoss. The Overmind's plan is actually not to destroy the Protoss but to destroy Amon who seeks to destroy all life, including the Zerg. So actually, in the original Starcraft, the Overmind really wanted to be friends with the Terran and the Protoss and unite against Amon, but it just didn't appear that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> BW is a better game, IMO. It doesn't devolve into deathball vs. deathball. Positioning is more important so there's a stronger tactical element. 

And it's more fun to watch. Good storms have a real meaning and suspense, or reaver hits. It's hard to control your units perfectly. It's a bit like watching a good football player juggle the ball. SC2 was a bit too predictable and players got it "right" almost all the time, or, at the opposite, in LoTv, the game became a mess of multipronged attacks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Overmind? That was Amon's doing. 

The original explanation for the Overmind was quite different, and a lot more interesting. It was essentially a Xel' Naga experiment gone wrong:

"The Xel'Naga, remembering all too well that their failure with the Protoss was a result of pushing the sentinence of the fledgling species too quickly, decided to follow a different path with the burgeoning Zerg. Attempting to waylay the potential hazards of differing egos, the Xel'Naga structured the collective sentinence of the Zerg into a unified, amalgamated 'Overmind'. The Overmind coalesced into a semi-sentinent being that represented the primary drives and instincts of all the Zerg strains. As time passed, the Overmind developed the rudiments of personality and advanced intellect."

"The Overmind, while slowly expanding itself into the voids of space, became aware of the mighty Xel'Naga world-ships hovering ominously above the skies of Zerus. The Xel'Naga, having kept a constant watch on the Overmind, were horrified to find that it had actually severed their psychic link, effectively hiding itself from their view. With its need to consume driving its minions into a lustful frenzy, the Overmind launched the now space-faring Zerg swarms at the unsuspecting Xel'Naga. The ancient race did what they could to stem the tide of the ever-advancing Zerg onslaught, but in the end their efforts were in vain. Wave after wave of Zerg swarms hammered the reinforced hulls of the Xel'Naga's ships with no signs of abatement. Within only a few hours the Zerg overran the defenses of their creators and laid waste to the Xel'Naga fleet.

As the greater whole of the Xel'Naga race was consumed by the raging, genetic whirlwind of the Zerg, the Overmind gained the knowledge and insights of its masters. The Overmind processed thousands of sentient beings into itself, causing it to grow far more powerful than it had ever imagined. It learned the secrets of the Khaydarin Crystals, and began to incorporate the energies of these Crystals into its own. Through the intimate knowledge of evolution and proto-genetic physiology gained from the Xel'Naga, the Overmind was able to increase the level of sentience in many of the higher Zerg strains, while still keeping them fully under its control." [source](http://archive.rpgclassics.com/subsites/starcraft/zhistory.shtml)

Edit: Also, I think this is a pretty good example of why the writing wasn't always bad. The old Chris Metzen, who wrote this, created a pretty good story. The Xel' Naga created this superorganism, the Zerg, then lost control over their creation. In the new, retconned version of the story, the cookie-cutter villain, Amon, created the overmind, and gave it a secret directive to kill the Protoss, so it just appeared to want to kill them. It's just extremely convoluted and a bad story. At some point, I think Metzen just started to copy the same story everywhere. It was all about Good vs. Evil, with a corruption story. Anything that didn't fit that mold was retconned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  If it hadn't been for SC1's great custom multiplayer with maps like BGH, DBZ Mods, Hero Line Wars and whatnot, the competitive scene would never have lasted as long as it did. These custom maps kept the players engaged in playing the game, however they liked playing it. I hated SC2 multiplayer in contrast - that shit gave me ladder anxiety. I liked watching competetive games between StarCraft pros, but what I didn't like was playing a game where I felt I had a gun pointed at my head. 

Their biggest mistake was probably making 1v1 the center of the experience. Yes, that's how the pros played BW, but how many casual players liked 1v1? It's stressful. All the other popular multiplayer games are FFA or team battles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actors are used to getting paid this way, and that's why they want royalties.

On movies, technicians and CGI artists do not get royalties. It's only the actors who get this. Giving royalties to VAs would not lead to game developers getting them too. Developers don't have a union and, since nobody knows who they are or what they did, no one will care if they protest after being fired. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This opens up the question of why voice actors should get royalties after working only a few hours on a game vs. the hundreds of hours that developers work. 

One argument is that it's how it works in the film/TV industry. People operating behind the scenes make a fraction of what the people appearing on screen make. CGI companies are treated with little respect and some have even gone bankrupt after working very hard on movies. Should the same apply to games? </TEXT>

PoE's story had a lot of what Bethesda calls "Bore Bombs", long exposition that just bores the player out of his mind. 

It had very little in the way of an engaging story. Good writing should hook the player emotionally and get him to care about the characters. I didn't develop an emotional bond with my characters or with the world.

PoE's world was a vanilla high-fantasy world, with nothing much to distinguish it from any other generic fantasy world. Tyranny's world has a unique twist (evil world). Apparently, it also received more of Chris Avellone's input, before he left.

	<TEXT> Short summary:

- K.I.S.S. Keep it simple, stupid.

- Great games are played, not made. This means: Play your own stuff. / harder to do than it sounds: ideas can be great on paper but suck in-game. 

- Strong central theme

- The most central theme in FO4 is suspicion (is the person next to me an android?) - but they didn't realize it until later

- Write what you know. Miyazaki said that Anime sucks now because creators don't observe the world anymore. In order to create something, you have to know something.

- We don't have a lot of design documentation. After FO3, found that design docs quickly became outdated - not worth maintaining.

- We start big - Want to write a great American novel. But these are novels, not interactive fiction. You have to keep to player in mind. Players are not going to see your story because they'll spend 30 hours building shacks (and they know and love this). 

- We needed to redo our dialogue system. Drew inspiration from Mass Effect and Telltale games. 

- Voiced protagonist: controversial choice within the studio. 

- 4 buttons: A: positive; B: Negative; Y: Question; X:Neutral.

- At first, dialogue not skippable. People within the studio were going crazy. We create stories, but players don't want to hear them.

- Nightmare for designers to write 4 answers to everything.

- Dialogue can be written quickly. Dangerous thing, because we don't want players listening to dialogue all the time. They want to avoid what they call "Bore Bombs". That's every time a giant bunch of text is dumped on the player. 

- Try to tell their story through the environment instead.

- How to start a quest? Example of a quest that starts after witnessing a bar fight. More interesting.

- Always keep the player in mind. You don't have to watch the story. You can experience it. </TEXT>

Edit: Btw, there was a cancelled Diablo 3 project by the developers of D1 and D2. You can see it [here](https://gamerant.com/diablo-3-images-cancelled-version-2005-jc-68367/).

For fans of D2, I also recommend [this talk](https://youtu.be/VscdPA6sUkc) by David Breivik, the creator of the original games. He's very passionate and genuine. One of the stories he tells is how he sold his company, Condor Games, which became Blizzard North, for less money than he could have sold it to EA, just because he thought Blizzard really understood the game he was trying to make. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a more casual player, I actually enjoy being able to try out 10 different skill combinations without making 10 different characters. Really hardcore players enjoyed trying out all these new builds and min-maxing characters.

In Pillars of Eternity, a single player RPG, I was frustrated when I picked a bad skill and was stuck with it. I'm not going to play the game 10 times as each class. If I pick a class, I'd like to be able to experiment with the different skills.

But I agree that for a multiplayer game, D3's instant skill swapping was too generous. It made the game only about the items and removed the idea of character builds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It was sorta a waste of budget if anything... They didn't really improve the writing enough to make it worth while.

The reason why they do this is because some players don't like reading the dialogue in their head. Also, it's "more cinematic". I would like to go back to the more complex text only dialogues, but games have been moving in the opposite direction. They tend to be dumber, action-oriented, and "more visual".

FO4 is a good example. Bethesda doesn't care about the dialogues so much. They're just used as a wrapping around quests. Accept the quest through a short dialogue, then get a short dialogue when you come back. They don't care at all about roleplaying, which is what FO1 and 2 were about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I took the menu option out because people ended up not knowing how to exit fullscreen once they entered it. If you find it in the hotkey menu, then you see/set the hotkey how you like and know what it is.

How about also having the common alt+enter as a shortcut? Higan can easily be alt+tabbed out of, so I don't see how getting stuck in fullscreen could be a major problem. You could also have the menu show up when hovering the mouse on top of the screen.

I do a bad job by not including them with the emulator though.

Yes, please include them! I didn't know that they existed. Like many other users, I'm lazy. I don't want to have to look them up or figure out how to install them.

Also, could you write the import .log to Higan's main folder? A bit annoying that the log is lost or written somewhere obscure.

I also have a built-in cheat database (courtesy of mightymo) which has basically every known cheat code already built-in. Literally tens of thousands of codes in there right out of the box. You don't have to go browse shady ad-laden sites that give you codes for the wrong revision or wrong region of your game.

Sorry, you're right. It works quite well. </TEXT>

Also, I find Higan not to be intuitive. You need to import games first. I couldn't find the fullscreen option. Turns out that it's hidden as a "hotkey" but not available in the menu...

SNES9X is more convenient if you just want to play a game.

I think that there's a kind of "expectation treadmill" that was built up around SC. Fans are expecting to have their mind blown, time after time, because it has happened before. However this demo comes very soon after the GAMESCOM demo. Developers are probably crunching to create them. I worry that there are too many demos shown and that the expectations are too high each time. I wouldn't judge the state of SC based on the lack of a mind blowing demo.

	<TEXT> The combat wasn't especially great. They had too many skills that could have been merged, like 3 persuasions skills.

Graphically, even the Director's cut doesn't look very good. WL2 failed to create a living world with an interesting atmosphere.

The UI design isn't very good. At higher resolution, everything is very [small](http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/az3npcaimao5osse9yt7.jpg), but it's a problem even at lower resolution. A lot of the "action" in the game takes place on the typewriter where all the game text scrolls. It's small and hard to read and hidden in the bottom right corner. 

This is one of the worst game design choices in the game IMO. [Old Infinity engine games](http://killapenguin.com/227/gallery/medium/planescape/planescape-torment-292.jpg) made you read a lot but they had nice clear text that took up a third of your screen. WL2 makes you squint at this tiny part of your monitor.

Also, the UI design in general, the icons, etc. is pretty bad.

But the worst is the writing. It has a redneck vibe and tries to be dark. It's just not very good. 

Fallout 2 was funny and at the same time tried to portray characters and factions in a believable way. It then layered philosophical themes on top of that. 

I've watched the WL3 trailer and it seems like they're heading in the same direction. If you think [this](https://youtu.be/xxYUgRdp0EE?t=39s) is interesting dialogue, then you'll like the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When people who don't play a lot of video games walk by and watch me play it they think it looks really stupid and I can't blame them. There's always some meat head on the screen sawing an alien in half. It just looks not very sophisticated, something for kids. 

I think you have a point. Here's [someone sawing an alien in half](https://youtu.be/PcPklMs4NtE?t=11m41s) in the game. Right after, a big monster comes out of the ground. 

Games like GoW4 seem roughly comparable to action movies like the Transformers, GI Joe, or the Marvel movies. They're not very sophisticated and I assume the core audience is mostly young males. It doesn't mean that these games are not fun to play but they're not Planescape Torment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not getting any image inside the rogue squadron II and III games. Kirby's Return to dreamland also displays only a grey screen on Vulkan. Nvidia 1060 on Win 7 64, .90 drivers.

Also, in Mario Golf character is invisible (and some button signs are flipped upside down on all backends. I was also getting some unknow opcodes in Spiderman 2).

Pinging /u/JMC4789 , is this something you guys know about? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But if they have a 1000 planets, that's 1TB. That's why I'm curious how they manage to give the artists control while keeping the size of the data reasonable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can you ask Sean what the storage budget is for each planet? Is it 10MB, or 100MB, or 1GB? I'm curious how they handle combining the procedural tech and the artists' work. It seems like all the artists' work is stored in a low precision heightmap.

And do the artists only paint biomes or can they also create terrain features like mountains and rivers? 

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "the company is experimenting with entirely new structures for Assassin's Creed, possibly breaking from the "Ubisoft open-world formula" of tower climbing and objective peppering used consistently over the last few years (and which Watch Dogs 2 will step away from):

"I do think we need to break that formula. This year we've given Far Cry and Assassin's some time to decant, innovate, and polish. The objective behind this is exactly that. You'd be surprised - there are so many prototypes of alternatives. It's always the same thing, the player is king, so we play-test it and people are just like, 'What the f***?' And we're like, 'Oh no! We just spent a year prototyping this new macrostructure for an Assassin's or other type of open world game and people are telling us it's s****.'"" </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  EDIT 4 Wow. This story was taken down by Rule 3? I guess disregard everything I wrote. This story doesn't matter. The 9th biggest video game company (including all mobile publishers and console platforms) fending off a hostile takeover isn't news.

Mods love taking down stories. 

This sub is caught in the paradox of loving drama about the game industry and not allowing said drama to be posted. </TEXT>
