	<TEXT> The public was so mislead and over sold it's ridiculous. First it was an insurance measure, not a care measure. But now there are about 12.5 million dependent on it. And that's where funding on a solution should focus. Allow for about 15 million users. A small tax increase to fund medicare/medicaid expansion for these people might be better than premium increases, deductibles and copays many now experience.

BUT what ever is done much more will have to be done to address costs issues. COSTS not who is going to pay for it should be a core issue. One way to help lower costs is clinic style medicine, internship programs to help medical students pay off loans and find out where many of the costs go. Many complain about emergency room costs so more people be triaged and referred to a non urgent or repeat customer part of the same hospital. What's going on is simply trying to find a way to fund/throw money at a failing model.

If I was that worried about living in the US I'd be screaming where's my  fair   speedy trial or a deportation hearing with in a reasonable period of time. How come they were not protesting for an expanded   expedited deportation process ie more deportation courts, judges, personnel etc. Or for more resources to help immigrants become legal citizens or residents.

Hoping an issue will go away, be ignored or minimized is called the shear luck method. We'll some people's luck has ran out. I don't see   "luck" being protested. </TEXT>

 Even though there has been proof of political corruption for decades Americans like to think they are above the shrude pettiness and are not stone cold killers. If 100% acceptable proof cameout on things like murder the people would've lost faith in the system long ago. If the system goes so goes their job security, money and power.

 Making matters even worse there are schools out there that tell the students they shouldn't work while they are attending and some will/do take that 'advice' to heart. But it's not necessarily the student's best interest at heart it's their income. A student who drops out to work or is so busy affects their bottom line.

There was a day when lower paying government jobs were offset by benefits including union representation in many cases. Now thanks in part to unions government job pay is in line if not better than many private sector jobs. There is no need for the entrenched pay, benefits and protections government unions demand. As a starter I'd make government employees, especially new ones get a 401K rather than a subsidized pension because it's those legacy costs that are killing many a government budget.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> American politics. Most appointees and many civil service employees get their position through political favors. If not a direct favor an indirect one.

 In my hometown just to work as a trash man or secretary one needed a politician as a reference on the application or "a word" would have to be put in for them. The politician usually will do it for family   friends or one will probably have done something for them in the past. Unofficially if you want a government job you are told work on a politician's campaign or in their office as a gofer. Sometimes politicians trade, accumulate or curry favors amongst themselves which in turn they call in if a neighbor wants a government job. Sometimes a favor can work it's way up from a local councilman's office all the way to a US Senator's office. </TEXT>

The funding of private schools should and will have to be monitored /checked as should the education budgets of local public schools systems which seemed to have gotten out of control.

In a little over a decade local school taxes have more than doubled yet the academic scores and college bound or trade certified individuals have remained flat if not lower. The school system used to be in the top 3 in various rankings recently not even in the top 10. More money per student is not the answer.

 I know being an ex union member myself how any union could lead their members to think they are the only ones that can do the job. But that simply isn't true.  </TEXT>

Not only was that story buried or minimized in the news so was a murder and potential evidence/video that was lost because of that hack. AND, and two were actually arrested for the hack in London in which and English man and Swedish women were believed to have something to do with or perpetrated the hack.

So here we have another senseless murder in a big city, evidence of an actual hack/crime and the arrest of two individuals in regards to the hack(who also should be charged with obstruction of justice and damaging public property). And yet the hypocrites still want to cry about "the Russian hack" in which no real concrete or prosecutable proof has been publicized. 

The story of Vivian Morrow, a murder victim needs to come front a center along with the damage the ignored hack/hackers caused. At best we'll still get excuses for these so called protestors   protests. </TEXT>
