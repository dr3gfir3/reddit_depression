	<TEXT> My interest now lies with seeing how the new DNC will take advantage of this.

This is what needs to be part of a 50-state strategy. This needs to be used to tar and feather the GOP in red states (nd evry state) and the DNC needs to go after the GOP in every single damn election.

I mean it's like taking a knife to a gun fight, but both parties showed up to the fight with knives and the GOP gave the Dems a gun. 

Okay, Dems ... now just aim and fire. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, for example, Obama's experts developed a good approach to dealing *overall* with radical Islamic terrorism by adivsing to not call it that so that normal people practicing Islam do not feel the West is at war with them. 

Sort of like how in the US people are aginast the Westboro Baptist Church but no-one ever calls it Christian terrorism.

Now, while some may scoff at the idea and claim Islam has a specific undertone that leads MOST Muslims to believe things like a lower place for women in society, etc., etc., etc., it makes sense to not draw attention to that, because hey we can deal with what they actually believe later, right now let's do evrything we can to keep normal Muslims from becoming radicalized so they don't *do* something bad *right now*.

Do you disagree with this approach? Of course, I'm not claiming it stops all acts of terror, but I do believe it is a very sensible approach to dealing with the bigger issue and this contains the possible acts terror to a smaller community of Muslims who are radical, while allowing gradual discussion with the larger community. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *This is gloroius!*

bear in my that i am replying to a three month old account and here are my notes to his arguments:

1. The real questions is whether or not the hacking was "supposed" to have an effect and if Trump and the Russians colluded to that end. Maybe in the end it did or it didn't, but the story is intent.

2. Trump is stupid enough to not know he couldn't lift sanctions without s shitstorm and the Russians would be happy to see a shitstorm on top of getting the sanctions liftted. I mean, during the campaign, Trump apparently didn't even realize that the Russians had already annexed Crimea. 

3. So, we are to believe this posters "feeling" and his "I think it's safe to say"? Well **I** think it's safe to say that if there is anything there, they want to build an airtight case around it. See, now it's you say/I say. 

4. Yeah, they are rattled! It's so fun to watch them fret. They thought they were getting a deal and goddamit their partner is royally fucking it up. I'd rattle him too. Plus, have you read the news lately? A lot of Trump comapgn guys have been cught trying to hide the fact they talked so much to the Russians. You might want to read up on that...

5. again, you claim there is no evidence. well, fine, go ahead and claim that. in my opinion, you are just trying desperately to make that seemt true.

6. BOOM - the one that made me so want to reply. OF COURSE YOU BRING UP CLINTON. nuff said.

7. So, you're going to go with "Trump landslide" and ignore that in fact just a few score thousand votes got him the EV he needed? Remember where 548 had him before the Comey letter? You're jsut rewriting history here, though i'll give you credit for doing it in a way to get bernie-or-busters to suck up and believe you.

8. Again, it's simply your claim that their is no dirt when all the latest news is that *there is probably dirt* and *shouldn't we have an honest investigation to see if there is or is not dirt*?

	<TEXT> Except that this has nothing to do with Trump and nothing to do with his being an isolationist.

FTA, it is clear this dates back a long time. 

The question goes before President Donald Trumps organization, going as far back as 2014. Poland, Croatia, Bulgaria, Romania and Cyprus are not conceded without visa access to the United States. 

From other articles, it is clear Australia had the same problem, but fixed it in a timely manner. (The EU warned it could go down this path).

Why did Obama not reverse the discrimination against certain EU countries when the EU brought it to the USA's attention that they needed to fix it?

Now of course it is Trump's problem to deal with. But given his rhetoric, why would he change the USA's policy? The reason those countries are not allowed visa free travel is precisly because the USA suspects that nationals from these countries are likely to try to stay ilegally in the USA.

So, I in fact expect Trump to say "So? Fuck you, EU" and in return, start forcing nationals from all the other EU members to get viasa, too. So, if you are French, Italian, etc., Trump just might make you need a visa soon to visit the USA.

That was losing, but my point is that this has very little to do with Trump's actions.

Still, it's not quite a smoking gun. But goddam if it ain't some pretty harsh circumstantial evidence.

Also, for the record, I live in Ukraine and it's really, really hard ot say if giving Ukraine lethal weapons is a good idea or not.

Even furthermore, I bet Trump really didn't have any real understanding of the nuances re Ukraine/Russia/USA - someone just told him "go this route" and he did. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, no, i'm sane thank you very much.

t_d actually banned me for an explanation of math in which i said nothing at all about trump or anything political. i just pointed out that this "new-fangled way of teaching math" is in fact much closer to how people actually do math in real, mundane life. it was some betsy thread in which the trumpites banged on about the sins of common core without every understanding it one little bit.

Sessions: Well, we have to figure out something on Ukraine then. What are you willing to do. 

Russia: Hell no, its OurCrimea!

Sessions: Well, fuck, we have to come up with something. You know we can't lift any (cough-cough, wink-wink) without smoothing out Ukraine. 

Russia: We're helping you win the election, remember?

"Save as" should mean "Save as" NOT "Do you want to open another document just like this one and automatically name it 'whatever copy' and then have to close the original one while the copy has an editable title bar yet it's really hard to save it to a different folder?"

	<TEXT> Thanks, that proves my point perfectly!

To wit:

because it was stabbed unaware, it didn't think to keep its momentum moving along with the car until it was too late

So, logically, while entangled in the seat belt, the Twin would have time to think -"Gee, maybe I should phaseout now. I'm conscious of this decision and can therefore keep my momentum. Imagonnadoit!"

Also, the wiki says "apparently they have to concentrate", and by using the word "apparently" the author is making it clear we don't really know. Consequently, we are free to entertain other possibilities such as the degree of concentration needed, etc.

Furthermore, the wiki disproves your assertion above that "If he ghosts, the car will keep going while he stays put." That needs a qualifier: "If he ghosts *as an immediate instinctual reaction and is unable to think about what he is doing before it is too late*, the car will keep going while he stays put." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this is not logical. he ghosted from one vehicle going at probably 120-150 kmh to another one in hot pursuit, so obviously also going that speed. so why can he not ghost from one 120-150 kmh vehicle into the same one? He could literally ghost onto the roof of it and hold on and then ghost back in if he had to.  </TEXT>

Just try and argue that in the world of The Matrix where in fact everything inside The Matrix *is* CGI, there could never, ever be a glitch like this.

Ah-ha! You can't argue that, can you? So, of course you must now admit defeat and pen a haiku extolling my spectacular insight!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like a rather limited super-power. Almost like he replied to one of those reddit threads:

"What super power would you choose and how would it fail you?"

/u/MatrixTwinthrowaway12329

 I'd get the superpower that lets you move effortlessly through all physical mediums with the precision that allows me to end up mere millimeters in front of a car seat and while materializing, my 'material essence' is also moving at the same speed as the car so I do not suffer from inertia upon my own full materialization. 

 But I can only go in and out of cars, I have no ability to move through physical mediums or allow them to move through me while riding in said cars". </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Even when you see the car roll into the van twice and the agent doesnt quite land where ths hood dents. 

to be fair, mistakes like this - due to incorrect calculations and basically using computers to do everything, are exactly what is to be expected in The Matrix where everything is in fact computer-generated. 

So, far from ruining the scene, this example should be viewed as a very elegant attention to detail. </TEXT>

But the Dems should just sit tight lipped through his performance and take to the cameras immediately after with all the "he lied" moments on note cards prepared by their ides during the speech.
