	<TEXT> If you have time to show me the math that would be great.  Here is my question. 

A deranged person tricked 100 people to drink Formula A.  It is either poison or it is not.  A 50/50 chance.  They have a choice to drink Formula B and are told that if A is poison, then B is the antidote, if A is not poison then B will kill them.  What is statistically the best choice?  What are the numbers?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am trying to get a decent video done for my students at school for a concert they did.  I video taped in 1080 and want to make a DVD and this is how I see it, I am here to be set straight.  

I have tried Mac and PC.  iMovie, Premier Pro.  I have .mts files at 1080 and the video is just shy of 30 min. I have tried all different types of burning and everything, even the graphics are not sharp at all.  I assume because DVD's only have a resolution 480i that is just the best it can do.  I can't be assured all the students have Blue-ray so, here is my question finally. 

If I film at a lower resolution will the quality be better because nothing has to be reduced to get on the DVD?  Or will it be unnoticeable and I will be in the same boat.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have tired every combination of tactics with iDVD and even the graphics in the DVD burn are not sharp and crisp like when setting it up.  I have done everything at the highest quality and the original video is beautiful.  Everything is golden right up to the DVD burn. 

I would like a software that can let me add chapters and maybe even a slide show.  It is for school events.  Thanks.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-09-14 01:35:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Sonys' are piercing with the highs.  I cannot take it. With that comes some amazing clarity but it is too harsh.  The bass is quite loose and not tight.  


The HD 280's seem to have a hollow dead sound to them.  Very subtle though. Certain things I just hear this tin can sound. Not always.  I am nit picking. They are insanely tight. I could break them in but still worried they might be tight then I cannot return them.  

I just ordered the Audio Technica M50x.  I am not opposed to $175 for cans but I don't want to if I don't have to.  

Anyone break in the 280's decently well?

	<TEXT> Without going into huge detail.  I prefer the SD280's for the tightness of the bass and overall sound but I cannot wear them.  They are so tight i have a headache after 20 min.  The 7506 are great but the highs are so prevalent that they are painful.  I have to turn the volume down so low to not feel pain it is too soft.  

Does Sennheiser make anything that will not crush your head?  Sony that will not make my ears bleed?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Please help me understand peoples allegiance to Kanye.

Everyone's defense of him is an argument from authority. That authority being what the public buys and the ratings that are driven by it. Public opinion is NO representation of skill His rhythms are mind-numbingly simplistic, everything he does is exhaustively repetitious, and his rapping has no concept of time. He is sometimes ahead of the beat and sometimes behind the beat. His lyrics have pathetic displays of literary devices and content of the gutter level of human experience.  The form of his songs are nothing new, the sounds are all rehashed.  They are also exhaustively repetitious.  He creates nothing. He just puts together things that already exist and markets them well. Now the big thing is that he puts heavy metal with his music? Black Skinhead is just rehashed music with the only thing he knows how to do, rap. As stated before I think he does that terribly. "Public Enemy" did the same thing with "Anthrax", it is nothing revolutionary. The only art that was done is the people he hired to do the set on his recent SNL performance. He cannot create any of this. Does he even play an instrument? What the fuck is wrong with you people? It is just his relentless and adamant bombardment of self praise comparing himself to Jesus and Shakespeare that have people all so insanely brainwashed.  

I understand people liking him, that is fine, but why does the public pretend there is something that is being done that is revolutionary or skilled. I saw people arguing over how he is like Beethoven.  I couldn't even....

What am I missing?  If all you have is that he sells records don't bother.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had two clowns eaten by my anemone, after talking to a lot of people (many here) we figured they had to die before he ate them.  I bought one more and a damselfish.  They were doing great and all my levels were perfect!  Then one night they are having the time of their lives and the next morning upside down and dying.  

Long story short I found I was getting shocked on a small cut on my hand.  The culprit was a crimped wire on the heater.  I replaced it and no shock.  Can that kill my fish?  There is no current flow is there?  Like a bird on a wire?  Maybe I completed the flow when my hand went in?  Anyone ever hear of this happening?  It CAN"T be anything else but scared to buy fish.  Tested my water again everything is great.   </TEXT>
