	<TEXT> I don't care about t_D, its a weird troll sub reddit of teanagers, ~~the mentally ill~~ people with personality disorders, trump fanatics, alt right, racists and GRU paid trolls... the discourse there is bizarre. Short responses, circle jerks, weird bolded and large font statements. 

It is how to get through to the middle american middle class trump supporter that Trump is going to screw them and that we need to reform and protect our safety net and reinvest in our economy in an effective way to decrease income inequality. 

And we have 2 years to get shit done before the next midde term... we need the senate in 2 years if there is to be any hope.

These are most desperate times, and the senate is our only hope...

Edit: Was unfair to the mentally ill </TEXT>

Buying a $2000 generator because there was an article saying Russia might have hacked a Vermont utility is a bit of an outsize response and I think speaks more to the problem with your mother than the media... considering storms/ regular breakdowns/ etc. are more likely to cause need of such a generator than foreign tampering with your mom's local grid.  This issue here is people not understanding probability and buying into hype...

The media issued a full retraction and apologized, so it is bound by ethics... meanwhile Trump lies and then denies saying the lie just to double down on it later.... hard to call the media less ethical or truthful Trump... even fox news.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is not about Hilary vs Trump, the election is over. It is about Trump going back on his promises before he even takes office.

 His cabinet is full of the very special interests he decried and promised to tackle. And it is only the beginning. Winning the election does not make Trump's positions or governance good for the country. It means he won the election. 

And while I do wish that things work out, early signs suggest that he has not clue what he is doing and his cabinet is staffed with conspiracy theorists, bankers, generals, special interests, and billionaires. The swamp is represented amply; from oil interests, to the military industrial complex, to bankers etc. 

With discussion of obama care repeal, privatizing the VA and medicare, privatizing social security a lot of people are going to get hurt. 

There is already concern of compromising net neutrality. There is concern about a new patriot act. A cabinet of generals, trumps propensity for bombastic twitter foreign policy, plan to increase our navy size, means conflict is more, not less likely. 

Ultimately, I think many trump supporters are going to be hurt by their vote. And when that happens they are going to double down behind him... because people do not like to be wrong. Maybe I am wrong, and I hope I am... time will tell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree, sanders would have lost too and if people think Hilary was rough on him the republicans would have been far worse. Politics is ugly.


Yes we need more inspiring candidates on the democratic side but at the end of the day the democrats need to make the case to swing state middle class voters why they will benefit those voters personal economic situations. That is what people care about and the dems failed to make that case.   

Bernie staying in so late and hurt Bernie supporters didn't help though. 

People need a thicker skin and more pragmatism. In 2 years see ned to get the senate back and maybe work on some state legislatures in the meantime... because we are woefully short on levers to affect the course of a trump presidency right now. Our best shot in these two years is the collective conscious and back bones of McCain, Graham and some additional republican defectors... </TEXT>

Otherwise, no one cares about Russia, it's Russia that won't let go of the past or recognize that she is a petro state with nukes. But more importantly, why is it surprising that Putin might have used hacking and propoganda to advance his agenda... it's straight out of the Russian KGB and special operations playbook.

China is and has always been more regionally focused. The whole global reach has always been a left over European, particularly  British mantle America reluctantly and clumsily accepted post WWII during the Cold War. 

Russia is different from China in that they are a fading superpower. They don't have the economic might or the people but they do have oil and are more akin to Saudi Arabia with nukes and a huge army. They too are regionally focused on what they consider their sphere of influence. With a huge border, even though Russia effectively lacks sea based force projection, Russia can project power through much of Asia and europe. Russia has also shown the ability to deploy expeditionary forces in Syria and meddle in global affairs...  </TEXT>

Multiple foreign agencies and inspectors thought Sadaam did not have wmds and when people raised questions of the source the bush administration was using (1 Iraqi defector), they got crushed... like Plame being outed to get back at Wilson for debunking the Nigeria yellow cake story.

Assange denying where it came from is meaningless... he has his own anarchist agenda, he was anti Clinton, and he also might simply not know. Who ever handed it to him might not have ever explicitly stated their affiliation. Assange is an amateur desperate for attention. One biased guy claiming it wasn't Russia isn't the same as a slew of foreign agencies and diplomats saying Iraq had no wnd.

	<TEXT> No, this is calling for investigation, the Bush administration actually clamped down on investigation regarding Iraqs WMD program and punished dissenting opinions... see Valerie Plame affair.

Russia is major super power advancing her own geopolitical agenda and the US is looking to understand Russian incursions into US private orginizations servers and the use of that information to advance Russian interests at US expense... 

It is the duty of the US government to protect it citizens rights which were violated by likely Russian hacking and also the duty of the US to protect against foreign powers meddling with US domestic affairs. Why is that so controversial?

Also unlike Iraq, Russia actually has nuclear weapons and the launch capability and second strike capability to use them. The parallels just don't hold.

Why is it ok for American political parties and companies to be backed? Why shouldn't we hold Russia responsible? Also, Obama is done in like 20 days, not starting any wars in the meantime. </TEXT>

Gun control is a republican spectre that they trot out, there is no legislative momentum for it and the bathroom is a distraction... personally not even sure why its such a sticking point.  

Russia is a real issue though... they are a destablizing global force, although rolling back neo con foreign policy is not unreasonable.

The problem is they right voted in Trump who just staffed a cabinet with generals, wall street, oil, big business and establishment. You will find republican gun control protections and bathroom wars won't matter, while I have a feeling neo con policies, pro-multinational corporation policies, and further erosion of the middle class safety net will hit a fevered pitch.

	<TEXT> The Germans who ran the camps provided many of the estimates. 

Eastern Europe was dotted with abandoned villages and towns where the people simply vanished. Jews stopped being part of the German popoulace. French and west European Jews also never returned. 

There is documentation and German testimony of their methods and the pace of the murder. This was a huge operation, many German soldiers were involved. 

Nazi leaders defense was also almost never that it didn't happen. Their defense was that they either just followed orders or did not know the extent. They didn't deny the evidence or the murders themselves. One Nazi division of soldiers who followed Nazi troops in the invasion of the USSR documented the murder of 1 million Jews even before transport to concentration camps.

And then after the war there was video evidence and documentation of the camps. Polish resistance had snuck into the camps and documented the slaughter. Allied over flights showed the set up of the camps and the gas chambers in operation.

But the part that I do not get is the part where people pretend they are surprised... the Germans were doing what they said they would do... 

You can disagree with Israels situation and actions but to suggest the holocaust is a Zionist fabrication simply ignores the numbers... Europe lost 67% of the Jews in occupied German territory and these people vanished. Their bones and fragments sometimes still found littering mass graves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um, ok, are you one of the "no jews died" crowd, the "some jews died" crowd, or the "nit picking with the 6 million number" crowd.

Because for the "no jews died" crowd we have video footage of dead jewish bodies in concentration camps.

For "some jews died" crowd, well we have the 1930s germany went from having 240,000 jews to almost none, and then the fact that entire jewish neighborhoods and villages in eastern europe stopped existing. Based on the people who ran aushwitz and other concerntation camps they admit to murdering millions. If its 5 something, or its 7 something million we will never know, but in the balls park of 6 million jews and 5 million additional others were murdered in the camps. 

For the "nit picking with the 6 million number" crowd see above. 

Otherwise, ask yourself why it so hard for you to accept the fact 2/3 of european jews were murdered in the 30s and 40s.

For people like you allies video tapede the camps, made german and local civllians tour the camps in germany and recorded witness testimony and presevered germanies own meticulous records.

But moreover, why is it a surprise, the nazis did what they said they were going to do, they jsut didnt have the chance to finish murdering all the jews and were jsut getting started on the slavs. Afterall, nazis did not see jews or slavs as human, so why is it a surprise that they went about murdering them?

Why is there such a movement for holcoaust denial... while pan acceptance of much less well document genocides like armenia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't get denial, Hitler and the Nazis are almost comically and 2 dimensionally evil in a way that almost never happens in history. 

Of course the leadership never denied the holocaust... Massive genoicde was the reason why the  Nazis fought the war. Some like goering tried to distance themselves a bit from it and core Nazi ideology, or pretend not to be aware of the extent, but no one tried the it did not happen defense. 

Hitler laid out the idea of Lebensraum, or living space in his prewar speeches and writings. The plan was to murder everyone in eastern europe and colonize it with germans.

They started with the jews as they were deemed subhuman/ inferior and hitler saw them as a threat that weakened germany. They were the priority and even as the war was turning he still poured resources into slaughtering them.

But, it was just the warm up act, they planned to murder millions more slavs and others too. The holocaust was not an event that happened as a part of the world war II, it was why the Nazis went to war. It even guided strategic planning and was at the core of hitlers refusal to authorize retreats on the eastern front. 

It was almost like for the nazis, winning the war and not committing genocide was not victory at all... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Entire villages... gone. 6 million never to be seen againn (+ the 5-6 million additional non jews, gays/roma/etc). The scary part is that it was the warm up act. 

They planned to kill the jews, that was priority #1, such that even as the soviets were advancing and the allies were opening new fronts, germany still devoted logistics and man power to killing jews.

The there was phase 2 where hitler planned to murder and enslave all the slavs in eastern russia/ukraine/poland and colonize the areas with germans. 

He was so set on this that he refused to authorise retreats on the eastern front any any cost, even if it meant over stretched supply lines and spread out defensive positions because it would mean loss of territory where he could muder everyone and colonize with slavs.

That is the scary part... the 6 million was practice for the full plan and for Hitler the entire point of the military plan was to carry out it out, all or nothing.

When people search for the holocaust they are looking for scholarly vetted and accepted work, just like they might if they searched for the American revolution etc. Because of how vocal deniers are it can skew results and game the system so people might get those results first. It makes the internet unusable because now you can't find properly sourced relevant info. 

Google makes the whole internet usable. People have forgotten how far search engines have come and how hard it was to find things in the 90s and early 00s.

So western/Russian (now Chinese) middle eastern meddling is a problem but Iranian vs gulf, Sunni vs Shiite, anti Israel fixation, tribalism (some places) etc... has resulted in regression in social norms, increase violence and radicalization, economic stagnation... etc.

If Trump had Alzheimers his tweets would reference past events or circumstances. He would have difficulty staying on message rally to rally etc. 

His denial of past tweets is perplexing but I think it is more likely that he lives in his own reality and as most con men, is used to bluffing and denying his way through obstacles. 

His media approach this entire campaign is deny, redirect, attack. I think the bigger concern is Trump's willingness to lie, bypass the media, and constantly attack the press, degrading any challenge to his own propaganda and claims.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hitler by accounts had an incredibly detailed memory. Also he was, it seems,  a charismatic both as a public speaker and in private. His downfall was in that he assumed he knew everything. 

In practice his military training was minimal, he was a pretty low level officer in WWI. Early successes in WWII some because of changes at his behest made him buy into his tactical genius. As the war went on and things got worse, he became paranoid and distrustful and took more and more control resulting in more and more mistakes.

Furthermore, his dogma of murdering all the Jews/Slavs/etc and gaining "living space" for Germany meant he refused to authorize any retreats on the eastern front meaning units were isolate and destroyed with over stretched supply lines and were destroyed. He also continued to devote massive ressources to his genocidal undertakings even as everything else was falling apart.

At the end of the day, intelligence is but one part of success. Hitler probably was relatively intelligent in some ways, if not in well rounded ways. In Hitler's case, ideology, hubris and paranoia were his undoing. Also, the meth and opiates didn't help. Probably based on his odd personal behaior has underlying personality disorder or mental illness too.

Trump is:

* 2) Engaged in murky business practices that probably have conflicts of interest with US interests.
* 3) Naming a cohort of billionaires, generals, and wall street to his cabinet.
* 4) Refusing to do press conferences, holding rallies and disseminating media directly through you tube. 
* 5) Hired an alt-right media leader as his chief strategist. 
* 6) Refuses to investigate widespread allegations a foreign power has engaged in disruptive propaganda and cyber warfare in America while his staff stripped any sanction of said government from the republican platform and appointed pro-Russia nominees to his cabinet. 
* 7) Puts his children who are going to run his businesses on calls dealing with state matters.
* 8) Constantly attacks any dissenting press reports or any press reports that do not support his narcissistic narrative...

	<TEXT> But you did see nazism rise in Germany and the violence that preceded that, or 1918 Russia, or the violence in Latin American unrest such as FARC and other revolutionary Latin American movements. In Vietnam you had ho chi min, in China the communist uprisings etc... 

Islamic terroriziam has reached the state its at now because of continued conditions and instability of Islamic regions and continued support from Saudi and whabist sources. Furthermore, the internet has expanded their reach and communication in a unprecedented way.

Furthermore, to your conjecture regarding the welfare of these countries under colonial rule, it was the excesses of colonial rule and the lack of real organic institutions that resulted in popoular uprisings and then the collapse of any real democratic or modern institutions... often fueled by competing geopolitical agendas and resource needs of western powers as well as sectarian divisions previously exploited by western powers.

	<TEXT> I do not believe that the Koran and Muslim teachings are somehow uniquely destabilizing and corrupting. People make decisions based on how they are incentivized and sometimes when their is instability it makes people respond on maladaptive ways. Combatting extremism means getting at why here is instability and give people alternative ways to address their anger or frustration or fear. 

Fundamentalism and fanaticism in any for is bad and saying let's stop admitting muslims, let's kick out the one that are here and let's single out this religion for further scrutiny is a bad precedent and ultimately will be more corissive to Europe than beneficial. 

Socioeconomic engagement and helping restore middle eastern stability will help stem the flow of migrants and reduce radicalization. Dwelling on Islam using 19the century Churchill quotes is not helpful and ironic because as an agent of British empire he helped set up the conditions of today's instability.

	<TEXT> That is a fine quote but it happens that islam is the religion of these dysfunctional countries. In other places other forces wrought havoc. From pol pot onward. Moreover, the british exploited sectarian and religous differences to control and subjugate large tracts or asia and the middle east. 1890s anthopological and econiomic observation needs to be viewed from the colonial circumstances of the time and observer.

I think the answer is more complex than something about islamic teaching or culture is some potent mechanism to breed terrorism.Rather, the issue is lack of civic institutions in many of these countries, lack of access to accurate and free press, corruption, poverty and high birth rates. Furthermore, the middle east has been particularly destabilised by a mixture of dutch disease, foreign geopolitical jostling, and corrupt strongmen.

This is important because its clues us into what needs to be done and it is a warning to Western democracies about the risks of what can happen in their own countries. 

Ultimately, the Syrian situation needs to be addressed and the instability there stemmed so that the flow or refugees stops. Otherwise, how are you going to stop millions of desperate people flowing over borders without spending huge resources on militarizing the border. Also, middle eastern instability creates the space for isis and other radicalization.

Western Europeans needs to stop fixating on Israel and address the middle eastern nation's disfunction... which will be hard, but its the only way. Just like in America no wall will stop desperate hondurans who face death at home... same with Syrians and other middle eastern refugees.

	<TEXT> See, voters misunderstood, they thought Trump was going to end corruption when he meant to drain the swamp. 

What Trump meant, being the business guru he is, was that our current system of corruption was inefficient.

Why have a swamp at all? Let us drain it and let the swamp creatures move into the white house and executive office building... 

Really just an innocent misunderstanding of an ambiguous campaign slogan. Actually, in a couple years, he is further going to streamline the process and outsource the decision making to the Kremlin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, why are there no Greek conspiracy theories? There are plenty of Greek tycoons and Greeks in America are also very successful. It's because while Jews historically were a part of insular communities, on the other side of the equation, governmental and religious institutions around the world have for centuries created a cannon of antisemtic conspiracy theories for various self serving reasons over the ages. You had the czars and elders of Zion, Hitler and his claim the Jews were weakening the aryans, Jews drinking christians blood (inquisition, I think)... etc. 

This tradition continued in Arab dictatorships to drive their own nationalist agendas and now has moved into the lexicon of Arab theocratic governments and organizations.

For someone bored, or dissatisfied looking to find someone to point a finger against Jews are an easy target because they don't even have to make  up their own conspiracy theories. There is an existing library of 100s of years of state sponsored propaganda and conspiracy theories about Jews. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, not the dirt that mattered. People didn't care about trump u or trump being on record molesting women or walking in on changing teen pageant contestants. 

Core trump voters in swing states bought his economic promise of jobs and did so not on policy proposals but on the nebulous idea that since he was good at "business" that he would figure it out.

What would have hurt trump is leaked tax returns showing his business operations and who he owes money to as it would get at the core of his ability or understanding to deliver on his economic promises. </TEXT>
