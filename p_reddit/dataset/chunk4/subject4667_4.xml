	<TEXT> I just started this. I'm approaching the line where I work for free or charge money. I'm desperate for a job though so I'm charging money. So far everyone loves what I put out, and I'll be job shadowing a professional who is highly successful in a couple weeks to gain more experience. I'm entirely self taught and have a very creative imagination. Hope it works out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would switch photos to the beat of the music. Every other beat or every 4.. just make it flow with the rhythm of the music. Also, cross dissolve transitions and other transition effects to add variety. But nothing cheesy or overly complicated. Looks like a nice video though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is what I'm doing. Nobody else has the flexibility to allow me to have bad days or weeks so I am working for myself doing what I love (photography and video), and I happen to be decent at it so I am pursuing it as a career and spending my days at home learning how to improve and practicing. If you can work for yourself and make money then id recommend it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I cant tell if half these comments are genuine opinions or people just making a sarcastic mockery of everything. Also the media lies and twists truths all the time just to keep ratings up. I don't understand why people even watch the news. It's biased depending on what channel you watch and they report things without providing proof or facts and they speculate, causing people to take speculation as a reliable fact source. People should support the new President because they can't change the fact he was elected instead of constantly trying to find ways to slander him. Spend that energy looking for ways to help him be the president we need rather than blame him for shit in the past. Not saying I'm a fan of Trump, but we're stuck with him. Make the best of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am. Fuck everyone. Nobody gives a shit about us unless it makes them look good or feel like a better person. Mobile phone stores are out to screw everyone anyway so they probably deserved it. High stress situations will trigger my rage and the reaction releases endorphins that make me feel better but make those around me fearful. The problem is we will never get anywhere in life by giving into these feelings. We have to suppress them and be who they want us to be to succeed. It's a shitty hand we've been dealt, but fighting the current will only wear you down and you'll keep ending up back at the bottom. When you get on medication you'll be able to deal with all the bullshit. Best wishes. </TEXT>
