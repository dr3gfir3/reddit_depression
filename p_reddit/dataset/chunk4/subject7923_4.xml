	<TEXT> I know this was a few weeks ago, but here are my two cents.  
This probably goes against what everyone else does, but I just accumulate egg whites from other things I bake when I only need the yolks. I just store it in the freezer if I know I'm taking a bit of hiatus from baking. Fridge otherwise. HOWEVER, I have also just used a fresh egg out of the fridge before as well. Especially for Italian method.      
When I bake macarons, I weigh out some cold egg whites in a small bowl and place that bowl inside a larger one filled with hot water (I've never had an issue with them being cooked from that) so that they reach room temp.   
And for the drying of the shells, I set the oven to about 25 degrees hotter than I need it and literally hold the tray inside and rotate it every 10 seconds. After about a minute, the shells have formed a nice skin. Then I throw them in to start baking and drop the temp back down to normal (it probably already reached that level by my having the door open while rotating the tray).  
It saves me the 30 minutes it would normally take for them to dry out and I haven't really noticed a difference. Feet come out just fine and the macarons bake well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It may or may not come up, but for my own reference, this was the recipe I used.  
I based my recipe from Justonecookbook, which covers a basic green tea one. However, I split the batter into three and added flavoring at the end. I'm not sure if that's taboo, since the recipe said don't overmix...BUT, I didn't have any issues so I think it's fine. I'll list what I did. The thai tea, ube, and green tea amounts are for 1/3 of the batter. If you want to make just one of those flavors, multiply by 3.    
 nbsp;  
**Madeleines:** *thai tea/ ube/ green tea*  [18-20 total madeleines]  
113 g unsalted butter + some melted butter for coating pan  
113 g sugar  
120 g flour (sifted)   
pinch of salt  
5 g baking powder  
2 large eggs  (room temp)  
15 g milk  
*For green tea:* 2.5 g matcha powder  
*For ube:* 2.5 g ube extract  
*For thai tea:*  2.5 g thai tea powder  
 nbsp;  
1. Melt butter in a small pan. Cool butter to room temp once it has melted.  
2. Add sugar, flour, and sugar into a bowl. *Note*, if you're going to make only one flavor, add any dry ingredients now (thai tea powder or matcha powder). Whisk to combine.    
3. In a separate bowl, add eggs and milk and whisk until frothy throughout. If you're making only the ube flavor, add the ube extract to this mixture.     
4. Add the wet ingredients to dry ingredients and fold together.  
5. Add the cooled butter and fold some more until completely blended.  
6. Now, for multiple flavors, divide your batter into three (I put ~150 g of this batter into two other bowls).  
7. Add in the flavoring and fold until incorporated. I tried not over over mixing.  
8. Cool the batters down in the fridge for at least an hour or if you're in a hurry you can throw them in the freezer for 30 min (guilty).  
9. Use a pastry brush or something to spread the melted butter onto the madeleine pan. Be generous.  
10. Fill each mold with some batter. I put the pan on a scale and added in 25 g of batter. It equated to about a 1 tbsp of batter. Youtube videos online also use those small ice cream scoops as well. You don't want to overfill it.  
11. Bake at 375F for 11 min.  
12. Take out and let cool for a few minutes and then remove from pans and let cool further on a cooling rack.  
 nbsp;  
**Custard:** *thai tea/ ube/ green tea*  
1 large egg yolk  
9.25 g corn starch  
85 g milk  
25 g sugar  
~1ish gram of either thai tea powder, ube extact, or matcha powder  
 nbsp;  
1. Combine egg yolks and cornstarch until fully incorporated.  
2. In a saucepan, high heat, combine milk and sugar. If you're just doing one flavor for the custard, incorporate it now.  
3. Bring to boil and remove from heat.  
4. While whisking constantly, slowly add to bowl with yolks and cornstarch. You are tempering the egg yolks so that they won't scramble.  
5. Return the mixture to the saucepan on high heat.  
6. Bring to rolling boil, while whisking/ mixing constantly. The mixture will become custard like.  
7. To get rid of lumps in your custard you can either sieve it through a fine mesh or use a hand blender (works like magic!). Or you might not have any lumps to begin with and then you're all set.  
8. Divide custard into three and then stir in respective flavoring.  
9. Add custard into a piping bag with a small tip.  
 nbsp;  
**Filling:**  
1. Make a cavity in the madeleines. I was ghetto and stabbed the bottom edge of the madeleine with a chopstick and swirled it around, making sure to not crack the entry point or the cookie itself. 
2. Pipe in the custard. You should feel pressure to stop/ see that the cookie might crack soon.  
3. Enjoy the deliciousness :D.  
 nbsp;  
*Final notes:*  
It might be beneficial to make the custard first, that way you can pipe it into warm madeleines. I didn't do that and it still worked, but I figure the cookie is easier to cavitize (is this a word?) when warm.  
Gluck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm telling you, it's the extract! I'm surprised more places aren't incorporating these flavors since they're super easy to add to any base recipes. But yea, even in Northern California, don't see much of them. Hmph. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many thanks. After knowing all the hard work that goes in, I'm still on the fence about having to pay a ton of money when you buy a slice of mousse cake at a patisserie. On one hand, I get it. It's tough making for anyone with a normal job and takes many hours. But on the other hand, I'm broke and they're so expensive. Plus, it's a baker's job and just a small fraction of what they'd be working on. Merp. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem. Typing recipes up also helps me next time I need a component since I can just pull up Reddit instead of getting my laptop. :)  
The mousse and gel are super good, so you could do those components and a chocolate sponge base. More reasonable :). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/KlaatuBaradaNibble , /u/DJFlabberGhastly, /u/_not-the-NSA_,  
Sorry, didn't realize stuff was hidden when I initially posted links earlier. I finally finished transcribing the translated recipe from *Verdade de sabor: torta rubus* (you can search for it online). Lots of things didn't make sense with the translation, so I included what I did.    
 nbsp;  
Heads up, it's a very long process. Lots of freezing/ cooling wait steps. Not for the faint of heart. However, the blackberry mousse and gel is really good. So if you're going to make anything, make those. :D   
 nbsp;  
There are 6 components: the chocolate sponge (sort of like a Jaconde sponge), blackberry jam, blackberry mousse, blackberry gele, vanilla cream cheese mousse, and a mirror glaze. This recipe is for a circular cake around 7.5 - 8 inches diameter).    
 nbsp;  
**1. Chocolate Sponge:**  
70 g almond flour  
70 g powdered sugar   
70 g egg yolk   
30 g egg white (1)   
130 g egg white (2)   
45 g sugar  
55 g flour  
20 g cocoa powder  
25 g melted butter  
 nbsp;  
1. Preheat oven to 440F. Get a sheet pan and lie down some parchment paper of silpat.  
2. Mix almond flour and powdered sugar.   
3. To that same bowl, add the yolks and the whites (1) and beat until smooth.   
4. Add the sifted flour and cocoa powder.  
5. Make a meringue by whisking the second egg whites (2) with the sugar to stiff peaks.   
6. Fold the meringue into the rest of the ingredients.  
7. Finally, add the melted butter and gently mix.   
8. Pour the dough on a baking sheet (it shouldnt really move that much since its a thick batter, so just make sure its spread out enough for the size of the cake youre making) and bake for 6 minutes. Use a toothpick to make sure the batter has cooked.   
9. Cool cake and separate from silpat. Cut out your cake shape (6.5-7in).  
 nbsp;  
**2. Blackberry jam:**  
70 g sugar (1)   
15 ml of water  
40 g corn syrup  
200g frozen blackberries  
8 g pectin    
45 g sugar (2)  
12 ml lemon juice  
 nbsp;  
1. In a small bowl, mix the sugar (2) and pectin.   
2. In a small saucepan, add the water, corn syrup, frozen blackberries and lemon juice. Put on medium heat, stirring constantly.   
3. Once the sugar has dissolved and blackberries have thawed, stir the mixture until its very smooth.  
4. When it comes to a boil, take off the heat and pour a thin stream of a mixture onto the sugar/ pectin, stirring constantly.   
5. Put back into the saucepan and boil on high for a few minutes until it reduces a good amount (about 5 minutes).   
6. Remove from heat and strain through a sieve. Let cool.   
7. When the jam has cooled and thickened, put a thin layer on top of the sponge cake. Put in the fridge to cool.  
 nbsp;  
**3. Blackberry Mousse:**  
90 g heavy cream     
90 g of blackberry pulp (pureed)  
3.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)   
18 g berry liqueur     
30 g Italian meringue **  
**  
15 g water  
60g sugar  
30 g egg white  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom the gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get an apple sauce like consistency.    
2. Heat the blackberry puree over medium heat and dissolve the soaked gelatin in it. Pour in a bowl and leave to cool.   
3. Prepare the Italian meringue:   
a. In a small saucepan, combine the sugar and water.  
b. On low and stirring occasionally, cook the syrup.   
c. Start whisking the egg whites until foaming.   
d. When the syrup reaches 240F, remove the saucepan from the heat pour in a thin stream, while whisking the egg white.   
e. Continue whisking to stiff peaks, then add in the berry liqueur.   
4. Whip the cream. Prechilled bowl and whisk speed up the process.  
5. Fold in meringue into the puree/gelatin (make sure its not warm).   
6. Fold in the whipped cream into that mixture.   
7. Pour the mousse into a mold or cake ring (6.5-7in) for and make a layer a little under an inch. Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**4. Blackberry Gele:**  
4.5 g gelatin (+ about 15 g water to bloom)    
100 g pulp of blackberry (pureed)  
50 g water  
30 g sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Bloom gelatin. Stir water into gelatin to get apple sauce consistency.  
2. Head the blackberry puree, water and sugar in a small saucepan and dissolve sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Remove from heat and add the gelatin. Mix. 
4. Cool to room temperature.   
5. Pour over the frozen blackberry mousse, forming a thin layer (less than half an inch). Freeze.  
 nbsp;  
**5. Vanilla Cream Cheese Mousse:**  
70 ml of milk  
50 g sugar  
2 tsp vanilla (or to taste)  
4 egg yolks  
9.5 g gelatin (+about 20 g water to bloom)   
250 g of cream cheese   
350 g heavy cream   
40 g dark chocolate  (shaved/ chopped)   
 nbsp;    
1. Bloom gelatin.  
2. Add egg yolks and sugar into a bowl and whisk a bit until they become a bit whiter in color.  
3. In a saucepan, mix milk and vanilla and bring to a boil.   
4. As soon as the milk starts to boil, remove it from the heat and pour a thin stream (about hald the milk mixture) onto the egg yolks/sugar, whisking constantly. This is tempering the egg yolks so they wont scramble.   
5. Pour the mixture back into the saucepan with remaining milk and set on low heat.   
6. While constantly mixing/ whisking, bring the mixture up to 170F.  
7. Remove from heat and add in gelatin and stir until fully dissolved.  
8. Stir in the room temp cream cheese.   
9. If the mixture isnt already, let it cool to 85F.  
10. Whip the heavy cream.  
11. Fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture.   
12. Fold in the chocolate shavings.  
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. In a larger mold (8in), add about half of the cream cheese mousse.  
2. Next, add the frozen layers of blackberry mousse and jelly and gently push them into the mousse.   
3. Next, lay out the remaining mousse with cream cheese.   
4. Finally, add the layer of sponge cake with blackberry jam and also slightly push it to the mousse.   
5. Add saran wrap to cover/tighten the mold and put into the freezer for a few hours.   
 nbsp;  
**6. Mirror Glaze:**  
100 g white chocolate   
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency.   
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, and sugar and bring to a boil.   
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted. If you have a hand blender, I highly recommend that you use it to blend the chocolate.   
5. Portion off and add desired food coloring. Do some more hand blending.  
6. Bring the glaze to about room temp.  
 nbsp;  
**Final Decoration:**  
1. After cake has set, remove from mold and set it on top of a smaller bowl or something in a sheet pan.   
2. Pour glaze over, creating desired designs with other colors.  
3. Let the glaze fully drip off. Clean off the surplus drips on the bottom of the cake and then transfer to a serving plate.  
4. Garnish with whatever other fancy stuff you want.  
5. Freeze or refrigerate. The mousse tastes when its not frozen, but even then, still good!  
 nbsp;  
This is a marathon to make. I guarantee it's delicious though! Gluck! </TEXT>

Sorry, I posted the link but didn't realize it would be hidden.

I google translated a recipe I found on Verdade de sabor [Google "**Verdade de sabor torta rubus**"]. She lists both Russian and Portuguese recipes, but each on their own is a bit confusing at times. So I translated both and cross referenced in order to figure out what to do. I'll post a translated recipe that worked for me a bit later.  
 nbsp;  
NOTE: Oh yah, forgot to mention...it takes forever. A normal person who has a job cannot finish this in a day...maybe two. Lots of freezing/ cooling wait steps. Take that into account. :p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone!,  
I've gotten the mousse cake bug. Well, I've wanted to make one for a while ...they look so beautiful on Insta! I finally got around to making one and of course I used a mirror glaze, since it's a requirement for it to look legit, right? :p  
 nbsp;  
Here's my question. How do you accomplish the spider web glaze technique? I tried doing it with a recipe I found on a forum and it came out so bad (i.e. there was zero effect).  
I used a simple syrup with gelatin and some white food coloring for the "spider web" component.  
 nbsp;  
If any of you have played around with mirror glazes and could offer any pointers, I'd be super grateful!  
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! I was happy with the flavors!  
The blackberry mousse and gele were definitely my favorite components. Next time I'll probably make mousse bombes (those half dome things at fancy bakeries) with just blackberry mousse with a blackberry gele center and chocolate sponge cake base.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bottom up: chocolate sponge, blackberry jam, vanilla cream cheese mousse w/ chocolate shavings, blackberry gele, blackberry mousse, more vanilla cream cheese mousse, and then a white chocolate mirror glaze on top :D.  </TEXT>
