	<TITLE> Oregon MPJE? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi fellow Redditors!


I'm looking to get licensed in Oregon sometime this year. I looked at the Board of Pharmacy website and found a PDF of their pharmacy laws. Is this sufficient for the Oregon MPJE or is there a text book I should look for?

Thanks in advance for any information you can provide! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, I'm not bringing much with me, just clothes and a few kitchen essentials. I was thinking of subleasing a room or apartment and spending 1-2 months looking around actually, since I know a lot of students are trying to sublease their space around that time.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Moving to Eugene in June! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi guys and gals,

I'm moving to Eugene in June! I've done some combing through city-data and thought I would also give Reddit a try. I'm looking for either a studio or 1 bedroom apartment to rent for 1 person, preferably under $800/month. 

I'm not really picky in terms of the condition of the place as long as it's clean and safe (ie. no mold, no sketchy neighborhood, etc.). If you could point me in the direction of town I should avoid, that would be also great. Any information you can provide is greatly appreciated! Thanks in advance!

	<TEXT> Same here, I've noticed that Target definitely favors newer talents. I know a PIC that was reprimanded for the pharmacy not doing well (it's not really hear fault though, lots of CVS's and Walgreens's around). She ended up quitting and they had to hire someone else, fresh out of school to be the PIC. 

I think for the most part, Target treats you better than Walgreens or CVS though. As for the interview, they really like to hear about teamwork, fun, fast, friendly, leadership, etc. They really like enthusiasm and perky people are definitely who they look for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't really say how it will be in 4 years or so, but I'm guessing it will be more competitive. I think as long as you're willing to move just about anywhere, you'll be able to find a job. If you're hoping to get a job in a big city (ie. Boston, Seattle, etc.), then the chances are pretty slim. 

Most retail companies secure their employees in the fall semester. The undesirable locations will have openings year round though. In terms of hospital, it looks like they like interns who did rotations with them, you know someone who works there, or just get lucky and get your application in at the right time with the right people. This is what I've seen at least.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For retail, I think the best time was in October or November of last year. Our school had a career fair and a lot of my classmates got their offers that way or they were already in the system and just accepted offers from the companies they're already working for. I did have a friend who didn't match for a residency and scrambled for a job in April and May last year. He was able to get a job, but in a very undesirable area. 

As for hospital, I'm really not sure. I talked to some pharmacists who work at a hospital and they all say to apply as soon possible. But from what I've observed, most hospital openings aren't really open, they're hiring internally or students who are graduating in the area. Other hospitals are looking to fill the position ASAP so I'm not even sure if they consider P4's applications. I applied for a few hospital positions and got the same message, "we're looking for someone with experience". Oh and it seems everyone prefers a residency now.  </TEXT>
