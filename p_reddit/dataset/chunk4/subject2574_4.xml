	<TEXT> The problem with spikes in traffics (which is what I assume happens when she asks for donations) is that if the traffic is too much, you'll see similar effects to DDoS attacks: slow responses, overloaded databases, saturated pipes.  

It's important to note that (in the tweet provided) Anita didn't say that this is a DDoS.  Merely that her website is down.  Now, that's objectively true.  If you consider that a "website" is the sum of the parts of the database server and the web application server, then one being up doesn't mean anything: without the database, the website is functionally dead.

Of course, if GamerGate folks want to be extremely pedantic, technically, yes, her webserver is responding to connections while her database is down.  But it amounts to the same thing: her website is functionally useless. </TEXT>

i definitely believe that a good culture is able to foster amazing work, but part of a good culture is an accepting culture.  

but this is also kind of a tangent to the original point. a good culture is also one who would balk at hiring someone steeped deep in the worst of GamerGate talking points.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This game certainly has the potential to top Telltale's TWD, considering that the Game of Thrones style fantasy setting feels certainly fresh compared to zombie survival

I agree with the setting, but unfortunately, I don't know if I agree with the potential.  TT did a smart thing with TWD by creating a pretty good gulf between game and show/comic.  

But it looks like with GoT, they are aiming directly at the established fanbase -- and by doing so, put immense pressure on their own original narrative from existing Song of Ice and Fire characters and plotlines.

I'd almost rather if they took Westeros the setting but not GoT the time period. </TEXT>

But I agree that it's not nearly as free as TWD from the comics, or Wolf from Fables.  

Due to the fact that TT set this game in the middle of Song of Ice and Fire proper, there's immense narrative pressure from the existing characters and plot points.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds like to me they just thought the opening was lackluster -- I mean, their problems with ep 1 are right there in the review:

 Characters and events are often brought up seemingly to remind the viewer that they're in Westeros, and not enough time is spent making us care about House Forrester before the characters are put in danger both direct and existential.

 It feels like a slow episode of the show and, although the story could go into a few interesting directions, as it stands it often feels like you're simply standing on the periphery of much greater struggles.

I think Telltale did a wonderful job with TWD in crafting a series of episodes that felt *important* from the get go, and not just a tertiary side story in a large narrative being played out somewhere else.

I think that's going to be much harder to do with GoT.  I'm certainly going to be playing it because I love both the books and tv episodes, but at the same time, I don't think I'll ever truly forget that this is, ultimately, a side story.

I don't know if that worry or feeling warrants a 6.5, but on the other hand, I acknowledge that it is a potential downer for what sounds like a decent but ultimately slow start to the season. 

EDIT: To the point about "Got" and "any who knows anything about it", I think that's true.  But I also think that you can have a lot of fun with TWD or Wolf or even the new Borderlands without knowing very much about the setting beforehand.  You don't have to be a fan of TWD or Fables or Borderlands *before* the game to enjoy the game.  So I definitley think it's valid criticism.  Perhaps TT set out to pen a letter to GoT fans with this new series -- I certainly wouldn't mind it.  But as an actual game available for purchase, I think it's also fair to judge its approachability compared to other TT games. </TEXT>

It's the kind of thinking wherein emailing advertisers and trying to get writers (and other opponents) fired makes snse.  It's the "I'M GOING TO TELL YOUR PARENTS" thinking that they seem to be unable to shake off.  

They appear to think that the only reason they have not been taken seriously is that they have not yet appealed to a high enough power.

	<TEXT> You're a gamer if you call yourself a gamer.  It's honestly as simple as that, IMO.

Gamer isn't a title that has rigorous requirements or some sort of qualification stage.  It's like calling yourself a foodie.  If you care enough about food to actually want to self label as a foodie, then go for it.

Sure, some people -- other foodies, other gamers -- might scoff and say "you aren't a *real* gamer", but that's fine.  To others, they are't either.  You can always get more hardcore.

But labels like "gamer" and "foodie" have much more to do with self-categorization than third-party categorization according to a set of rules (rules that also change from person to person). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  matt Taylor probably assumed that considering his female friend seemed fine with it he thought it was okay

It's important to note that she gave it to him *for his birthday*, as a gift.  That's it.  Period.  According to her, she was just as surprised as anyone else when he wore her shirt live, in public, for the world to see.  It wasn't a gift for him to wear to work, it wasn't a celebration of landing a comet shirt, it was a birthday gift.

There was no approval, implicit or otherwise, given from the maker of the shirt to Matt Taylor to wear his shirt at the time and context that he did.

The irrelevance of who made the shirt and why aside, I generally agree that he wore the shirt, he gave a sincere apology.  And the world, for the most part, has moved on.  Except for those who extremely offended *on his behalf* who can't seem to let it go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (Caveat I *absolutely* agree that you should not preorder if you cannot cancel the preorder or otherwise get out of it)

So while I get this, I'm still going to pre-order games at Amazon.  Why? Because it's to my advantage.

1. I can still cancel the pre-order without any issue usually by the time reviews come out (Amazon doesn't ship the game until 1-2 days before its launch date)

2. Even if I forget to cancel the pre-order, I can (and have on some occasions) simply refused shipment to return the game to Amazon.

3. I still get pre-order perks.

4. It saves me the the ordeal of having to go into a Gamestop or Best Buy if I want a physical copy on launch day.

Yes, I realize that I can simply wait until launch day and then order from Amazon and only get it a few days late.  But why?

But in general, I think that it's *fascinating* that it work so well given the simple algorithm that it follows.  Speaks to some neat things about people's follow habits and where a lot of the more objectionable tweets are coming from.

EDIT: there's been a few other things that people have written that speak to the same following/follower habits that the block list script goes into.  One example is megablock, a script that makes it so that when you block someone, you also block everyone that follows that person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get what you're trying to say, but things like:

 Even without any elisp knowledge, emacs is superior at editing text. The only thing other editors have are more "normal" keybindings and plugins that are easier to install

show a startling ignorance of what other editors can do out of the box.  Things like workable multiple major modes (Textmate did this particularly well when it was first released), interestin snippet systems (in fact, clones of Textmate's snippet system are popular plugins for both Emacs and Vim), multi-cursor editing (Sublime Text refined the UI of this action so that it was relatively intuitive for most), centralized package and plugin upgrade/config screens (Atom is doing a pretty great job of managing their plugin ecosystem).

I get that you like Emacs a lot.  But I think it's also beneficial for us Emacs users (I personally use Emacs with Evil for vim keybindings, because I think native Emacs keybindings are atrocious) to step outside the cave once in a while and see what's out there.

The world of text editors have not stood still. </TEXT>

* Will Wight's Traveler's Gate books.
* Peter V Brett's Demon Cycle 
* Michael J Sullivan's Riyria Revelations
* Jim Butcher's Codex Alera novels
* Feist's Magician: Apprentice and Magician: Master, though probablby not his later Riftwar books
* David Eddings' The Belgariad 
* Steven Brusts's Vlad Taltos series
* Pullman's His Dark Materials

Some books that I think would be great seinen anime that takes itself more seriously:

* Zelazny's Chronicles of Amber 
* Abercrombie's First Law books
* Mark Lawrence's Broken Empire novels
* Steven Erikson's Malazan novels, if you imagine it done one a scale and breadth like Legend of the Galactic Heroes
* China Mieville's Bas-lag 

Some that would be great one-shot anime films:

* Guy Gavriel Kay's Tigana
* Beagle's The Last Unicorn
* American Gods by Neil Gaiman
* Stover's Heroes Die
* Zelazny's Lord of Light
* Heinlein's Glory Road
* Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman
* Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell

	<TEXT> Generally, my favorite fantasy books draw me on one or more of these things: sharp dialogue, deep magical systems/settings, honest character growth that extends to beyond the standard fantasy "powering-up" tropes, a sense of history to the world -- something that makes it feel lived in, or a complex protagonist isn't defined by a notion of being "good" or "evil".

Not all my favorites have all of these, of course. And many of them probably actively lack some of the things I mentioned -- but thinking about it, they all tend to exhibit one or more of the things I mentioned above.

Examples:

David Eddings' books don't, to put it favorably, have the most original narratives or magic systems.  What they do have though are passages of dialogue that I find pretty delightful.

Terry Pratchett's Discworld books have a land that feels lived in, has amazing dialogue, and actually a surprising amount of character growth for some. 

Malazan is obtuse, complex, and honestly hard to get into.  But I loved it.  The world felt like it existed before I started reading.  It felt realized.

The Coldfire trilogy by C.S. Friedman had an amazing world, and probably one of the most fascinating characters in fantasy that I can remember in the form of Gerald Tarrant.

Similarly, I loved Logan Ninefingers in Abercrombie's First Law books -- and in the Red Country followup. </TEXT>

Pretty much everything written by Charles De Lint, particularly his Newford books.  Many of these are less action oriented, but still just as focused on infusing magic in a modern world.

An earlier thread asking about books focused on mages/magic reminded me of this novel, and it's sequels.  It was probably amongst my favorite "magic-oriented" books growing up.  

I loved the breakdown of the different types of magic.  It doesn't match the complexity of many of the modern magic systems in terms of mechanical depth, but I loved it conceptually.

(The other "magicky" books I read in and loved my formative years was Jack Vance's Dying Earth novels.  I read them shortly after getting heavily into AD D, and then got my mind promptly blown when I realized the magic system was basically lifted from the Dying Earth stories) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IMO, Metacritic correlates with sales for a couple of reasons:

1. Highly rated games tend to sell well, because they are good.  

2. Gaming consumers put (probably more than they should) a lot of weight into Metacritic scores, and review scores in general.  I know for a while when I didn't have a lot of time or money after college, I just trolled metacritic every couple of months and only looked at games with  8. 

I actually think Steam user reviews are some of the best in the industry for precisely one reason: they put how many hours the user has played of the game.

That user review with 4 hours into Skyrim? Yeah, probably not super trustworthy.  That user review with 40+ or even 100+ hours into Skyrim? Yeah, probably worth reading.

(Though that also brings up self-selecting bias issues, where users with high numbers of hours into a game will be necessarily more favorable to that game) </TEXT>

*****

Been seeing a lot of FUD being spread by GG supporters about Adsense, and what it means.  So, a brief explainer.

**Google Adsense** is an *ad network* operated by Google. **Google DFP** is an *ad server* operated by Google.  This is also known as Doubleclick for Publishers.

These are separate offerings that are tied closely together because they are both owned by Google.  They are, however, still distinct products.

Checking Gamasutra's page source, there's heavy evidence that they are using Google DFP, and not straight Adsense tags.  What does this mean?

Here's how Google describes Adsense vs DFP. From https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/112651?hl=en: 

 With Google AdSense, you can display contextually-relevant, unobtrusive Google ads on your website's pages to earn money. With DFP Small Business, you can manage your directly-sold and network-based online advertising inventory in addition to Google AdSense.

Google also provides a handy table comparing the two products at the end of this page:

https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6022000?hl=en ref_topic=6021031 rd=1

And if you're really curious about some standard terminology in the world of online ads, here's a a good page about DFP terms (though many of these are pretty common to the industry): 

https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/6012282?hl=en

And lastly, if you are still curious about online ads and how they are delivered, Google has a pretty handy white paper that goes over the basics: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1143651?hl=en

**Some important things to take away:**

1. Adsense and DFP are not mutually exclusive but are also not the same thing.  Adsense is an ad network.  Google DFP is an ad server that is capable of using the Adsense network to serve ads.

2. To further distinguish DFP from Adsense, there's nothing requiring a user of Google DFP to actually use the Adsense network. Many sites do, however, and Google even has a page explaining why somemight might want to turn on Adsense for their DFP ad units: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/112640?hl=en

3. The code for rendering ads using Google DFP essentially matches up to what Gamasutra uses for their ad slot rendering.

4. Most importantly, the code that is used does not change whether or not the ad is sourced from Adsense or an existing DFP line item.  All the code does is fill in a designated payload into a designated ad slot.  This mean that if a GamerGater says "this is obviously Adsense code because an Adsense ad is generated", it is false. The same exact code, unmodified, is also capable of serving up non-Adsense ads.

**It's just Adsense! says the sneering GamerGater**

Now, I've seen "Adsense" used as a derogatory moniker for Gamastura ads.  "It's just adsense!" is a pretty common refrain from GamerGaters.  It's silly. 

First, as evidenced, Gamasutra is using DFP to serve their ads, not Adsense. So a more accurate refrain woudl be "It's just DFP!"  Which is even more silly, because DFP is used by sites for their ad needs that get tens to hundreds of millions of page hits a month.  

Second, an ad does not need to run 100% of the time in an ad slot to be a direct buy (or **order**, using DFP terminology) from an advertiser.  There are all sorts of targeting that can be applied.  This is getting into the weeds a bit, but here is a good page describing all the ways that can be targeted, including a section on custom criteria that basically means you can use almost anything: https://support.google.com/dfp_sb/answer/2884033?hl=en ref_topic=1655865

Beyond targeting, line items typically have goals based on type.  Here is a good page going over the basics: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/177279?hl=en

In short, standard line items have impression goals, which Google will then use to determine if a specific ad is shown or not based on forecasting.  Specifically:

 For directly sold campaigns with defined start and end dates and specific impression goals. DFP will speed up or slow down delivery to meet the goal.

**Remnant ads**

Another common GamerGate refrain is that Intel is probably Adsense because Adsense ads show in the same slot as the Intel ad.  This is also silly.

First, remnant ads.  Remnant ads are ads that are typically shown when there are no direct by ads shown.  In DFP, this is managed by priority.  Standard direct buys are normally high or medium priority.  Remnant ads are low priority ads that basically fill up empty ad space if there are no other higher priority line items to server.

To reiterate a link above, here is a handy white paper by Google that goes over what precisely happens when ads are served: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1143651?hl=en

Now, I don't know how many of Gamastura's ads are direct sells vs remnant ads (besides Intel, which they've confirmed as a direct sell), but assuming that Gamasutra does have remnant advertising, this means that *Adsense ads might be served in the same slot as Intel ads*.  Why?

Here's Google (https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/177279?hl=en):

 If AdSense or Ad Exchange line items are enabled for your network, these line items compete on price with other low-priority line items. If an AdSense or Ad Exchange line item is available to serve and has a higher price than any available network, bulk, or price priority line item, the AdSense or Ad Exchange line item will be served.

In the whitepaper referenced earlier, this is covered in great detail in part 5, "Choosing the best line item to serve". 

So, here is a hypothetical scenario that has no real basis in what Gamasutra might actually be doing because I don't know what their line items are.  But this is a pretty easy scenario to think through.  Imagine Gamasutra has only one standard line item of medium priority, that being the Intel direct buy.  (They very likely have much more than that, but let's keep it simple).  

If that Intel ad gets enough impressions for the day according to DFP's calculations and forecasting, then to avoid overserving the ad, DFP might decide that to use Adsense ads instead, based on the line item selection critera mentioned above.

	<TEXT> The worst part is, it's not even AdSense.  I've had to correct several GG supporters repeatedly on this.

Gamasutra is using Google DFP, an *Ad Server*, which, among other things, can use Ad Sense, an *Ad Network* for ads.  However, the source for ads served through Google DFP may look superficially like standard AdSense calls as both invoke "google".

	<TEXT> That the Intel ad did not come from Google Adsense. Yes, it did come from Google.  But Google offers multiple advertising products, and Adsense is not the only one.  

More importantly, the advertising framework that Gamasutra uses (Google DFP) allows for both Adsense *and* targeted campaigns like a sponsored Intel ad. 

So whereas William Usher is right on one count (Gamasutra is using Google for ads), he is wrong with the conclusion (that therefore the Intel ad must be adsense and not under Gamasutra's direct control).

	<TEXT> This subreddit is obviously a group.  Sure, "anti-GG" as a *thing* doesn't really exist, in so much as there's not a counter-reactionary organization in opposition to GamerGate.

But I think, as this point, it not terribly beyond reason so say that there are groups of people who are much more say, invested, in being opponents of GamerGate than your average non-GamerGater.

Are we bound by a common ideology? Not really.  But there's still a group, bound by a common purpose.  Maybe the purpose is to mock GamerGate. Maybe the purpose is to oppose GamerGate.  Depends on who you ask.  But we're here, on this subreddit with 3.2k subscribers.  We're a group.

And that's essentially who I'm talking about when I say "we" in what you quoted.  Not "Anti-GG" we.  We, as in this subreddit.  We, as in this subreddit, who like to make fun of GamerGate extremist rants.  We, as a subreddit, who like to condemn stupid hyperbolic statements by GamerGate supporters.

And now we have a hyperbolic rant *against* GamerGate.  That's how it cuts our way. We don't typically mock extremist statements against GamerGate, but imagine for a second if that exact same tone and language was on a KiA post.  It'd be front page material for days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, Adsense allows for direct buys that show 100% of the time: https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/3064395?hl=en  

So Gamastura using Adsense does not actually disprove their claim in any way.

Second, Google also has other products besides Adsense.  DFP, detailed below, is another.

Gamasutra could be using Doubleclick (http://www.google.com/doubleclick/advertisers/), possibly via DFP (http://www.google.com/doubleclick/publishers/welcome/), which has the ability to do more complicated ad buys that, yes, can run targeted campaigns.

Evidence:

	<TEXT> There's angry ranting, and then there's this.  

Chris Kluwe's oft linked rant on Medium was a proper, something-I-can-defend rant.  He called GamerGate names, yes.  He called them a lot of names.  But he also didn't go at lengths to describe how he thinks they should all die -- and then reiterate that same sentiment several paragraphs later.

In fact, I'd be fine with Tait's rant if he just stopped shy of repeatedly suggesting that all GamerGater's should die.  I mean, c'mon, seriously. That's not cool. I get that he's angry, that much of the rant is probably grandstanding and a written form of high drama, but seriously.  It's not cool.

Radical, militant extremism is a double edged sword, and it just cut our way.

	<TEXT> I generally like head shots, but there are a few places where I think the concept of head shots is used as a crutch in lieu of more interesting weak spot mechanics.

Destiny, for example, does head shots both well in some places and poorly in others.  

In some enemies, the "headshot" location is the head.  In others, like the Vex, the headshot location is in the chest.  I think that's a nice change, and forces the player to not just rely on muscle memory to aim for the head against every mob.

On the other hand, Destiny also uses the concept of the "headshot" or "single weak spot on an enemy" poorly in many of its boss fights.  Most of Destiny's bosses have a location where you deal critical, or headshot damage. This is offset by massive health.

I think that there's potential for much more interesting boss mechanics than just the basic hide, strafe, and shoot the "head" of the boss loop.  

Zelda, in particular, tend to have pretty interesting boss fights, though admittedly Zelda has more boss-unique tools to work with. </TEXT>

The general gist: 

Agree that games reviews have been traditionally consumer advice pieces.  I think of it as the product review vs the experiential review.   I think both are valid ways to approach reviews. 

I think, currently, some sites are trying to approach reviews from a more experiential side -- more about what the reviewer felt while playing the game than a product breakdown of the game as w hole.

I think that's fine, and that people just need to decide what kind of reviews they like, and find a site that does it that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that's true, in the same way that exceptional (or exceptionally awful) cinematography or music in film are mentioned in film reviews.

But, I think here's where it differs:

Traditionally, game reviews have been focused on technical prowess with bits of the reviewer's experience thrown in.

Traditionally, film reviews are experiential reviews that primarily talk about the reviewer's thoughts and experience watching the film.  Mention of specific breakdowns like music and special effects are typically only as supporting evidence for the experience the reviewer felt.

ie, the special effects in Final Fantasy: Spirits Within only served to highlight the uncanny valley feeling I had the entire time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think both you and him are talking about Reviews, just two different types. I like to call it the product review vs the experiential review.

Traditionally, game reviews have been product reviews.  ie, does this game work, does this game satisfy expectations going in, how does this game look, etc.

Traditionally, film/art reviews have been experiential reviews. What did I feel when watching this? After watching it, what am I feeling now? What about the film did I like/didn't like?

Both are entirely valid forms of review, and I wouldn't label either the "true" review.  Because they are just different kinds of reviews.

Personally, I favor the experiential review for games.  But it's perfectly fine to favor product reviews, too. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Metacritic proprietary score weighting </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-12 16:35:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Disclaimer: if you look through my post history, you'll see I'm pretty openly anti-GG.  But that said, this is a post from me attempting to highlight what I think is an actual issues in games journalism.  Journalism ethics issue? Probably not, strictly speaking. 

**Background:**

Metacritic, when "averaging" their scores, assigns different publications different weights.  It's a proprietary system, with weights and tiers that have never been confirmed or officially revealed to the public.  What this means it that Metacritic's "average" is actually closer to a FICO score -- a proprietary score under the control of Metacritic, rather than a straight mathematical average.

http://www.metacritic.com/about-metascores

 Metascore is a weighted average in that we assign more importance, or weight, to some critics and publications than others, based on their quality and overall stature. In addition, for music and movies, we also normalize the resulting scores (akin to "grading on a curve" in college), which prevents scores from clumping together.

Last year, Full Sail did a study on this, and gave a talk about at at the GDC: https://archive.today/KSAXb  (Gamasutra link)

Metacritic's response (https://archive.today/Sbd12) denies the accuracy of Full Fail's estimates of site weight and tiers.

**My position:**

With the power given to Metacritic scores by both the gaming industry (ie, New Vegas), the gaming consumers ("what is this game's metacritic score"), and the gaming press (some publications have more power over the Metacritic score than others), it feels wrong to me that this is a proprietary score, without any accountability other than what Metacritic puts on itself.

There's no visibility into how a score is determined, no consumer/readership voice as to, in Metacritic's own words, a critic's "quality and overall stature". These are things determined solely by Metacritic without input from the public.

We should be asking Metacritic to be more open with their internal weights.  

We should be asking Metacritic to investigate more ways to allow players to give input about score, and critic weighting.

We should be asking ourselves why we put so much faith into a proprietary score system that might give more weight to publications we don't agree with, in the first place.

(In the case of GamerGate, you can certainly bet that many of the sites y'all don't like are in the highest weight group, and many of the sites y'all do like might not be shown at all or are in a low weight group)

FWIW, the one study about metacritic score weights was done by Full Sail last year, and used Metacritic data that cut off before Polygon was founded.

So I'm not entirely sure where your info comes from. </TEXT>
