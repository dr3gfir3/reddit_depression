	<TEXT> I've read through this whole thread and I've been very impressed with the time you've put into it,... thank you! 

1) I know you don't hand over the report fulled with vulnerability, wish them luck dust your hands and walk off, surely there are certain levels or standards that they have to comply too. Especially Hospitals/Banks that hold public records. 
2) Who is responsible for deciding what needs to be addresses (if there is no standard to measure against) 
3)Who is responsible for implementing the changes network/server engineers at your company or outsource? 
4)This "standard" I'm assuming exists, is it international or dose it vary with each country?  </TEXT>
