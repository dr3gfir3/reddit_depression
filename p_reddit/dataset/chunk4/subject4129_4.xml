	<TITLE> Ben Woodburn </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-22 00:13:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just wanted to give my opinion on something very quick, considering that we haven't played well at all these past few premier league games (even Cup games) I figured why not give Woodburn a chance in the first team? it's clear that we're missing Mane and having Can and Gini do the same thing on the pitch isn't helping anyone. I figured someone like Woodburn can step in, and get given a chance just like TAA. I think we should go back to what worked earlier in the season, having Hendo, Lallana and Gini in the midfield, instead of changing two players positions we should only change one, as it would keep more of the chemistry in the team. From what I have seen of Woodburn is that his ball control looks amazing for someone his age, he seems very composed on the ball and looks to get in behind when possible (which is something we've lacked). Origi has been given several opportunities as of late and hasn't taken them, I think he should be rested for a bit and have Woodburn take his place for a bit.

	<TEXT> Really sad imo, i understand that they are loving it, but trying to throw out a bunch of memes, what does Gerrard returning as a coach have anything to do with this? what does punting the ball long into the box in the last 10 minutes when you're losing have any relevance to playing long ball football as your first tactic? any team would pump the ball in the box when you're losing, we've always done that.  </TEXT>
