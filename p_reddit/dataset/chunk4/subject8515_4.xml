	<TEXT> It's a tough situation because from a story perspective, the wise decision would be to tell a whole new one. Less risk of it being a disappointment. But one of the biggest reasons this show is so great is because of the amazing characters and the people who play them, and it's ridiculous to expect them to find an equally great (or better) cast every season. Besides, I can't imagine Stranger Things without Eleven... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never fully believed but I wanted to be a good spiritual example that my parents could love as much as their other kids. So I made the best-worst decision of my life and went on a mission, ultimately coming home way early because I became suicidal. A month later I decided I was done ignoring "anti-Mormon material" because if it was correct then that would explain why the Church was trying so hard to keep me away from it. Within about two days I was more sure the Church isn't true than I ever was that it is true. The hardest part was dealing with my family's reaction (still an uphill battle every day) but otherwise it was a smooth and relieving transition and I've truly never been happier.

I wish it could be that way for everybody. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just barely finished it as well and god damn, what an incredible show. This is legitimately some of the most well-structured and beautiful storytelling I've seen in my life, and everything from the cinematography to the writing to the acting was consistently spot-on (and holy shit, how did they find so many good child actors?! Especially Eleven, she gave the best performance of anyone in the show imo).

It felt a tad predictable at times, and there were a lot of clichd beats. The villains served their purpose in the end but I wish they had been less generically evil. However, the protagonists were such great characters and the story was so good that those things didn't really affect my enjoyment when all was said and done. This show is amazing and I can't wait for season 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's my problem with it, though, is it sucks so much of the time. You're absolutely right: when it hits, it REALLY hits. Some of my favorite television episodes of all time come from this show and there are some incredible moments and scenes even in the less desirable episodes. But the ratio of bad to good episodes is so frustratingly high, especially once you get to series 7, that after the first few episodes of series 9 I just couldn't take it anymore. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But you realize that Overwatch had a closed beta for several months and the people who played that are still into it, right? Regardless of which game is better (I like them roughly the same, personally) Overwatch has a much bigger player base than Splatoon ever did, and it's impossible for it to "go the way of its brethren where the servers are completely dead a month after release" when the full game has been out for over two months.

Maybe think twice and do some research before calling somebody else ignorant. </TEXT>
