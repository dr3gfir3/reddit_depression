	<TEXT> Consoler over here. With the poison changes to dragon knights, just how much more of a dps boost are stam dks receiving? Looking for a percentage increase I suppose. 
  
What new armor sets and combos is everyone spitballing to use? I've had my eye on the vice cannon set for my one-shot bow build.
  
General discussion for stam dks are very welcome </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just tested this out on my stam dk on console - live. Molten armaments, camo hunter, heavy bow attack in pvp immediately followed by a poison injection will kill most things instantly. Very viable. Instead of using it always as part of rotation I use it to begin a fight from stealth, stampede in and dos to finish it off if the initial burst doesn't work. Works great with gank dk builds, but I find this to shine in pvp as it completely sets classes off balance and puts them on the defense right off the bat, if it doesn't insta-kill them. 
  
I recommend not using HA in combat outside of animation cancelling or cleaning up someone else's fight from far away when the pressure isn't on you. </TEXT>

As far as play style- generally with your setup you want to time your buffs and proxy det, lotus fan into an enemy group. Soul tether and proxy explode, Sap essence to kill all that remain. And then dip out with mass hysteria and shadowy disguise. Rinse wash repeat

	<TEXT> Well things will be different between leveling and end game play styles. I'm at work so I'll describe leveling bars later, but for now I'll write out gear and rotations. 
  
5 julianos
2 kena
1 torugs (in lieu of maelstrom)

Destro/resto

Fight- buff merciless resolve, structured entropy(or sap essence.) Medium attack weave swallow soul/ funnel health (twice), then two consecutive light attacks for kena proc. Then structured entropy for empower buff (might of the guild passive in mages guild) then spectral bow proc from merciless. Consistently hits between 32-40k depending on buffs from group mates.
  
Alternatively you can do the same buffs, proc kena, proc empower, then drop a meteor on some unlucky soul.
  
So, essentially, minor brutality, major sorcery, kena, empower, meteor/spectral bow, repeat </TEXT>
