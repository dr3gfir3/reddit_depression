	<TEXT> That's why I don't agree with most of the changes after Juggernaut patch. If you have a champion, his/her skills NEED to have a sense with the character itself, like Amumu's Ult (He stops everyone around so they can be close to him, or at least that's how I interpretate it).
And that's why I actually agree with Garen changes. Having him to chase after a villan makes so much sense. But then, you give Darius healing over his spinning axe and Fiora over her ult, and also Mordekaiser not sharing experience, it just doesn't stick because it doesn't fit with the characters, and by doing so you are basically ignoring all process of building that was made for each of them in their pasts.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, brTT has 431 thousand likes on his facebook page which you can check by yourself, has his own brand in a vast territory in the country and also in our server, the champion Twitch spell his most famous jargon "Rexpeita", a tribute made by Riot for him. 

His and Kami's fanbase are really huge, I wouldn't be surprised if what Whitesnaku said is true.

	<TEXT> Rune pages. It has been around a year and a half since Riot haven't touched runes. We have to be honest; there are several useless runes in the shop like Armor Penetration (which are being replaced by flat AD) Spellvamp and Gold Quintessences, and besides that, the tier 1 runes prices are overwhelming. If we at least received free runes and pages while getting to lv.30 like suggested before, it would be so much better.
And also, give us more reasons to mix different runes (bonus interactions maybe). A visual update would be awesome too.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can skarner drill a hole and take the enemy while ulting instead of carrying him? (Explanation inside) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> The same range that he would carry the enemy while ulting, but instead of carrying him, he drill a hole and make both untargetable until he comes out to the place selected. 
This way, he's not going to be that op since the target will not take the damage that it currently takes while being carried. 
This will also prevent the nerfs on him that would make him not viable like before.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to agree. 
Darius, Garen, Skarner, Mordekaiser, Fiora, what are those guys. Renekton and Irelia getting also really strong after those new items. 
It's really all about who picks the most of the champions above to guarantee a win. 

And don't come saying to me that it's all about skill.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can call me what you want but we all have to agree about that. Gimme one of those 6 must-bans champions in a game and you already won. It's so sad how a game can be destroyed in a single patch. And I'm also sorry that PBE is not worth anything. 
I really hope this get fixed soon.
