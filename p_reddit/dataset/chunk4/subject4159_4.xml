	<TEXT> Idk if anyone knows this but i just found this out and wanted to share it. You know when you create a custom game and it takes forever before you can actually press start because that button keeps loading? All you gotta do is press (Spacebar) and it will go away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright well, the first thing you need to do is have a main champion. And when i say this I mean you have to know the limitations of the champion inside and out to your respective ability. You don't need to be able to do stuff that bjergson does. Anyways, then you need to know what all the items do, regularly check what the enemy team has for items, know what the limitations of your opponents champions, check your minimap-[ When i say this there are different meanings to this. When you check it you want to make sure that there are champions on the map before you start to go aggressive or else you are susceptible to ganks. You also need to know when to back off if you see that they are missing and learn to not overextend in your lane. ] Knowing how to snowball with a lead = basically if you're laning you just want to sit in your lane with the lead and be able to 1v2 or 1v3 split push non stop and solo carry your team. If your team feeds then you just need to make sure that each lane is covered if they aren't. If you see a big wave of minions make sure that you take them for yourself, don't let it all die to the tower and then lose a tower for nothing. If you see activity with your jungler in his jungle or if something is happening in a lane nearby make sure that you are moving to follow the fight if you are needed and decide whether or not following a fight is a good idea, sometimes it's a good idea just to sit in lane if it is a losing battle and just push a wave. Wave management = if you get a lead, position yourself between your lane opponent and your minions so that he can't cs efficiently. Either he takes damage from you by taking minions or he losses out on getting cs so in that situation it's a win win for you but watch out for ganks. Make sure to last hit in that situation as well. Don't auto attack full health minions, just wait till the minions die down before taking them, unless you need to back. When you back, make sure to clear the enemy minion wave so that you have a better chance of catching the next one after you get back from the shop. I'm not sure what the benefits of freezing the lane is other than forcing the opponent to either over extend for cs and get collapsed on or they have no choice but to get recourses elsewhere or group up. But the way you do it is you make sure that there are more minions on the enemy side than yours, make sure to last hit the minions and don't take aggro(that's very important). Then once your minion wave has been depleted then you can take aggro and move them upwards or sideways away from your tower so that they follow you. Once your minion wave is far enough up to where they crash on the enemy minion wave out of the area where your towers can attack, you can then drop aggro by walking into an unwarded bush, or by walking towards your minion wave far enough to where your minions will attack them, thus it will make the enemy minion waves attack yours, but they will follow you a little bit. This can help you catch up to your lane opponent as well if you are behind, BUT, if your team needs you, then you need to shove the wave and join them, but don't waste time, always be looking for recourses on the map to take without being in danger unless you know for certain you can kill them. I think that's it, but if you have any more questions let me know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a platinum 4 player and I think I have jungle efficiency down pretty well. I know what my flaws are when it comes to this game but to improve I just need to practice. But one thing that I feel is inefficient is playing multiple 35+ minutes games. I can't seem to find out how to end sooner. Any thoughts or input would help. ;p </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yo, riot don't give a shit honestly, i sent about 10 emails to them about a previous mac client issue where i would crash and be unable to connect until the game was over and then some time after. They never did anything to resolve it and refused to believe it was a client issue. Then the patch before 6.6 came out fixed it. Really don't think they'll care now. But i've been spiking to 1k when i get to lane. Drops for maybe 1 second back to where it should be at which is around 50. </TEXT>
