	<TEXT>  I just said I don't think there's a connection between Cainhurst Castle/maidens with the Pthumerian Queen. Byrgenwerth is a whole separated story.

And I was just saying the connection between Cainhurst Castle and the Queen is **Byrgenwerth**. 

Alfered tells us "*Well, once a group of young Byrgenwerth scholars discovered a holy medium deep within the tomb. This led to the founding of the Healing Church, and the establishment of blood healing. In this sense, everything sacred in Yharnam can be traced back to Byrgenwerth.*"  We can also assume it all started with the Queen's miscarriage, in old Byrgenwerth. And the Cainhurst Vilebloods brought the Old Blood out of Byrgenwerth in order to become Vilebloods. "*In Cainhurst Castle, Queen Annalise was a ruler over many nobles and dandies, she is the first Vileblood that partaked in corrupted blood from Byrgenwerth.*" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're claiming the connection in dress is just because they were lazy in design. But, why would they parade the lazy design around by making it an equipable item with its own lore description attached?  To me, it is much more likely they did that so it would be easier to make the connections between those that wear it. If it was "generic female clothing #74" (like the Hags wear) they'd not give it its own lore description (like they didn't with the Hag clothing).

You say that its just symbolism that the Queen is seen in the lake. I agree that it's symbolism, but not in the way you seem to  think it is. If the Queen wasn't associated with Byrgenwerth in some way, they would have no reason to show her there. When they do cut scenes, they are not limited by location. You're in the church when you touch the skull, but the scene you see isn't. Additionally, the player is about to be teleported to Yahar'gul. There is no reason for the Queen scene to have her standing in the middle of Byrgenwerth's lake unless they waited her to be right there. To me, this scene shows that **everything** really and truly started in Byrgenwerth, right down to the original miscarriage of the Queen. 

I'm not saying that the OP has everything right, but I don't think everything you claim is unintended coincidence is unintended coincidence. </TEXT>

If you murder someone, you now owe a debt both to society and to the individual you murdered. You can be rehabilitated before being released to pay back society, but you must be punished to pay back the individual.

Didn't we establish you can't pay back the dead?

	<TEXT>  I said that because you are advocating for "rehabilitating" violent murderers at the expense of justice. 

I've been saying:

If a person is doing something that's damaging society, like raping babies, they should be removed from society until they're no longer likely to damage society. This can be accomplished by killing them or removing them to try and fix them.[[1]](http://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/32875g/mother_gets_20_years_in_prison_for_killing_son_by/cq91pye)

Not that I really should expect you to know what I've been saying at this point.....

I don't believe in punishment for damaging society. I believe that punishment should come as a result of damage to individuals. 

Yet, you said the American court system is about punishment, and you hoped it would stay like that. Not that it would change so that only crimes you -personally- don't like get 'punished.'

Anyway, this system you're talking about is stupid. YI should be allowed to drink a bottle of rum while going 80 in a 25; as long as I get lucky, no problem. I should be allowed to swing a loaded gun around next to a schoolyard, as long as it doesn't go off, no biggy. If I plot to kill someone, but screw it up so bad no one is hurt, no harm no fowl. Better luck next time. I want to bring a bomb on a plane, why not? I'm not going to set it off or something, lighten up. </TEXT>

I've advocating for the rehabilitation of all criminals. **You** said:

 But remember, the purpose of the (adult) court systems in America is primarily to punish, not to rehabilitate. **Hopefully it will stay that way.**

The court system isn't just for murderers, it's for criminals. Or, -in addition to not knowing what 'prove' or 'rehabilitation' means- do you also not know what "criminal" and "court system" means? 

What we -collectively- agree damages society we call 'crime.' It might be driving recklessly, stealing, or murder, but -whatever- we feel it isn't behavior that we want people doing. We have a system for dealing with this, one I think should be about prevention/rehabilitation and you've been saying should be about making emotionally hurt people feel better. 

Well, some people get really upset when people smoke weed, and they feel better when they know those people are punished. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem to misunderstand what I'm saying. I'm not saying we shouldn't work on rehabilitating them while in prison, only that they should be adequately punished for crimes where they've hurt another person very badly.

You are saying that punishing them is more important. I would be *nice* to have more useful members in society, but not as important as punishment. Indulging your righteous anger is what really matters, and making them a productive member of society is a secondary issue. Thus, I would assume once your need for revenge is slaked, you would want them released. If they 'learned their lesson' during that time wouldn't be as important.

Also, it's much cheaper for society to kill them quickly (without 10,000 appeals) than it is for us to bother rehabilitating them.

Then do that. If they **really** can't be effectively fixed, then I would be more included to permanently remove them. But, honestly, I would also be included to permanently remove people that truly believe society should indulge its rage and hatred to prove dead people mattered.

 And in the (fairly likely) chance that they offend again, was it worth it? 

If they're 'fairly likely' to do it again, they're not rehabilitated are they?  I will remind you, YOU are the one more inclined to release people who are "fairly likely to do it again," since weather or not they'll do it again is less important to you than them getting punished to your satisfaction. Weather or not they're "fairly likely to do it again" is my **ONLY** concern, it's your secondary concern.

They don't care, but we should. Would you be okay with the "rehabilitated" murderer literally going up to this kid's corpse and spitting on it? Why not, if he's dead?

That's my question. If the person *really* and *truly* is rehabilitated -and will positively add to society for the rest of their days- why does it matter if they spit on dead people?

It's to show that we cared for them. For us

If we really care, then we know we care. Why do we have to prove we care to people that already know we care? Seems like a wasted effort all around.

 she thought that attention was worth more than her child's life.

And, you think indulging in your hatred and anger is more important than her life.  You're not doing it for society; you're doing it for yourself, just like she was.

(More people in society helping society, and using money to get more people in society to help society)  (Society using money to punish people for no other reason than to punish them, and then releasing them when convinced they're sufficiently punished without really caring if they're likely to be productive or harmful after being released.)

the kid has just ceased to exist forever because of her actions I think that's sufficiently horrible that she doesn't deserve forgiveness from us.

Then why say "That's spitting in the face of the dead kid?" Why would dead people care if you spit on them? Why even have the PRETEXT for doing it "for the children?" If you don't think people can care after death, why should we be wasting resources *for* dead people's feelings?

Honestly, I just assumed you were religious because I can't reconcile your view otherwise. Why use the living's resources to further damage already mentally damaged people to take revenge for dead people that can't possibly care anymore? </TEXT>

Anyway, killing or hurting the baby's mother isn't going to help the baby. Even in this response you seem to be admitting you want the mother punished because of how YOU feel, not because of how the dead child feels.  You would take revenge for yourself, not for the child. Getting mad and than acting on that anger isn't the best way to show you care.

	<TEXT> I'm sorry, I thought the question was meant to relate to the first one so I was just answering the first one. If a person is doing something that's damaging society, like raping babies, they should be removed from society until they're no longer likely to damage society. This can be accomplished by killing them or removing them to try and fix them.

However "taking revenge" doesn't address the underlying issue, nor does it help those already hurt or dead. I get as mad as the next person when I hear about children getting hurt, but I also realize lashing out in anger often causes more problems than it fixes.  I don't think dangerous people should be walking around, but I also think we should be removing them from society for the right reasons. Not because we're mad and want to "make them pay" for making us mad.

I can understand the value of "making an example," but I know that only works if the people you're making an example *to* are rational. Crazy people are -by definition- not rational. Hurting them to make ourselves feel better about their irrational behavior accomplishes nothing. You can't 'fix' crazy people by punishing other crazy people in front of them, and hurting them for "revenge" is misguided. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, I'm not advocating for her to be let back into society.

It just seems most people here seem to realize she is mentally ill, but they also seem to think she should be harshly punished for her actions. I find it unsettling that people seem to think the best way to "cure" the crazy would be to punish other crazy people as "an example." As if someone with Mnchausen by proxy would read this reddit thread and then stop being mentally ill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Punishing her isn't going to help him in any way. 

I didn't say 'release her,' where did you get that idea? Rehabilitating her so she can -perhaps- rejoin society as a productive member would be more useful than wasting resources on "revenge" for someone that's dead.   Why do you need to inflict harm on the living to "prove" the lives of the dead mattered?

If your computer starts misfiring, do you take it out back and torture it? Or do you see if you can fix it to work right again? Which would be more useful? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article I linked:

Social conceptions and groupings of races vary over time, involving folk taxonomies[4] that define essential types of individuals based on perceived traits. Scientists consider biological essentialism obsolete,[5] and generally discourage racial explanations for collective differentiation in both physical and behavioral traits.[6][7][8][9][10]

See how Wiki links, in that one section, **7** different papers? I don't expect you to trust wiki itself, but I do expect you to trust the 7 different papers it's citing. Honestly, when I worked in research, and we used wiki *as a starting point* quite often. But, that was the field of Physics and wasn't controversial. I will admit I don't know the reliability of wiki in something controversial like this, but I would expect if they have 7 different citations, it's probably not as bad as your "LOL" makes it out to be.

Regardless, I am very aware of things like the *Minnesota Transracial Adoption Study* and was planning on linking [Race and intelligence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_and_intelligence) earlier, but I guess I'm glad I didn't because of the "LOL WIKI LOL" reaction I just got... 

Anyway, none of this is really the issue, because there are glaring errors in the very premise of your point, which is why I don't find merit in it. I don't know -objectively- if race affects IQ, but I do know -objectively- contradictory reasoning can't be correct.  And, you're using contradictory reasoning in that you're claiming social scientists aren't reliable, **but you're still relying on them.** So, while your conclusion could -in some objective sense- be right, your reasoning in obtaining that conclusion is fundamentally flawed. It's your **reasoning** I've been taking issue with. Let me see if I can elaborate further.

One of the central premises you're using to draw the conclusion you're drawing is social studies is -itself- unreliable. As you -yourself- put it: "The problem with social studies is that people pick and choose which contextual elements to emphasize, and do so with considerable bias." Within that, you also seem to feel any social scientists that rejects the idea their studies lead to evidence that race affects IQ is emotionally biased (ignoring the fact YOU could be bias in making this assumption). That "those explanations causes emotional distress among many who work in the field of social studies." However, these emotional clods are the very people you're relying on. You seem to be of the opinion you understand their data better than the people trained to collect and analyze it. Worse still, you have no data to back the assumption social scientists are temperamental dullards. You don't even have circumstantial evidence (I assure you, poor blacks aren't funding their research). But, your reasoning still goes further downhill from this shaky premise.

You're hypothesis is saying that this bias and inexact science can somehow *still* ferret out the slight difference -if it exists- in psychology between human phenotypes. That the raw data, "FBI crime statistics," somehow overcomes the error from education, test bias, stereotype threat, socioeconomic environment, etc. to reveal the underlying signal under all of the noise. That you -the layman- have more insight than the bumbling emotional experts that -literally- have the answers in their laps (since they're the ones that compile said data). That you have *special insight* and have seen the hard science that lies at the bottom of the statistical noise that is this soft science. But, I think the error bars from all the crap in the raw data only leads to "no conclusion." Raw data are normally just junk until you process it. 

That's what experts are FOR: finding the slight signal under a mountain of noise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, because scientists (biologists) -not *social* scientists- have declared 'race' mainly a human construct, with actual genetic differences superficial at best.[[1]](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_%28human_classification%29) Next you'll be telling me brown eyed people are genetically predetermined to be better pianists than blue eyed people, since that -like skin pigmentation- is also a difference in phenotype.

I will also go on to say what I -really- don't find merit in is someone telling me I should ignore people with experience and evidence on the assumption that all of them are bias, simply because they disagree with this person's [Special Pleading](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading) argument. An argument he claims doesn't require as much (or any) evidence since this person is seemingly convinced he is without bias -or at least 'less' than all said experts- (which is a good indication he is so biased he doesn't even have the self-awareness to realize he's bias).

If we're being honest, you sound like a conspiracy theorist. You should turn your critical blue eyes on your own argument and expect the same level of rigor from it as you do those you've been criticizing as 'bias.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, you're using social studies to draw the conclusion, while simultaneously explaining how social studies -as a whole- are bias in their conclusions.

How are you squaring that circle? How are claiming social studies can't be used to draw conclusions, but also claiming you've found a way to do just that?  Are you claiming you have some silver bullet way of interpreting this data none of the *actually* experts have? That you're some kind of "meta-expert?"

And -again- you've brought a lot of fancy words to the table explaining your distrust of experts, but you've still failed to do what I originally asked you do to: Bring some **evidence** for your claims.

You keep saying things like:

Now, I guarantee you that one of those explanations causes emotional distress among many who work in the field of social studies.

"We've go orders sir. Marneus Augustus Calgar wants us to lay siege to a Chaos sorcerer stronghold on a backwater planet in the Sol system."

"What I don't understand is why we're committing the entire Chapter to this mission. Surely one company would be enough."

"Orders are orders, sir. But -between you and me- I heard this 'Doctor Doom' fellow was on the same tier as  Ahzek Ahriman."

"Ahzek Ahriman!?! Well, we should just issue an *Exterminatus* and be done with it! Why are we landing troops if that's true?"

"Apparently the sorcerer only has control of one city and the planet is resource rich. It's inhabited mainly by humans and any Xenos contamination is slight, but mutation seem to be a problem. Regardless, there are plans to bring it into the Imperium once the Chaos threat is eliminated."

"Well, lets get to work planing this siege then. With the whole Chapter at our back, it shouldn't be much of a problem..." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They might get to decide how to allocate their Electoral College **seats**, but they don't get to decide weather or not to use the Electoral College. You probably want to look into this more before continuing to say things that aren't correct.

Anyway, no, I'm not going to put forth an idea just so you can poop all over it, as you've already declared you will. I'm done dealing with a Black and White thinker. Good day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's kinda too late to ask now, isn't it? Since you started with:

 No, we really don't.

You've essentially stated "It's **exactly** as hard as it should be; any decrease in difficulty -no matter how marginal- I will disagree with."  What is the point of me putting forth an idea NOW that you've already clearly stated you'll disagree with ANY decrease in difficulty? Based on what you've said, the only way you would agree with me and not be hypocritical is if my proposal made it harder.

38 states, 67 senators, and 290 representatives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, first '2/3' or '3/4' isn't "all states" as your second post stated. Second, I wasn't suggesting we make it effortless, again as you seem to be currently implying. I was suggesting we make the process more akin to how it is in the constitutions the US wrote for other countries. As in, hard, but not as hard as it is now.

However, I'm not sure why I'm debating this with you. Likely, you're one of the people that feel the Electoral College is a good idea and/or the founding fathers had the foresight to make an unequal democracy for the 21st century. *Argumentum ad statu quo* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who said anything about bringing balance to Good and Evil?  The prophesy is about bringing balance to the FORCE, as in Light and Dark.  The Sith exclusively used the Dark side and the Jedi the Light.

Thus, Anakin brought balance to the practitioners of the two different sides of the **Force.** "Good and Evil" have nothing to do with it. Your argument is a strawman.

Edit: It's also relevant to note the New Jedi Order Skywalker created used both Light and Dark sides of the force.[[1]](http://starwars.wikia.com/wiki/New_Jedi_Order) </TEXT>

I don't see how the two are related.  Why can't people on assistance use their own skills as well?

I mean, look at corporations. They get more government assistance than anyone, and they still use their skills to get ahead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also the C'Tan transported the Necrontyr's souls into the new bodies made of living metal and made them immortal. If that's not magic then I don't know what is.

Except -in 40k- "magic" has a definition, and the Necron's tec doesn't fall into it. That's all I'm saying. I'm not saying Necron tec doesn't break OUR definition of physics or that it isn't "unbelievable" or "incredible." I am just saying "magic" -in 40k- means "uses the Warp," and the Necrons -canonically- don't. They -canonically- are anathema to the Warp. Thus, IMO you shouldn't call their tec "magic."

Also, they LOST their souls when they become Necrons. Their souls were not transferred into their new bodies, only their memories. 

The Necrontyr may now be immortal and unified, but they had lost their souls in the process. Thus the soulless machines known as the Necrons were born. [[2](http://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Necron)]

That's kinda the whole point of the Necron race. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are not Borg.

But -seriously- each borg has a personal force field. I'm sure they could modulate it -or whatever- to prevent themselves from getting pulled apart. Necron tec might take them awhile to assimilate to adapt correctly, but maybe not. Borg are better with the purely mechanical than they are with the purely organic, as was shown by 8472. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One on One. I would like to know how [Dr. Doom](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/26ufq7/respect_dr_doom/) would do against 'normal' Space Marine.

Then, if people have time, I would like to know how a 'hero' Space Marine -like  [Cato Sicarius](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Cato_Sicarius) or [Ahzek Ahriman](http://www.reddit.com/r/respectthreads/comments/2fouvk/respect_ahzek_ahriman_lord_of_the_thousand_sons/)- would do against Dr. Doom. If Dr. Doom gets minions in the fight, then so does the Astartes (same #).  

A siege battle would also be interesting: A [Chapter](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20131024175349/warhammer40k/images/1/12/UM_Astartes_Ultra.png) of Astartes making plans to invade Latveria. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fair enough. I did as you asked and you are 100% correct. I should have done that first. 

 But, none of the ones I could find analyzed a 'hero' Spartan -like Master Chief- vs an 'average' Space Marine. In making this post I thought -IMO- Space Marines were better. But, I'm not sure how a 'normal' Space Marine might do against a 'special' Spartan. </TEXT>

I would like to know how an 'average' Spartan would do against an 'average' Space Marine. 

Then, if people have time, **I would like to know how a 'hero' Spartan -like [Master Chief](http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/John-117)- would do against an 'average' Space Marine;** how a 'hero' Space Marine -like [Cato Sicarius](http://warhammer40k.wikia.com/wiki/Cato_Sicarius)- would do against an 'average' Spartan; then Hero vs Hero.

*(And we are talking 'normal' Space Marines, not Primarchs, Terminators, or even Psykers)*

Edit: I should have used the search bar :( But, I'm still wondering about the bold part. </TEXT>
