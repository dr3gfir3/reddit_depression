	<TEXT> I have shot with both the Tamron 10-24mm and the Sigma 10-20mm. The copy of the Sigma I had was not sharp and I was very unimpressed. I bought the Tamron and I have found it to be a very pleasing looking lens. Though, I will note that it looses some sharpness wide open, however  I feel that the Tamron has character.  I have not tried the Tokina 11-20mm but It seems to have some very good reviews and it is a little faster than the Tamron or the Sigma. It might also be worth looking into the Rokinon 14mm, which is a great lens for the price, if you don't mind manual focusing all the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take a look at the AF-S DX NIKKOR 18-140mm f/3.5-5.6G ED VR. It is a nice walk around lens with a useful zoom range. I have seen them refurbished for about $250.00. If your budget is small, then I would look at the D5000 series. It will take similar quality pictures to the D7000 series, but are smaller and less costly.  I almost always buy Nikon refurbished to save money and have never had a problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you sticking with Nikon? If so I would recommend the D7100. It is a little older but you will have some money left over for lenses. What do you primary shoot? Do you feel there are any limitations to your D3200? </TEXT>
