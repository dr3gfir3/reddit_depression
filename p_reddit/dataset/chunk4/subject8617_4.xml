	<TEXT> I like the IPL beer but it is really disappointing to see that Golden Road rather focuses on financial success and exploitation of workers - let's be honest it is about time the minimum wage is raised. In addition, Golden Road is making bank as Trader Joe's supplier of El Gero beers. If they pull through with this I will have to start reconsidering my purchases of their beer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> we are brewing our own here down in LA... you can get a kit to brew it from morebeer (http://morebeer.com/products/russian-rivers-pliny-elder-extract-beer-kit.html) it works pretty well.. it's not exactly the same but comes really close! and the satisfaction that you brewed it yourself makes it as good as the pliny itself. </TEXT>
