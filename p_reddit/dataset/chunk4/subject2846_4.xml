	<TEXT> In the other case it would be van Der Waal forces. Basically, every molecule is always in a changing state, ie for very brief periods of time they have an almost insignificantly slight positive and negative charge which causes them to stick. 

This isn't the only thing that causes stickiness, but it will cause things to stick for a little longer, and if I remember right, it is what some frogs use for their sticky feet. I could be wrong, but without digging through my textbooks, I think I'm mostly right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This true. I think the only way we get him at a good price is with GS signing KD, which almost feels like an inevitability. GS will have to make room on the roster and I could see them letting Barnes go or signing Barnes and sending Green off for cheap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been asking the same question. Nobody will answer, but speculation gets down voted. 

IMO if we could land biz for a 2-4 year deal or Howard for a 2 then I say go for it. Besides that, I think that Barnes might be a good fit, and that if the Warriors sign KD that we could pick up Draymond for a good price. He might be a bit vocal, but he is a great guy focused on winning, and I think Stotts could curb the attitude. Besides him, I don't see too many players besides our RFAs that we would really want to sign. I feel like we are pushing for that one piece and that we will probably spend big bucks on a center and then pick out the rest of the team from whoever clears room for KD. </TEXT>

That being said, I understand what you are saying,and it would be good to land someone for cheap and really filling out our lineup. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] Working out a trade with the Kings? Other trade scenarios/ free agent signings you would like to happen? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-27 16:03:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright fellas, here it is. I'm a Blazers fan through and through, but Sactown is my hometown team. We need a center. Plumlee just can't perform with these huge centers down low. The kings just took a Greek center, and given that they already have 2 full time centers, it would make sense that they are going to shop someone around. They are also looking at an aging SF in Rudy Gay who i think is actually a free agent this year, and they need to fill that hole. So how about a trade scenario where we send Crabbe and Leonard for this new draftee and a first or second round pick? We get a lot more size in the middle, more potential, and the possibility of a great pickup in next year's draft?

More than anything I just want thoughts on possible trade scenarios with other teams to fill our gaps in the roster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A reason that I understand is that a women's breasts, whether they like it or not, is viewed as a secondary sexual characteristic. Guys like looking at topless women, and that has become such a thing that there is a multi billion dollar business devoted to showing men (and women) the naked breasts of women. Something that I see happening is men becoming aroused and the women making a big deal out of it. It is a big deal. Men shouldn't have erections in public. 

But a law being passed is not going to change hundreds and thousands of years that men and women have been sexualizing that body part. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Source quality is a huge thing. A lot of people surprisingly trust most everything they read, and lack the critical thinking to judge the article on whether or not it is a decent source. Besides that, hearing and processing an argument without agreeing seems to be challenging as well.

It is strange that one of the most quality news sources for America is BBC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I messaged the Mods about creating rules for this. It would be nice to have op-ed pieces labeled as such and have the source in the title. I hate clicking on things that look like actual news and then are editorials by someone who has a massive hard on for Bernie, Hillary, or anyone else. News is news, opinion is opinion. Let's keep theme separate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, she shouldnt. The difference is between a private citizens and a government worker. If she has personal messages, send them through personal email, and use the government provided email for your work related stuff. 

Transparency is key, even if the public isnt allowed to see it. She needs to be held accountable by someone, and the communication in business matters needs to be documented just like everyone else's.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even data that wasn't classified, but was retroactively classified is on the "no-no" list. Also, if you look at the number of emails she received on her .gov email account, I remember the number being suuuper small during the tenure as Secretary of state, as opposed to the emails she sent from her personal server.

Perhaps this is a little backwards in thinking, but if you ask someone to erase your server after the FBI is coming for it, you are trying to hide something. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How PMO almost killed my marriage. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-23 21:16:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been married for just under a year, but my addiction spans much farther. I think I started around 12 or 13, and always thought to myself, I can quit when I'm 16. I can quit when I'm 18. I will quit before I get married. 

I went on an LDS mission and lasted a year and a half, followed by another year and a few months.

Being LDS, it is really hard to express yourself sexually before you are married, and I think I was so excited about finally being able to have sex, that I fell back into PMO. I was able to last another 6 months before I got married, I was worthy to be married, but just after this I fell back into it.

I had an idea of what sex with my wife would be like. I was excited to try everything, and for the first week we tried a bunch of stuff and sex was awesome, but something was off. My wife is on a few antidepressants and anxiety medications and those really take a toll on her drive. Like she has no physical desire for sex at all, which was really hard for me as a young Mormon newlywed. In my mind, we should have been having sex at least 3 times a week, but in reality, 1 time a week to once every few weeks was what my wife could commit to. (We never had a conversation about commitment, just an expression.) 

With the raging hormones and sexual frustration, I turned to PMO to curb my appetite. I was lonely, bored, and increasingly saw my wife as a barrier to my happiness. I had and sometimes still have dreams about cheating on her to appease my sexual desires with unhealthy and unrealistic relationships with women I didn't know.

I have gone on and off as personal goal setting to try and get to two weeks and have done so exactly once in 6 months. When I get close, I always feel a deeper love and commitment to my wife, and I can see past my sexual desires for what she truly means to me.

I have told her about it and she was really hurt, but we have been getting closer and stronger as a couple, and I am happy to say we are on the up.

Don't let PMO ruin your love life, take a stand and say no. You will feel better about yourself, you will feel more in touch with your surroundings, and your family relations will strengthen. Be a good husband, father, brother, friend. ( or wife, sister, mother. Women have the same struggles.) 

Take back your life! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The homeless problem is big, I think we could curb it by making some panhandling laws. I have people that attend my church building that opt out of church welfare to beg because it is more profitable to stand on the corner asking for money than to get the necessities and go to a church unemployment center and find a job.

All in all, the homeless problem still exists, and I don't know why we don't do more to curb it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is soooo true. If the temptation is there, I have a lot harder time controlling the urge to eat. I basically just have to keep in mind that I want to be skinny and that eating even one dorito will have me binging on the salt and fat.

And my wife uses baking as therapy. Not to eat it, just to relax. Help haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be the same way, but his policies aren't half bad. They are not ideal, and some of them are absurd, but he is a lot more moderate than other GOP candidates, and he is an outsider.

Don't get me wrong, I would vote Sanders over Trump in a heartbeat, but if it is between him and Hillary, I would almost rather have him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what bugs me. Everything is so polarized nowadays. If you look at the claims conservative news outlets have put out about Obama, you would be apalled.

Every time I go around my family, I get to hear about how Obama is purposefully trying to ruin the nation, how he is secretly a Muslim letting in first Al Queda, now ISIS, and how he is so detached from his job as a president.

We need to realize that the only way things get done in any relationship is through compromise. Picking battles, coming down a little bit off your high horse and making a compromise that is good for everyone, instead of trying to filibuster progress. You would think that the country is run by toddlers instead of adults, and that the media are just spectators that egg on the problem. </TEXT>
