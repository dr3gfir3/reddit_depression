	<TEXT> Yes, I think I was being a bit of a brat saying not to get a puppy. I'm just hurting really bad right now, and the decision to let him try and fight or have him put to sleep is really really tough.

But all the years I've had with him following at my heel like my shadow have been the best of my life. I dreamt about him before I met him, and when I first saw him I knew he was my dog. We've been through so much together, he even once protected me from a man who was trying to break into my home when I was home alone. He attacked a man who snuck up on me in a deserted back lane. He has protected my dreams and my waking life and been with me on many adventures both in reality and imagination. I would recommend to anyone who has the capacity and the space and the love to get a puppy, put in the effort to train them and be honoured to have them as your companion for the short time that they can be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't get a puppy. I did. 17 years later and a million memories and I'm nursing him right now on his death bed. My heart will never mend from this. No more puppies. Sorry to turn down the mood, it just sucks.

Edit: just because of course I was being facetious with that. It hurts real bad right now but I wouldn't swap my little prince and all the years he's been with me for anything. Get a puppy, but be warned, a huge chunk of your heart will be devoted to them and you will lose that chunk when they go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a behaviour analyst working with individuals with disability, mental illness, trauma. For the most part my office is really casual, mainly women and loads of them wear dresses or even shorts. I do a lot of clinical observations in the field, which means pants are best, as sometimes I need to make a quick getaway. But even on my office days I feel I need to wear pants as with most professions a lot of the management are male and I am often called into meetings where I have to defend my clinical opinion against what they think will work best financially. I just feel like in a dress they might take me less seriously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have to beg to differ, I can make myself come, in a variety of ways, but saying that a one partner does not and can not induce another partner to orgasm is ridiculous. Of course one partner can't take all of the credit, there has to be a certain amount of relaxation and willingness from the other partner. But saying that the partner, in this case male, is irrelevant, completely disregards the beauty of being together as a couple and reading each other's needs and wants and desires. In this case OP was able to help his lady achieve bliss. Please don't discount him. That's bad feminism. </TEXT>

Any busker, particularly if they had a didgeridoo, would become our disco, and the dancing would commence. I also remember the other tourists and people watching would then distance themselves or move along. One day though, the guy playing the didge gets up and yells, "Come on people! Get down and dance like this beautiful little family here, they know what it's all about. Deadly!!" and then it happened, everyone was accepting and dancing with us! To this day, when I see a busker I still get in there and dance my heart out like that lady! I don't care if anyone is judging. </TEXT>

It kind of seems like you're trying to make it about you - also, in light of the events that RooshV dickhead has been running I could see how it might not go over well.

Seriously, you don't need to be co-chair of a board to run an event, if you organised a feminist Men's day event that celebrated Men's role in birth, parenting, family and community life, social advocacy, social justice, celebrated cultural diversity, indigenous men and those with a disability then I would be there in a heartbeat. But not if its just going to be about wars, sports and prime ministers. We have more than enough statues, history books, street names and holidays that celebrate that stuff already.

And when I think we are in a good place and I might try to initiate again, or even just cuddle a bit more passionately, I get rejected and spend the next week feeling horrible about myself. When he does initiate, probably 1-2 times a month, the sex is fantastic, and I can take care of things myself for the most part. It's not that I need sex for my emotional and mental wellbeing, more that I need to be validated at least once in a while, that I am a desirable, beautiful human being. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's normal. I always find it best to remember that when it comes to human beings normal is a relative concept. Also when something seems different on our bodies we tend to feel it as much bigger than it really is. 3 inches may be a slight exaggeration, but really I wouldn't think much of it, 3 inches would be well within the spectrum of normal in my experience. I've seen a huge variety of nude people due to my work, but most others haven't had that opportunity, you can now thanks to the Internet.

	<TEXT> This is a really interesting question. I'm not a man but I have had an experience similar to this. I'm HL my male SO is LL. Sex doesn't happen unless he initiates it. Period. It used to, but now it doesn't no matter how I try or how much I desire him. He freezes, and rolls over to sleep. 
At one point after 6 months of no sex I decided that I would give up attempting to initiate at all, this went on for three months with no comment from him. Finally he confronted me and accused me of sleeping with my best friend, even inventing "evidence" that this occurred. This almost broke us up. 
I find it really interesting that the comments so far seem to be saying that they would dump a HL female partner if they stopped attempting to initiate. What gives guys?? If you aren't going to give it, why be so drastic when we stop trying to get it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me tell you, once I went into a job interview and the main woman interviewing said the same thing and then went on to quiz me relentlessly on the selection criteria I had previously answered. They didn't even get to the interview questions. At the end she said she was impressed with my answers and believed I could preform the role. I didn't get the job, but a week or so later I did get another job which essentially put me in a superior position to her, in an organisation that funds the one she works for and I have cause to visit her office often. It feels good to rub it in.

Something better will come along, I promise you!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He sounds like a keeper. I had serious doubts as a child about what my gender was. I didn't grow long hair until I was about 6, and I hung around my dad more than my mum who worked shifts. I would more often than not choose pants over dresses. People would always say "What a cute little boy!" Kids at school said I had boy hair so I must be a boy, and even at dance class, the older kids said that I was a boy because my leotard was yellow and not pink. For the longest time I wondered if I really was a boy and nobody had the guts to tell me. 

Edit: Now I think of it, my male cousin used to have longer and more curly hair and lighter skin. He was always called a "Pretty girl" He also used to wear my dresses when he came over and we would play princesses together. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would beg to differ on the gender neutrality part but you are entitled to your opinion. Men's accomplishments are already robustly celebrated, not only with special holidays.

Seriously though, and I mean this with the kindest of intentions, if you want to celebrate the accomplishments of men on International Men's Day, go right ahead and organise an event. It's easy, I've organised many, give it a shot! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how it works in your country, but in ours we have other holidays to celebrate men and the work they do. And we celebrate them fervently. Anzac Day, Labour Day and Australia (Invasion) Day all come to mind. Crying foul over a day that celebrates the accomplishments of women is counter-productive and diminishes the lived experiences of women. It doesn't prove any point other than that masculinity is fragile.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's good that you are seeing a therapist, but don't be hard on yourself about stopping your behaviour before you do. Behaviour change takes around 6 weeks of consistently doing things differently. 

No judgement on your lifestyle, it's not for everyone, but the fact that you are recognising that it is becoming out of control indicates that you may need to do something about it before it gets out of hand. 

All behaviour of concern is a reaction to a perceived lack of control, finding what it is you feel you've lost control of will help you understand the function of the behaviour and give you better ideas about how to curb it. All the best </TEXT>

But as long as he eventually pops the condom in the bin and then we both get a chance to pee. Then cuddling, kissing, murmuring sweet nothings and snuggling together until we either have to get up to go to work or drift off to sleep is the best. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair it's pretty hard to keep a foreskin from retracting when that's what it's naturally going to do. I'm fairly old lady with an uncut SO and years and years of practice at BJs but that would be too hard for me to do. The actual motion of taking him in your mouth pushes the foreskin back. 

But all your other advice is totally on point, sloppy BJs are the best. It's a skill that only comes with practice and enthusiasm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's all so ingrained that people don't even realise they're saying things that are so hurtful.

My best friend (a guy) once said to me (drunk) "Big boobs aren't attractive Desire"
I just sat there, incredulous, mouth open. "Um, what?". "Big boobs are overrated, they're what's in porn, but real bodies are what is really attractive. More than a handful is a waste" I turned to my SO and said, "Is he for real?", SO just shakes his head and says "Think about what you're saying and who you're saying it to". Bestie was mystified, until he caught me giving him the evil eye. "Are you saying that my breasts are unattractive, are you insulting SO's taste in women? I have big boobs mate" Then he back-pedalled, he wasn't talking about me in particular. I think this is one of his lines that he gives to girls when he's out trying to pick up, but he had never thought before how hurtful that could be, not only to me or other large breasted women, but to all women, as by doing so you're playing one woman off against another by the virtue of their bodies, something they can do nothing about. He is better educated now, and also slightly afraid of me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh no don't do that. I don't think they're terrible. They are just products of their environment, breasts have been overtly sexualised in popular media over the past 50 or more years. This kind of attitude is culturally mediated, TV shows and movies and particularly ads, that turn breasts into these objects of desire and ridicule. I see my mum telling me to "put them away" as a form of protecting me from sexual harassment or ridicule. Sort of like saying, "Don't go out wearing that, you know boys are only after one thing" which is wrong and counter productive, and she doesn't say it very sensitively, but she's also a product of her generation.

You can however point that firehouse at any and all men who think they have the right to harass me in the streets. And fill that firehouse with baked beans, or Sulfur water or something equally disgusting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do a little bit more exercise, everyone is saying to do squats, yoga etc which is excellent advice but even brisk walking can help. Also get him to reach up and hold your hands and steady you so you can bounce on him, bonus points if he can thrust at the same time. I have always been a bigger girl but I recently became a lot bigger because of an injury and not being able to train as hard and I'm feeling a lot less confident as a result. But walking is helping, both just out in the community and doing HIIT walking at incline on the tready at the gym have helped somewhat with the muscle tone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I realised recently that I have major anxiety about my breasts because they have always been the first thing that anyone ever comments on. I'm a 34F. The My mum was always telling me that they were "hanging out", men are always demanding that I show my tits to them, my friends are always saying "wow look at those tits" and asking to touch them, people are always saying "Oh Desire and her boobs", people automatically assume that I love the power they have over others and that I use them to get ahead in life, they've become this ridiculous joke to everyone. I really love and cherish them because of how they feel, not because of how they look to others. 

On my sisters wedding day my mum had bought us all matching dressing gowns but said "Sorry Desire, I could only get this size, hope it fits"  It fit my waist and hips perfectly, but my tits, were "hanging out" and my sis wanted to have photos of all the bridesmaids in these robes. I proceeded to have a full on and very embarrassing anxiety attack, because I was thinking of the years of ridicule to come she family looked at the wedding album, "Look at Desire with her tits hanging out, she just loves getting those tits out." My sis was the only one who understood, while everyone else was saying "what's wrong what's wrong" which doesn't help.  But my sis set up a few shots where my boobs were hidden by the other maids. 

It sucks that our body parts are always under such scrutiny.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have so many other stories like this. One guy yells at me "Get us tits out" once, I said "No. Get your dick out and I might consider it" he then unzipped, and pulled out his nuts. I was like, "wow, it's so small, I can't see it past your balls" then he got the shits and says "You really have nothing going for you bitch!" 

Yes, I have nothing going for me. "I'm not the one trying to pick up chicks with my scrotum hanging out of my pants in broad daylight, but yeah, nothing going for me, might as well give up now" Then I walked into the pub and he was refused entry by the bouncers who just laughed and laughed. </TEXT>
