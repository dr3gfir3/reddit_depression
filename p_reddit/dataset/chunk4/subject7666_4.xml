	<TEXT> For people who sincerely, honestly believe that they would be condoning sinful acts by serving homosexuals, the law makes sense. Such people should be doing everything they can to denounce and prevent such acts, if they are to serve what they believe are their god's commands.

But yeah, the Constitution should block such things. People can have religion but governments should not. If something like this did pass, I'd fight at least to have medical, emergency services and government offices exempted from it. I don't really care if someone doesn't want to bake a wedding cake with two grooms on it, but I do care if pharmacists won't provide morning-after pills, birth control or HIV meds, if hospital administrators decide that same-sex spouses don't get visitation rights, or county clerks decide not to issue wedding licenses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Barely a quarter of Americans were motivated enough against a candidate who was part of "the system" to vote for Trump. You have not proven that the system has let everybody down (especially since unemployment is down and the Dow has been at record highs for a long time now). 

Enough people were fed stories and fear at a time when politicians seem incapable of working with each other and not enough is being done to help American workers whose jobs have gone away. I think that says more or less the same thing you did, but is more defensible. 

The problem is that enough voters were so in favor of anyone outside "the system" that they elected someone who can bring it all down without considering the pain and problems this will cause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After sporting a neat, well-trimmed beard for 30 years, this winter I decided to go ahead and let it grow to see what I'd get. (Hair's not growing on the top anymore, might as well go with what still works.) I'm well on my way to a Santa beard, and running into all the problems I've seen here already: stiff hair, flaky skin, etc. I've taken the advice and used conditioners and beard oil, rinsed in cool water, etc. and that helps a lot. But how often should I be doing this?

I shower every morning. I live in a hot climate. Should I be washing my beard with the same regularity, or should I skip days to let the natural oils come back? How often should I use the beard oil? I'm not after a shaped look, just a soft mass. Suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) The rest of the article adds much more context.

2) I wasn't aware making it easier was the important part. If there are roughly equal numbers of white kids and black kids doing drugs and you're arresting mostly the black kids, something is wrong. Don't continue discriminating because it's easier, change the way you address drug use on-campus and off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the article:

 Law enforcement in Alachua takes the war on drugs to the black communities, targeting those with darker skin for petty infractions that ultimately spur a drug search. Three-quarters of those arrested for misdemeanor pot by the Gainesville Police Department in 2014 and 2015 were black. The stop-and-search tactics produce at least one arrest every day - a constant pressure that has left the black neighborhood feeling persecuted and fatigued.
 - At the university, police are less aggressive in their search for drugs, relying instead on complaints. Even then, few minor drug busts end in arrest and even less in conviction. Unlike the black neighborhood, students feel police are there to protect them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple of my personal favorites are:

**Steel Beach** by John Varley, a sprawling story of a journalist in the years after Earth was invaded and humanity had to move out to the moon and other planets. Nanobot tech is ubiquitous and the main character changes genders midway through (time for a change). Also, the computer intelligence that runs everything and is everyone's best friend might be going insane. The book **The Golden Globe** is set in the same universe, a few years later, and follows an actor trying to get from Pluto to the moon in a ridiculous amount of time (and with no money) to play the role of a lifetime, followed by an unstoppable assassin with a grudge. Both are funny, thought-provoking and hard to explain.

**Jumper** by Steven Gould, and its sequels. Forget the movie, the book is amazing. Main character discovers he can teleport to anywhere he can see or remember, and the book is about him working out all the ramifications and uses of this skill. Also about dealing with an alcoholic, abusive father, a mother who abandoned him, and, oh, yes, terrorism.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 51-year-old dude, been reading comics since I was six. I have bought a *lot* of comics over the years. And the Big Two finally broke me from my character loyalty in the last decade with the nonstop annual crossover EVERYTHING WILL CHANGE AND SOMEONE WILL DIE PROBABLY cosmic whatever events.

I don't care who dies anymore. I don't care which character will never be the same for about six months anymore. All I know is that the crossover events broke the monthly books. Writers can't get a story arc going because the characters will get sucked into whatever new mega-event the editors came up with at last year's retreat, for months at a time.

A few years back -- I think around "Brand New Day," which is its own rant -- I stopped following characters completely after decades of faithful purchasing. I've stopped following hero books almost entirely, except for the ones where they're not really influenced by crossovers and the creative team stays the same. Instead I follow writers. I go look for Moore, Fraction, Liu, Waid, Simone, Ellis, Vaughn, Wilson, King, etc., and just follow them from publisher to publisher. Saves me money and I'm guaranteed good comics.

But the companies wouldn't keep doing this if it didn't pay off. Has anyone here been brought in by crossovers? Has anyone found new books to buy because of them? Where are the success stories? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  As for Trump, and I'm definitely not trying to defend him, he is actively distancing himself from his various businesses, so he's not trying to "rake in the cash."

No, he is *saying* that he is actively distancing himself from his various businesses. Not the same thing. There has been no proof of this, and I don't see how he can distance himself anyway.

He still knows what they are and what they do. He knows which countries his businesses deal with, and he knows what deals are already in progress or have been held up. He knows where his hotels and golf courses are. *They have his frigging name on them.* He has a hotel near the White House, where visiting dignitaries may be staying. It is simply not possible for him to avoid the appearance of conflict of interest even if we did grant him the benefit of the doubt, which I am not willing to do. 

MAYBE if he had released his tax returns so we knew about those business dealings ourselves before the election, or even now. MAYBE if he proved that he sold his stock months ago as his people now say he did, without a bit of evidence. MAYBE if he put his companies into a true blind trust. MAYBE if the first thing he did after winning hadn't been to contact all the heads of state in countries he had businesses in. MAYBE if he hadn't canceled the press conference he'd called to talk about his business plans and postponed it till after the Electoral College vote. MAYBE if he hadn't spent his whole business career running up debts, stiffing contractors, filing for bankruptcy and walking away. But he has given us absolutely no reason to believe him. </TEXT>

- I'm betting we've seen most of the RDJ scenes right there.
- Really don't like Ned Leeds. Nothing against the actor, but this was stolen straight from the Miles Morales run. If you want a Miles Spider-Man, make a Miles Spider-Man.
- People complaining about the cruise ship scene giving it away: this happens with every MCU movie. Guaranteed that will not be in the final scene, it's probably from some mid-point action scene. I doubt we've seen anything from the final scene yet.
- Love the Bruce Banner shoutout.
- What I'd really like to see, by the end of this? Parker moving past Stark's design and developing his own costume. He should close out the movie swinging toward us in something closer to the classic look.

	<TEXT> Oh, I'm sure most of the people who have seen it are probably liberal. The Broadway audience is mostly liberal, it's self-selecting. 

But your post suggested that only liberals would like it, and I wanted to point out that "Hamilton" has more than a few conservative fans, some of whom are prominent and on record for it. Why wouldn't they be? Hamilton was their guy. He opposed states' rights over the federal government, but he was for a strong military, a strong bank, the electoral college, etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's part of why I do like the show. Hamilton was a dick to many people, and the show doesn't hide that. Few of the characters are just one thing, really, and that's rare in any story.

I think it's important that we understand the founding fathers were imperfect, human. People have not changed, really. We've always had politicians who were at odds with each other, often loudly. The country was created out of a consensus that was hard-fought. We didn't have these paragons of virtue and then suddenly our politicians all went insane the last few decades. 

It's important to know that they were just like us, and they still accomplished what they did. It means that we can do it, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's pitched as a hip-hop musical, but it is and it isn't.

"Hamilton" uses the style and language of hip-hop and rap to tell its story. Miranda used the fast cadences, multiple rhymes in the same line and the rapidfire delivery of rap but the subject matter is at turns dramatic, funny, and heartbreaking. It's rap the way Gilbert and Sullivan would use it, and there are some shoutouts to G S in there, too.

Miranda put out a Spotify playlist of songs that inspired him when he was writing "Hamilton." I loved "Hamilton," so I listened to it. Nope. Still don't like hip-hop.  

It's not three hours of gangsta rap. You won't feel like you walked into the wrong club. And while rap is used in many of the songs, there is also rhythm and blues, jazz, and one or two songs that would fit perfectly in a Disney movie (OK, a pretty funky Disney movie, but still.).

You still may not like it -- my wife doesn't -- but you might be surprised. A lot of people have been. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You could cast a white man as an Asian in a movie right now. Nothing is stopping you. Your artistic vision is your own and you don't have to change it to please anybody.

But if your artistic vision includes the most over-the-top racist stereotype you can produce -- such as Mr. Rooney's I.Y. Yunioshi -- you're going to get flack for it. Freedom of expression has never meant freedom from criticism.

If the Hamilton actors were portraying the founding fathers with "white guys do this" types of jokes and physical humor, giving themselves deformed Caucasian appearances and mocking white people in general, you might have a case. Instead they portrayed them with respect and depth and brought them alive for millions of people.

Context matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It means they're not starting from an equal position. 

Black people playing traditionally white characters are still a tiny part of the whole thing. White actors aren't hurting because of it. A black actor getting a powerful role is still a noteworthy thing.

White people getting cast in the role of a POC takes jobs away from the relatively tiny pool of available jobs for POC actors, and it reinforces the stage, TV and movie cliche that the default color for human beings is white. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out of context, it does seem unfair and weird.

But when the vast majority of actors throughout the history of western TV and movies have all been white, with other races mostly relegated to playing stereotypical bit parts or villains, it's powerful for people of color to see people who look like them on the stage and on the screen playing roles that have weight and depth. And taking a classic role portrayed by a POC and giving it to a white actor instead of any of the many qualified POC actors seems like a step backwards.

Similar to asking why there's no White History Month, White Entertainment Television or why white people can't use the n-word when black people can. The question only makes sense if you ignore the last couple hundred years, which many people seem quite happy to do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The level playing field of the Internet will be gone.

Bigger sites will be able to pay for faster content delivery. New startups and your own homemade site? Slower, less reliable.

ISPs could charge different rates for different services, and it would become more like cable. Your cheap package might not get the good websites, especially the media-heavy ones.

Bundling like that could be even more invasive. Suppose you want Netflix but to get it you have to also use Bing? What if a business deal resulted in the high-speed Hulu only being available to Comcast users?

Once ISPs start curating website access, if they do, then pressure to blacklist unwanted sites will be huge. Porn, torrent sites, and other questionably legal sites are obvious targets, but some people may pressure local ISPs to block information on abortion, birth control, news sites they don't like, dissent, etc. 

One common theme for Trump and the people he is choosing is that business is more important than anything else. Privatize infrastructure, reduce regulations, promote charter schools and vouchers over public education. If there is a way to make money, it will happen, and the freewheeling, open nature of the Internet will be gone.

Because success and wealth are easily available for anyone willing to work, as everyone knows, so people on welfare must be lazy and are probably deliberately gaming the system to buy drugs.

Because being seen to be tough on welfare cheats -- even when you have to create the idea of massive welfare cheating yourself to do so -- plays well with your base.

	<TEXT> - Stricter voting laws, more purges of voter rolls, more restrictions on same-day registrations, early voting, etc. 
- More anti-abortion laws. 
- Privatized infrastructure that results in sweetheart deals to friends and very few new highways or bridges. 
- Privatized schooling that benefits unaccountable charter and religious schools and further impoverishes public education. 
- Religious freedom laws that do not block gay marriage but that allow people (including pharmacists, county clerks, hospitals, etc) to refuse them service. 
- Complete defunding of Planned Parenthood. 
- Evisceration of Obamacare. 
- Increased deportation of illegal immigrants with criminal records. 
- Elimination of any efforts to combat or even study climate change. 
- Tax changes that overwhelmingly benefit the wealthy. 
- Relaxed regulations for business. 
- Slashed funding for the EPA or any consumer protection groups. 
- Reduction in investments for clean energy, increased attention to "clean" coal. 
- The end of Net Neutrality and increased ease of government to break into your email and phones. 
- Reduced support for UN and NATO.

I'm not so worried about what Trump has said he'll do because he changes opinions to win whatever conversation he's having at the moment. But everything on that list is something that the GOP wants, and several of them are pet projects of the people he's chosen for his cabinet. Some of them can be done just by the department's secretary deciding what to focus on and what not to enforce. 

I don't actually expect Trump to govern at all. I expect him to grow into the banana republic dictator he's been bred to be and come out of the job far richer than when he went in thanks to the many international deals that will magically happen.

	<TEXT> Big, big fan of Allen Steele and John Varley. Big space ideas, but with very fallible humans out there. Try "Orbital Decay" or "Steel Beach." "Steel Beach" is one of the books I re-read every year or so.

If you like idea books, try Robert J. Sawyer. After awhile his characters and plots tend to run together -- his protagonists are all unique, as long as they also are all Canadian professors who like Star Trek, and he takes these mind-stretching ideas and then drops a murder or something in them -- but he is excellent at coming up with interesting ideas and seeing where they go. What happens if aliens land and someone kills one? "Illegal Alien." How would it change humanity of you could prove, conclusively, the existence of a soul? "The Terminal Experiment." How would we accept an alien visitor who believed in creationism and had proof? "Calculating God." What if the Internet woke up and was, despite popular culture warnings to the contrary, benevolent? The WWW trilogy. What if the majority of humans weren't really conscious, a smaller percentage were sociopaths and the smallest percentage were people with a conscience? "Quantum Night," and some of the musings in that one resonated a little too closely to current events for me.

I like Sawyer's work almost despite Sawyer, his website and social media are nonstop promotion for himself. Or at least they were, I haven't looked in years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're in retail, assume that at some point your customer will see it. There is always the chance that a coworker (or that CEO) will forward an email to a customer without realizing the whole email chain went along for the ride, so the customer can see all the "let's just give it to the idiot so he'll leave us alone" emails you sent back and forth first.

(Had this happen to me once, and fortunately our emails had been on the lines of "how can we help this customer out?")

Assume that every email (or online post) you write will be something you have to publicly defend some day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really think we can have a serious discussion with that question, and I really, really doubt anything I or anyone else could say is going to change your opinion as stated since we're not starting from the same assumptions (or, possibly, realities), but here's this:

"The devil made me do it" is hogwash. Putting the blame for the actions of human beings on external sources -- whether it be demons, Satan, cursed books, what have you -- gives the humans who performed the deeds an excuse, and it can blind people to the real dangers of ordinary people. The guy who looks perfectly normal could be a sexual predator. The religious leader or parent or youth group leader who could never do such things because they're so nice could be a pedophile. Blaming any evil influence takes the blame away from the people doing the acts, and I do not agree with that. 

It also allows people to rise up against other things they consider to be evil, since it's clearly a general rise in evilness that's causing all those problems and not just, say, some twisted son of a bitch, and then you get programs against kinds of music or sexuality or whatever misguided people decide they hate this month.

People are responsible for their actions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything's possible, with good stories.

That said, the Big Two's reboots, rebirths, cross-promotions and other demographics-grabbing schemes have scared me off of most cape books for the last 10 years. These days I follow writers/artists I like, and focus on self-contained stories that don't interact much with the rest of the comics universes. (Ms. Marvel is one exception, but I'm worried "Champions" will end up watering her down.) 

I'll check back in a year or so and see if I need to catch up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But a) Bernard said there was code in there that wasn't Ford's. If Ford  built him and there's STILL Arnold code in there, Ford isn't entirely in control. And b) that assumes Bernard's moment of sentience didn't happen the second Ford walked out the door and Bernard had to fight for his own life. 

And it really comes down to TV logic: if you didn't see a killing happen, don't trust it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Looks like there's at least two, possibly three.

2. After last night's episode, looks like it was Arnold.

3. We don't know yet.

4. He talks to him in episode 5, but never names the MiB. He talks to Teddy, mentions Wyatt, and quotes Sir Walter Scott as he goes past Teddy: "Mr. Flood, we must look back and smile at perils past."

5. Apparently because WW has all-new staff, Arnold was reclusive, and I guess there were no bio pics on the company website? This is one of the weaker parts of this reveal.

6. A sentient host would be one that was self-aware and able to do things outside of their programming, I'd think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think part of Arnold is still alive. Ford has talked a lot about consciousness and sentience and what makes a human being human, and says Arnold was trying for true awareness. I think Arnold figured out how to put himself in the system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We know someone screwed with her code even before she started to do it herself. But she also had that "alive" moment when her daughter was killed. Did that trigger something in her? Was she already changed at that point, so the trigger moment could happen in the first place? We don't know yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two things going on here. One, the creators wanted us to think, early on in the show, that the MiB raped her (just like we all though Logan was going to rape her, or have his men do it, last night). Second, I think it's entirely possible we'll find out the MiB stabbed her in the barn that night, with the same knife and in the same way that Logan did 30-something years ago, to see if she'd remember it or it would trigger something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Couple thoughts and questions.

Pretty sure MiB is William, or it'll be one hell of a fake. I think they're going to give us that one but surprise us somewhere else.

Also think Ford is setting Mauve up to be the new Bernard. But I'm not positive Bernard is dead. Hosts get shot all the time. Delores already shot herself in the head at least once. (And did Ford tell her to, way back when, or was that her last sentient decision that first time?)

Where did the "Arnold is Ford's father" theory come from? That seems way out of left field to me.

Still a little sketchy to me that no one recognized Bernard/Arnold. Even if you accept the theory that everyone working for Westworld is new or a host, what about the outside world? 

I kinda hope Ford ends up being the good guy, if for no other reason than to play against Anthony Hopkins' type. </TEXT>
