	<TEXT> Because a first reaction to a 20 week ban on abortion might be..*well ya, that's pretty far along, how many women are doing that?* And that would be a fairly accurate observation as Planned P points out: "Nearly 99% percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks." *hmm, so why are the 1% of women getting abortions after 21 weeks?*: "but when they are needed later in pregnancy, its often in very complex circumstances  the kind of situations where a woman and her doctor need every medical option available."  And that's a pretty solid fast answer for starters. </TEXT>

Here's the first part transcribed:

"I have a simple question: **What the heck are you thinking?** What is in your mind! Why would you want to give out any of your personal information to a faceless corporation for the sole purpose of them selling it!? Give me one good reason why Comcast should know what my mother's medical problems are, you know how they'd know, because when I went to the doctor with her and they told me what it was, I had no clue what they were talking about, I came home and I searched it on the net, I searched the drugs she was taking. The same with my children. **Just last week, I bought underwear on the Internet, Why should you know what size I take?"**

	<TEXT> It's counterintuitive to the arguement being made about abortion rights. I gave you a clear argument of what I mean and you did not reply to any of it. Do not conflate abortion rights and pro-gun rights. You can make another point about guns but to say "this article missed the point because of guns" is antithetical to the point being made, so what do you think of my explanation of abortion not being a polarized issue up for debate, particularly for all democrats to take that stance?

   On the issue of gun rights, perhaps that is something Dems should do to bring in the moderate right. I don't want people who shouldn't have guns illegally for crimes to have lots of guns and I don't want bullets flying around from guns people legally or illegally own, but I am no longer confident arguing with the 2nd ammemdmnt will do anything to prevent gun violence. It is true that the guns people own to protect themselves are more likely to hurt or kill someone they know than to protect themselves and it is unclear how to minimize that statistic.  </TEXT>

But to your point, yes, part of me wants it over and I want them to release this human being from his hardened position as I feel bad for all uncomfortable humans. But, also, I don't think either one of us can be sure he won't end up with a Fox News job...So, I don't empathize with Sean or the position he has put himself in, sure it is sad though  </TEXT>

Because I am very concerned that congressmen David Nunes and the Trump administration is trying to stop the public from hearing her testimony, and I need to know my country is in safe hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bernie was pretty directly asked about being more open to anti-abortion and he said yes. Before I read this, Sanders came off poorly to me when I heard it and he at least needs to clarify because he did say yes without elaborating. And the writer goes on to point to the fact that Dems have historically moved to the right on what they consider polarized issues, where as the writer points out that abortion rights are not a "polarized issue" and calling it "polarized" is a male perspective that men see amoung men. Among women it is not a "polarized opinion" meant for debate; it is a human's right to their body.  As the Democrats decide how to respond to the loss, every right is up for grabs, anything can be labeled too liberal (as she also pointed to an nytimes article urging Dems to move right) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last 3 minutes, Bernie on Climate Change:

"Right, Mica, that's a 6-hour discussion. It's...it's...I don't know what adjective to use."

"You have a president that tells the world, in his *view,* after intensive studying, he has concluded, unlike the rest of the science community that climate change is a hoax, emanating from China."

"And what he has done appointing the people he has appointed is a danger, a horrific danger, not only to our generation, but to our children and our grandchildren."

**""Hey, Mr. President, listen to the scientists, Climate Change is real,** it is already causing devastating problems to our country and around the world. And if we don't transform our energy system away from fossil fuel, coal, oil, gas, into energy efficiency and sustainable energy I worry very much about the planet the future generations will inherit."

"By the way, despite Trump's rhetoric there, the corporate world understands the future is sustainable energy, most of the new investments are going into solar which is exploding all over our country and the world, and into wind and solar. **What this guy is doing is really an international embarrassment and endangering the future of our country**

Sounds like Sony and Disney are splitting the Sony movie merchandise, and Disney owns the image but they would maybe get a smaller percentage from Venom merch for example? more like a rental fee, so they d get less from a future Spider-Man movie merch, although it all boost all Spider-Man products which Disney owns..? </TEXT>

Regardless of what one might say of Sony's Andrew Garfield they were happy to sell us on him and then disappear him, with all the build up they laid on us. It's that profit share, maybe they just want more and even the venom movie verse  is a ploy for more Spidey's shares, but more likely Amy pascal's bosses want the whole pie with the added hype of the MCU. It seemed like Pacal didn't mean to get into it maybe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Im not allowed to promote anything that Im involved in. So I just want to have the legal disclosure that youve asked me the question and I am not promoting any product, Mnuchin said. But you should send all your kids to '**Lego Batman.**'


Mnuchin is one of the executive producers on the movie, which was financed by his RatPac-Dune Entertainment


The group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington released a statement in which it said that **"its clear that Mnuchin did not learn any lessons from the Kellyanne Conway affair. This kind of thing happened, and will continue to happen, when there is a White House that does not take disciplinary action for ethical lapses.**

	<TEXT> No I'm referring to conservatives floating Garland for the Supreme Court to Obama, not the lower level court nominations.  And no, Gorsch is way more conservative than Garland is liberal. Sorry, I don't support your Ideological Conservative Judge, yes I'm sure some Conservatives don't know if Gorsuch is as hardcore as they want, but Garland was absolutely, undeniably, more of a compromise to Conservatives than Gorsuch is a compromise to liberals. You keep obfuscating my points for petty side debates.

 Sanders layed out three clear fair points, you just don't agree with his opinion, but you can't say he isn't laying out a reasonable argument against Gorsuch for moderates.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Picture IDs do not prevent voter fraud; and that may sound surprising, but we can be identified with various factoids. Recently, they said Mail-in ballots in Michigan would be legit (and would also increase turnout!) i.e. you don't need a picture. In Texas, right now, they are tying to enforce needing a picture ID to vote, a picture ID is usually a drivers license, and poor people for example in Texas don't have a car or can't pay the money for a state ID or can't get to the state ID office without a car because it's too far to get to. Texas Republicans use these "Voter Fraud" rules to inflict voter fraud, actually suppressing poor minorities who generally vote for Democrats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Is North Carolina a Preview of Whats to Come?*

"The election of a Democratic governor last year directly challenged the ability of the Republican-controlled General Assembly to defend a suite of voter disenfranchisement tactics that has been called a monster law.


For traditionally purple North Carolina, this fight represents a willingness by the GOP to abandon any vestige of bipartisanship in accepting the will of the electorate.


One can argue that the roadmap for the national Republicans to permanently consolidate power is being tried out in North Carolina  particularly in light of calls by the president to investigate alleged voter fraud.


By 2055, the United States will be far more ethnically diverse; no single race will make up more than 50 percent of the population. The country also is growing more liberal by the year, placing increasing pressure on conservatives to find ways to stay at the table. Many politicians have embraced undemocratic tactics in order to stay in power.


The right to vote is our most fundamental right, said North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who, in February, filed a motion with the U.S. Supreme Court to dismiss the petition to appeal the overturning of the 2013 voting restrictions package.
The NC General Assembly has responded to this call with a petition of its own to the Supreme Court, seeking to disqualify Stein from the case.


While the situation in North Carolina can be construed as a consequence of the hollowing of the Voting Rights Act, the North Carolina case is really a study in gerrymandering and how this winners-take-all approach to governance has managed to turn a demographically purple state into one that is solidly red. It is also a warning to the rest of the nation that  left unchecked  aggressive gerrymandering can, and will, be the end of American democracy."



And then the article really dives into North Carolina voting rights recent diminishing.

	<TEXT> Yes I do blame the Republican congress. But it does seem those states took the ruling as an opportunity to push new voting restrictions, which is probably why it was passed or diminished by 5 conservative leaning judges yes, 4 liberal leaning judges no. Perhaps your "bad precedent" holds to a degree(although precedent seems interpretable to the context), but there is a precedent to replace before you repeal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see. 
"The effects are already being felt. Ballard Sphar LLP said: The demise of Section 4 has had and will continue to have substantial effects. Mere hours after the Court issued its decision, Texas announced that it would activate its controversial voter ID law and possibly the redistricting maps passed by the Texas legislature. The North Carolina legislature has also indicated its plan to enact a statute...that requires voters to present state-issued photo ID to vote.

Sounds like they should have just left it as it was, obviously the Republican majority doesn't want to update it, I still maintain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, but what kind of thing was rejected? 1964-racist states had to get approval for 50 years? Maybe not perfect, doesn't sound unfair yet though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are the newly offending states? Seems like the court striking down the "punishing" of states part, which just means the slowing of enacting law by needing to get approval, is the Republican victory, so until the Democrats take the house, no Republican wants new restrictions on states? The Dems will probably try to tag it to some other bill. Cornyn don't care about equal rights, he said it was equal enough.
