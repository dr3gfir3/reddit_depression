I guess some time spent on relevant Wiki articles couldn't hurt! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! That helps a lot!

I'm pretty new to world building so not a lot has been cemented yet. I guess I never thought of sapience as something that could gradually evolve, and was thinking of it as some sort of freak mutation. However, the Darwinism makes way more sense! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, all. I've got a question about intelligent species in worlds.

Is it possible for more than one sapient race to evolve in one region with out any sort of physical barriers between them?

My first reaction to this is that one would reach sapience then the surrounding species would form some sort of relationship with them (symbiotic, predator/prey, etc.) and that would halt the evolutionary progress of the non-sapient race. But I have little to no knowledge of exactly what causes the ascension to sapience...

Any input, guidance, or reading materials would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>
