	<TEXT> A stolen car. They were in a police chase, eluded the cops by tearing down an alley, and then crashed through my back fence. So I wake up thinking I heard something, go out back for a look and see a dim light in the pitch darkness. Totally mystified. Muster up the courage to approach and realize it's an abandoned vehicle, still running, underneath the debris of my fence.  </TEXT>

Alcohol. No idea what your relationship with it is, mentally or physically. If you think that eliminating it is crucial for you to accomplish a big win over an untimely death then you have your reasons. If not, then maybe the focus on elimination can be subject to revision.

	<TEXT> Push ups. 

My son showed me a YouTube of a girl who did 100 push ups a day for a year. She started out only able to do a few at a time. By year's end she's able to do all 100 at once. Her physical transformation is awesome. After a month, I am now doing 70 a day. I started out at 25 per day. (Was not up to going for 100 at the start). 

This is a simple thing to make a daily routine. It makes me feel great.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dropped out of college and went into sales. Met a ton of interesting people along the way. Partied, traveled.  By contrast, my wife (whom I met and married many years later) worked as a bartender, completed bachelors and masters, and landed a great job at graduation. 

I have made a living in a niche industry that does not require a college degree. We are both six figure earners....But money is just money:

She has a far greater number of opportunities as a direct result of her academic accomplishments. She is totally immersing herself in opportunities and interests on a level that I simply cannot. As we grow older these things will pay life enrichment dividends exponentially. 

I beat the odds. My strategy of focusing on one thing in sales has worked (so far). (I've also seen a lot of really focused individuals buck the trend and forgo school to instead work and / or start a business that reflects their talent and passion.) I guess my "success" is told as a cautionary tale...because I would hate to see anyone leave school and then fail to thrive...which is all too common.

"An act of war is an action by one country against another with an intention to provoke a war or an action that occurs during a declared war or armed conflict between military forces of any origin. The loss or damage caused due to such conflicts are excluded from insurance coverage except for life assurances."

What John is doing is called saber rattling. And he does it a lot.

	<TEXT> Powerful. I hope you find some peace today, and for the remainder of your time there this holiday. 

When I was young, it was pre-internet. I felt suffocated by the way my mother dominated the home atmosphere. Glad you have the ability to reach out, as you have here. Hoping you have friends available on FB, etc, to reach as well. Hoping too that you have a place to maybe go out for a stroll or a jog, or a beer or a coffee or a toke...

Guess what I'm trying to share is that dipping out for my little self indulgences has helped me, and still does.

	<TEXT> Can you pursue getting it expunged? 

1-I hope over time you can come to healthy terms with this unfortunate situation. Seems to me that the majority of popular opinion here on Reddit is that you were dealt a bad hand. That is likely true in the court of opinion out in the real world, too. Hoping that improves your morale. Hoping that you will invest in loving and taking care of yourself. 

2-i recommend staying in the country. Winning is often less about waging an aggressive offense, and more about patience, minimizing mistakes, and waiting for an easy opportunity. Fleeing will likely have a cascading effect of unintended consequences. Stay. Develop good relationships with good people. As you grow your circle of friends, you grow sphere of influence. Reasonable opportunities will avail themselves.

Would much appreciate any tips or suggestions! Have a hemp related prospective client but he cannot afford the pricing. I'd really like to get him his shirts on hemp...just think from a marketing perspective it's really cool way to go.
