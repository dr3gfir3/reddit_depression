	<TEXT> When I was my highest at 136 and had just gotten back from the gym, my boyfriend and I were fighting about something. I totally forget what it was but it was totally irrelevant.  He then gets frustrated and blurts out something like "you fucking sausage!" I could tell he didn't even think about the words he was using. He never has called me a word like that and never commented on how much weight I've gained, so hearing him say that felt like he had been holding it in for awhile and was grossed out by my weight, and finally broke and let it slip that he thinks I'm a sausage. It makes me nauseous to think about this moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? Wow thanks :) I've kind of been all over the place. I started restricting back in Late June when I was about 136 pounds, and stayed at about 500-600 for one or two weeks. Then I did some higher restriction at 700-800. I had some slip ups where I would overeat and have like 2000 calories, but it never truly hindered my progress.
 
 In August I started trying much higher restriction at 900-1000 but started bouncing all over the place. Some days id have 1000, others 500, 1200, 2000 ..etc. this has still being going on up until this point. I ate around 3000 calories last night-my highest binge yet :/. However, I still seem to be losing about 2.4 pounds a week.... I'm not questioning it. 

As for working out, I rarely do. The only times I MIGHT go to the gym is the day after over eating to try and make up for it. I also do 100 weighted squats every week. Besides that I'm pretty much a potato. Now that classes have started up (I'm a student) I've been walking a ton, so that'll hopefully speed up progress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only exercise the day after a binge. I mostly restrict every day to about 600-850 cal, but in the last few weeks I've had two or three technically overeating sessions where I ate 2000-3000 cal in a day. The day after I'll feel bloated and gross and actually have some energy for once, so I channel it into working out To try and lessen the damage of my binge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust me, they would take you seriously and be more than happy to help you on your weightloss journey. I worried they wouldn't take me seriously because I felt like 800 was a lot for someone with with an ED, but they're really just happy to help. Also, if you have been gaining on 800-900 cal a day then you may have an underlying health issue that may be preventing the weight loss/causing weight gain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a paranoid and anxious mess and it's super embarrassing when people I'm around pick up on it. I can usually mask it pretty well but lately I haven't been doing too well. It's gotten to the point where my eyes will start to water because I'm so upset in public, even though I'm forcing a smile or just trying to keep a poker face. 

Last night I went to see a musician I really enjoy and couldn't even focus. I started doing DBT techniques to try to calm down, but nothing really worked. For 3/4 of his set, I was shaking and hoping my boyfriend wouldn't look over at me and see my teary eyes because it would ruin the show for him. I feel like such a burden because he paid but I couldn't even enjoy it and he could tell ):  </TEXT>
