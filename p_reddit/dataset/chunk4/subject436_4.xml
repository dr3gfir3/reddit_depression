	<TEXT> Optimists had significantly better blood sugar and total cholesterol levels than their counterparts. They also were more physically active, had healthier body mass indexes and were less likely to smoke, according to a paper on the research that appears in the January/February 2015 issue of Health Behavior and Policy Review.

http://americanlivewire.com/2015-01-10-heart-health-may-depend-optimism-levels/

"Individuals with the highest levels of optimism have twice the odds of being in ideal cardiovascular health compared to their more pessimistic counterparts," said lead author Rosalba Hernandez, a professor of social work at the University of Illinois.

"This association remains significant even after adjusting for socio-demographic characteristics and poor mental health," Hernandez added.

Statin use and fruit consumption were also found to be favorable 'factors':

The study also looked at the effects of diet and **statin drugs**, both of which have been implicated in lowering Alzheimer disease risk. Statins are widely prescribed for lowering cholesterol, and there were 3975 subjects who used statins when they began the study. Their risk for Alzheimers disease mortality was 60% lower than non-users. 

Consumption of three or more pieces of **fruit** per day was associated with 60% lower Alzheimers disease mortality </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to Sanders, who cited federal records, the average prices of more than 1,200 generic drugs increased by more than 400 percent from July 2013 to July 2014. Now one in four Americans cannot afford to buy drugs anymore.

Two tablets of albuterol sulfate, a drug needed by those who suffer from asthma, were priced at $11 in October 2013. Half a year later, the price went up to $434. A bottle of doxycycline hyclate, an antibiotic, was sold for $20 in Oct. 2013. In April 2014, the price of the same bottle was a staggering $1,849. The list could go on.

	<TEXT> This was such a beautiful and fascinating spot we found in New Mexico. The Bisti Badlands is a "scenic and colorful expanse of undulating mounds and unusual eroded rocks" located along highway 371 in quite literally the middle of nowhere. It's so far from anywhere that the silence is almost absolute and a little eerie.

	<TEXT>  We investigate the effects of resistance exercise on emotional episodic memory.

 We measure physiological state with heart rate, blood pressure, and alpha amylase.

 We use a knee extension/flexion task for resistance exercise.

 We find that resistance exercise during consolidation can benefit memory.

 We find effects of valence based on the physiological response to the exercise.
