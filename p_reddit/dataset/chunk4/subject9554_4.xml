	<TEXT> Has an MVP ever been awarded that wasn't on the winning team? Lets take this series for example. If Cleveland had lost at the end in typical Cleveland heartbreaking fashion, could the MVP trophy still have been awarded to Lebron or is it automatically awarded to someone on the winning team? Because my argument is that Lebron was still the MVP of that series no matter the outcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [The Changeling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cETMR4cUp6c) with George C. Scott. It's an older movie (1980) but holds up really well, has no CGI and has a great, menacing atmosphere to it.

	<TEXT> Back in the early 80's, I had a wrestling/football coach that was an old badass Marine. Landed on Tarawa and a few other islands then fought in Korea. The kind that was old school and gave Zero Fucks.  

Now, this was in 7th and 8th grade and once in awhile, he would would shower at the same time we did. The coaches didn't have separate showers and these were the old school open bay showers. 

Well, this old man had the longest balls. We ended up calling him Donkey Balls (insert last name). What a shock to see what we'd one day become... </TEXT>
