These are Sennheiser HD280 Pros (64ohm). Can I take out the board completely? Or does the extra resistance live here instead of the drivers, which I assume would be sketchy?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So for a long time I have really wanted to make an extension to handle downloading of larger files. As of now, I save URLs to a .txt file and run a batch script which is basically just "wget -r -np -c -i Auto.txt". 

I think the next step is to set up an extension that can load URLs into that txt file straight from context menu in chrome. 

Problem is, I have never really done anything like this before. Does anyone have ideas or tutorials to share? I don't really know where to start, but I'm a fast learner! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I recall it's about 3 cups shelled pistachios, soak in water for like a half hour, take out of water, blend, make like 3 cups of simple (boil 2 cups sugar and 2 cups water) and pour blended nuts into it letting it simmer for a few minutes. Don't boil. Let sit overnight. Strain through cheesecloth (twice if necessary). Add some vodka or brandy or whatever you want. 

You can probably adapt any orgeat recipe though. Only lasts a few weeks in the fridge.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now there's a hard cap on charter schools. For example say Springfield has two. Under 100 in the state. 

They split budget with public schools. Springfield's total budget for education gets split 80%/10%/10%. The public schools have to share funding with charter schools. 

The charter schools both only enroll 200 students (part through lottery and par through legacy). These students may get an excellent education, or they may get a horrible one. We don't really regulate that. 

Yes on question 2 lets the state start 12 new schools every year with no limit. So we could see Springfield public school budget dropping gradually, lowering public school effectiveness (further than it already is). 

Basically, Massachusetts has the best schools in the country. We need more money for public schooling, especially in cities. Dividing it more between charters we don't regulate hurts, it doesn't help. 

Mind, all of these numbers are purely made up.  </TEXT>

The sorcerer and I broke into a room by using blink from the floor below. We were now on the 5th floor of the building. Our rogue climbed out the window of the adjacent room and shimmied along the ledge. 

A guard finds us. Rogue climbs out window quickly. Guard trains crossbow on me and sorcerer. Sorcerer has 10 HP. Tried to ready spell. Guard fires, drops sorcerer to -2HP. 

Now I'm alone with the unconscious friend. Can't bring her out window and walk on ledge because fuck that. 

Throw sorcerer our windows and blink 10ft downward.

	<TEXT> What if his E acted like Fizz's E? He can jump onto the wall and he has a second to decide which direction he wants to go. That way you can jump up and scout, then jump back. Still lets him move quickly, but you'd be able to use it in range for a wider gap closer, and to get on a target during a roam. Maybe even let him Q with extended range from on top of the wall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love Sand Dancer. I made a character (fighter 4, warblade 1, bloodstorm blade 1) for a wild west one shot that used weapon finesse, hurling charge, sand dancer, quick draw, etc. Basically running around throwing knives and sand at everyone. Super fun build, but I got un-invited from the game for breaking up with the DM's sister. Oh well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but Bose won't do it. You'd have the most luck with a furniture restore place. They stopped taking repairs on those unless they're series VI v2 (model since '96 or so).
