	<TEXT> In movie Split, Kevin's dad is said to have left on a train and never return. Kevin was a very young boy then. Is it possible that Kevin's father left on the same train which had David Dunn (Bruce Willis) traveling in? Could it be that Kevin's dad was one of the 131 passengers who died back then? Is this why Kevin leaves flowers at the train station? Is that why Kevin becomes the Beast inside a train? Given the movies are related, would these things be related too?
