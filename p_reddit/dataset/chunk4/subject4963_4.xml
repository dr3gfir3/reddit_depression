	<TITLE> Buddha Nature in "The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying" by Sogyal Rinpoche </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-21 07:06:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been reading this book lately and it's actually pretty good, it mostly revolves around preparing oneself to die and the reality of death. There's one passage however that talks about buddha nature  and describes it as being called God in Christianity/Judaism, the Self/Brahman in Hinduism, etc. When put like this, isn't this buddha nature then contradictory to emptiness and impermanence? The way he also refers to discovering the buddha nature and seeing it as being the "changeless" almost seems like it's being considered a sort of soul. Anyone care to shed some light on this? Everything I've read so far seems great but with all due respect I'm iffy about these claims. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This book is fantastic, and it's what got me into Buddhism but at the same time gave me a false understanding of Buddhism (I wouldn't blame Hesse for this, I don't believe the book ever asserts itself to be actual Buddhism) but really it's more Brahmanism which I did adopt for a while. Buddhism was kind of the next step from there. But it is a great book. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a pretty cheap 7 inch Chinese tablet that runs Android 2.3. I've used it as a Kindle reader before and it's pretty good for that, however I can't get the Kindle app to sync with my library (most of the downloads I've made I made on my phone). The tablet is not compatible with the play store, so I had to download the latest version of Kindle that's still compatible with Android 2.3 off of apkmirror. Is it just because the app is so outdated that Amazon doesn't allow it to sync with libraries anymore? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah that's why I said estrogen-like. The article stated that soy contains isoflavones but what they failed to mention is that they do have similar effects on the body as estrogen. The article(s) that they cited involved studies looking at the testosterone and estrogen levels of men who consumed soy, however did not look into the effects caused. One of the articles did observe that it did not effect sperm production, however this is the only thing they looked into regarding estrogen-like effects (others not looked into would've been fat and muscle production and emotional states). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I go Vegan/Vegetarian? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-12 17:37:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm thinking of dropping meat and possibly animal products in the attempt to add good karma to the world. I understand the suffering that eating meat causes and the Lankavatara Sutra also gives a pretty good reasoning to drop meat-eating.  
The only problem is getting sufficient protein at a still inexpensive cost. I've read that beans, nuts, and grains such as quinoa are very good, however one article I was reading said that quinoa is one of the only ones that provides all the necessary amino acids that meat provides. I also don't want to make my diet revolve around soy as I've heard it increases estrogen-like hormones.  
Any advice for this transition? </TEXT>

Of course my post wasn't going to be accurate, I tried to sum up what takes libraries of books and years of practice and insight into two sentences each on a Reddit comment. Anyway you also seem to have a good understanding of the topic, and if you ever have to explain to a Redditor the difference between Theravada and Mahayana Buddhism hopefully you'll have better luck than I. Have a good day! </TEXT>

And you're right I don't know much about Vajrayana but would like to learn more about it so if you have any suggestions please let me know. I currently have The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying in my library but haven't gotten around to reading it yet. I have read though the an anthology of texts from the Tipitaka in a book called In the Buddha's Words by Bhikkhu Bodhi as well as the Lankavatara Sutra, the Platform Sutra, and the Milinda Panha. Thank you though for your critique and insight! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Theravada Buddhism is what is considered by scholars to be the closest to what the Buddha actually taught. It is the most "basic" of the teachings and focuses primarily on the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Path. The main goal is to attain Nirvana and therefore leave Samsara.  
  
Mahayana Buddhism is based on believed additional teachings by the Buddha after the teachings followed in the Theravada school. Many scholars, however, don't believe that the Buddha actually taught the ideas present in the Mahayana schools. These ideas include prayer, Bodhisattvahood, and Buddha-nature amongst many more.  
  
Zen (Ch'an in China) is a school of Mahayana Buddhism that focuses heavily on the nature of being as well as mindfulness in practice.  
"Zen does not confuse spirituality with thinking about God while peeling potatoes. Zen spirituality is just to peel the potatoes." -Alan Watts  
It also focuses on the idea that some stuff just has to be realized and cannot be expressed by way of mouth.  
  
Another major school is Vajrayana Buddhism, which some believe to just be a Mahayana school while others feel it's an entirely different practice on its own. It focuses heavily on Tantric methods, i.e. connecting oneself to the external world similar to Hinduism. This is done through deity meditation and other esoteric practices.  
  
If anyone feels I am incorrect with any of these please let me know, I wouldn't want to give anyone incorrect knowledge and would like to refine my knowledge as well.
