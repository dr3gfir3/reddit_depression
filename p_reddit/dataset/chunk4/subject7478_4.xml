This month I received a USB hub that looks like a mini Sega Genesis and couldn't help but think... That thing is probably mostly hollow and would probably have plenty of room for an Orange Pi One in it.

About twenty minutes later, I had drilled a hole for power and cut and filed a hole for HDMI. Some hot glue action secured the board in place and we are off to the races.

So far it doesn't seem to be running overly warm, after a nice long NES session. Super happy with how it turned out!

Sorry about the messy photos... Doing a bunch of remodelling and took a break for this. </TEXT>

Had Tasha survived to meet Picard, this Tasha would have a completely different history than the Tasha Yar Picard knew. It never occurred to me before today that the reunion would have been bittersweet for both, neither being the friend either remembered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can do it man. I started at 400 and am down to around 280 and still working at it. I started with food changes and a couple of times a week at the gym. I did protein, then fat, then carbs. I try to keep carbs to 50 or less a day. It can certainly be a struggle, but it can certainly be done.

	<TEXT> Very interesting how close the uniforms they are wearing on the Franklin look like they are super inspired by the Starfleet uniforms from Enterprise. Right down to the patches on the arms. I wonder if they find an old federation ship and... for some reason put on clothing they find in it. A la In A Mirror, Darkly?

Very interesting indeed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Slightly shorter than you, went from 398 to 274 in a year. You can do it, 5 years in plenty of time. Just gotta get yourself into it. 

I started small, I found a gym I was comfortable going to and started going twice a week. Then 3 times. And I cut out all sugar drinks. Over the course of 5 months, I trimmed out deep fried food, and brought my calories a day down to about 1850.

In June I transitioned into doing low carb. Eventually I increased my gym visits to 5 times a week. The most important lesson that I can convey is that don't try to do it all at once. If you do, you are likely to burn yourself out. Find rules you can live in now that get you started, then change them as you get comfortable. And remember that it's going to be 90 percent food and 10 percent exercise. Fitness helps strengthen your body and make it run better. But it can't make up for really bad eating habits.  

If you have any questions, feel free to hit me up. I love to help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha yup. I was 30 when I started, too. I had deluded myself into thinking I would be done by end of year. It's almost never as fast as you think it will be. But, as you say, 30 years of debauchery traded to 2 years of self repair isn't a bad trade.

So far, I have gone from a tight size 60 waist pants to a loose 48 - 50. And shirts from 5x to 3x. Most of my size progress has been since June. So now I am hoping XL by the end of the year.

If you need to chat, or have questions, you can always shoot me a PM. US soon to be former fatties have gotta stick together! </TEXT>
