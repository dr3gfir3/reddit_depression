	<TEXT> Well, when folks want to play pokemon go or some other intensive power consuming app, they won't be able to keep the phone powered while using headphones. At all.

Not even attempting to find a solution to that problem is a complete fuckup. Had they found an easy solution and bundled it with the phone I don't think there would be anywhere near as big an outcry as there is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I helped organise the 40 man raids in Vanilla WoW for a semi top tier Horde guild on our server (EU Bloodscalp) and while there were some *incredible* moments, it was painful too.

I mean, trying to organise and keep that many people focused for 4-5 hours a time is almost impossible. Back then as well I feel that the bog standard difficulty was kinda in between heroic/mythic (at least it feels like it today), you're tanks would need very specific gear, which would tank several weeks to acquire for one of them.

Trying to organise (IIRC) 8 groups on the Core Hound Packs before fighting Magmadar (again IIRC, its been a while), was incredibly difficult, but the first time we beat them and then took Magmadar down after like 2 tries was amazing and way up there with my fondest mmo memories.

But basically, the more difficult it is, the better the payoff afterwards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's certainly been the least problematic, but I honestly believe that is largely down to the fact that Blizzard flat refused to merge servers and have cross realm phasing now. So, if WoW is at 50% of its peak subscriber base now and they still have all the server infastructure in place to cope with the numbers at their peak, and they also basically have the means to instantly load people to any server they see fit as and when demand dictates, i'm really not surprised. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mained a rogue from vanilla to wotlk because I wanted to do the best DPS. Hell, the game manual said in it that Rogues were undisputed kings of DPS. Then they actually re-wrote the class description from that when Rogue were caught up by mages and other classes. Why take a Rogue when you could take a Warrior who is also melee DPS in two of its three specs, and will also absorb less damage?

But again to argue your point, why would they then give hunters a melee spec???

Thanks for a proper response though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I think it's pretty easy to say that people are enjoying the new Outlaw spec for rogues, but IMHO the other two specs still feel pretty similar to each other. 

What would people say about dropping the assassination spec and replacing it with a 'Gunslinger' spec, giving Rogues a ranged spec, and basically doing for hunters what Survival has done for them?

There isn't anything really resembling an old west kind of characterisation in Warcraft anyway so it may be against the lore or something, but I think it'd be a pleasant change for Rogues.  </TEXT>

-Trailer Reaction Videos
-Sponsored Lets Play
-Twitch Streaming
-Creating Board Games
-Convention appearances
-Angry Video Game Reviews
-Angry Movie Reviews
-Crossover videos

This is alongside all of the things normal people like to do. Frankly I'm amazed he puts out as many videos as he does. 

Yes I would love for there to be an Angry Video Game Review once or twice a week, but these obviously take A LOT more time, thought and resources to put together than a movie review consisting of three guys sitting facing a camera and discussing what they did and didn't like about it. People shat on him when he did the rapid fire reviews which aside from him being on camera is essentially the same thing as the movie reviews, which to be honest were fine. We'd still have gotten the angry reviews on the bigger titles.  

I'd rather have 8 reviews per month where he gives his thoughts and jokes on a game than one a month where we get to see him play dress up.  </TEXT>

After that, I would love to see Jaina take on Sylvanas after the legion is dealt with and then possibly see Thrall leave his Shaman brothers and return to lead the horde once again in an effort to limit the bloodshed between the two factions. George RR Martin has always said that the most interesting writing is when the heart is in conflict with itself, and seeing both of these characters lead factions that are warring against each other and being unable to stop it would be pretty cool to see.  </TEXT>

I have the soundtrack on .mp3 and in sounds fine when playing it in iTunes or playing a video of it via YouTube, but the vocal part just seems to be missing when actually in the game.

	<TEXT> I thought about this before. I'd like for there to be a set of poses/emotes for each zone dependant of class.

For instance, if you left a Druid in Ungoro Crater, when you logged in you'd see them tending to some of the plantlife there. While if you selected a hunter who was logged there, they could be shown stalking a dinosaur.

You could have a Rogue logged at Stranglethorn where the login screen would be your character in the tavern at Booty Bay flipping a heathstone board and pulling a pistol on their opponent.

There are loads of possibilities like this, but I don't see Blizz putting in the time to implement this when there isn't really going to be any financial gain from it. I've never heard anyone say "I'm not subbing to that game, have you seen how bad the login screen is?!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mission 4 is probably the true start of the game where you have a decent selection of tools and the game throws the majority of its problems at you for you to tackle. 

In any case, the best piece of advice I can give you is not to use the same sort of tool or method to get around the alien all the time. There is only one of them and he learns fast and will soon ignore them and come look to see where that flare was thrown from etc. 

If you're really stuck, aliens don't like fire and a well placed Molotov can really save you're skin. 

You might find like I did that the working joes are a bigger problem. Emps work wonders on them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a fat kid, I can tell you now, do not under any circumstances MAKE him go training. He will hate the whole time he is there, and resent it and when it comes to lifting, as you will probably know, trying to lift weights when you aren't trying very hard is a pretty pointless and possibly dangerous thing to do. 

I didn't start training until I was 30, and by that point 157kg (350lbs approx). Do you want to know what got me interested in training? Arnold Schwarzeneggers life story, Total Recall (an awesome read for anyone tbh). Reading that book and his determination, what he did to get where he was (he was a millionaire way before he started movies), was all started by his lifting. That was the catalyst that got me in there. 

The next part was keeping me in there, which was taking my iPad, buying a tv series or game I could play, and then watch said series, or play the game when I was on the reclined bike or some other machine. I went three days a week, and kept pushing until 45 minutes of the walking dead had finished. It was hard for like a month, and sooner or later Id continue cycling or on the vario for another 15-20 mins before finishing. Then it became a chore to watch something while working out. A month after that I was in the studio, doing classes, and a month after that I would go in the gym early in the morning to use the studio on my own and put my own circuits together. 

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, if he was anything like me the very idea of going to the gym was a pain in the ass. It was the thought of me spending time in the gym when I could be gaming (even at 30 years old) if I'm honest was the biggest turn off. Fix that, and you stand a shot and may fix your sons motivation. Ask him to train with you sure, but ultimately if you want him to enjoy it, he needs to *want* to be there.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played a Summoner in FFxIV, is hardly say it was boring, having the ability to farm several mobs at once while soloing, or ensuring that you're dots are up on every pack mob is pretty fun. 

I did try DRK too which was fun for a while but seems pretty basic. I feel however that the recent Legion changes to classes has made them feel very, very similar for FFXIV.  </TEXT>

Twice the game has been released and rereleased, and both times I've been less than impressed with it, so I can't say I'm that bothered about it being redone a third time.   </TEXT>

So you can gamble until you find something good, go on the shop and pay real money for something, sell it on the market place, then buy your gear from the vendor. 

Seems like you can buy end game gear to me. Not to mention the energy tonics that replenish your energy instantly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The game was always marketed as B2P with a small cash shop with nothing P2W in it, and that as it was a B2P game it would never get P2W features. Since launch:

- The starting cash shop items give pretty large advantages over people who don't spend. Particularly the pets and ghille suit.

- More items were added to it later increasing this disparity.

- The creators/publishers of the game added an NPC that sells end game gear for ingame silver.

- The most recent change means that people can now buy cash shop items and then sell them on the marketplace for ingame silver, meaning anyone prepared to drop a couple of hundred bucks can get endgame gear really quick making a B2P game have a very P2W cash shop.

Nearly everyone I know who was playing has left the game in the last few weeks and many of them have asked their card suppliers for charge backs or raised payment disputes with Pay Pal claiming false advertising, which to be honest I can kinda agree with.

People are leaving this game in droves, and I believe it'll go F2P within the next couple of months. </TEXT>

I'll let you know if I find any more.

EDIT:

Seems it was a promotion he did in 2009 where over a weekend he put forward for screening and discussion a bunch of films. I'm kicking myself that I missed it all:

I literally yesterday was discussing with my wife how awesome it would be if each year Sky Movies had a weekly film slot dedicated to a famous actor/director/writer discussing a favourite movie, giving it their critique and then screening it. She asked who I would most want to do that, and I said QT.

Like him or not, his knowledge and love of film is unparalleled and I'd love to hear his thoughts on many movies, even those that i'm not a particular fan of, just because he has the power to change my perception of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, if I understand it correctly:

Imagine you have 16 cookie jars, each with a different flavour cookie, but without knowing what flavour is in each.

This tech basically allows you to have your hand in each cookie jar at the same time, and once you try one cookie, you'll know whats in another jar. So, what traditionally would have taken a minute or so to find out what all the cookies tasted like, now you could find out in a fraction of the time, all without making your hand move faster.

	<TEXT> Legitimate ways, selling EPP mods is IMHO the largest single hit income, but as others have said the most reliable way is farming, or looting and selling weapons etc. Farming and cooking is by far the safest way. I can recommend fish pie which is fairly easy (1 raw fish + 1 mashed potato). With some perseverance you can spawn an npc who sells the fish with a colony deed making it far easier to make the food. 

Illegitimate is another thing entirely, but I'm not sure if I can talk about that without getting banned from the sub. 

Edit: why downvote? Because I know *how* to cheat? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah i'd love to see that also, but I don't see anything on the horizon doing both the source game justice, and being an outstanding movie, unless the game could have been a movie anyway.

For example, people rave that they want a The Last of Us movie, which could work if the story beats could be condensed to make a 10 hour games journey with a pair of characters be as impactful at the end as a 2 hour films journey would be, I just don't see people becoming as attached to the characters over that smaller period of time.

The opposite of that and what I don't see could ever work as a game (**SPOILERS** if you've never played it) would be **Undertale**. It'd be impossible to have the same kind of effect as a film due to it being impossible for a film to react to you and your decisions.

Like you though, Michael Fassbender, Marion Cotillard and Brendan Gleeson all seem to have a knack for picking good projects to work with (or maybe it's just their screen presence!) and I also am quietly confident about Assassins Creed being a very good movie in it's own right. As a *video game* movie though? I'm not so sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Isn't this a film that has video games in it instead of a 'video game movie'?

I feel that's why it worked so well </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When they cast Sean bean, I was certain they'd use the car crash ending, but I have to be honest, I was disappointed they used a mix of the first three games for it instead of go using on the story of each games protagonist. Silent Hill 2's James I feel would translate really well to a movie.  </TEXT>

Wouldn't he (the actor) be like 35 now? The last film was at least a decade ago.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me I can't say I hated it, but I just a found it kinda meh. The whole on rails thing annoyed me more than anything else to be honest. It was the first FF that I haven't finished since 6 though, not even the great soundtrack could save it from being mediocre imho. 

After playing the story in 14 though, I'm pretty sure it's just a blip and am very hopeful for 15.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice video, but I should point out another bit of interesting info about the game and its music is that i'm pretty sure that the music writers were pretty big Loudness fans. Soldier of Fortune is almost identical to Metal Squad
