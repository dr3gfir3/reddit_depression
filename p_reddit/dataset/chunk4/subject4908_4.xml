	<TEXT> Thank you!! And yes, I lost a decent amount of weight recently in hopes that it would improve my self esteem. I'm going to keep working at it though.

And you're right, I don't really associate too much with people like that anymore. But being bullied throughout my entire childhood really affected me a lot, and it still does. 

But I appreciate you taking the time to leave such a kind message! :) </TEXT>
