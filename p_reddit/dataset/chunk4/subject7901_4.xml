	<TEXT> The global capitalist economy suffers chronically from insufficient effective demand, disabling the incentive it needs to mobilize liquidity into active production.  Private demand is insufficient precisely because profit depends as much on cost-cutting as it does on demand. Cost-cutting achieved through increased productivity and efficiency, can grow the real economy.  But as the global reservoir of labor, much of it still outside the capitalist market, gets increasingly pulled into a global wage labor force, competitive pressures pull down labor's share of global income.  In this context, added liquidity produces mainly bubbles.

An economy rooted in the real would recognize the demand that the future must exert on the present, in order for us to have a future.  Multi-trillions of dollars of investment are needed if we are to survive, and live decently, within the planet's natural limits.  Recognizing the validity of this demand, and allowing it to direct resource allocation, is the fundamental task of a new political economy. 

What Metcalfe gets right is the need to finance projects that move us towards global sustainability. But the scope of his proposal must be recognized as just a start.  

Metcalfe says:         

 They [SDRs] could, for example, be used to buy bonds issued by the UN's Green Climate Fund. This was a fund created in 2009, following that climate agreement in Copenhagen. And it was designed to channel funds towards developing countries to meet their climate projects. It's been one of the most successful funds of its type, raising almost 10 billion dollars. But if we use those extra SDRs that were issued, it helps governments get back on track, to meet that promise of 100 billion dollars a year that was derailed by the financial crisis. 

But the Green Climate Fund cannot, with any credibility, issue bonds for projects unless those projects can ultimately repay their loans.  While some projects may need only a little help to be profitable, much of the transformation we need are public goods (like extreme weather resiliency measures) which cannot be expected to achieve positive market returns on investment. Putting a price on carbon would help even the playing field for renewable energy, but that, too, is only a part of what must be done. 

Adaptation to climate change, and mitigation of its causes (GHG emissions) must also be integrated into a larger vision moving us towards a sustainable global economy.  

Metcalfe raises the fear of unconstrained money creation:

 Once you break down and dismantle the idea that money is a finite resource, governments can quickly get overwhelmed by demands from their people to print more and more money for other causes: education, health care, welfare -- even defense.  

Yes, we must all live within real limits.  The revenues from a carbon tax could provide a major portion of the funding needed for the great transition. We must acknowledge, however, that even this would not be enough to save the planet. 

But I must believe that people are capable of recognizing the dire conditions we face with respect to the climate. Living within constraints, even real sacrifices, becomes possible if there is justice, a real safety net, and solidarity. The mobilization for World War II comes to mind.  (The Republican Party in the US is an outlier in denying climate reality.  But defeating that mindset is only the first step towards accepting, and ultimately embracing, what the future requires of us.)

Only when we are working with broad agreement about what must be done can we allocate scarce resources effectively, while minimizing our regrets.  

We must build a vision that a sustainable future is possible to achieve, and worth fighting for.  With that in mind, money must be directed now into projects which can show us how that future can work. 

Such investment should be in the form of grants, not loans.

Metcalfe shows us the way:

 And just to think what amazing things could be done with that money, consider this: in 2009, Norway promised one billion dollars of its reserves to Brazil if they followed through on their goals on deforestation. That program has since delivered a 70 percent reduction in deforestation in the past decade. That's saving 3.2 billion tons of carbon dioxide emissions, which is the equivalent of taking all American cars off the roads for three whole years. So what could we do with 300 other pay-for-performance climate projects like that, organized on a global scale? We could take cars off the roads for a generation.

	<TEXT> In this century we're in a climate crisis.  It has already begun. If we do not recognize and respond to that emerging reality, we will descend into a war of all against all.  It is the existential question of our lives.

Syrian refugees are the lead wave of the coming tide of climate refugees.  

Climate change and the loss of habitability in the Middle East is a primary cause for states to fail, descending into conflict, and an independent force pushing refugees to flee the region.  None of the actors will survive an unmitigated climate disaster. See: [intolerable heat may hit the middle east](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/27/science/intolerable-heat-may-hit-the-middle-east-by-the-end-of-the-century.html), [extreme heatwaves could push gulf climate beyond human endurance](http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/26/extreme-heatwaves-could-push-gulf-climate-beyond-human-endurance-study-shows), and [Future temperature in southwest Asia projected to exceed a threshold for human adaptability](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n2/full/nclimate2833.html).

Both water shortage and sea level rise are other aspects of climate change which threaten long term habitability in the region.

If we are to avert a migration disaster, we must start by finding a resolution for the Syrian bloodbath. Finding a way to make Syria livable would demonstrate what must be done over the course of this century.  Failure now prefigures a devastating future. 

The current ceasefire in Syria is a frail effort at de-escalating the conflict.  Cooling the violence is a precondition for negotiations to begin.  But for negotiations to be fruitful, they must envision a future set of conditions in which current constituencies must come to terms with each other.  They will need to modify what they each hope to obtain in the light of challenges which are not solely political.  They will have to recognize that they need each other in order to counter a greater threat. 

Responses designed to allow Syrians, Iraqis, and others in the region to live in their historic homelands provide an alternative vision that has a chance of addressing an unfolding catastrophe, while resolving civil conflict and stanching the flow of refugees.  Any program for sustainability will have to be funded. The U.S. and Europe, as well as the wealthy oil producing states, must all contribute to such an effort.   

If ISIS and al Qaeda remain at war with everyone else, they cannot be a part of any resolution.  But while their domain of control can be reduced, contained and isolated, they cannot be crushed by force.   

The blowback from collateral damage is greater than any military objective achieved by armed intervention.  The problem lies not with the US military, but with the mission, which cannot be accomplished in the real world at an acceptable cost.  The result of a misguided policy based on cheap victories by drone and bomb is that the perpetrators (not only the U.S., but also the Russians and the Saudis) lie, denying their murder of innocents.  Such lies destroy the trustworthiness of the liar.  Their impact is to strengthen the enemy even more than the initial crimes do.  In the eyes of those who identify with those wrongly attacked, we become the terrorists. 

Violent fundamentalism will spread as long as the conditions that generate it prevail.   Poverty, corruption, and subjugation are the conditions which potentiate violent reaction.  The basic source of attraction for fundamentalism is its totalitarian rejection of an unjust, unresponsive and failing old order.   On the other side, an open society is not possible without social order.  If social order is to survive, it must be reformed to address peoples aspirations and needs. 

Climate change is already occurring and will intensify into the future fueled by past greenhouse gas emissions.  We must stop adding to the fuel.  But there is also an enormous agenda of work to do for communities and society to survive the climate change we cannot prevent.   Fundamentalism has no answers for this.  It can only derange the complex order we must have to effectively respond to the challenge. We need everyone to work towards an inclusive future.  Starting in the Middle East, we must take immediate action that will prepare and employ people for the demands of this century.  We need new ways that are different from what any of us have known -- relations between people and with nature which must be determined by people in their own communities in their own way.

Climate change will, in this century, create hundreds of millions of refugees who will be dispossessed both directly and covertly.  It was the multi-year drought that set up for the failure of the Syrian state.  

Communities must be supported to evolve under conditions of change, rather than become atomized and dispersed.  But, where large numbers of people have to relocate, the difficulties of transplantation must be acknowledged.  Only Pope Francis gets close to the proper dimensions of the human issues at stake.

In a world without vision, it seems only the most shortsighted self-interest motivates action. But there is a long-term price to pay.  Order cannot be maintained against a rising tide of sorrow. Ever-growing Disorder will consume us, state by state. Turkey and Lebanon are already at a breaking point.  Jordan is close. And then there is Greece.   

We can decide that we are incapable of facing a menacing problem.  Trump and the new German Nationalist party, the AfD [Alternative fr Deutschland], will succeed when we deny our common humanity.

Or we can mobilize for a global response. If we are to take climate change seriously, we must expect large-scale displacement of populations in this century because we can't reverse the damage fast enough to protect large parts of our human habitat. We will have to build a global economy on a sustainable basis if we are to survive.  

That task must start now, with today's dispossessed. How can they be integrated into a more just and sustainable future?   Current policies will not get us to where we need to go. The answer starts as a moral-political stance. It is a choice of what's worth fighting for, and taking the first step forward.  America, recognizing itself as the homeland of refugees, must continue to live her proud heritage.  She must lead by example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As usual, Trump is strong on naming what's wrong.  It doesn't take a genius to call out the shambles.  Interventionism always costs more than any of its champions ever imagined, and unleashes consequences well beyond their imagination.  

But America First is nostalgia not vision.  We're 5% of the world, using 25% of the world's resources.  The cost of defending that inequality is a military stance that keeps the dollar king.  In the grand imperial design, we have the money, they make the goods. Our economic "strength" is as Consumer for the world's output.    That's so 20th Century.  It can't last, and Trump offers no alternative vision.

	<TEXT> A moral economy is one which serves human needs and keeps the planet livable.  Capital accumulation as an end in itself has some fatal flaws.  It grows by ever-expanding debt, on the assumption of limitless growth, that will always be large enough to repay past debts, to keep the whole game credible.  But that's no longer working.  Instead, we get bubbles and busts.  Real wealth has stagnated.  What to do? Assume that global warming is real, and very threatening.  It does not present market signals that promote survival.  What's needed is a global-political re-orientation to direct resources for a sustainable future.  For that future to be worth living in, it must involve people in decision-making, and as much local control as possible.  That's where all this must go, or we can just give up the fight.  Bernie and Francis and betting that humans will fight to survive.  And that fight must be cooperative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 "worked" if you don't count the multi-generational continuing collateral damage to communities of color, and to the fabric of American society.  Yes, violent crime had to be addressed. But Bill (and Hillary's) solution was only repression and retribution.  The economic choices that were needed for sustainable growth were not in their play book.  That's because they chose to rely on an expanding financial sector, and lowering real wages.  Their "realism" told them that "What's good for Wall Street is good for the country."  And then the bubble burst.  America's hollowed economy has not recovered.  It is producing only precarious low-wage life prospects. The circle  outside the comfort zone only widens.  Bill and Hillary believe we must still depend on the way things get done by Wall Street.  But that hasn't worked for most people. The question is: can we find other drivers to build an economy that meets real needs, employs people to do productive work, and gives people reason to hope for a better life, like we did 80 years ago in the New Deal?  Hillary will never ask that question.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bernie Sanders follows the long and honorable American political tradition called "sewer socialism". It's not very romantic. It starts with being open to noticing real problems that people have, and finding workable solutions. I was afraid that that part of American history -- the spirit of public service that made this country work -- had been lost forever. But it hasn't. Maybe we're getting past being demobilized by cynicism. According to Wikipedia: In 1961, Progressive editor William Evjue wrote of the Wisconsin Socialist legislators he had known, "They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men. They were incorruptible." </TEXT>

Together with the large base of support for Bernie Sanders, there is clearly an anti-establishment majority in this country that is no longer silent.  To keep their power intact, those who have ruled us have only one option left: keep that majority divided against itself, let them destroy each other.  Whoever is elected, a new politics is needed, based on people talking together and organizing themselves locally against our joint enemy: concentrated wealth using the power of the state to convert public need into private profit.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Randa Kassis, representing a Moscow-backed opposition group, said de Mistura would distribute a document of common points gathered from the various delegates.
Points included creating a future unified Syrian army to fight terrorism or ensuring a democratic and non-sectarian based Syria.
"We're waiting for a U.S.-Russian accord to solve the (key) issue once and for all. Until they resolve it this process will drag on," Kassis told Reuters.

Who knew that there is "a Moscow-backed opposition group" and that it is waiting for the U.S. and Russia to make a deal, and then each lay down the line to their respective clients, Assad and the HNC?  That still leaves Iran/Hezbollah and Saudi Arabia to tire of this conflict.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bernie Sanders follows the long and honorable American political tradition called "sewer socialism". It's not very romantic. It starts with being open to noticing real problems that people have, and finding workable solutions. I was afraid that that part of American history -- the spirit of public service that made this country work -- had been lost forever. But it hasn't. Maybe we're getting past being demobilized by cynicism.
According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewer_Socialism): In 1961, Progressive editor William Evjue wrote of the Wisconsin Socialist legislators he had known, "They never were approached by the lobbyists, because the lobbyists knew it was not possible to influence these men. They were incorruptible." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a plan to kick the refugees down the road.  What will really happen to these people?  That's not the issue.  Make Them Go Away is the operating principle.   In a world without vision, it seems only the most shortsighted self-interest motivates action.  But there is a long term price to pay.  Increasingly desperate people are fleeing disintegrating states and economies.  Blindness to their plight is a decision to let them suffer and die.  But Order cannot be maintained against a rising tide of sorrow. Ever-growing Disorder will consume us, state by state. Turkey and Lebanon are already at a breaking point. 

We can decide that we are incapable of facing a menacing problem.  Or we can mobilize for a global response.  If we are to take climate change seriously, we must expect large-scale displacement of populations in this century because we can't reverse the damage fast enough to protect large parts of our human habitat.  We will have to build a global economy on a sustainable basis if we are to survive.  That task must start now, with today's dispossessed.  How can they be integrated into a more just and sustainable future?  All I know is that The Old Order will not get us to where we need to go. The answer to the existential question starts as a moral-political stance.  It is a choice of what's worth fighting for, and taking the first step forward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Russell Moore is president of the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. Richard Stearns is president of World Vision U.S. Together they are supporting the #prayforrefugees campaign.

 As evangelical leaders in the U.S., we are concerned about the growing hostility toward refugees. Thats why we are calling on Christians of all stripes to do the one thing that has the power to change this dynamic: pray. ... Prayer has been ridiculed of late as an ineffectual response to tragedy and urgent physical needs. We disagree. Action that leads to systemic change starts with prayer. </TEXT>

Even technological defenses can be bested. Laser trip wires and night-vision cameras are defeated by dense ocean fog near Imperial Beach. Seismic sensors buried in the ground are defeated by movement that doesn't pound or shake, but rolls - like bicycles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Long-term, coal is a risky investment if the world really takes climate change seriously enough to reduce global carbon emissions, through regulation, carbon pricing, and continued clean energy innovation.
Short-term, it is even riskier, because Saudi Arabia stopped supporting the world energy market, when it ceased its post-1973 OPEC cartel policy of withholding production.  Now its own cheap supply of oil is flooding the market.  After the OPEC collapse, there is a temporary overhang in supply that has cut all energy prices, so that even coal is a loser. 
While much of the newly developed supplies, like Bakken shale oil, can't pay back their cost of investment, they're still producing at developed sites, until they're pumped or fracked out.
So that leaves coal without a business plan, except for the belief that the old days will return, and Coal will again be King.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The documentation of war crimes from all sides should be thought of as a kind of "site preparation" necessary prior to reconstructing the rule of law in Syria and the whole region.  Those who are responsible for crimes against humanity have lost their legitimacy to rule over others.  Yet we have to start with the world we have.  There is no outside savior who can impose good governance.  
But if public outrage against these crimes can be maintained over time, domestically and worldwide, the perpetrators can be pushed aside.  That is what happened in Latin America over the course of a generation.  Commitment to human rights may be a slow path, but, there is no alternative, no matter how much we would like there to be.  So far, every quick fix has failed.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody is FOR illegal immigration, including Bernie Sanders.  See his plan: https://berniesanders.com/issues/a-fair-and-humane-immigration-policy/
The question about immigration is how to manage it.  The construction of a sustainable American economy in this century will require more people working hard, not fewer.  Immigrants are a necessary part of the mix.   Welcoming people we need means that we must treat everyone with respect, and expect that they will do what immigrants have always done -- taken onto themselves most of the burden of adjustment.  Protecting immigrant workers as fellow workers is the best way to assure that they do not undercut wages and working conditions.  When the American economy was strong, workers were able to organize, and their unions, protected by a friendly government, were able to win decent labor conditions.  The American standard of living topped off in the early '70s, when labor unions were strong, and have been eroding ever since.  Inclusion and unity is the only power that most people, who are not wealthy, have to protect themselves.  Divided, we will continue to fail and fall.  In egging on a war within the plundered majority, only Trump wins. </TEXT>

Deb is Indian. He has never been to the Middle East (or India for that matter). And yet, he has repeatedly been singled out at events.
At a rally in December, he tweeted, "A man came up to me to say 'Go back to Iraq!' I've never been!"
And in January, he tweeted, "A Trump supporter just asked me at Reno event if I was taking pictures for ISIS. When I looked shocked, he said, 'yeah, I'm talking to you.'" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My actual name is Bernie, and I have been a very small contributor to Bernie Sanders' campaigns since 1990.  So, I feel entitled to say to my fellow Bernie supporters who attend Trump rallies: Silent Witness is fine (and extremely courageous), but attempting to silence even Fascist speech is always a mistake.  So: NOT IN MY NAME.  Don't give them the excuse they crave to act out.  Both Trump and Sanders supporters have too much in common, as the plundered majority, to be set upon each other as enemies.  We need each other if we are to get free of the agenda imposed by the concentrated power complex -- Wall St. banks, transnational corporations, corrupted government, mainstream media, etc.  We need to learn how to respect each other, to speak to each other, and share our common experiences.  So when Trump supporters come to disrupt Sanders events, our response should not be to exclude them, but to draw them in.  Let's all sing We Shall Overcome, and hope they join.  And if they shout down Bernie, let's repeat his words, phrase by phrase, as we did in Occupy Wall St.'s "mic check".  Then we can all get the message.  If we all stop and think, we will have a chance to act responsibly, effectively.  We'll do more than survive.  We'll win.  </TEXT>

and then there's all that private land that must be seized by eminent domain, and the violation of environmental laws, and the construction of dozens of new roads to connect border wilderness with the rest of the country to permit construction workers and material to get to the construction sites, which will make infiltration into the country dozens of times more costly to police, once the coyotes figure out a way to get people over the top of the wall -- and they will. Vain Glory Thy Name Is Trump.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take a look at the political landscape.  It's in earthquake mode and the old map no longer applies.  Trump's case against Clinton is, unfortunately, compelling.  Over a lifetime in politics she has made herself into the most acceptable face for selling the Wall Street agenda.  But post-2008 the public has caught on that increasing inequality is at their expense.  Romney was more of a representative of the .01% than Obama.  That's why he lost.  Trump is a demagogue wild card.  He could easily win against Hillary.  Bernie has been painfully honest all of his life.  He has no skeletons in the closet.  And he's right on the issues.  Does he have your vote?  If you're convinced, then he'll win the nomination and the Presidency.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The most important fact about Bernie is that he is honest and trustworthy, Mr. Riegle said. Thats an essential differentiator for me.
