	<TEXT> Well if you catch a golden stag or a Hercules beetle you can get 230,400 bells in one trip if you have the wealthy ordinance on as well. And it takes only about 5-10 minutes to get that much depending how fast you get past the walls. 

I see this glitch as a way to get some quick cash in order to have some money to invest in things like turnips or other huge money making activities.  Also you can do this offline and by yourself if you don't have a wireless connection.

 I don't really know if this could mess up your save but it hasn't done anything so far to me, but i can understand if people are scared of losing everything for quick bells. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If your character runs into any holes while your under the map it will be like you hit a pitfall and you will appear above the map where the hole was, found that out the hard way lol I guess it's safer than saving but I just find it faster to save and continue  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just keep running around until they spawn, that's what I do anyways 
*edit* also make sure the time is set at night after 9 so that the stags have a better chance at appearing. </TEXT>

So I was stalking Dan Lee's friend's videos and I found him being incredibly awkward at an iJustine meet and greet. He's obviously a very nervous man in real life I don't know why people keep trying to convince themselves he's an actor. Dan pops up when the vlogger meets iJustine. </TEXT>
