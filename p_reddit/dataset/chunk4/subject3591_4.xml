	<TEXT> Seems odd someone wouldn't like the top cut off of an onion. Or the rest of it for that matter. Beans, potato, carrot, ginger, other stuff comes out of the ground. Leeks, garlic, etc. But you don't like onion. Or peppers. Peppers are a fruit, and your favorite pizza has pineapple. I just don't get the onion hate. Cilantro, I can understand although I'm not affected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> On a bus, there's a 5x5" plastic plate with grooves in it to form an x pattern from corner to corner. The legend says that to open door, smash plate and turn handle in emergency. About ten years ago the cost of the plastic plate went from $5 to $130. There had to be a lawsuit. To be fair, if you weren't careful pulling your hand back out of that in an emergency it would probably tear you up pretty good from the four points in the center. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like you're using "country-style" ribs. It's a really tough cut of porcine goodness. I don't think there's any way to get that tender on a grill, low and slow in the oven maybe, but a grill is going to be difficult. So anyway, it's NOT YOUR FAULT! Edit: this cut contains multiple muscles some of which you can get to tender and tasty, and the loin portion is always a big fail for me that needs buckets of gravy or bbq sauce. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like it. I don't see how this can fail, I've had thin potato on pizza and it was good. This has nothing to do with that, but in the pizza continuum, I don't see why people wouldn't love this. I would. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you may need to sharpen your knife a bit, can you imagine what Katy Perry would look like with that big piece of parsley across her lower teeths? I'm sure it would taste just the same though, good job! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Huh, I'm going to have to have my eyes checked because Coors cans are smaller diameter than pop or bud cans and that's what I was going by. I hope it's just an eye infection or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had to look at the picture again. Wait, I'm still unsure. So the beef goes around the beer can and the stuffing is inside. What keeps the stuffing from falling into the fire? Oh, you have the BGE, and are using a grill? Not a wire grill, got it. (is that right?)  Looking really yummy with all of those flavors. I'd sub Hatch green chile though for the green pepper. </TEXT>
