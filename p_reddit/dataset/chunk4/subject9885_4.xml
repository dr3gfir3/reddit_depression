	<TEXT> Depends on whose life we're talking about - shelter and food have a huge impact for those who don't have regular access to them. Time saving devices that free up women in particular from house hold chores - washing machines, dishwashers probably had a pretty big impact too  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eurgh I still cringe thinking about a teacher in primary school who would do this really excessively while handing out papers - he'd also put his pen in his ear all the time.. Gross </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [here's](https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/jun/07/addiction-not-disease-science-stigma?client=safari) an interesting article about the disease vs. Non disease models of understanding addiction - my personal opinion is that disease isn't quite the right term for addiction but neither is thinking of it just as part of someone's character and them choosing my to quit. Maybe something like a mental illness as a result of trauma/ circumstances? </TEXT>
