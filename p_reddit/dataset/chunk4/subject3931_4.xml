	<TEXT> OK, yeah. DQ1 is a rare example where winning is pretty much impossible without grinding, though maybe speedrunners have found some tricky glitchy way to do it. And DQ2 doesn't require grinding so much as there are bullshit enemies near the end that can kill you in one hit no matter what your level is. Beginning with DQ3, there is no grinding necessary. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For different reasons, I've never really played the original Metroid. One of the bigger reasons is what little I did play seemed very copy-and-paste, like all these huge vertical corridors with nothing interesting in them.

So I'm playing this Super Metroid hack called Retroid which pretties up NES Metroid and gives it a map system, while also taking away stuff like wall jump to make sure it's as accurate as possible. I've played now for half an hour, actually got bombs and hi-jump this time instead of giving up out of boredom and.. my suspicion seems to be correct. This game is boring as fuck.

And I don't get it. Why? It's not like Nintendo couldn't handle non-linear gaming back then. The only thing outdated really about the first Zelda is the graphics, the game design is still top notch. Metroid NES feels so simple that it's a wonder enough people bought it to get a sequel. </TEXT>

Does this mean they film both seasons back to back, or do they still take a break until next time just as if there had been only one season ordered? Or is this perhaps something that varies from production to production? </TEXT>

For me, Hard-Boiled Wonderland is easily the best of the three novels of the three Murakami novels I've read. The first few pages in particular are brilliant because they seemed to me like a cute tangent that didn't have anything to do with the plot despite being well-written - but in the end, it was excellent foreshadowing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is after so many fake deaths of Clara since her introduction, she did not deserve "closure." She died and came back to life so many times that I wanted her to stay dead. Last Christmas could have been a fitting end, yet they brought her back once again. And then with Hell Bent, not only did they revive her - *again* - but they imply she is going to live forever traveling the universe with Me in her own goddamned TARDIS. 

I know you can say this is a children's/family show and letting her die would be depressing, but the fact that her death has essentially no negative repercussions (because honestly, what are the chances she will go back to her "proper death") makes me so mad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now I'm the type who enjoys literature with a capital L just as much as genre fiction, however almost every time I pick up a book that's received the Booker or Pulitzer, I'm bored out of my mind. It's the dry writing more than anything, which makes me wonder if these committes and judges choose the winners based more on the culturally aware subject matter more than the writing itself.

Assuming that is true, I'd say that's an odd practice for a prize that you'd think would value the writing as much as everything else. Can anyone provide some insight into how these books are selected? I guess there is also the possibility it's something as simple as hype and expectation, where my mind is convinced a book that has won an award must be good, and then I'm let down when it's "just another book' instead of some total revelation. </TEXT>

Still not tried Undertale. It's one of those things where I know it's probably good, but because it's popular I wonder to myself "Is the hype justified?" I did this with Breaking Bad where I wouldn't watch it for the longest time, then I saw it and loved it. So I know I'll eventually give Undertale a chance.. just right now I'm wondering if it can really deserve the following or not.

Despite how small it is, the place FEELS like it takes forever. You've got a boss in Phantoon who takes a while to kill, made worse by the fact he's pretty easy. The top floor that leads to an energy tank and the Gravity Suit is a long corridor that requires you to kill all the enemies within it twice, for no apparent reason. Then there's the chozo statue that takes foreeeever to walk down the stairs to the Gravity Suit itself.

I'd say its only highlight is the creepy music, which isn't enough on its own to save the annoying level design. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not the type to over-analyze the shit out of everything in a TV series, but surely the opening credits of a drama are meant to convey *something*. So I'm curious what people who have watched this show much longer than me (only on season 2) think about them.

To me, something mundane like driving around the city for all the credits and then pulling into his driveway, seems to symbolize how you don't know who a mobster is in your own life, that it could be your next door neighbor for all you know, that they're hidden in plain sight. Because you think most shows like this would highlight the mob part, but The Sopranos chooses not to do that. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Visual triggers are fool-proof. They work on any camera, as far as I've ever seen. 

Sound triggers, on the other hand, rely on having a better microphone. Whether it's Rode, Tascam, 3Dio, etc - you can't (or at least I can't) get triggered by a microphone that lacks binaural setup. 

It's admirable that these creators WANT to give you tingles, but it's just not good enough on crappy microphones that don't have a surround sound quality. Focusing on visual triggers would really play to their strengths instead of making me wish they had a better microphone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's been a decade and my tastes have changed. Not to mention, these days it's rare that I listen to anything featuring a guitar. I'm not saying I won't jump at the chance to listen to a new Tool album if such a thing ever materializes, but it's not something that I'm dying to hear. I'm just gonna say "Oh, cool. Guess I'll finally get to hear it."

The follow-up to 10,000 Days is a missed opportunity and I have to wonder how many other people have kinda "moved on" from the hype. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently, I tried to re-read The Westing Game because I remember I loved this book as a kid, particularly the word play.

And while that word play is indeed clever, I'd never realized this has such a messy beginning. There are around ten characters introduced in the first few chapters, all briefly mentioned and then bouncing off like an A.D.D. rabbit to the next one. 

This kind of thing is typically exhausting for me and I'm curious to hear what the rest of /r/books thinks about it. Do you like a lot of characters being introduced at the beginning of a book? Is it acceptable to have a large cast if they're introduced slowly or do you still prefer a smaller and intimate group of heroes and heroines? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After trying out some less than savory methods to obtain ebooks, I give up. It's not worth the hassle to use calibre and make sure they've got good formatting. 

The only reason I decided to go that route is my small town local library's OverDrive isn't all that great. I've heard bigger cities have much better ones, and after searching a bit in Brooklyn's, they do seem to have 90% of what I want compared to my own library which has like 5% of it. 

So I'm willing to pay the $50/year fee just for the convenience, honestly. But what's the process like, for anyone who's done it? Are there any special requirements? How long until I get my card? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thinking about giving Kindle Paperwhite a second chance - any help on finding GOOD books? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-10 22:53:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got one a few years ago, after hating the idea of ebooks for a long time. Turns out I was wrong, I loved reading on it and didn't see a need for paperbacks anymore. Well, that would have been the case... if I could find good books that weren't so expensive compared to paperbacks. So I returned the thing and went back to buying used books.

The problem, from what I remember, is those sites that email you deals and sales never recommend anything GOOD. I'm a bit of a snob who's into the classics like Faulkner and Woolf, then there's modern stuff like Gaiman and Stephenson, then stuff like Murakami, George Saunders, Jose Saramago, etc - stuff that is never on sale like that.

My best option seems to be finding a really good library that would have these - for example, I've heard the Greater Phoenix and Los Angeles libraries singled out by name as large ebook libraries that are worth the $50/year (assuming you don't live there.) Other than that, do these types of books ever go on sale?

Bonus Question: You can subscribe to stuff like newsletters and magazines and send them directly to your Kindle, right? I really like the idea of a periodical like this. Do they have good formatting or is the screen size small and awkward for what is typically a bigger magazine?

Bonus Question 2: has the formatting improved over the past few years? My one real complaint about the Paperwhite (other than the high price of books I'd actually want to read), is that there was a lot of    spacing    out     of       words instead of using hyphens. It looked so tacky and distracted me from reading. </TEXT>

Any first person shooter I've ever played, on the other hand, is much more about aim and map awareness. You can't cheese your way through those games: either you can play them or you cannot. </TEXT>

That got me thinking a bit about Starcraft, where I'm still on the Starter Edition. I took to Google and apparently there aren't two separate queues for Starcraft, it's just that if you queue for ranked your rating can go up or down. So an unranked player can go up against a ranked player, is this true? I assume the game still tries to match skill levels despite this?

I'd say Cameron and Bosworth are actually the least bizarre characters in the show right now.

Is this a problem that persists in season two? Does the show ever learn what subtlety is? I really want to like this show, but it's a little bit over-the-top for what it is. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing the game for about a month now. Support characters have always been my "thing" in video games, and having played TF2 in the past, naturally Mercy appealed to me because of her resemblance to the Medic. 

But after playing with Zenyatta over the past week, I'm not really sure why I'd choose Mercy. Right now, it's looking like the only thing she can do is the fun as hell Guardian Angel ability. 

Her right-click damage boost doesn't seem to do much, whether because my teammates refuse to shoot the enemy or because they DO shoot the enemy and you can barely tell a difference. Orb of Discord seems like a simply better version of this.

Then you've got her heal, where she can't fight back without breaking off the heal. Meanwhile, both of Zenyatta's orbs allow him to attack. 

Yeah, she's got the useful Resurrection ult... but other than that, I'm not seeing why you'd choose her over Zenyatta. He can heal, increase damage an enemy takes, AND attack, all three at the same time. Mercy can only ever do one of those at a time. And it feels like if you *do* ever use her damage boost, that your teammate will surely die because the damage dealers in this game are rather squishy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been playing the game for about a month now. Support characters have always been my "thing" in video games, and having played TF2 in the past, naturally Mercy appealed to me because of her resemblance to the Medic. 

But after playing with Zenyatta over the past week, I'm not really sure why I'd choose Mercy. Right now, it's looking like the only thing she can do is the fun as hell Guardian Angel ability. 

Her right-click damage boost doesn't seem to do much, whether because my teammates refuse to shoot the enemy or because they DO shoot the enemy and you can barely tell a difference. Orb of Discord seems like a simply better version of this.

Then you've got her heal, where she can't fight back without breaking off the heal. Meanwhile, both of Zenyatta's orbs allow him to attack. 

Yeah, she's got the useful Resurrection ult... but other than that, I'm not seeing why you'd choose her over Zenyatta. He can heal, increase damage an enemy takes, AND attack, all three at the same time. Mercy can only ever do one of those at a time. And it feels like if you *do* ever use her damage boost, that your teammate will surely die because the damage dealers in this game are rather squishy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This makes no sense. If you manage to destroy her mech, she should drop the flag. There's no logic in that she gets to hop away with it in her mech-less form. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's honestly a little confusing, especially since the colors of the tiles seem to be bugged. Patches of darkness don't seem to have much logic to where they spawn, for example. Should I just turn off color effects to make it less confusing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoyed every bit of it when I watched it a few years ago, however I'm still a bit curious how much of it was true to the manga. For example, was the bit with Arale filler or not?

Or I guess more to the point - can someone link me to a concise list of all the episodes that aren't filler so I can rewatch it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are low health ... you do not keep trying to rush the enemy 1v6. I am honestly not sure what you expect to happen in such a scenario, except for your hilarious death.

Seriously, what is it about this type of game that compels players to do the most insane shit just for a kill, when a logical person would say "Hey.. this is really dangerous." </TEXT>
