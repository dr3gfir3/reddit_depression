I was extremely stressed out from it and thought I had a serious disease, and felt like I was waking up into a nightmare every day.

	<TEXT> Everyone I know thinks Reddit is alt-right and basically a lesser version of 4chan. Based on my experiences, I can't say they're wrong, although I'd say the majority lean to the left of American politics on the whole at least. But it's definitely not an echo chamber in that sense, there are a large amount of right-wingers here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taco Bell is just disgusting. I got one of their quesadillas, it was gross and ended up giving me an allergic reaction. I have no clue why because as far as I'm aware there's nothing I'm allergic to in them. The "cheese" in them tastes more like fake nacho cheese than anything resembling real cheese. Everything I've had there has tasted like literal throw up. </TEXT>
