	<TEXT> I didn't say it to say he's selfless. He's a massive dick. The point is that not all megachurches have salaried pastors. And what do his finances have to do with his brothers and sisters? They didn't write his books. If they're doing a job they deserve their salary. And it honestly isn't anyone but the organization and their donors business what they're paid. 

Yes, I specifically wouldn't want to donate money to some place that gives their  employees an obscene amount. But it's not the governments job to say how much they can pay people. 

In fact a very small church might get in maybe 100k a year from members or less. If they pay their pastor 1/3 of their take its still only 33k a year which while better than min wage isn't nearly what a person with (at least in lutheran circles) a Masters degree could make. 

Heck if they take in less they could be paying 1/2 to the pastor and giving him a 25k a year job for a position that in many churches is 6 days a week and always on call. 


Also for politics, I said if they are taxes they would likely then start giving money to candidates and funding campaigns and such. But again big if. 

That doesn't mean that because they might if they're taxed get political that they are now. I've been to a lot of church services and I can only think of 2 overtly political things that I've heard. 

1 is I've heard Lutheran's pray as. Part of the order of service for the protection of the leaders of their state. Local and federal government's. Which is just what they do in general at basically every Lutheran Church worldwide. 

2, I heard someone preach about how jesus went into Egypt and how it's terribly unchristian to vote for people that want to deport illegals. 

Other than that I don't think I have heard much about any voting ever in a church setting. 

Now, I've talked to pastors about what they think about this politician or that based upon biblical principles. Or if this economic system or that is more Christian. And they've made their beliefs known, but that's their right as a free being. They weren't preaching from the pulpit or anything like that.

	<TEXT> Am I complaining? I don't see where I did that. Im just saying that having a highly stable family will yield better results more often. 


If Warren buffet was born into poverty with an absentee father and abusive mother, he wouldn't have had the same results. 

Just like my grandfather, he had jobs starting at like 6 or 7. And there were definitely other kids with the same breaks as him who didn't have jobs and weren't motivated. So yes, his determination did matter. But while Warren buffet was able to save that money and did it for fun, my grandfather did it because if he didn't he might have to wear worn out shoes with holes in their soles. Or he might not eat. He didn't have the luxury to save his money and even if he did, I doubt anyone that he knew would have been able to tell him how to even buy a stock or bond. 

Or take my kid for example. My son has autism, I get him every service I can. But while celebrities with autistic kids can say, I'm gonna get my son 20 hours of speech therapy a week and just plunk down a check like nothing because they have tons of money. And then worry about the insurance company covering it later.

I have to go thru all the government wait lists, I have to apply for grants, I have to take the services that I can get. 

So you know, maybe my son and Holy Robinson Pete's son had the exact same type of autism. But my son is definitely not going to have the same type of outcome. 

Why because his parents aren't rich, and that other kids parents are. 

Sure, yes, I totally agree, that success does involve the individuals work ethic but some of it is entirely based upon socio economic concerns. 

And even the most motivated dude might not even do anything. So what was he not motivated enough? Did he not try hard enough. No, there's a fair amount of luck that goes into some things. Like the guy that sold his stake in Apple, he had his own personal problems that came up and so it didn't work out.  

All's I'm saying is right now there's probably a junkie with wealthy parents who dropped out of high school who's still getting high and doesn't have any life ambitions that is going to die wealthier than me. That whenever he decides to do something with himself will have funding to do it.

But half the time I'm not even certain that even if a massive opportunity came up I could afford to take it. 

Shoot, I wanted to do some volunteer work in my field during the summer but couldn't do it because I can't afford childcare. That would have helped me tremendously with getting into grad school or just an actual job after having not worked for a few years.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I was going point by point as to what they do that isn't inherently religious that other 501 3c organizations do. 

And many people keep saying that churches should be taxed just like for profit businesses, so I addressed that as well. 

I've no problem with them filing but this idea that they have to justify what they do. 

Like even if a church was just a bunch of people believing in their religion and donating money to continue to do that. It's still an entity that exists 



As for the politicalness, most churches aren't nearly as political as you think. Unless you're considering any mention of any issue that can also be considered a political issue. 

The Bible teaches caring for the sick and infirm. Is telling members to do what they can for the sick and infirm even if it means voting for candidates who help the poor political speech? Is preaching about what the Bible says about homosexuality or taxes political speech? 

What about schools and sports organizations? They too engage in political speech. Schools will invite politicians to speak on campus or ban others based upon their political views? I don't see anyone saying these entities should also lose their tax exempt status. Sure Harvard isn't going around proclaiming vote for X but they definitely do do very political things. And even if the head of the organization doesn't many teachers liberal and conservative do so in their own class rooms.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did I say that he didn't do any work himself? No, I said that having wealthy parents likely helped. 

Also he had a stable home environment. And apparently a grandfather that would employ him. 

Yeah my grandfather worked hard and had all kinds of jobs as a kid. And that's his personality and drive for success. But even with all that hard work, he still didn't have

And he definitely had decent success in his life.

But what about the kid who has to drop out of high school because his brothers and sisters will be homeless if he didn't. 

Sure buffet did all that stuff cuz he wanted to but when my grandfather had a paper route at 12 it wasn't because he just wanted to make money and could save and invest. It's cuz his family wouldn't eat if he didn't. 

Not a lot of room for him to invest in businesses when he has to feed his brothers and sisters. 

Warren buffet was able to invest in stocks and bonds and whatever because he didn't have to worry about feeding anyone else even himself. 

Is it possible that he would have been just as rich had he been born a poor black dude during Jim Crow? Idk maybe. But you can't just say that he had the same hurdles as anyone else. 


Am I doing terrible? No. But meanwhile, I've never been arrested, I have a degree, and I have significant trouble getting even jobs at convenience stores. Maybe I don't interview well, but I bet if my parents owned their own business that I could just work at my finances would be a hell of a lot more secure. 

Shit I have friends who's parent have money who have records but they own houses, they have jobs and more. Why? Because they work at their fathers business. 

Sure I had a few really great opportunities that would have given me a great heads up on my career in publishing. I was offered an unpaid internship at rolling stone. Unfortunately, I couldn't take it because I needed to work to not be homeless. But I guess i wasn't motivated enough. Should have just been homelessness or something.

Not to mention, that now the government is pulling those members information to get their financial information so they can then tell the church how much to pay their employees.

Reading, education, preservation of antiques and more all count. Religious education is still education. And it doesn't have to be an accredited school to count. Unless you're going to say only certain formats of education count. 

Almost every church service involves a reading and education on what that reading means and how to apply it in society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For one applying biblical principles to your life.

It's not like they say, so jesus said render unto ceaser that which is Caesar and unto God that which is God's. 

And then nothing else. 

Depending upon the pastor or preacher.that verse could become a sermon on why taxes are good, why you should pay your debts, why you should get saved, why you shouldn't be rich, I'm sure there's more. 

A sermon on the verse that says there is no Jew or Greek in Christ would inspire all manner of sermons on equality of the races. How to treat immigrants, etc. 

The Bible talks about a lot of moral issues that are relevant to politics and general everyday society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just cuz he is exceptional doesn't mean that a large part of that didn't come from his family being rich. 

If you could clone him as a child and give those kids to two separate families, one with money and one in government housing. It's more likely than not that the one with the wealthy family is going to have better opportunities and be better off in the end. 

For example: I come from a town with alot of rich people. 

I have friends who had similar grades as me in highschool similar sat scores, and things of that nature. On paper we'd be about equal. 

The kids with rich parents are doing well better than me. Even the ones that didn't go to college. 

Some got into colleges because of who they knew, others didn't go to college but, their dads financed the shit out of their passion. 

I on the other hand, had to go to jr college ,then regular college, I had to take out student loans, I had to work and go to school, I didn't have the luxury of taking lots of internships or hobnobbing with the go to people. 

So while Richy Rich is an associate editor at Penguin cuz he got to do all those internships and his dad knows a guy and I'm taking whatever job I can get even if it isn't in my field because I have to make rent. It puts you on a path. 

When you don't have to worry about material things like rent because you've got a well funded family, it makes things way easier. 

If my parents had paid for my education, I could have went to any school that accepted me. I could have gotten better grades in college because I didn't have to work. I could have taken unpaid internships over the summer because I didn't need money. 

Sure there are plenty of people that come from poverty and become super rich. But it's not some easy shit to do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also the politics thing is pretty shaky because some people would consider a pastor talking about how racism is bad from the pulpit is politicking. 

There are loads of politically themed Bible verses. There verses about taxes, prisoners, how people should be treated, the death penalty, and more. 

Yes it's a bit wishy washy on the endorsements, but what are you going to do. Go around and send government officials into churches to listen in on services? 

Also what is and isn't acceptable political speech apart from direct endorsements? 

Telling your congregation that the Bible is against abortion and as such they should remember that when picking who to vote for will definitely sway someone from voting for a prochoice candidate over a prolife one. But that isn't prohibited. 

And you couldn't prohibit it either. Because how are you going to prohibit it? Tell pastors they can't use specific words? Can't mention anyone in politics? What then do you do about all the churches that as part of tradition pray for God to protect their countries leaders? Is that political? Is it not? Who decides?

	<TEXT> You can't enact that. 
For 1 barring Joel osteen and the MC mansion guys. 

Let's say a church has been around for quite some time. So they own their building and have a home for the use of the pastor. 

Well, maybe their congregation is a ton of people are mostly poor and as such either don't own homes or don't own high value homes, but the church owned parsonage is worth a ton because of its location and the housing market. So what, now they have to sell that building just cuz their members are poor? 

Also, it seems quite an invasion of privacy to enforce something like that. In order for the church to comply with that law they'd have to give over a list of all their members to the government. And idk if I want that kind of prying by the government. 

Yes the government knows where you live and yes you pay property taxes. But now, the government has to know what organizations im a part of in my free time? Also, now I apparently have to give information about my personal finances to my Church? 

Also, that would have to be applied across the board to all kinds of non profit organizations at the least. 

Look at Harvard and other big universities, often the Dean will be given a home to live in ( the Dean has to pay rent to avoid declaring it as income on his taxes but nevertheless). I'm fairly certain that most buildings that Harvard owns are probably valued at way more than a majority of their faculty can afford, not to mention the students. 

Think about it, if you're putting this oversight on value on a church based upon members home values then that means that everyone counts. So all the students, the faculty, the janitors, everyone would now be a metric for deciding how expensive a home they can provide to faculty? Idk if that's a feasible idea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> adding to what /u/behlski said: 

It's also only the individual that has to pay the taxes on the use of the car based on their personal use. The Church can still buy the car for them, and they will still use it, but it would the minister himself that has to file his own taxes. No new law would stop that. 

It wouldn't stop them from giving Pastors houses, allt he pastor has to do is pay 5% of the value for rent to not include it as his own income. But the church can still do that. 

There are already rules in place to stop the primary benefit of the pastor or manager. 

I've had friends who worked at big companies who were provided a car that the company leased and an apartment that the company owned. And as long as they worked at the company they could stay in the apartment and drive the vehicle. 

Look back to Ted Haggard, when he was ousted as pastor of his church following his scandal, he had to move from his home and give up his car. This was because he was no longer the pastor at the church. 

While I'm sure Creflo dollars church would collapse if he left, Anything that the church owned that he used would no longer be available to him. They might allow him to buy the things from them for some kind of discount, but he couldn't just keep them and have the church own them. 

These kinds of abuses happen all the time even amongst regular non-profits. 

I know of people who create their own family non-profit to give a child a job. They often do some good as well, but maybe the Grandfather funds it and his grandson is the head of the foundation and draws a salary. It's perfectly legal as long as the non-profit was created to do something other than give Grandson a job.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Just because churches do some charitable stuff does not mean they are non-profits as the law would requires for any non-religious organization.

Actually here are [the exempt purposes for a 501 c 3 organization](https://www.irs.gov/charities-non-profits/charitable-organizations/exempt-purposes-internal-revenue-code-section-501-c-3) (emphasis mine)

 The exempt purposes set forth in section 501(c)(3) are **charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, and preventing cruelty to children or animals.**  The term charitable is used in its generally accepted legal sense and includes **relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency**.

Here are things that most churches do other than just being religious: 

* Are Charitable (Give out goods, services, and money)
* Are educational (Teach church history via church services, bible studies, religious rites, and membership classes)
* Literacy (They read the bible during service, Many churches offer ESL and Adult literacy classes, some dont explicitly but will when they see a parishioner in need)
* Preventing cruelty to children or animals (Churches promote the general welfare of children as a moral issue)


*From just the definition of charitable definition (again not including religious exclusive wording)* 

* Relieve the poor - they donate money, time, and goods to the poor (even if it's just among their own members)
* relieve the distressed - pastors regularly provide counseling of a non medical nature to their members and the public, they provide meditation (prayer), and kind words to those in distressing times. 
* Relief to the underprivileged - Churches often work as advocacy agents for the under privileged (see MLKjr and other civil rights era church leaders, see Catholic agencies and their work with the disabled and tremendous amount of work with the intellectually disabled, see LGBT affirming churches and their work against HB2 and for Equal Marriage Access)
* Advancement of education - While it is largely religious (not every church has an actual school) all churches do teach religious history and literature some also teach music. They do this not only in non church related services but also within a church service As a typical service involves reading the bible (literature), discussion about the history of the teaching and how they relate to daily life thru preaching (history), and education in music via worship music (often times hymns from Bach etc.) 
*Maintaining public buildings, monuments, and works - I can't find the link but I think the Catholic church has the largest collection of art in the world, They maintain historic buildings that are open to the public (Older churches), and they preserve high quality stained glass from artists of the past. 
* Lessen the burden of the government - Any money, goods or services they distribute amongst the community. Checking in on elderly adults to see how they are, providing counseling to members, helping members learn to read, giving members rides and assistance
* Lessening neighborhood tensions - Providing activities for members of the community to interact and get to know each other
* Eliminating prejudice and discrimination - Not including LGBT issues, a majority of churches do work to at the very least eliminate prejudice and discrimination of the disabled, the ill, and the elderly. 
* Defending human and civil rights - Prolife churches believe they are doing that, Historically Black churches believe they are doing that, and Also just in and of itself the free exercise of religion is that
* Combat Community deterioration and juvenile delinquency - A kid that goes to church in a poor gang ridden neighborhoood is likely not going to be a kid that is also in a gang. 

I dont think the current law is "flagrantly granting special privileges to religious entities": 

If anything churches in and of themselves are a special entity. A Church does a whole lot of different things where as the average Charity doesn't dabble in multiple trades. Planned parenthood might give low cost or free medical care to women but they don't also have a huge store of art, give money to poor people, teach people how to read, provide community togetherness and maintain public buildings. 

Not to mention this whole idea of them having to prove their worth to the government. Also they aren't like other for profit entities. The lutheran church down the block isn't the same as the car wash up the street. Barring a scam church most churches are in the business of providing a benefit to the community, depending upon how big the church is that community can be as small as 10 people to as many as whole countries. For profit entities exist to make a profit and return that profit to shareholders. 

Plus if a church is going to be taxed, then they're going to get extremely political. Which means where they might have said "Vote for Prolife candidates" they're going to just straight up get involved and make their will known. Which will probably make candidates more religiously inclined than not. Even if they aren't the richest organization in the world, the catholic church is likely in the top 10. You don't think that once they're being taxed that they aren't going to start donating tons of money to prolife, procatholic, candidates? Is that really what you want?

	<TEXT> Creflo dollar is like the worst possible example. 

But you can't just pick and choose which ones are taxed. 

Like the government can't say prosperity gospel churches are taxed but these ones aren't. 

Just like they can't say, health charities are tax exempt as long as they arent antivaxxers.

It would be nice, but it would be ripe for misuse. Especially because political leanings of all 3 branches of the government change constantly. 

If they can punish certain speech or beliefs they'd be able to punish others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to say in general I don't see why they don't require them to be transparent with their funds. 

I've gone to churches that aren't and I churches that are. 

I went to an evangelical church that would kinda tell you what needed more money but wouldn't easily release how much money they took in from tithes and offerings and such. 

And I've been to Lutheran churches who not only make their financial information easily accessible to anyone who wants to know. Post the prior weeks take of all incoming money including tithes, offerings, donations, and income from people renting out facilities, in the weekly bulletin to all members. But they also give out statements to all the members of their quarterly income and expenses. Plus they vote on the pastors income, raises, and major expenses. Some even vote for if they should accept a large donation (especially if it is something like to be used for this 1 thing). 

It just seems sensible for them to do it. 

And would help them to be more organized. 

Not on a scale as big as a church, but I have worked with a student group to raise money for something. So we sold candy and just took in donations and stuff. 

It got really hectic when we first just kinda stuffed all the money in a jar. Eventually we had to start counting money, recording it in a journal and stuff. Not to mention we had to figure out if we were making money off of selling candy. 

I'm sure most churches have utilities to pay, rent or mortgages to pay, and they are supposed to send their donors statements at tax time. 

So I don't see how they couldn't just fill out that form. A good church should have all that information anyway. 

And honestly I don't see how it would be burdensome to fill out a form. It's not like it's a background check and they have to wait 10 days to do church stuff after they file it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't meant as a maligning thing. It was just a contrasting fact. It was just the one that I happened to have picked. 

Just cuz he takes/took a large salary doesn't necessarily mean that he didn't deserve it nor that he's a dick or something. 

I'd consider him (based on no knowledge of the guy) to be a better human than Osteen. Even if Osteen doesn't take a salary from the church. Just cuz, he doesn't seem to do the deceitful and dishonest crap osteen does. 

I've no problem with a charity paying their employees competitive and even excessive wages. 

If paying the CEO 10million a year is what keeps the guy that has helped reduced expenses, increased donations, and increased the effectiveness of the charity every year they've been there then go ahead. 

If they're paying the CEO 20k a year and the charity is doing worse they're wasting funds on a terrible employee. 

All that is to say, my intent wasn't that the Goodwill is bad or the CEO is bad. Just that not all megachurch pastors actually take any money but that many charitable organizations do pay their leaders a hefty sum.

	<TEXT> I don't necessarily consider them gaining wealth to be hypocritical. Wealth in and of itself isn't a moral thing. 

Yeah sure, there's the story where Jesus tells the guy to sell all his belongings and give them to the poor. But then there are also all the biblical stories of God blessing people with money as a reward for their faith or obedience or whatever. Like Job was rich as heck, lost everything, but in the end he was doubly rich because God blessed him more for being faithful. 

From christian specific morality, it's more the love of money that is immoral. 

Sure Joel Osteen and his ilk are more than likely well in love with their money. But, just having a shitton of money doesn't necessarily make a christian a hypocrite. I know of many such rich people who while they have a big fancy house and drive a BMW or whatever, also give well over the "required" tithe to charity. 

For example, Mitt Romney (whatever you think about him politically aside) does give more than 1/3 of his annual income to charity. He's not a pastor but he is like a Bishop or something like that. Sure he's blindingly rich, but he's also pretty generous. 

And that guy that wrote the purpose driven life that was all the rage like 15ish years ago [\(Rick Warren\)](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/morgan-guyton/rick-warrens-economic-principles_b_1464954.html) apparently gives like 90 percent of all his income away to not only his own church but also like HIV/AIDS programs, and programs for the poor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anything political? 

That's a bunch of crap because EVERYTHING can be political. 

Where I live most of the homeless shelters are run by churches. So they'd more than likely have members, pastors, and churches that are all looking to get the local (at the very least) government to create laws and services that help these people get better jobs or whatever so they won't be homeless. 

So now you're saying well, if they decide to hold a rally or join someone elses protest about the government cutting benefits for the poor, all of a sudden they lose their tax exempt status that they were very well using to benefit tons of homeless people that the local government isnt? 

All 501 c 3 organizations are involved in other peoples lives. And many of them "spread lies and brain wash people". You have [homeopathic 501c3 organizations](http://www.homeopathycenter.org/), [anti vaxxer 501 c 3](http://momsagainstmercury.org/), and I'm sure if I look into it there are probably ones for a flat earth, chemtrails, and other such nonsense. 

Also the no politics law extends to all 501 c 3 organizations. This includes groups that work with the disabled, that help unwed mothers, planned parenthood, and more. All of those organizations have reasons why they'd advocate political things. If Politician A and Politician B are both running for office and Politician A wants to end medicaid waiver, why shouldn't the organization for the disabled say "Vote for the candidate that supports medicaid waiver." Why shouldn't they be able to protest the things that they are against? 

Besides you couldn't even enforce that anyway. All they'd do is break up the two entities. And technically, you don't really need much money to hold protests. They'd just break it up into 2 parts one would be a 501 C 3 and the other a 501 C 4. Which is what many 501 C 3 organizations do any way. 

Planned parenthood has both a 501c4 and a 501c3 the c4 can conduct political activities and the c3 technically can't. 

There's no rules that say Church A can't give money to Charitable organization B. So any rule as such would just have Westboro baptist breaking up their organizations into 2 separate entities. A protest entity and a church entity. 

Not to mention that you can't police their protests. If Pastor Bob wants to go and protest planned parenthood on his freetime as a free citizen of the US he can do so all he wants. So can the other members of the church. 

What are you going to do, tell Pastor Bob he can't do what he wants as a private citizen just because he has this other job? Seems a massive violation of civil liberties. And that wouldn't just end with pastors either. It'll trickle down to tons of other jobs and organizations. Not to mention it'll be policing specific free speech. 

Sure everyone has a problem with westboro baptist and the way they go about their activities. But what about all the churches that banded together and protested North Carolinas HB2? Not the ones that were against Trans* people in bathrooms, but the ones that were there to advocate with the LGBT commmunity. Do they also lose their tax exempt status? 

What about the churches that joined with milliions of the LGBT community to create momentum for equal rights? Or all the historically black churches that worked to fight racism? Remember Martin Luther King Jr. was as a profession a Pastor of a church. And he used his religious beliefs as part of the reason why he was fighting a largely politcial fight for equal rights of people of color. 

So yeah, you want to stop the Westboro Baptist church but you'll also stop the MLKjr type churches too.

	<TEXT> Hi,

I think I've literally tried all the advice for hard-boiled eggs and 9 time out of ten they always come out like this: http://i.imgur.com/5IYGCUz.jpg

The peal always gets stuck and rips the egg up. 

Here's what I've tried:

1. Eggs in cold water, bring to a boil, and then wait. 
2. A little vinegar in the water
3. Boil eggs the entire time, take out run under cold water
4. attempt" to peal them while their still warm
5. Peal them the next day
6. Don't use new eggs, use eggs that are at least a week old. 

So those are the things I've tried. 

Sometimes using any of these methods will work. But most of the time they don't. Last night I did the bring to a boil, turn off, and then wait til the next day with old eggs (over a week since purchase) and that's what is pictured above. 

Anyone got a fool proof way to hard-boiled eggs that look nice? 

Most of the time I'm making egg salad so I don't care what they look like but occasionally I want to make deviled eggs and they don't look nearly as appetising when they're ripped to shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair, even mega churches do have charitable organization entities within them. 

I went to one when I was younger that had begun it's ascent to megachurch status. (They'd just purchased a very large parcel of land for a campus). 

And even though they were raking it in, they did provide a level of charity that the small 50 member church couldn't. 

They gave like 100's of thousands of dollars to some charity in Guatemala. Provided inner city children with backpacks and school supplies. They operated a college scholarship, and gave out a few checks to kids for private school at a few local Christian academies (which even tho Christian were vastly better than the education a lot of the kids would have gotten in Newark public schools). They'd even just write  random checks for members (and to some extent people in the community, with verification and some investigation) for financial difficulties. 


Even at the small church I attended years later, we didn't have that many members but when my husband broke his leg and we didn't have money for groceries and were waiting on food stamps and workers comp to kick in, they just have us like 400$ to live. 



****

As for people getting rich from megachurches. It sucks, but many of those megachurch pastors don't even draw a salary from their churches. 

For example: Joel Osteen hasn't taken a salary from his church since 2005. Nearly all of his millions come from his book sales.  http://www.howmuchmoneytheymake.com/public-figures/joel-osteen-net-worth-and-salary-lakewood-church.htm. (I'm on mobile right now so I'll properly format the link when I get to a computer).

Meanwhile, the CEO of goodwill takes like a 3million dollar salary. 
https://www.thestreet.com/story/12877842/1/you-wont-believe-how-much-these-10-nonprofit-ceos-get-paid.html

However that trollacious dick Creflo dollar does still draw a check from his church and won't even say how much it is http://mobile.nytimes.com/2006/01/15/nyregion/preaching-a-gospel-of-wealth-in-a-glittery-market-new-york.html?referer=http://rare.us/story/exposed-creflo-dollar-and-7-other-black-pastors-whose-net-worth-is-200-times-greater-than-their-flocks/.

So you know it isn't all cut and dry and it definitely would be hard to implement and enforce. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I looked apparently for the BS it's like 58 credits for the major, so about 4 semesters or about  ~ $4000 per semester (so $16,000/ft over 2 years) 

Tho, if he's working probably going to take a slight bit longer and cost a tad bit more.

He's been doing code academy and stiff like that in his free time. And the price difference between the boot camp is negligible.

The college would be about $9000 depending upon the credits. While the 2 boot camps in the area are between 8 and 13k. Plus the other guy said that boot campers don't come out too terribly well prepared.

	<TEXT> My husband hurt himself on the job a while ago and it looks like we're going to get a decently sized settlement. Not millions but somewhere between 30   75k.

We are going to pay off all our non student loan debt, which isn't much. We're also going to put aside 3-6 months of current expenses and a little for a vacation. but not sure what to do with the rest.  Which even with the 30k should be over 10k. 

We've a car loan that could get paid off

But we could also put 10k+ down on a condo or small house in our area and stop throwing money away to rent. Or something. 

The 3rd alternative would be paying for my husband to get a second degree. He has a BA in political science but wants to get an associate's degree in programming for some reason. (You can tell I'm not really behind it). 

We don't have great credit, but according to most advice we should qualify for a FHA loan. 

Just not sure what's the most sensible thing to do. 

Other facts: I'm planning on attending a Masters programme in 2017. Our kid does have autism. My husband hates his current job. And I might want to move to another state once I'm done with school in 18-36 months.

But here are the options I can think of listed. 

1. Pay off car
2. Down payment for home
3. Computer programming degree for husband
4. Just squirrel it away for later
5. Towards some of the student loans
6. Blow it on a world trip and hookers (joke)
7. Something I haven't thought of.  </TEXT>

So does his lack of ever even going to his "homeland" and being very culturally an American and not speaking any spanish. Lessen his ethnicity?

I wasn't aware that there were all these rules to being a member of ethnic groups. 

Even if he isn't culturally mexican, he's still part mexican. You can't just say He isn't mexican enough. That's still part of his heritage. </TEXT>

My son is like even less than that cuz his father is hispanic. Yet he still gets mistaken as black from his looks so it's definitely part of his culture. So what me and my son aren't black because it's not enough percentage wise for you?

	<TEXT> That is pretty true. 

I hate when people say that shit about how "This person isn't really X ethnicity/race" because of their looks, their lifestyle, their whatever. 

Like my husband is hispanic but he looks more Italian than anything (which while still an ethnicity people just blanket that shit under white). Also I've heard our last name for italian people as well as ecuadorians so if we do some geneology we'll probably find some Italians or something. 

And it's funny because he was trying to be a comedian and he was always getting people that said he should do like ethnic comedy like Mencia and Chapelle (am I the only one grossed out that I used them in the same sentence?) but thats not really his thing. 

He does have the stereotypical big loud hispanic family, but he's more of a stereotype brooklyn dude, who just happens to really like pernil and mangos. lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's cuz he focused on churchy crowds. Christianity can bring in lots of cash. I remember watching some of the plays that eventually became the  first few Madea movies on tapes at my religious in laws house. They were terrible but funner than any other Christian focused show. Notice Christian movies are very rarely comedies, so he found a hole and filled it. 

His aren't straight comedies, they're more like comedy/dramas but they aren't too heavy on the religion and they've got enough meh laughs. But during that 3 year jaunt when I was a evangelical, I'd look for Christian comedies and there really weren't any. It was all Christian apocalyptic movies, and shitty evangelical dramas. The bulk was Madea movies. 

So basically, if you just want to make money or are a Christian that wants to become middling big in film. Make decently produced Christian comedies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I really only wanted the tracking features. 

I don't need any of that other stuff. 

There's a training program in my area that gets your animal ready for search and rescue the whole training is about 2500 

I have to do a fair bit of the "homework" with the animal but I'm not really doing much else so I don't really have a problem with it. 

I know that a lot of service dogs are trained to help with this thing and that and turn on lights and things of that nature.


I saw autism specific service animals and they costs like 15k. And I can't help but think a fair amount goes to buying animals from breeders which seems terrible since there are all these unwanted animals in the world. And a lot of them tend to make good tracking dogs. 

But I'll think about it. Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you live alone it can be hard to want to cook at home. But I find the best way to create a habit. Is gradually. I know that science says 21 days and it becomes a habit but I like just adding it little by little.

So if I wanted to cook at home everyday, I'd probably just say every Monday I'm gonna cook. 

Then every Monday I'd make dinner. Even if it's just meatloaf every Monday. 

Then after 2 weeks I'd add in Wednesday

And so on and so on. 

If you do that by week 10 you'll be making dinner 5 days a week.

	<TEXT> I'm part of a shitty shitpost group on Facebook. 

Anyway whilst in the group I made some comment that apparently was badass and this dude proceeded to become very enamoured with me. 

Whatever, I'm bored and lonely enough to entertain it. Plus who doesn't like someone to sing your praises all over the fb. 

So he friends me. I typically don't friend random people unless we've talked a lot slot before or we've got a mutual friend. Not cuz I'm very private or whatever but because Ive got a fucked up sense of humor and don't want to deal with arguments from people who don't like it. 

So now we're friends. This guy publicly on Facebook is the biggest sjw, feminist ally, GLBT ally, BLMer. 

Like I'm not even joking like the dude posts constantly about how women aren't objects, Gets all pissed at the hypocrisy of schools that send girls home for spaghetti straps, tells dudes to not rape in his posts. Like super PC. I'm not even exaggerating. 

However, via pm he's like (and knows I'm married and not interested) "you're so sexy" "I'd make you squirt" and "let me tell you about my sexual prowess" 

It's really creepy and annoying. I've taken to unfriending him but he's still like friends with friends of mine somehow, I guess he weaseled his way into their lists. 

The worst part is I'm not very good looking. I'm quite overweight, and I'm a massive jerk.  </TEXT>

I remember I had a friend like that in highschool it was a girl but she'd say these things like "I think he's cheating, can you let me know if you see him this weekend" 

Or 

"He was saying some really suicidal things and I just want him to be safe." 

It always seemed weird to me. Also I'm a jerk friend cuz I'd just tell the dude like "this chick said you wanna kill yourself, is that true? No? Okay cool" or "You still with this chick? No? Okay cool." </TEXT>
