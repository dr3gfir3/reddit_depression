South Korea's permit program swells ranks of foreign workers

Percentage of guest talent far outpaces Japan's

TOKYO -- In the competition to recruit much-needed foreign talent, South Korea's work permit program is beating that of Japan's system.

In raw numbers, Japan's 1.08 million foreign workers edge out South Korea's 960,000. But South Korea's population of 50 million is less than half of Japan's, making its proportion of foreign workers more than double that of its neighbor.

Foreign workers had entered through the Industrial Training System, which was similar to Japan's current Technical Intern Training Program. But Seoul replaced the framework with a broader Employment Permit System in 2004, which let in 480,000 nonprofessional workers.

Among that number, South Korea granted regular work permits to 260,000 people from Vietnam, Thailand, Cambodia, the Philippines, Indonesia and 11 other nations under bilateral agreements. They generally work in agriculture and at small to midsized manufacturers. In contrast, Japan is taking in only 210,000 technical trainees.

"The number of nonprofessional workers accepted accelerated after the introduction of the Employment Permit System," said Koji Sano, a professor at Fukushima University who is an expert on South Korean labor policy.

What sets apart foreigners working in South Korea is the sheer number who can speak the language. Some 220,000 people were recruited through the special work permit system -- among them ethnic Koreans from China as well as other foreign nationals of Korean heritage. They are found in service sectors, such as restaurants and nursing care.

Meanwhile, the language barrier prevents Japan from recruiting and retaining a significant number of talented foreigners.

On the other hand, the 210,000 foreign students in Japan who are working dwarf the 13,000 in South Korea. Furthermore, 80% of these students have joined the labor force in Japan while the same can be said for only 10% in South Korea. The 46,000 foreign-born specialists in South Korea also trail those in Japan.

	<TEXT> 	Fake China data: was it just one province?

Revelations Liaoning fabricated statistics raise questions over rest of rust belt

Women ride past oil wells in northern China's Hebei province  AFP

4 HOURS AGO by: Lucy Hornby and Archie Zhang in Beijing and Jane Pong in Hong Kong
Sceptics about Chinaseconomic statistics have taken a special pleasure in revelations offaked data in the north-eastern province of Liaoning dating at least to 2011. Along with an officially reported contraction in its economy last year, they have given the impression that Liaonings economy is unusually troubled. That impression may be unfair to Liaoning.


In 2007 when he was party secretary of Liaoning, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang made waves when he declared Chinas gross domestic productfigures man-made.

Even president Xi Jinping weighed in on Liaonings data-faking last week, telling the provinces delegation to Chinas annual legislative meeting that the practice must be stopped.


But is Liaoning the only province to have doctored its statistics? The map below shows the share of metals and mining (a category that includes crude oil output) in the nominal gross domestic product of Chinese provinces in 2011. China stopped publishing this data in 2012, the same year the commodity cycle turned sour.


The FT examined four provinces that are more reliant than Liaoning on the coal, steel and oil industries. Shanxi, Shaanxi and Inner Mongolia comprise Chinas coal heartland; Liaoning and Hebei together account for almost one-third of Chinas steel output.

In regions where resources or steel dominate, the commodity cycle is more extreme. Booms inflate the service sector, consumer spending and property prices; busts have an outsized effect on employment and government finances. China has a rust belt just like the US or UK, says Andy Rothman, investment strategist at Matthews Asia.

Here is a look at coal, oil and steel prices since 2012.


These benchmarks were multiplied by each provinces reported output of coal, oil and steel, and charted against the reported growth in GDP. Here is Liaoning. Strangely, when it admitted to a contraction in 2016, steel, coal and oil were already recovering.


The other provinces show a similar pattern in the three key industries. Output values weakened in 2012, briefly recovered in the second half of 2013 and then took a deep dive. Here is Hebei, home to one-quarter of Chinese steel production:


The worse period was the winter of 2015-2016, followed by a recovery in 2016, as we can see in Shaanxi...


...and Inner Mongolia...


This pattern diverges from reported GDP figures, which show growth speeding up from early 2015. Heres Shanxi, the most mining-dependent of all Chinese provinces. Metals and mining (mostly coal) made up 62 per cent of its industrial output in 2011, and 37 per cent of GDP.


Did Liaoning actually underperform last year, or were its reported data suddenly brought back in line with reality? And what does that imply about the other rust-belt provinces?


 Liaoning is the most developed and diversified of the three north-eastern provinces, therefore it should have been performing better, not worse, says Andrew Batson, economist at research group Gavekal Dragonomics who keeps a close eye on the economy in Chinas beleaguerednorth-eastern provinces.

In 2013 the Communist party pledged to implement a unified system for compiling provincial GDP. Rather than relying on provincial agencies to produce GDP figures in parallel with the national survey, the pledge called for the National Bureau of Statistics in Beijing to take charge of the process.

The goal was to avoid the perennial problem of provincial GDPs summing up to a higher number than the national figure. NBS circulated a draft plan for the unified system in late 2014. Ning Jizhe, director of NBS, told official media on Sunday that phase-in will begin in 2017 and be complete by 2020.

Observers must await the release of four years of corrected data from Liaoning  if indeed the true numbers are ever divulged  if they are to find out what really happened to northern Chinas economy when the economic books were being cooked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When the majority of population is dumb enough to pick Park Geun He

Um. No. This come off as pretentious. I really hate this recent surge of people who are like "Man, how the fuck did we/other people elect this nutcase as a president." Situations were different back then in 2012. Park was a somewhat established figure in her party and won many elections. It is undeniable that the old voters were thinking about her father's legacy when they voted for her, but saying that she wasn't qualified whatsoever is also not true. And nobody sans a few people were aware of the shady relationship between her and the Chois. Moon wasn't an attractive candidate, too. And the margin was not big, it was 51.6% and 48.0% respectively. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When asked Friday whether Bharara was also being asked for a resignation letter, one White House official not authorized to speak publicly said, Everybodys gone, and would not engage further on the issue. Two people close to the president said the presidents chief strategist Stephen K. Bannon and Attorney General Jeff Sessions want a clean slate of federal prosecutors and are unconcerned about any perception that the White House appears to have changed its mind about Bharara. The ouster of former president Barack Obamas federal prosecutors is about asserting whos in power, these people said.

It was President Bannon's decision, what's done is done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And of the three cultures, I'd say that the Koreans were the most keen on keeping things natural. They didn't built moats around these dwellings, and their landscape architecture and gardens received minimal intervention and maintenance. This probably has something to do with the Joeseon Dynasty, the last dynasty of the peninsula, basing their social and cultural values around Confucianism and embracing frugality. </TEXT>
