	<TEXT> As a gay man, I have to disagree.  Not everyone is raised to believe that gay people are born gay; many are obviously raised to believe it was a (usually negative) choice.  You can't hate someone for saying "I don't understand how he could be gay;" it just shows that he was raised ignorant.  His tweet was *hardly* "Jason Collins is a faggot and I don't want to be in the same locker room as him." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   ...the only way it will become widespread in the US is if Apple rolls it out in their phones.

I don't understand this viewpoint.  There are so many NFC-based Android phones in America but it's still yet to "take off."  After a certain point, you can't just blame that on Apple for not using a hardware feature that has obviously been unpopular with consumers and businesses and start asking other companies like Samsung or HTC to create the solutions you mentioned.

"Apple should start making Segways!"

"Why?  No one bought those nor do they think they're useful..."

"True, but Apple making them will all of a sudden make everyone love it!"

"Wat." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no idea what my plans are with this; I was hoping to gauge interest in the app with this post, but it appears most comments are regarding my face rather than the app.  (I'll look into stock photos for next time heh).  If I were to release it, it would most likely be closed source and for $.99.  Though if I clean the source up a lot, I could foresee myself releasing the source and using the Play Store app as a donation.  Sadly, ad revenue wouldn't work with this UI. :(

You don't have to line the photo up to the lines; they're [all random](http://imgur.com/a/OCz8U).  In fact, there's even a random number of band distortions per image!  I hope you don't mind me using your (fantastic) photo here!   </TEXT>

[Here's an example](http://25.media.tumblr.com/08e56c8fc039317a3f0b2502b5b38248/tumblr_mjrcrpr4np1s89vx9o1_500.jpg) of what I had going with the VHS effect.

According to you, my 2.0 Ghz i5 is comparable to a 3.0 Ghz Pentium 4.  Ghz only means something when you're looking at a similar chips; a 1.7 Ghz Tegra 3 is faster than a 1.5 Ghz Tegra 3.  A 1.7 Ghz Tegra 3 is not as fast as a 1.2 Ghz A6. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks!  I don't really have a structured workout system but here's a run down on what I've been doing. I've been taking creatine every day and protein shakes after every work out.  I've also been splitting my workouts into two days: arms/back and legs/abs.

Arms/Back Days:

1.  Bench Press
2.  Curls with the EZ-Curl bar
3.  Dips
4.  Low Row
5.  Behind the head barbell shrug... thing (my roommate showed it to me)
6.  Concentrated curls

Legs/Abs Day:

1. 125 sit ups
2. Plank-typed exercises
3. Glute kickback
4. Leg Press
5. Leg Extensions
6. Calfs on the leg press machine

Any suggestions are more than welcome and would be taken to heart! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Reddit usually hates it when women aren't 100% verbally clear about their intentions with no reliance on hint, body language, or normal social protocol, but suddenly it's take the compliment, bitch?

This.  I'm so tired of redditors (and more abstractly, guys) say, "It was obvious we were flirting but she never told me she had a boyfriend; what a bitch!" and then see things like this.  What OP said was a bit off hand, but if a guy came up to a girl and said "I like your shirt, gorgeous," then it's obvious that he's hitting on her.  She would be doing the right thing by telling him that she's seeing someone because he wouldn't feel strung along. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree.  One is telling people to "just do it already," which is more condescending than it is helpful while the other is saying "if you realize the importance of what you're putting off, you'll be more likely to do it."

To be fair, this could've been said about America after The Jersey Shore started.  Iknowthatfeel.png

Also, I don't think it was cancelled due to ratings; the cast is now doing their "own thing," AKA trying to seep into American pop culture in other ways.  Also, Snooki and JWOWW (ugh) have their own show here (titled Snooki   JWOWW) and I think Pauly D has one, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We do however celebrate the dead on Nov. 1st (All Saints), but it's a somber Catholic festivity

As someone who's taken a lot of Spanish and Italian classes, can I point out that, while yes, both holidays share the same roots and deal with the dead, they're really not similar?  All Saints or Dia De Los Muertos (Mexico) is actually about remembrance and celebration whereas Halloween is more of a commercial holiday.  There's literally 0 remembrance going on; it's a day to buy costumes, buy candy, buy decorations, etc.  

Don't get me wrong, it's my favorite holiday!  I've just always been fascinated by All Saints and am actually saddened something of that nature isn't celebrated here. :( </TEXT>
