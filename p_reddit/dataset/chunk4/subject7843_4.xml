	<TEXT> There's one thing I feel like people don't mention or make theories for enough is what happens in the first 30 secs of the whole show.

Theres a kid filming a video in the back of their car, they see Prairie is running around (on what looks like a bridge in NYC.) 

The mother and kid have a dialogue that says:

Kid: "Mom, mom that lady"
Mom: "Shes fine, look shes ok"  
(Prarie runs to the edge)
Kid: "She's going to the otherside"
Mom: "NO NO. GOD! DON'T LOOK"
(Prarie jumps)
Kid: whispers "She let go"

To me there's a lot of questions here. 

- Did she die and wake up in another dimension / otherside? If so, are the new 5 the same as the old 5? 

- How was she rescued? Did she drown? Wouldn't she have broken limbs from a drop this high?

- If this is in NYC , how did she get to "Hospital in St. Louis" 

- If you were to jump off a bridge, wouldn't they surely take you to a mental hospital?

- Why did kid say "She's going to the otherside". Kids don't say that 

- Is the incident at the bridge and her waking up in the hospital two separate events. Maybe they didn't occur linearly.
