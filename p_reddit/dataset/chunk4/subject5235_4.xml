	<TEXT> I've pretty fully fleshed out a rather complicated language for a country in my world-- verbs conjugate by the indicative, subjunctive, and deductive moods, present, perfect, imperfect, and pluperfect tenses, active and mediopassive voices, singular, plural, and dual persons, and infinitive, gerund, and supine non-finite verbs, with a total of 75 possible conjugations per verb; nouns decline into 10 cases as well as into singular, dual, and plural numbers; there are two writing systems-- one older, "traditional" one for important and/or sacred texts, and one newer, simplified one for everyday use (much like how modern Hebrew works); the dictionary currently has about 350 words and is growing in number! I don't know how detailed this is for fellow worldbuilders but this is definitely the most in-depth I have gotten :) </TEXT>
