	<TEXT> I think it is OK to have those thoughts sometimes and it doesn't mean that you are mentally ill, but if you ever get the urge to act upon them you should seek professional help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I have said before, the deep love I feel for my husband is the only thing that prevents me from going through with my thoughts. He does know how I feel.

Regarding your first question, I think I already explained in my answer to your other comment.

The problem about vacations is they need organizing, and this is pretty hard to do when the most proactive thing you have done in weeks is writing an AMA in reddit. Plus even if I could find the energy to go somewhere else, I would probably only see the inside of my hotel room. Bit of a waste, isn't it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks again. I consider it an "up" cycle when I can get out of bed and have a shower. Sometimes I have enough energy to do the dishes or a bit of laundry and it is awesome! I will definitely try to find another doctor. Doing something (anything) to this effect has been my main goal for the past two weeks. That and going to work, of course. Today I failed miserably on that one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, I am very happy that you found your answer and you both got your lives back! Unfortunately, I don't think this applies to me.

Edit one month later: I leave this comment for posterity. Oh how wrong I was! </TEXT>
