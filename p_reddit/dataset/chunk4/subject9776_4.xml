	<TITLE> Quick question - Does "Prevent all combat damage" effect protect from Deathtouch? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-14 19:25:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Technically Deathtouch says that "any amount of damage dealt by a source is enough to kill the creature receiving the damage", implying the damage has to be dealt in the first place and "Prevent all combat damage" should counter that. Is this correct?

EDIT: Thanks! /thread </TEXT>

The drill is all over the place and it will always jerk out to the side so bad that before it finally decides to listen to me, the asteroid is already at 1/3 health. And then it happens again. Is there any way around it except for wasting real money to be able to get the best drill? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since darkness is pretty much a natural state of objects that don't give off light by themselves, you don't ask if shadows are made of atoms. Shadows are spaces reached by a reduced amount of photons, or none at all, so basically we're talking pure-whatever-it-is-unlit. And that pure thing is made of atoms, so yeah. Everything else is that + photons.

And dreams are an effect of brain activity that is based on neurons, and neurons are weird ass chemo-electrical relays of sorts. And since electricity = flow of atoms and chemical substances are also made up of atoms, then go figure. </TEXT>
