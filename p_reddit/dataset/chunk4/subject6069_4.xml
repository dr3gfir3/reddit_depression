	<TEXT> These people were terminated (asked to resign) effective immediately and no indication was made that there were replacements ready for them. Typically, as in Obama's tenure, replacements are phased in over time and appointees are given notice to prepare. There are hundreds of other positions in Trump's government that are unfilled at this point, and no indication has been made that these or any of those other positions have ready replacements. There's either a lack of replacements or a lack of transparency - come Monday morning, we'll know for sure which, as 46 attorneys' desks will be empty.

Also, for some reason you're reading a bunch of things into my comments for which there's no evidence whatsoever - I'm not surprised by that, as Trump makes baseless accusations on a frequent basis and provides no evidence for them, so it's in his mold. If you can point to somewhere in this conversation where I've come across as "aghast, threatened, and frightened" rather than simply conversing with you, I'll give you a high five. The reality is that you're making bad arguments and you know it. I know you're trying to gin up material for your liberal tears spank bank but you're really grasping for straws in your accusations here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So first of all you're obviously kidding when you say "he will not divide us" - he's a remarkably and intentionally divisive figure. And again, the reasonable and responsible way of handling these situations is to phase in new appointees over time and with replacements ready. Citing an example of another time when people thought it was poorly handled and possibly politically motivated doesn't change anything about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You keep citing an example of a time that this was also widely seen as badly handled as, what, a defense of *this* time that it was badly handled? Really struggling to see your point here. Are you saying it's not bad this time because it was bad another time? The bottom line is that phasing appointed positions out over time and having replacements ready for them is the reasonable and responsible way of handling this. The fact that people handled in unreasonably and irresponsibly in the past does nothing to diminish that it was handled in an irresponsible and unreasonable way this time. Whataboutism is not a valid defense of bad actions. </TEXT>

I actually loved the first 40 or 50 pages and I was hooked into what seemed like was going to be an interesting story.

	<TEXT> Yeah my theory is that a lot of dragon stories come from people witnessing volcanic eruptions. If you watch "Into the Inferno" on netflix (highly recommend, especially while stoned), Werner Herzog reads from an Icelandic saga about dragons while showing eruptions. I imagine most people who saw giant plumes* (not plums) of ash and fire erupting from a mountain, most of them probably took a quick look and then ran their asses off. That could easily translate into thinking a giant evil worm just blew it's way from the earth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're in a bit of a crisis over there right now because of the AHCA health care law. It's funny to watch. The bill is shit and everyone knows it, including T_D. However, they're torn on how to react to the fact that Donald is throwing his considerable weight behind it to try to get it passed even though it was dreamed up by the "traitor" RINO Paul Ryan. Some of them are, of course, convinced that it's a genius political ploy by Donald - that he *wants* it to fail so that he can "write his own bill". It's pretty entertaining and worth checking out any thread on health care over there right now.

e: when you can find threads on health care there, that is. I've only seen a few. For some strange reason they aren't all that excited to talk about it... </TEXT>

Same thing with Obamacare. He said they'd repeal it so much that he's forced to back the piece of shit bill going through congress right now. You should see /r/the_don right now - they don't know how to take the fact that Trump is lobbying so hard for "Obamacare-lite" drafted by the evil Paul Ryan. Well, some of them don't know how to take it - others are of course convinced that this is a master strategy by Trump and that he WANTS it to fail (even though he's lobbying hard for it) so that he can write his own bill... if that makes absolutely no sense to you, you're having the logical reaction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Typically, dystopian work uses symbolism and hyperbole to exemplify and criticize current and historical events and trends. In Puritan society, men governed, women were not allowed into positions of community leadership, they were expected to fulfill certain roles, primarily as mothers and homemakers. Gilead is an extreme version of that meant to illustrate the psychological and sociological impacts that kind of powerlessness has on people and societies. The parallels people see in current politics are not that women are going to be forced to birth children against their will or wear hoods that control what they can or can't see (again, that's symbolism) - but that the people in power would contribute to the erosion of women's rights and advocate for more "traditional" gender roles, removing autonomy and choice. </TEXT>

But the fact that he continues to do it instead of having the decency to step down speaks volumes (not good ones) about his character. It infuriated me when he claimed, earlier today, that Trump was "obviously" not just talking about Obama releasing 122 fighters back to the battlefield from Guantanamo. It is not fucking obvious because Trump STRAIGHT UP SAID Obama did it. It is fucking infuriating to watch this weasel just completely lie to peoples' faces over and over again with NO recourse aside from public humiliation. We are just USED to the lying now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are too many weird things related to Russia with this administration that it seems likely that something strange is going on behind the scenes. Why do people keep lying about meetings with Russian officials? The story keeps changing. Why did Trump staffers work to soften the GOP's statement on aiding Ukraine in standing up to Russia? Why do many of Trump's positions and appointments happily align with Russian interests? Why did he constantly praise Putin during the campaign? Trump openly requested that Russia continue to hack and release DNC documents. Among all of that, each individual instance might raise eyebrows but would not be a huge deal. But all of these oddities keep piling up, and the fact that Trump's people aren't being straight-up about these meetings really looks dirty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the long view you imply is stretching plausibility. The people in control want to remain in control, consolidate power, and make as much profit as possible. That much is certain. Where it goes off the rails is the "wait until the birthrate drops, etc" part. That's Alex Jones FEMA camp material. I can see why it's tempting to go down that rabbit hole, especially considering this insane leak today. But why is it not more logical to simply stop at "these people want power and money" than to continue down the road to "they want depopulation by attrition"? Unless the idea is that these people plan to like for like 400 years on the blood of children, there's no reason to think it's about anything more than immediate power and profit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw what happened after 9/11 and I know what a republican president will do in reaction to a serious terrorist attack. It led to two wars, thousands of lost lives, and the erosion of civil liberties. Trump will be a whole different level of overreaction and the toll will be multiplied massively. The political ramifications are no small matter - they will lead directly to the loss of human life - probably on a scale we haven't seen in a long time. So yes, that's what I'm most concerned about, because we haven't even seen how much Trump will overreact to a small-scale terror attack, let alone a large one. If his actions so far are any guide, it will be a horrifying thing to witness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I STRONGLY disagree with this ban and agree with the DHS that this ban actually undercuts our ability to fight terrorism, I have to wonder if, in the grand scheme of things, it's best if this holds up in court and goes into effect. I am picturing the absolutely disastrous fallout if at some point a person from one of these countries who immigrates to the US or comes here as a refugee from Syria commits a terror attack. It hasn't happened yet but that doesn't mean it won't happen - and the overreach, clamor for war, and consolidation of power under Trump if an attack like that does happen will be UNREAL and earth shaking. I am really scared for what's going to happen after a terror attack of some kind happens here, because it's basically inevitable that SOMETHING is going to happen at some point no matter what we do to prevent it. Coda: I mean "radical islamic terror" rather than the right-wing terror we've already seen, which Trump has taken no real steps to stymie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, just pointing out that the "response tweet" from Favreau isn't summarizing the accusation Trump made accurately. It's a strawman, which is unnecessary when the actual argument Trump is making is already unfounded and crazy. Plus, I'd imagine Trump's allegation is meant to fuel speculation that Obama did this illegally for his own gain, not for a case to be built in court, but to undermine the Trump campaign in some more nefarious and secretive way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, Pence is simply not worse than Trump. Pence is not an imminent threat to the functioning of our government. We can trust that Pence would leave office if he loses the vote in 2020. Pence has not shown the signs of mental instability that Trump has. Pence will push forth terrible policies that can be opposed and fought against. But he won't bring the entire fucking government crashing down on us like this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP drew a conclusion from this video and posted it under a headline that the video does not support, at all. You are right, all the stuff Levin comments on in the video has been in publication for a long time now. It's been posted here and we've all talked about it. And none of it points to Obama wiretapping Trump Tower. It points to the FBI getting FISA warrants to monitor several members of the Trump campaign for possible collusion with Russia. Everything he brings up in the video looks bad for Trump - none of it looks bad for Obama. Not even sure what the point of this exercise was supposed to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watched the entire thing - nothing backs up the claim that Obama asked for Trump tower to be wiretapped, or even that the executive branch made the decision to center an investigation on the Trump campaign. Everything he talks about in the video has been known for a long time now: the FBI obtained FISA warrants on several members of Trump's campaign, and they along with 5 other agencies followed up on suspicions they had of Trump's campaign's possible collusion with Russia. None of what he reviews in this video does any favors for Trump, either... and this video definitely does not "break down Trump wiretapping claims" considering the claims were that Obama tapped Trump Tower.

If I missed something, please point me to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I Lay Dying is great! But definitely a jarring style that takes a bit to get used to, what with all those narrators. If you end up liking it I recommend The Sound and the Fury, but be ready for the first third of the book to be told by a mentally handicapped person (because it is). Light in August is a little less convoluted and is fantastic. Or if you're in the mood for something shorter with plenty of creep factor, A Rose for Emily is definitely worth a read. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This week I finished **The Handmaid's Tale** by Margaret Atwood. It was on my "to-read" shelf for years and I finally decided that, with a TV series being made out of it later this year, I ought to read it. It was great - terrifying, but great. Scarier still is the idea that there are actual theocracies like the one depicted in the book in full operation in parts of the world. It's also creepy to imagine how an erosion of our civil liberties could lead us from the kind of world we live in now, here in the US, to a world like the one in the book. A lot would have to change, but simultaneously, not much would have to change. With the wrong people in control, the slippery slope towards theocracy could easily drop us into a Gilead situation. I would hesitate to make any direct real-world comparisons since at this point they would be overblown, but there are definite parallels between the trends we've seen over the past 40-50 years (with dips and peaks, not a direct line) and the way things play out in the book. And of course, that's the point.

I am rereading **The Golden Compass** this week - when I heard that there would be a new trilogy set in the world of His Dark Materials I knew it was finally time for me to reread these books. They were my favorites when I was a teenager and I am extremely excited to get back into them.

Breath of the Wild has been eating up a little too much of my time, but I hereby swear to myself that I won't let it derail my reading goal this year! </TEXT>
