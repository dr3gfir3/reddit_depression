	<TEXT> Ok, so if on the tdee calculator I checked little to no activity and ate those calories but did all my lifting+cardio+mma, that would basically be eating at a deficit?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, my question is if I eat at standard Matinence, will the increased activity consume make my energy use sufficiently high enough that it would be equivalent to a regular person (little to no activity) doing a -500 deficit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In regards to Fat loss, I was mainly wondering if eating Matinence calories with all of my cardio plus mma training would be equivalent to eating at a deficit because of the extra calories burned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a quick question about my diet.  (Current stats after 7 weeks of greyskull, 19M, 190lbs, 6', 22ish% BF) I'm doing greyskull for my current beginner LP, and I was doing a minibulk along with it to maximize my gains.  I was doing no cardio at this time.  However, last week, I was diagnosed moderate to severe depression, and my doctor said he wanted me doing daily cardio, 30 minutes steady state on lift days and 20+ mins HIIT on offdays.  He also said he didn't want me eating above my TDEE.  Also, I plan to start MMA training 2-4 times per week within the next month.  I figured that since my activity level is going to be so high it would be a good time to lose some of that bodyfat.

My question is in regards to my diet and supplementation. I'm concerned that if I eat at maintenance levels, I wont see any significant fat loss.  However, if I eat on a deficit, I'm concerned I won't have enough energy, especially for the MMA training. Getting my necessary protein isn't going to be a problem, I'm more concerned about the rest of my diet. Do you guys think that I should eat at maintenance or on a deficit?  My current supplements are 5g creatine, 1tbs fish oil, multivitimins, and 5g BCAA before cardio, and 5g BCAA during.  Any suggestions to changing the supplements would also be appreciated.

	<TEXT> It seems like the fact that I'm a virgin matters to everyone but me. My guy friends are giving me shit because of it, and the few women that I've been able to escalate successfully with have completely lost interest when the fact that I'm a virgin comes up.  These women were the only ones I've even had a remote chance of losing it with.  I didn't know that this is such a big deal. What can I do about it

	<TEXT> Very good advice, thanks! Could you clarify a few things for me though?

1) Is it the basic alpha (I don't like using alpha but it applies well here) body language that I should be conveying? Or are there things I need to adapt for the concert environment?

2)
If I see someone I like, I make eye contact and smile then simply walk up to her lean in a bit and wait for her to lean the rest of the way I say simply "Hi I'm MrADHD" and give them a twirl then say "let's dace for a bit"

Do you literally take her hand and spin her around? 

3) 
 I escalate to touching tits, ass etc then a little kiss on the neck, then a number, to making out, then try (not need, just suggest or lead) bring her (and if need be her group) to my friends and dance there.

Any particular reason you ask for a number before the make out?

I've got another concert I'm going to later this week, so I'll definitely try out your advice.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I went to my first ever EDM concert with one of my friends last night and had a great time. Just wanted to post a few observations I had as well as a question that popped up. 

1) Reading seddit material over the past few months as definitely helped me.  6 months ago if I had gone to a concert like this, I would have felt that everyone was judging me and I would have stood in a corner and done nothing.  Last night, I just felt the music and let myself dance.  It may have not been the prettiest thing, but who cares.  

2) Focusing on trying to find girls to dance with didn't yield as good of results as just letting myself go. Towards to beginning of the concert, I was in a "headhunter mode" of sorts, and was specifically looking for girls to dance with, and was starting to feel down. A little over halfway through the concert, a little voice popped up in my head and reminded me "give no fucks bro, outcome independence."  The second half of the concert then became much more enjoyable for me, since I was just focused on my fun and not placing requirements on my happiness.  


Now for the question.  I have no idea how to ask women to dance at concerts like this.  I was having to shout near the top of my lungs just to get my friend next to me to hear me.  We got to the concert a little after it started so we didn't have time to socialize and meet others before it began.  Here's a specific example: I was just out and enjoying the music (at this point I had had my revelation in point 2) and dancing around.  I turned around and there was this gorgeous HB9.  We made eye contact, I smiled and her and she returned it.  I may not have the most experience but I can tell that it was pretty sexual in nature, just based on the work I've been doing with eye contact over the past few months.  I turned away and was trying to figure out how to ask her to dance since I was clueless.  It's important to note that she was not right behind me;  there was a pretty sizable distance between us.  20 seconds later the concert ended and then she disappeared into the crowd, so I didn't have a chance to approach her after the show.  Assuming the concert wouldn't have ended right then, what would have been the best way to approach her? </TEXT>

My hi bars have pretty good form, but I cannot for the life of me get my hands into the right position for low bar squats. The only way I've been able to get remotely close is to have my hands as wide as possible to the edge of the bar, but I still couldn't get it.

	<TEXT> I often hear the squatz and oats mantra repeated, but I have a quick question. Why are oats praised so much? 150 cals and 5g protein per half cup. Seems like it would be great for cutting, but there are better ways to get more cals/protein while bulking.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Classes are going ok, the environment just sucks. Lots of hostile attitudes and seems like no one wants to be there. Everyone just goes to their classes and goes home. Trying to meet people and develop any sort of social life feels like trying to pull teeth out of a fully conscious man using only pliers. 

If you're working full time and taking supplemental classes community colleges can provide a great benefit, but for someone who just graduated high school it's a nightmare.  </TEXT>

 The clubs you wanted were shut down? (I don't even get this) Join a different club. Start a new club.

I was really looking forward to playing ultimate frisbee and inter-murals, but the school recently adopted a "No clubs with physical activity" policy, which means all these clubs got shut down.  So now the only clubs left are the career specific like paralegal club, ethic based or faith based clubs.

I'm studying comp sci.  Thats part of my problem, I've been blessed (read: cursed)  with only being good at activities that are single person things and technology related, such as video games or programming.  I've tried expanding my fields, but everything else I've tried wasn't that fun.  

It wasn't one specific person I was talking to, but in general people at the university seemed much more receptive and social then at my CC.  At my CC it basically has the environment of go to classes and go home.  You get the feeling that no one really wants to be there, so that might be why people get so unreceptive if you try to even just have small talk.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's tough being at a CC while your friends are having fun and living in the dorms. But getting out of undergrad without debt will benefit you a great deal. It's not necessarily a fair trade for the social experience of being at a four year university, but it's the best you'll get at this point. 

"You might not be having fun now, but it will benefit you in the long run."  That's what a a lot of people have said, but it isn't always true.  I busted my ass in high school to get good grades and have a college ready application, and it was all for nothing now as I'm stuck at a community college with students who (Not lying here, heard three girls around age 18-19 complaining about this) cannot do the simple math of 1/4 + 1/9.  

Try to socialize more in class. I met a great friend at my CC. Get involved in group activities off-campus or on-campus. I practice a martial art and have some friends from that.

Everyone I've tried socializing with seems like they hate the fact that I'm just talking to them. I thought it was all me until I visited my friend and using the exact same topics of conversation was able to have great discussions with people.    </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Chose community college and full of regret.  How can I fix this? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> TL;DR: Chose community college, it sucks. Time is spent browsing Reddit, watching TV or going to class.  Can't afford to transfer to big four year school unless I wait out my full two years or take out crippling loans.  How can I make my life not suck?

So when I was a senior in high school I came to the decision that I would go to community college for two years.  The driving factor for this was that if I went to CC, I could go to my dream university after two years which costs upwards of 35 grand a year, instead of going to a school with an ok program for all four years.  Right now, a couple of weeks after the halfway point of my first semester at CC, I am really unhappy with my choice.  

I was hoping to get really involved in college, and was banking on it in my decision making process.  Since I was going to be living at home, I figured it would be best to will my time with stuff at school.  However, considering my times weren't good enough for the swim team, I didn't make any roles in the theater productions at the school, and the clubs I was interested were shut down by the school and can't be re-opened, it left me with a lot of free time.  Swimming and theater were my big two things in high school, and so not having them frees up a lot of my time.  So I thought I'd just make some new friends. The best way I can describe this experience is trying to pull teeth out of a fully conscious man with a pair of pliers.  It's almost as if they don't want to talk to you at all.  For example, just trying to make pleasant conversation with someone in the line for coffee results in a one word answer or back turn. At this point I'm thinking maybe I'm just that uninteresting of a person and no one wants anything to do with me, and I've just gotten shafted socially. 

Then this weekend I went to visit one of my friends at his university.  What an amazing experience. For a concrete example, my friend wanted to introduce me to two of his friends, so we met them in some designated park for smokers on the campus.  In the half hour that we were there I talked to more people and had more friendly conversation than I had had thus far in my entire community college experience.  Going out to the parties was fun too. 

Thing is, now that I'm home, I'm even more regretful of my choice to go to community college, knowing well that if I had gone to a regular university I wouldn't be confined to browsing Reddit in my free time.  I've looked into transferring into regular universities for my sophomore year, but because of the way financial aid works at these big schools; I would actually be paying more for the schools I could have chosen as a freshman. I wish I could visit my high school friends more often, but the closest of them is 3 hours away with the majority of them being over 10 hours away.  

My question to you fine folks is how can I make my life liveable? There's nothing for me to do at school and it seems like no one wants to be my friend.  Waking up every day is like pulling knives out of my back, because I know that the only things I'll ever do once I get up is browse Reddit or go to class, whereas if I had gone to a regular school I could actually be out having a good time.  The regret of not choosing a four year school makes the pain all that much worse.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spice up that intro! The single guitar repeating gets a little monotonous after awhile.  Maybe layer a lead pattern on top of it. Also, consider breaking up the bass drum pattern.  At times it sounds like their should be a pause in it but it just keeps going.  Maybe try to match the guitar strokes.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a school project I have, I need to locate a song about a great or famous leader.  Obviously I would prefer to have a metal song; any sub-genre is fine. The song can reference any time period, any nation or civilization. After going through my music library, I have nothing on the subject at all.  I thought I could get something from Sabaton or Falconer, but so far I've had no luck. Numerous Google searches also gave me nothing. 

Any suggestions guys? </TEXT>
