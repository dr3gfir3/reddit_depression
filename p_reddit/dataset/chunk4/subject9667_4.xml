	<TEXT> I appreciate the replies I'm getting. I normally wouldn't be concerned because I am in for the long haul. I've been stacking silver for a while so that didn't really bother me. It was the gold because this was my first gold purchase and I'm not used to losing $100 overnight on a single ounce of metal haha.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I be worried? (Falling prices) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> 3 days ago I placed a rather large order from Provident, thinking that the prices were stable. Now, 3 days later, gold has dropped nearly $100 and silver almost $2 and they don't look like they're finished. 

I know that rising and falling prices are part of the game but I can't help but feel I should have waited a few days as I don't see these prices stopping their decline for a while. Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm looking at it the wrong way but the way I see it, if I spend $1,000 on silver, and the price doubles to $40/oz which seems likely, I just doubled my money. If I spent the same $1,000 on gold, if it increases proportionally, I'd only have made an extra couple hundred bucks or so.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been stacking silver for a while but have yet to purchase any of the yellow shiny. With today's slight fall in price I'm considering picking up an ounce with my next silver order today. Thoughts? Opinions? Should I stick with just silver and wait for gold to drop a bit more? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll experiment like you said using simple geometry, and I agree, it is part of the fun! And it is going to animate from old, crumbled ruins, to what it used to look like when it was new. As for that, I suppose I could just use the new geometry and then change the textures and break it up, and just animate it in reverse so to say, and put a render layer for each texture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That seems like a decent workflow, however, my camera is going to be moving, so it will definitely be very render intensive. Also, the set itself, as well as the character's clothing, will be changing geometry, not just textures/materials.

I suppose, using render layers, I could put both geometries in, like you suggested for the textures and then follow your advice for the transitioning using masks and effects.

During the transition area, how would you go about doing that? A third render layer? And then composite the three together? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's hard to actually explain. I am trying to figure out the best workflow for transforming an asset from one mesh to another seamlessly. It is supposed to go from old and decrepit, to new and polished looking. I am versed in Maya and Houdini.

If you look at [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moSFlvxnbgk) at 3:05, you can see an example of what I am trying to accomplish, however I will not only be doing it on a character, but also the set piece that she will be in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wondering if our beta characters will be playable come release time? It would be nice, because I spent a long time finding a unique character name that wasn't taken, and I don't want to lose it when the game releases. Also, it would suck to have to replay the first part of the story again in two months. </TEXT>
