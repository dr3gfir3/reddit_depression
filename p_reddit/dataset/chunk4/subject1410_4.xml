	<TEXT> I wouldn't say that he was actually a "silent protagonist" since you continuously have verbal interactions with other characters. A silent protagonist in my opinion is Gordon Freeman, who don't actually talk. In FO3 and FONV, you still talk to people. I also enjoy the skill system in FO4 as well.

Well, then we just don't agree on those things, and that's fine.

EDIT: Also, what I was talking about wasn't the fact that the protagonist is speaking or not. I pointed towards that they have switched the sentence box so that you can't read the dialogue before you use it. In that way, if you want to chuckle at his sarcastic remarks, you have to choose to say it, not just read it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly. In short words, mall cops. They are put on duty where security needs to be checked, but places that are still low threats. Such as petty thefts in malls, subway stations where fights can break out etc etc. They don't have the same full authority as an LEO, but are allowed to hold people down until police arrives.

If I'm not mistaken, there's two types of CSO's here in Sweden. The ones that can handcuff you and those who can't. Not sure about it since I'm not a part of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have for as long as I can remember been interested in studing my family history, my ancestry, heritage and so on. I have been able to reach quite some time back but then it stops. I don't have any good idea on how to continue and then I found 23andMe. The problem is that it's rather pricy for me. Living at home, recently unemployed and no higher education.

If someone would have one, or felt like sending one, that would mean the world to me.

Thank you. </TEXT>

**Johan under bron** - uteliggare som bodde under en bro i en av stadens parker. Hade jobb som han sktte, men ville inte skaffa lgenhet eller liknande.

**Cindy** - Gammal pundare vars enda replik r "HARUENKRONA" samtidigt som hon stirrar p en.

**Ralf** - alla som ngonsin har skejtat i stan vet vem Ralf r. Mrkhyad och stor som en mindre ladugrd. Gr inte att missa honom. 

**Darwin** - Ingen aning om vad han egentligen heter, men vi kan kalla honom Darwin. Mrkhyad snubbe som alltid gr kldd i reflexvst. Skelar t alla hll och kanter och pratar om Darwin hela tiden. Trodde han hade kolat rtt lnge, tills jag sg honom p stan i veckan. 

Sen har vi han som alltid sger **Jag tycker inte om att tigga** samtidigt som han ska ta i hand och bertta om att han r frn Sydamerika, att han inte tycker om att tigga men att han behver ngra kronor. 

Kan skert komma p nnu fler om jag bara tnker till. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best shaving kit for sensitive skin? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-28 16:51:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My genes won't allow me to grow a full beard, so I still look like I'm 14 years old after a week or two. So I try to keep a clean face by shaving at least twice a week.

My problem is that I have rather sensitive skin. I use Gillette Fusion (I think. The one with the blue strip) and their shaving cream for sensitive skin, but I still get sore skin after using it.

I usually shave either during a shower or directly afterwards to keep my skin as warm and moist as possible to prevent any problem. If I rub my hand against my 5 o'clock shadow (or as in my case - the day after shadow) my skin is really sore.

So, my question is - what would you guys recommend for me? Is it worth buying a more expensive kit instead of Gillette? Is there any after shave that you can recommend for sensitive skin as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not crazy over whiskey, but I can definitely enjoy varieties of it. As with wine, cheeses and other things, it's an acquired taste, really. Then, for me, it kinda goes hand in hand since I come from a family that always have been very interested in both food and drinks, so I've had the opportunity to try a rather large range of whiskeys.

But then again, people have different taste in different things! I prefer beer! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the title says, what things that people go crazy over do you not care about? Maybe you don't see the point, or you just don't get the phenomenon?

As OP I'll start:

1. Game of Thrones. I really don't get it. I just don't. I found it rather boring and mundane. But I get the pleasure of not being afraid of monday spoilers.

2. The Walking Dead. I watched the first season and din't think much of it. Not bad, but not very interesting either. 

3. Swedish rapper Silvana Imam. She's being raised to the skies for her music and for being some kind of feminist icon. I... I just don't care about her. I don't see anything that makes her special or how she stands out.

So, what things do you guys not really care about? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a beer snob, I've never heard anyone say most of these things.

About nr 5 - "Who ranks beer?". I don't know. Who ranks food? Who ranks wine? Who ranks movies? You tell me.

Nr 7 - some beer, that isn't Bud or Corona or anything like that, tastes better at room temperature. Why? Because some things taste better at certain degrees.

Anr nr 8 - obviously the person writing the article has never drank or eaten anything that feels different from water and bread. </TEXT>
