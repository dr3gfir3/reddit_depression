	<TEXT> I liked this quote, and I'm sure Stephen king will go in the history books if for nothing else besides many of his books being best sellers. He created a whole little universe inside Maine pretty much, and his ideas are pretty good. But, that being said, when you write like a million things, not all of it's good, so it is what it is. 

Now poor Dean Kootz probably has just as many, if not more books than Stephen king and literally no one knows any of his stuff. And I bet you can name 5-10 Stephen king books without even having to try hard.

It

The Stand

Carrie

Cujo

Salems lot

Pet Semetary

Misery

Green mile

Shawshank redemption

The shinning

Children of the corn

Apt pupil

Stand by me (the body)

	<TEXT> Jekyll and Hyde is only about 100 pages long. 

I go to book store and just check if they're abridged or not, I guess you could do that to get a page count and compare to a kindle book, but I don't know how kindle stuff works. Though at the bookstores, like half price, there's usual several copies of the same things, find the biggest one and look at the page count. 

For example, I've seen a ton of like 800 page copies of Count of Monte Cristo, but that books around 1300 pages. I think 1277 to be a little more specific. 

If kindle let's you select publishers, go with penguin cause I think everything is unabridged. 

Also try this

http://commonplacebook.com/art/books/word-count-for-famous-novels/

It should have a decent sized list of word counts for classics. Or not, I'm on cell phone and can't see the whole thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Literally almost done with War and Peace, like 200 pages left. And what I like about it is, it's not really about the war, I mean it's in there and it's a catalyst for the story, but the title is all symbolism for the struggle the characters are going through during all these events.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I try really hard not to know anything about a book going in, I just want to know if people think it's good and if it's worth reading. For example, I have flowers for algernon, and not even kidding, I have no clue what its about, but it's supposed to be a really good story. 

But I knew the terrible things that were supposed to happen in Lord of the flies, so when said stuff happened I wasn't hit as hard as I wished. 

I had no idea what Death of a salesman was about, and when I got it I didn't even know it was a play, and I read it and was almost torn apart from everything that happened. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I'm beginning to see the finish line of War and Peace (only 600 pages left) it got me wondering, what's the longest book others have read?

For me, at least until I finish this, it was Count of Monte Cristo, which I think is still around 1277 pages, this being 1388, and hopefully one day it'll be In Search of Lost Time.

Also what's your strategy for tackling these huge tomes, if you have one. For me I write the day I start on a little bookmark and then the day I finish, this was stated December 1st and hopefully will be done before the end of February. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe you're right, the "e'en" is the same. The copyright stuff in the book was very sparse, basically just says who the illustrator is.

I already own o copy of The Divine Comedy, it's translated by someone named Oakley I believe, I never made my way through it because poetry is difficult for me, but I felt with what I skimmed over in this version, it was easier for me to understand, so hopefully I'll finally make my way through. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> To me Nier was the saddest game I've ever played </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I first heard of Nier nobody could explain what it was or what made it special. Everything about it was generic, but it still had something to it.

But I want to break this down for people unfamiliar with it. The sorry starts off sparse, in fact when you beat it, nothing is really explained, until you start a new game. Now there are 4 different endings to the game, but here's where Nier shines, slowly unveiling the story. 

See your first play through, you're the hero doing hero things and fighting the bad guys, fun stuff right, oh there's a giant wolf Ha, easy fight.

Beat the game.

Second play through, wait...what, why do these things I'm killing have backstories, wait...what am I doing.

Third play through...wait...no..Roc...

Fourth play through...I hate literally everything.

I don't want to spoil too much, but I know when people talk about their saddest games, I don't ever see this one mentioned.

Do you have any hidden gems or unknown games that you feel hit you emotionally?
