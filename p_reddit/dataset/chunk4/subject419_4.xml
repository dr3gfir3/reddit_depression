	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm wanting to properly perk up my gear for dps and was wandering what the best set up for perks is? I found this list.

Weapon = precise 5   Aftershock 3

Armor 1 = Biting 3, impatient 3/devoted 3

Armor 2 = Crackling 3, absorbtive 


Some of the perks overlap, such as precise and devoted comi from arms components and impatient and devoted from zamorak components. So I was wandering what the best thing to do would be? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mob spawner help </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-12 15:59:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Iv tried to build a mob spawner near my base, iv built a room with 0 light, most caves near by are all lit and I'm stood about 20 to 25 blocks away. But nothing is spawning. Iv built the same size room on a creative world and it spawns a lot of mobs. The only difference I can find is that the survival one is made of clay and the creative is quartz. Any suggestions as to why nothing is spawning?

edit: some screen shots that hopefully help...

	<TEXT> Fellow rs vet here, played about 12 years myself. My biggest thing g is the difference in quests. Runescapes quests are vastly superior to wow quests. I find wow quests to be all the same, just different locations where as the rs ones are all different. Plus, quests on wow are probably the best way to level a new character, almost necessary, where as, again, rs isn't.  </TEXT>
