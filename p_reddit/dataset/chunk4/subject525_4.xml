	<TEXT> I feel like Rowen needs a greeting that actually.. greets. Reporting for duty seems like something you say to a superior, not an opponent.

EDIT: Now that I think about it, "Don't let it get to you" isn't an apology either, but probably the best BM in the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the fact that the ambush minions are on the board and Rogue's Creed can be removed by Odin etc.. makes the deck fine. I have played against it one or two times and if I lost I never felt annoyed, just impressed. D-Shift on the other hand... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's more to do with how most of his audience is there for Hearthstone and if he plays something else his viewership will drop and he will lose money (I mean look at how many dislikes his youtube shadowverse videos get for no reason). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel if a card does start getting out of control they can implement an algorithm that will pair the card with something considerably weaker, balancing the pick out. I always felt the ability to this down the line was one of the biggest strengths of this drafting format. </TEXT>
