	<TEXT> I read the book in high school and watched the whole series in a day. I think what makes the show so effective is how committed it was to showing what it is teens today are dealing with when it comes to high school. Like some of the stuff has changed a little since the book first came out, but a lot of it has not and that's kind of heartbreaking.  </TEXT>
