	<TEXT> Would like the data to stay in the data table. The button click/link would then 'copy'/use data from row to fill out the appropriate cells in another excel sheet. That's what I'm aiming for. 

Not sure what a helper column is and how to the lookup to find x thing, but I'll look into it.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there!

Have a table of data and want certain rows' data to go into a standard form (in another excel sheet). 

More specific/steps:
1) user desires Material A's form, based on data in Material A's row
2) highlights row/ or just clicks hyperlink etc (being able to make it repeatable for new materials)
3) new excel workbook's sheet pops up, in the form's appropriate cells are Material A's data

Should I be going into VBA for it, is there a simple macro to be made etc.

Been looking around and getting wrapped up in hyperlink info and VBA stuff (which I've gotten very rusty at).

Thanks so much </TEXT>
