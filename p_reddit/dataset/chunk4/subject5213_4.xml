	<TEXT> I added it to the chicken to cut through some of the sweetness.  There was none of that fish sauce odor once it cooked into the sauce.  Another part of it might just be acquired.  Vietnamese dishes that used a lot of fish sauce (to the point it smelled really pungent) were too much for me l, but now it's something I sometimes crave lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you!  For the noodles I pan-fried some cooked soba noodles with sesame oil, minced garlic, and chopped carrots and onion.  Touch of salt.  The chicken is pan-fried with minced garlic, little bit on onion in oil until browned.  Add fish sauce, chili garlic sauce, brown sugar, and soy sauce and glaze chicken before turning off heat.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its going to be mom, no  dad. I kept telling myself repeatedly.  I fidgeted and tried not to immediately see who was walking towards me.  The footsteps were deafening. 


Please let it be mom..  I pleaded lightly.  But I knew who was coming.  The person I had actually hurt the most.  


To my surprise I found a younger man walking towards me.  An adolescent, maybe 16 or 17.  More attractive than me, wearing black jeans and a shirt I forgot I had.  He smiled at me in a way that I never smile now.  Naturally, and genuine.  Ten years ago this was me. 


For what was either 2 seconds or 5 minutes we stared at each other.  How do I explain myself?  I just wanted to tell him how sorry I was.  What I had done to this kid.  But before I could speak he started.

This was a point in life where I could have branched off into a dozen different directions.  His demeanor was so casual.  I was standing in silence, holding back tears. 
He didnt seem sad, or distraught.  No, he wouldnt have been those things.  Not yet.  


Heh.  You know, I was told in one of those alternate paths I could have been married, and working our dream job.  How crazy is that? 


I dont know how my face reacted, but he tried to make me feel better ..but then again I could have also overdosed at 21 had you continued being friends with Eric Meyer.  So it isnt so bad when you think about it he smirked.  I hadnt heard that name in forever.  Last I remembered, Eric and I had grown apart after high school for some reason.

Why arent you upset at me?  Im so sorry.  I-I wanted better for you. I jumbled my words, and tried to say so much more but tears were streaming and my voice felt paralyzed.  


Hey dont cry.  So you made some bad decisions?  It isnt --  


I fucked up so much.  Wasted so much time.  Alienated people who love you.  Did things I could never take back.  You know, things have never been the same with mom and dad?  This isnt what I wanted for you, none of it.  we both stood in silence and his demeanor changed to serious.  


He started softly, I might be standing here.  But Im still a part of you.  We did go through a lot.  And Im sorry too for how things turned out.  He stepped forward and hugged me and then whispered, but now its time to make things better.


I was confused.  What do you mean?  What happens now?  Arent I dead?


Well *technically* no.  Maybe half dead?  Youre not conscious.  But for whatever reason it's been decided its time for you to go back."  He paused, then started more seriously.  "Youve lost sight on the things I wanted, old man.  Its time for you to finally take them.


Old man? Im only 27! I wasnt sad or crying anymore.  I understood now.  Why I was here.  This wasnt the end.  Only the beginning.


Younger me looked off into the distance.  It was white everywhere.  But far away on the horizon you could faintly see green mountains.  I had never seen anything like it. I guess neither had he.  He looked down at his feet.  We'll be over there some day, just not now... But hey, dont forget about me, alright?  And jeeze dont text and drive anymore, you asshole.


He looked at me almost eagerly, clenching his fists. Ive seen a future for us.  A good one.  You can do it.


Before I got the chance to reply I blacked out along with the sensation of falling.  In a hazy dream I could feel the air and smells around me change.  I felt heavy, sore, and dizzy.  I could hear the sounds of the hospital.  The beeping, muffled noises, nurses hurriedly walking.  


Was it just a dream?  No, I knew it wasnt.  I looked at a dry erase board with information scribbled on it.  I studied it for a moment before seeing my name and pausing.


I wont let you down this time.  Not this time.  Not again.

Note:  Sorry, I never write and so am not the best at it.  But I had to write this one.

	<TEXT> People can usually taste the difference between tomatoes and other produce that aren't picked until ripe and ready to eat/cook.  Makes me wonder about bananas and other tropical fruits that would be impossible to get "vine/tree-ripened" for many of us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's what I did:

2 cups cooked chicken (diced)
1/4 cup adobo sauce
1/4 cup diced onions
1 TB oil
salt   pepper to taste
corn tortillas + oil

Garnish: chopped cilantro, minced onion, salsa, lime wedges

Heat and cook chicken and onions with salt and pepper in oil until slightly browned over medium high heat.  Browned and crispy bits are desired.  Add adobo sauce, combine and continue heating on medium-lo until it's not too wet anymore.  Set aside.  

Heat up corn tortillas with a small amount of oil on medium high heat.  Heat until warmed and just slightly crisp. 

To serve, stack 2 tortillas per taco, topping generously with chicken.  Add garnishes as you like.

I can post a recipe for the salsa (salsa de chile arbol) if you want.   </TEXT>
