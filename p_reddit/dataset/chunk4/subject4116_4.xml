	<TEXT> I assume you mean there wont be a next league between now and Fall of Oriath, but that's certainly not guaranteed. This league started more than a month ago and we have atleast 2 more months until Oriath, which does line up. Except that the release date is currently June/July, and if it's July then there will be atleast a month between end of this league and the release of Fall of Oriath. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Streamers like Mr_Aek have shown faster ways than BV. Him and I worked together to get speeds within 10 seconds of the top runners last league. If you knew anything what so ever about the currency meta of lab running, you'd know this. I'm not going to hold your hand. You're the one spouting off as if you know what people are doing at the top. Go watch Mr_Aek or one of the other top streamers. Their stream link is literally on their ladder name. You're just being lazy.

It's not my job to evidence your statements, you're the lazy one not me. If you'd like to make a claim, while complaining about my lack of evidence for my claim, then you can either provide evidence or you can kindly go fuck yourself.

All he has to do is hit you once to wif your (sometimes) perfect run. Please spare me the cynical comments. Nobody here cares.

I'm sorry, is it too much effort for you to dodge the maybe one slam or major attack that'll happen in those 3 seconds? Because that's the only thing that's gonna 1 shot you. His auto-attack certainly wont.

If you can kill him faster and safer than BV, and choose not to because, 'it's easy.' Go ahead.

The fuck are you talking about? You're the one claiming you have a way to kill him faster and safer than BV, although you have yet to provide this method.

	<TEXT> Thanks, and I'm glad to see that you've provided evidence for your supposed faster way to kill Izaro than BV. I'm also glad that you think pressing x to swap to your dual-wield scourge is the same as a gear swamp macro. Lastly, I'm really glad that you think the 3 seconds it takes to get enough poison stacks on Izaro can be termed "having to sit on Izaro".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So first off, Jugg node specifies both movement speed and speed, which right away tells you that there are two stats at work here. Secondly, it says "below base movement speed" and "below base speed", which tells you that it wont slow you below what your base speed is, before any modifiers like movespeed from boots or such.

In my opinion, the way it works makes perfect sense and is intuitive so long as you actually read the node. 

Kaom's Roots is a different case, but that's because it doesn't imply that there is a difference between speed and movement speed. Imo the term "speed" should be changed to "animation speed", or something similar, to avoid this confusion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Incorrect. You can be slowed below 100% movement speed, but not below 100% animation speed with Kaom's, but not with Jugg.

Edit: with Kaom's, but not with Jugg. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you can tell is incorrect. Tar and darts slow movement speed, not animation speed. Kaom's Roots do exactly the same thing as the Jugg node. </TEXT>
