	<TEXT> just as a general note to folks going "UGH WHY DIDNT SHE JUST BLOCK HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE"

she didn't because 

* 1) they had a mutual friend, 

* 2) he messaged her with the pretense of honest intentions (questions about a university she had previously attended), and 

* 3) she is a good person who understands that folks sometimes have difficulty communicating with other people. she was willing to give him a shot and say "hey, those remarks aren't appropriate, please stop," because she is a teacher and a damn good one, and trying to course correcting idiots is kind of a reflex when you deal with college students all day.



sometimes it's easier to be nice than to have to worry about some dude flipping out and tagging your friends on his wall to call you an egotistical cunt for blocking him "for just saying hi." </TEXT>
