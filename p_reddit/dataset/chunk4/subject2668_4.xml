	<TEXT> That was so real, you can say what you want but that was real.  Bill respects Chris for what he has done for the game and knowing it was his last broadcast to take the time to acknowledge that after the roller coaster of emotions was something that will stick with me.  That meant a lot to Chris because he knows bill doesn't do that for anyone.   The mutual respect brought a couple tears, not even gunna lie. Chris berman was such a big part of my childhood and bill was my first hero and to see the two of them have that moment...fucking chills and tears at the same time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't remember seeing a wrestler make things look so stiff yet so perfect. He flirts with disaster because the moves in that match especially have little to no room for error.  Okada's skill speaks for itself but you can just tell how much that crowd appreciated omega.  When omega jumped backwards over the guard rail I shit myself but he landed it perfectly. Top 5 match I've ever seen period </TEXT>
