	<TEXT> There is hope. Fortunately, there are people who were admitted to Rutgers, but for reasons decide to decline the admission. (Safety School, No Financial Aid, Accepted to Top Choice, etc...)  All schools accept more than they can house due to the fact that students do decline admission. Just be patient, there is always a chance to be admitted from the waitlist. Also, you can enroll at a community college and then transfer into SAS (on terms that you fulfilled articulation agreements of the associate's degree.  If you choose this route, you can lessen the weight of the SAT score and HS GPA. Rutgers offers transfer scholarships for top performers in CC in state). 

Don't worry you have options if things don't work out with Rutgers. I' m sure you've applied other places as well. 

Good Luck! (Don't wait around for them, though.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many students are left with a false sense of security. There are students from different parts of NJ and other states, who are not familiar with the area. If you're not familiar with NB, a large percentage of the population is at or below the poverty line. Like any other city, there are rough parts where drugs and organized crime is prevalent. Yes, MS-13 exists as do the Bloods. These gangs have affiliated members in and around the NB area.    

Also, if you've ever been hit up for money by a group of guys claiming to sell candy for their youth athletic programs...those are gangbangers. When the weather is nice and students are out and about....they'll walk around the voorhees mall near Scott Hall.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New Brunswick is a dangerous place. I posted this because it seems  students are oblivious to their surroundings. This happened very close to campus where many students reside in off campus housing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good stuff. If you want the party scene Myrtle Beach has a place called Broadway at the Beach. There are bars, clubs, and restaurants all in one area. 

Usually, Broadway at the Beach is the main hangout for college spring breakers because of the proximity of all the bars and clubs. They may still offer pay one price wristband to club and bar hop, but I'm not sure.  A lot of Coastal Carolina students.

North Myrtle Beach is the safer part, along with Cherry Grove Beach.  

Just a few tips: Like anywhere else, if you look for trouble...you'll find it. Stay away from Socastee, downtown Myrtle Beach (a little past the ferris wheel) and Atlantic Beach (at night). If you see groups of bikers, let them be and DO NOT tailgate, yell or "disrespect" them. These are real biker gangs that travel to Myrtle for conventions and so-called bike weeks. Last time I was there, they took the area over and flaunted their presence at every turn. MB has bike week, let's hope it's not during spring break. lol 

Traveling is easy. There are two main routes up and down the area. 
Use 17 Local for access to all the stores and beach access via Ocean Blvd (This route has a ton of lights, if you do not want to sit in traffic, use 31 Carolina Bays Pkwy, to cut your commute from one end of Myrtle to the other.

Use 501 to go inland. There is a huge outlet center off of 501, going towards Conway.  Conway is home to Coastal Carolina, but don't expect a huge campus presence as it is a commuter campus. Literally, one road by Horry-Georgetown Technical College leads you to the campus. 

Also, remember this is South Carolina. People are friendly, but if you treat them rudely, they'll let you know about it. lol And as a side note, many people have fire-arm permits. Do not act like a drunken dick to people while driving. lol SC has lax gun laws which allow gun owners to conceal carry as long as the firearm is concealed in a locked compartment in the vehicle. The "Jersey attitude" does not fly down there. I say this not to scare you, but to be cognizant of the environment you're in. 

CHARLESTON - one of the oldest cities in the country. True southern hospitality. Fun place to be, beaches are there, too. College of Charleston is 70% girls as their are no shortage of southern belles walking around.  For the ladies, there is a ton of shopping. 

Spring Break is supposed to be fun. So get fucked up, try to spell your name correctly, and get home safe so your family can watch you graduate! 

Safe travels! Good Luck!  </TEXT>
