	<TITLE> My idea for a big television serial.... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-13 15:22:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is why reddit is not TV execs... We can do better than this.  
In fact, let me try.....  
A series set in ancient Greece where the gods are real and intertwined with the affairs of man. All the legendary heroes (i.e. Hercules, Odysessus, Achilles, are all real, the gods i.e. Apollo, Zeus, and Gaia, Hades, The Titans, and the real people like Plato, Homer, The Oracle, and so on. All of them, and at the same time despite historicity. There are soooo many baller stories out of that realm, and I picture it like one of my favorite animations... [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l_EDBM1tOEo) and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKfAF4jVqnA). Imagine a series done with that kind of beauty. You could also have the threats of war from outside the realm. Anyway, that's my idea. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As OP said, quite well, they're a "me-first" culture.. they feel a desperate need to flash and project power, to control lives, to control people, but at base root, they are so unbelievably insecure. Projects of power are the bells and whistles of a coward state (for example, North Korea's rocket tests).  
  
What is China insecure of? Truth and freedom. They're afraid of their people getting /woke and realizing the extent of the control apparatus. They're afraid of ["I"](http://i.imgur.com/JKCoz.jpg).  
  
How does the apparatus fail? Well, as soon as they are no longer able to keep up the story of infinite progress and lifting up all Chinese (and keeping up these narrative with absolutely sickeningly destructive effect on the environment), once the leaks in the apparatus of hiding insecurity... once that happens the collapse will come so fucking fast it will astound.  
  
edit: I already spotted [one suspicious account](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/4sg39i/the_hague_rejects_chinas_sovereignty_claims_in/d592mjx?context=3 st=iqjfpt59 sh=f6386d5e), you can be sure they're here, controlling message here.

I have enjoyed the memes.. but I don't know if this game will make it through the week with this level of popularity. If you could battle friends and strangers.. that's where things would get very interesting. I wonder if the problem is the fighting strangers thing, presumably you would be able to if you could find friends in near field.. because that could get into a really grey area socially speaking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's because... for white people they *don't* want it to be true. They don't think it can be true, they don't want a world where they are in positions of power shooting down a race of people, they don't want to be the face of this, or face the reality of this, so they deny. Because the reality is, it hurts white people too, to be the face of hegemonic systematic execution of a race.... that don't feel good, that has consequences-- so the only way they can make it seem *not true* is by trying to find some kind of excuse that a cop would do that, the only way to do that is by putting blame on the victim. I'm not saying this is right, I'm saying that is the reason you're seeing all this denial and blame shifting.  
  
please note: this has brought some weird comments.. so.. this isn't blaming white people.. I'm explaining why, naturally, they would wish to seek any avenue of plausible deniability. Nor am I saying *all* white people ffs. If you are arguing against with those points, you're missing the point completely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact is Trump would send us down a path that we can't even comprehend. To elect him would be a great shame upon so many who have *actually* tried to make this country great. It wouldn't be steps backwards, it would be going off the path completely. He has a certain appeal, and those who are hearing him have very serious grievances, but unfortunately even those to whom he is appealing, he will damage if president. The man doesn't love America, the man hasn't been good to America, his ego is a blackhole that sucks up everything in its path and knows no satisfaction. To vote for him, would be to vote for ego in its most pure form. To vote for him is to not vote for America's best interests, but for one man's best interests.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think most Americans have. The fact is he hasn't done much in office. I mean that *not disparagingly. But he hasn't got a record of leadership that I've seen people point to, nor does he have a coalition of friendships. Also he hasn't had much foreign policy involvement at all so it would make sense that his name would be absent from the world. I don't think most of America had heard of him before the election. Again, not being mean, just what I see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting breakdown, good points. Something I want to bring up... his whole "going after the Clintons" speech next week I see as a continuation of bad direction. This base level mudslinging that worked against a bunch of doofuses that was the Republican field... but there's a lot of people who have heard garbage against the Clintons for so long it just is old hat at this point. Hillary is a nimble navigator and has been dodging mud her whole life.. and it's not like he'll have any new information? Why go there? A lot of people just don't even want to go there, it's old, over, buried.  
  
So the thing is this little speech is designed to be his response to getting BTFO by the foreign policy speech, one that demonstrated experience. This will just look entirely unequal to that effort. There is no way this will hurt Hillary, or make him look good. I wonder if he'll just drop it. He could do a speech on a million things, a focused message speech. If he were to do a series of speeches where he dropped cohesive plans... *that* is how he could engender interest. Not TMZ trash talking. </TEXT>
