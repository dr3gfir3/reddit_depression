meanwhile, i have friend after friend after friend posting shitpost after shitpost after shiptpost demanding that people get offended that buzzfeed found one christian dipshit on twitter who complained about this sbux cup design. 

it is SO draining and not worth your time or the rise in your blood pressure. 

And i honestly dont even know what the original controversy is about because the "journalistic ideas out there are just retarded blog posts calling libtards up to arms but having NOTHING of consequence to say. 

i guarantee you that Starbucks will do JUST FINE this Christmas with their updated cups. the only reason there is a controversy in the first place is because your cheesedick friends manufactured one.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any Alan Moore fans? He answered 75 questions for Horror Week on Goodreads. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-30 17:10:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Goodreads Link](https://www.goodreads.com/author/3961.Alan_Moore/questions)

*What happens to you when you write?*

**Alan Moore** I probably shouldnt play favourites, but for my money this is perhaps the most interesting question Ive been asked all year. I dont know. I dont know what happens to me when I write, because Im not sure if we have adequate language to describe, even to ourselves, what it is to use language in a purposeful way. I know that my consciousness, if I am immersed in writing something demanding, is moved into a completely different state than the one which I inhabit during most of my waking life. Neither is it like dreaming, having much more focus and control. If Im writing, as I often do, something which requires messing around with the structure or vocabulary of the English language, then I find myself entering some very unusual mental spaces indeed. Writing the Lucia Joyce chapter of Jerusalem, Round the Bend, I found myself in a kind of synaptic cascade-state that had a delirious, mind-expanding bliss to it. By contrast, writing the collapsed future-vernacular of Crossed +100, I found myself ending up slightly depressed just by the experience of having a limited language with a subsequently limited number of things that the characters could think, or feel, or conceive of. What I suspect is happening is that, as started earlier, our entire neurological reality can be seen as being made from words at its most immediate level. When you descend into this level of our reality, the code of our reality if you like, then whether consciously or not; whether deliberately or not, you are working magic. So, the answer to your question as to what happens to me when I write, is the most banal and useless answer you will ever get from an author: the magic happens. I hope that the fact that its me saying that and that I mean the above statement with absolute conviction, along with all of its potentially frightening implications, will be enough to make it sound a little less fatuous. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sex aside ... who is using who? 

There have been some camera angles and things where we know Allison is a snake. She was trying to backdoor Saul during the leaks. We saw her face when Assad's plane blew up ... *she knew*. 

Also, her station got the information leaked in the first place AND they lost the blogger when they were tracking her (with the fire alarm) and I STILL think that she's either totally inept or she's letting that happen on purpose. 

So she has some other agenda besides Saul's version of what the CIA's agenda is to say the least. 

I'm confused about Saul. 

He HAS to know that she's a mole. What is he getting from Allison? 

Seems like with his ex-wife Mira cheating on him ... that Saul would be quite a bit hip to the wily ways of women. I'm just not sure what he's getting out of her to keep furthering this relationship.  </TEXT>

Who would be the guy that Rick goes to for advice now? Who is brave enough to pull Rick back from the edge? Is it Daryl or Morgan? 

Daryl seems to be softening quite a bit. And I'm not quite sure *who* Morgan is right now. It's like Morgan is more of a paternal figure to Rick and Daryl is the fraternal.

	<TITLE> Losing weight: is it really just as simple as calories in versus calories out? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-02 23:07:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was reading this article from Atlantic: [Why It Was Easier to Be Skinny in the 1980s](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/09/why-it-was-easier-to-be-skinny-in-the-1980s/407974/)

The article makes the following claim: 
people today are about 10 percent heavier than people were in the 1980s, even if they follow the exact same diet and exercise plans.

The reasons which might cause this to be so were stated in the article as the following: 

First, people are exposed to more chemicals that might be weight-gain inducing. Pesticides, flame retardants, and the substances in food packaging might all be altering our hormonal processes and tweaking the way our bodies put on and maintain weight.

Second, the use of prescription drugs has risen dramatically since the 70s and 80s. Prozac, the first blockbuster SSRI, came out in 1988. Antidepressants are now one of the most commonly prescribed drugs in the U.S., and many of them have been linked to weight gain.

Finally, Kuk and the other study authors think that the microbiomes of Americans might have somehow changed between the 1980s and now. Its well known that some types of gut bacteria make a person more prone to weight gain and obesity. Americans are eating more meat than they were a few decades ago, and many animal products are treated with hormones and antibiotics in order to promote growth. All that meat might be changing gut bacteria in ways that are subtle, at first, but add up over time. Kuk believes the proliferation of artificial sweeteners could also be playing a role.

Just some food for thought. 


I personally think 100 calories of a fruit or veggie would be preferred over 100 calories of starburst the candy! But it seems when ONLY talking about weight loss, those two scenarios would result in the same output (ie. scale weight) when it came to the calories in versus calories out purists. I just can't envision your body processing those two scenarios the same way though. But, I am no scientist. I'm just going off intuition.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That arena is apparently FULL of "walkers". 

Is the military planning on bombing it? I'm guessing there will not be a lot of headshots going on if they just bomb the arena. But wouldnt some of the infected be "protected" by the other infected? They might lose an arm or something, but there are instances where the head might be protected? 

Which brings me to TWD when the city apparently got napalmed? Did that effectively kill the walkers? Did the military expect that the napalm wouldnt have 100% kill rate? Did it have 100% kill rate? Do I not understand bombs and napalm? 

Im asking if corralling zombies and bombing them would be better than just killing them one by one with headshots?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, Ive recently listened to a few audiobooks read by the author. Bill Bryson, Amy Poehler, Aziz Ansari ... 

Comedians are the best because instead of reading it in their voice, you're actually hearing it how they envisioned it. (I have George Carlin one to listen to next, it just wouldnt be the same from a different narrator!)

But I'm currently listening to Chris Hadfeld's An Astronaut's Guide to Life on Earth ... and I just LOVE how he narrates his audiobook as well as the subject matter! Must be all that military training and talking into mics. 

Do you guys have any authors that read their own books and really enjoyed the experience? Please share  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does anyone add a pinch of sea salt to their water? (Warning: Pee talk) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-14 17:52:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: I HATE drinking water. I will typically drink just when I'm thirsty or if I KNOW I'm going to hot yoga or a long workout where I just need to be hydrated. I dont ever *feel* dehydrated but after some workouts, not gonna lie, I guzzle water. 

The reason why I don't like drinking water is that I feel it goes right through me. Like I will drink water and then 10 minutes later, I'm peeing out basically clear liquid. I HATE that. 

Also, when I am about to work out, I have to get out my pre-workout pee. And it's literally just a tinkle. And that's annoying. 

Sidenote: I sweat. A lot. 

So, I was halfway listening to a podcast with Tim Ferris/Kelly Starrett (so dont quote me on any of this!). And I just heard them say something like how plain water is just "diluting your body" and then one of the guys said something about how he adds a pinch of sea salt to his water. And it gets into the body a bit better (like tendons and stuff? I dont know I wasnt really paying attention). But I do have a chemistry degree and I know that salts and ionic things facilitate the movement of water bc it's polar. So, I dont know, it made sense and I thought, hey, why not try it out. 

So I added a pinch of sea salt to my water yesterday. 

And I didnt pee out all the water. I went to the bathroom a normal amount of time. Like 3 times at work. 

And I went to the gym. I only lifted, but I didnt sweat that much at all! Like our gym doenst have AC so Im typically dripping sweat (and we're in 90 degree/humid weather most of the time). I didnt do my nervous pee either. 

I'm probably retaining some of the water, but it's only a PINCH of salt. So I wouldnt think it'd be like eating a bag of potato chips. I cant even taste the salt in the water, so I couldnt imagine it making THAT much of a difference. Like maybe I'm biasing my experiences to favor putting sea salt in my water? 

I'm going to try this out for a few weeks. 

Has ANYONE else heard of putting sea salt in their water? And what would be the positive benefits of doing so? I cant find much with a google search so I thought maybe you guys might have heard things? Broscience thoughts appreciated.  </TEXT>

Unseaming came out in 2014 and the stories really remind me of modern day horror movies at times! I just got done reading the 2nd short story where, every morning, everyone in the world wakes up covered in blood that has come out of their pores. And no one knows why!

I did a search and didnt find the book mentioned so just throught I'd throw this out to the horror readers! </TEXT>

The schedule is [here](https://games.crossfit.com/schedule). 

And the list of workouts is [here](http://games.crossfit.com/workouts/games). 

Most of the individual and Team events will be on ESPN. But if you're outside the US, you can stream most everything on youtube, I think. 

There are just some great athletes: Lauren Fisher is on Teams this year (so is Miranda Oldroyd). Anna Tunnicliffe is an ex-Olympian. Camille Leblanc-Bazinet's pictures get thrown around everywhere on the internet. Elisabeth Akinwale is Strong af. Brooke Wells, Brooke Ence, Kara Webb, the Icelandic women ... like it should be good times this weekend. 

Again, a lot of those "fitspiration" photos (which is a whole other topic) has a lot of Crossfit females on it. 

I know crossfit gets tons of hate on /r/Fitness but Crossfit is like 60% females in most crossfit gyms. And it's not perfect, but most of the gyms out there try for safe, fun programming!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whats the best or funniest piece of Sherlock fan fiction or fan art youve seen?

I dont know the funniest. Theres been some eye-watering stuff of Benedict and Martin together. A load of it has been superb. Theres a tendency to disparage it. I dont agree. Even the slash fiction, thats a great way to learn to work. No one really does three-act structure, but just trying to put words that make somebody else turned on, thats going to teach you more about writing than any writing college you can go to. Its creative and exciting. I refuse to mock itbecause Im a man who writes Sherlock Holmes fan fiction for a living!

	<TEXT> Hello,

Thank you guys for subscribing to this subreddit. I have finally deleted the blogspam. Thank you for the reports.

I'm not a "trained" moderator or anything. I just really love the nutritarian lifestyle. But I'm learning, and I will try to keep the page looking a little cleaner. 

Whether or not something is blogspam or not is up to my discretion (for now). But typically, if you have a new reddit account and the link is low quality (in terms of information) and the ads are pretty obvious, your link will be marked as spam or removed. 

Thank you! </TEXT>

Do you have the story already written out and you post the 1st chapter after the whole thing is written? 

Do you write it as you post it and just finish chapters each week? What if it's not completely to your liking or you get writers' block? Do you have a full-time job?? Like how do you have time to do this/?

I'm more curious how the post-as-you-write people do it. . . . I have a full time job and I like to work out and watch tv and I teach yoga every now and then, so I struggle with time management. . . .  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm currently listening to Pines by Blake Crouch. And the guy is constantly beaten up and in pain. I'm so stressed out listening to it!

Also (I sound like a broken record) Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, the story of WWII Olympian Louis Zamperini ... his life was like one amazing or catastrophic thing or the other. He certainly lived on the edges of life. 

I read both of these (not audiobooks), but I assume The Martian (Andy Weir) and Silo (Hugh Howey) would be similar.

	<TEXT> Hi! I'm a long time Georgian. And I automatically root for the Braves and Falcons and Hawks. My parents even have a signed ball or something from Lenny Wilkins. 

But I've definitely not kept up with the Hawks. Obviously, they've been on an amazing winning streak. But they don't have any "huge" names that I know (like people who have played on the USA Olympic Team). I'm just curious how they're winning. Is there a standout player? Good defense? Good offense? Turnovers? What makes them better than the other guys?? 

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Gone Girl was great and all. But I'm just wondering if the whole unreliable narrator thing is going to be the next best trend in bestseller fiction. Sometimes these "what *really* happened" stories can turn into the author pulling an ending out of their ass. Before I Go To Sleep by SJ Watson (I felt) did this. The ending just kind of comes out of nowhere. 

Anyways, reader beware.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!

This is my first time doing Whole30. I'm doing it with my gym and it's a HUGE motivation to see the pics of what the other people are eating for the Whole30 Challenge. 

But I was at a local farmers market and they had a young coconut for $0.99. I've never even messed around with coconuts at THAT stage of their lifecycle but I thought I'd try it out for 99 cents. Worse case scenario, I'd be out a buck. 

I got the recipe from [breaking muscle](http://breakingmuscle.com/nutrition/cuckoo-for-coconuts-how-to-buy-and-eat-young-coconuts). 

* 1 young coconut - the water inside and the meat
* 2 spoonfuls of raw almond butter (or 1/4 cu almonds but the blog recommends almond butter)
* 5 pitted dates
* 1/2 cu water
* ca. 4 ice cubes

I added some cinnamon (I accidentally dumped probably too much in). used this expensive nut butter from costco, and didnt use the ice cubes (but I did stick my drink in the fridge bc it was too warm for me!). 

I just want to make two comments. 

1. If you're missing dairy, this was the most milkish thing I've experienced! With the cinnamon, it tasted like leftover milk from cereal. 
2. I feel like dates are cheating. They sweeten everything. They are amazing. I've used them in a few smoothies and, oh my gosh, so sweet. 

This is my first Whole30, so let me know if something is not "compliant". I know smoothies are not the first thing to grab on Whole30. But they really do satiate me, and I find them pretty convenient for me. 

Anyways, here's an [album](http://imgur.com/a/gdEnO) of the drink. SO GOOD.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a ao3 thing, I signed up for Yuletide not really understanding how it worked. One of my options was Homeland (which I ended up having to write for). It's on Showtime and the main characters work for the CIA and generally go after terrorists in the Middle East. 

Turns out, I have NO CLUE about the culture in the Middle East. I couldnt really come up with a plot that was CIA related. I feel like I should get a u tried anyways award. 

I will probably NEVER write a Doctor Who fic (even though I love the show) because I don't know anything about British culture or speak. 

And I just got into watching Penny Dreadful, and I would probably be dreadful at that because I dont think I could write their speech convincingly enough. 

Even with The Walking Dead, I have trouble with the gun scenarios bc I know nothing about how to handle or store guns. 



Here is my first CIA story ... http://archiveofourown.org/works/2907656?view_full_work=true

Also, if you have any suggestions for writing CIA stuff, I'd appreciate it. I bought some Homeland books. So I'll read those and see if I'm just trying to overcomplicate things.

The book is split into a few sections: Beginners Writing Prompts (it's a super short section, don't worry); Constrained Writing (that's where you are forced into absolutely specific criteria for the prompt); Flash Fiction (either a word count or a time count is imposed upon you); Ripper Prompts (you are given a list of items for "Random Item Prompts"); and the bulk of the book ends with basic writing prompts with which you can write as much as you please with no tricks!  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seems like my writing includes a lot of "grabbed" and "looked". And I can maybe use "clutched" "seized" for grabbed. And "Gaze" or "stare" for look ... but, I dont know. Is there something stylistically I could do to get away from these words? 

If there's a quiet moment in a conversation, how do you convey that person A looked at person B. Moments passing? 


And it seems like my writing involves people picking things up in a hurry. They snatch it or they grab it. That's all I got!

I have to think this is just me making poor stylistic choices. 

Do other people have this issue with other words? Or am I just not thinking outside the box with my descriptions?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I dont really post here that much (probably obvious by the thread title). 

But I saw that Chris Rock made the following comment: 

Tupac might be a political leader if he was alive, but then again, Tupac might be in a Tyler Perry movie right now, so you dont know.

I ALWAYS thought if Tupac were still around, he'd be more political. He's not like Snoop or anything. 

But then I read that Chris Rock thing about Tyler Perry and I just wonder "wow, *would he* be up in Tyler Perry movies?"

What say you guys? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Crimson Peak directed by Guillermo del Toro, starring Jessica Chastain, Tom Hiddleston, Charlie Hunnam, Mia Wasikowska ... I'm kind of excited about it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-20 04:18:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This post is just going to be me rambling ... 

But first off, I'm doubtful if this movie will be "true" horror ... I wonder if it'll come across as more of a dark thriller (kind of like Sleepy Hollow ... which I love but I wouldnt really call it "horror"). I know Jessica Chastain has done Horror before (with Mama). And I'm kind of surprised seeing her in another horror movie since she was in a freakin Nolan movie. But I guess if Del Toro is at the helm ... why not? 

Tom Hiddleston is wonderful. But I've only really seen him in something a bit darker in the movie Only Lovers Left Alive (which was not my cup of tea and sucked). 

I saw Mia Wasikowska in Stoker and she was phenomenal in it. But Stoker was definitely more of a thriller/drama. She was also in Only Lovers Left Alive with Tom H. And she basically carried the movie Tracks, and that's getting pretty good reviews. 

These quotes are from the Entertainment Weekly blurb about this movie. 

Chastain: 
It was really draining, emotionally and spiritually.... The experience took more out of me than anything I'd ever done. When I finished I had to take some time off. 

del Toro has said: 
It's very much in an old mold with a little bit of extra depravity and brutality sprinkled in."


Del Toro was also said to have found inspiration from classic goth films like *Rebecca* and *The Innocents* (and I've neither seen nor heard of either). 

The movie is set in the 19th century. Mia has just married Tom and she finds out he's a tad bit ... off. Jessica Chastain players Mia's sister in law. Charlie Hunnam plays Christian Grey jk the Doctor. 

I'm just really curious how "scary" this movie will be. They seemed to have pulled a good director and a high dollar cast. I'm under the impression that most horror doesnt really bring in the big bucks or big awards .... so I'm really looking forward to a trailer so I can kind of get a better grasp of this film! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] [5x07] In defense of Tyreese and my future prediction for Rick </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-25 07:03:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So Tyreese's demeanor seems to frustrate people. 

But I had a random thought 

If Tyreese was a more violent person, a badass as some might say, would he have been able to forgive Carol for killing Karen? Tyreese was about to start something GREAT with Karen. And Carol admits that she killed Karen, slides a gun across the table to Tyreese and tells him to do what he has to do.  So what would a *badass* do in that situation? We know what Tyreese did. He forgave Carol, picked up Judith, and got the hell out of dodge. 
 
Earlier, when Rick found out, he kicked Carol out of the prison, that's essentially killing her. Like what chance does ANYONE have out there on their own? 


I'm just going to talk about violence and humanity now and I'm going to try and bring it all back to Rick. 

It seems like people are VERY annoyed with some of the more peaceful suggestions ... itt's boring, it's "stupid", it's "bad writing". 

In 5x07, people are annoyed at the rest of the group for not letting Rick just go in guns a-blazing, Columbine style up into that hospital. And when Daryl talked Rick back saying 3s better than 2, people were annoyed that Rick didnt just up and shoot the guy. 

And I've said this in other threads but does Batman kill the villains? No. Thats what makes Batman the GOOD GUY. 

I think Ricks hardened view of the world is going to get reinforced in the MSF (bc how can it NOT!). He's right. The group is probably going to get further damaged from this "trade" with the hospital. They should have not given the hospital a CHANCE to make the right decision. Rick got burned with The Governor and Terminus. And this time will probably be the last straw (on an unimpressive foe, by the way ... which is, again, I think good writing ... bc these people are a bit more "grey" than the governor or the termites)

So after the MSF, Rick is going to become more violent. And hes going to make a wrong call and kill a good guy out there. Not just leave the backpack guy running after them .. but actively kill a good, honest person.

And when does Rick become one of the assholes that hes trying to save his son from? What death does he hand out where Carl fears him? Thats where Rick is heading with all his lets shoot first, ask questions later attitude hes got going on. 

This is just my opinion. I really am interested in discussion on this. I feel like there's a LOT of bloodlust going on in the subreddit. I think that's focusing on the smaller picture. And I think for humanity's sake ... (which is why I think it's nice that they talk about Art in some of the episodes) .... it's nice to have the big picture in mind, when you think of other people as humans and not as "not one of us".  </TEXT>

I obviously don't want to hurt anybody. But on the other hand, I feel like these are pretty standard poses, and I see this so little that I don't want to omit the poses either. Halp

	<TEXT> I was just watching The Affair. And (I dont think ruins anything for The Affair, it's just a plot point) Noah's father-in-law basically runs Noah's family by financially supporting Noahs family. So Noah can get told how to raise his family bc his in-laws have been their financial backbone while Noah writes books. And I'm sure this leads Noah to not "feel like a man" ... erego, the affair that he has. 

So I'm watching this last episode, Redux, and it looks like the ambassador's husband is starting to really like this spy stuff he's been doing for the other side. It looked like he got enjoyment out of it. What do you guys think? Is he starting to stick it to his wife a little? Like a few episodes he was trying to get the hell out of dodge. And now he's encouraging his wife to stay at her job. 

I just think he got shamed out of his professorship. And then his wife seems to wear the pants in the family. . . . it's just a theme I havent seen played out in television recently.  Or at least I havent recognized it. 

edit: And in a weird way, it's like the guys do the kind of feminine things of subterfuge to get back at their spouse. So cheating (something sexual). Or spying (something crafty). These seem to be "feminine" things. Whereas a masculine thing might be to get into an argument or fisticuffs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read off-hand comments that you HAVE to read House of Leaves in a real book version, not an ebook version. Is that a serious suggestion? What would I be missing? Or is that just paper book people dogma? 

Like, I'm fine with looking at pictures on my kindle ....

	<TITLE> [Discussion] What's the "It" book of 2014? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-30 19:14:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I saw this [goodreads post](https://www.goodreads.com/blog/show/469-what-s-the-it-book-of-2014) titled **What is the "It" book of 2014** and definitely wanted to hear reddit's opinion!. 


**The main players were:**

1. *We Were Liars*, E. Lockhart

2. *Landline*, Rainbow Rowell

3. *All the Light We Cannot See*, Anthony Doerr

4. *Big Little Lies*, Liane Moriarty

5. *The Invention of Wings*, Sue Monk Kidd


Goodreads limited their selection to releases from Jan - Sept (to reduce the bias for newer releases). So here are **more recent releases** that you might unfairly favor over the older releases: 

1. *The Bone Clocks*, David Mitchell

2. *Station Eleven*, Emily St. John Mandel

3. *The Paying Guests*, Sarah Waters

4. *I'll Give You The Sun*, Jandy Nelson 


**Previous "winners"**

2012 - Gone Girl 

2013 - Goldfinch? 




Please, no spoilers (or mark them appropriately). 


Do you agree with the nominees? Who is the winner? Any obvious books missing?

	<TEXT> One of my characters doesn't talk that much. And I feel myself repeating "sidelong glance" over and over and over. 

Like, how do you describe the Mckayla Maroney face? 


I don't want to get into a rut of saying "Bob looked shocked." Or "Bob just rolled his eyes." "Bob dismissed the comment with a wave of his hand." 

I need to graduate to more colorful language! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 1x01 and 5x04 hospital parallel - probably looking too much into it but ... [Spoiler] </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These screen grabs were taken from the 5x04 sneak peek. So not too spoiler-ish.

It's just showing that there might be a little nod in next week's episode to the first episode when Rick stumbles out of the hospital. 

In [the post](http://blondietvjunkie.tumblr.com/post/100558274377/1x01-5x04-the-rick-and-beth-parallels) where I found this, the commentor talks about how the clock is moving in next week's episode (suggesting maybe there's movement and power in the group) versus in 1x01, where time was still.  

I don't know if they do this stuff on purpose ... but I saw and wanted to share with yall! Don't dead open inside. 

edit: Also, is it a thing to rip your iv out if you wake up in a hospital?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love horror movies!! The Descent, Cabin Fever, Saw, things like that. But scary is scary, I'll take what I can get. 
Seems like most fanfics out there circle around a love story. Does anyone have any good horror fanfic suggestions for me to check out? I'd rather hear suggestions from you guys than the search features!

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About BETH.

It seems like the group just talked about going on to Washington without even taking a stab at looking for Beth. Daryl pretty much told everyone that someone took her. Thank god for Daryl/Carol. 

I'm super annoyed with Maggie! And I guess since Tyreese is the new babysitter, fuck Beth right?

	<TITLE> Organization suggestions for integrating scribbles and notes into an outline or story I'm writing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-14 19:11:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So throughout the day, especially when I'm driving and my mind is kinda blank, I'll find little notes of inspiration. Or better ways of telling scenes. And then I just pull out my iPhone and use the text to speech as a way to scribble down ideas, plot points, motivations, whatnot. 

I guess I'm having issues transferring them somewhere that will be useful to me later on when I get to that scene. They seem to clog up my outline. But my Notes are getting super long and out of order. 

Is this just a bad process? Is there a better way to organize my jots? What do you do?  </TEXT>
