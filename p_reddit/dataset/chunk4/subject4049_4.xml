	<TEXT> There are multiple reasons. Sometimes It could be a sign of anxiety or a stress reliever. It could just be the angle of your foot. Like right now, my foot is hanging off of my knee and I'm just shaking my foot like it's nothing. Usually people with ADHD can't sit still so moving all the time is comforting. Sometimes I shake my foot before I go to bed and other times I shake my foot so I can stay awake depending on my environment of course. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I think when people think of Sharingan they get a picture in their head of the stage 3 Sharingan because that stage was seen more often than the first stage. Also, I don't really think they need to go into specifics necessarily because all of us Naruto fans already understand each other.

However, if it's too complicated to explain, details would help me and others understand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just picture Rock Lee having the abilities he has now and then suddenly getting the Sharingan. I don't think just because he has a Djutsu that he would give up on staying a strong and active taijustu fighter.  I mean look at itachi's taijutsu, he was able to fight Naruto in tailed beast mode using just taijutsu and stage 3 Sharingan. And Rock Lee's taijutsu is way better than itachi's taijutsu. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Optional] You can pick someone that isn't underrated but doesn't have a Djutsu.

Edit: These are all great character picks!
 Just to be clear, the characters you pick are not natural users of a Djutsu. This is just combining their abilities with a Djutsu. </TEXT>

I just read an article of a woman sexually abusing her kids in front of strangers in exchange for money to buy meth. She was WHITE! Every race has done fucked up shit like this and it's always getting worse. 

Go back to Youtube if you want to post racist shit all the time. What is wrong with you?

	<TEXT> I live in Saint Louis, Missouri the weather is fucking random.  One day it's clear skies with a perfect 72 degree temperature. Over night it rains or snows and I wake up to a random 'winter wonderland' if it's not that im freezing my ass off in the morning and by the afternoon it gets warm enough to take my jacket off. Believe me Missouri may have the most random weather in the midwest. </TEXT>
