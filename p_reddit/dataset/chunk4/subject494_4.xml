	<TEXT> The Series of Unfortunate Events really got me started into reading as a young child. Short, addicting stories that get longer and longer to warm you up to the "big boy books". Not everything is so flowery and perfect so it gets you out of the "everything always ends up okay" mindset that you are so used to seeing in elementary reading. </TEXT>
