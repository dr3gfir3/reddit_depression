	<TEXT> played WOW since vanilla. Quit a few times, but played every expansion. During Cataclysm I was in a solid raiding guild with a few of my RL friends. But the rest of 95% of the guild were guys from Egypt. 
I will never forget the day one of them kept failing in Firelands... When they started to yell at each other in high pitch arabic voices, i was fucking done :D Best raid night ever.
Will never forgive myself for losing that ventrilo recording... 

miss you guys 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in high school. Played video games until 3 am. Had to wake up and go to train at 6:15 am. But i wake up thinking my alarm didn't went off. I panic and check the clock,  my vision was all blurry but i was sure it said 6:00 on the clock. SHIT! I got dressed and ran like hell to the train station. I don't know why it wasn't odd to me at that point, that there is no one around but me, and there was still pitch dark.
Got to the empty train station. My vision not so blurry anymore. Checked my watch. It was 4:15. 
Got to see the deer cross the railroad tracks though. Went back to sleep for another hour and a half. </TEXT>
