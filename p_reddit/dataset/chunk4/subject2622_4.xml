	<TEXT> First of all, they've discussed many ways that people are stigmatized by criminal charges whether they turn out to be guilty or innocent. You're blind if you can't see that. They release people EVERY FUCKING DAY that have been wrongly incarcerated. People get arrested and detained and treated like criminals because of police "instinct" or false information.  Evidence is fabricated to get the conviction. "proven" guilty is always an opinion. Whether it's BASED in fact of not.

**EDIT:** Wow. Somebody can use google...  See, I'm not an asshole so I thought it would be ok to put a picture of my car (that I also have on facebook) in this comment. Apparently someone knows ho to image search and I don't keep my facebook private because, again, I'm not an asshole.
