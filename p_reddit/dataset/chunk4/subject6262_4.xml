	<TEXT> I dont get why you guys making memes of legends. First female marco then now you guys are trying to make "human hody". New characters are meant to have better captain abilities then their counterparts.And thats why they are making 6*+ legends so they can compete with the new legends.Look at doflamingo,  why didn't you call him blonde fujitora or seeing fujitora? Just because they boost the same type or class doesnt mean that one unit will completely destroy the other.Making fun of legends for being overthrown by another legend is just flat out stupid. </TEXT>
