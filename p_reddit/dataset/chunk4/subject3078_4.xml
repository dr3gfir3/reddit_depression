	<TEXT> For the record, I don't want you to think I'm arguing against you (don't know if you're reading it that way or not, but I could see how it might come off that way).

No I wasn't reading it that way, I assumed we were having a discussion, that's generally my default position..

Lemme know what you think when you listen to the link. It was from late Jan or early Feb. 

I will do, probably tomorrow, do drop me a message if I get distracted and don't reply..

Lars called my brother to interview him for the show about it, but my brother didn't return his phone call for obvious reasons. The teacher is still employed, but not without any consequences.

Well, I'm quite intrigued now..

Anyway, I think I can actually go and sleep now, so I shall. Good Night.

	<TEXT> Again, Hungary is an EU member now though, the political views of EU members are relevant to the EU in terms of how the EU looks out for their interests and indeed how the EU continues to develop. It's not as though the EU is on any particular path, a rise of right wing parties within the EU would shunt the EUs political direction as much as the rise of further left parties, or Green parties would...

I'll grant that the issues around Russia, especially at the moment are pretty concerning, but again Hungary is a member of the EU, and as long as it remains democratic there isn't a lot anyone can do about that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It started some great discussions.

I bet it did, I had a fairly decent discussion with my kids about the rise and fall of fascism (eldest is currently covering the causes of WWII in history) and ended up talking about the more recent apparent surge of nationalism and the right wing currently in Europe.  I also get the picture that at least with my kids school, there is a bit of a distorted view being presented that Fascism ended in Europe with the end of WWII, handily excluding Spain in both the pre-war and post-war periods (I think probably because the focus is so heavily on Germany and Italy), it also excludes the impact of fascism in the Balkans...

Anyway..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whether or not something is a "rant" is in the eye of the beholder. The teacher genuinely thought he was making productive use of class time to teach kids what's happening. Lars Larson is the one that called it a "rant".

True (I can't listen to the damn thing here, as it's early in the morning and I have a daughter asleep who has been having nightmares..). Hence the lack of comment on the actual link you posted..

I don't think it should be a conclusive thing until history has deemed it.

That's true of most things, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it now.. After all, I don't see the answers to the question in the article, or the ones I posed as looking for a definitive, authoritative answer, but rather a discussion that leads to an opinion.. I mean, that's broadly what a huge number of history (and other humanities) subjects are about, you discuss and think and come to the best conclusion that you can based on whatever factors you consider.

Point being, in my opinion, stuff like this should be a facilitated discussion led by the students, with teacher "opinions" served only to encourage critical thinking (playing devil's advocate, for example), not a class lesson for the day.

Yeah, I wouldn't disagree with that, but I'd see the posing of he question as relatively neutral to the debate, if provocative, in the first instance, after all it can be answered with a yes or a no or anything in between.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's clear you misunderstand how dysfunctional the government is

That's entirely possible.. 

Sure, but courts have limits, and so does general civility. 

Of course.

War is hell, and the entire concept goes above government. I mean, it's a system of "it's ok if innocents die if we maybe hit our target." Obama murdered tons of innocent people holding weddings and funerals. No one "held him responsible" then. I wanted them to, but it's really annoying that Trump is being held responsible for something OBAMA DID when Obama still isn't being held responsible for that stuff.

The really antagonising element there is the lack of a war in any declared sense, we spent a lot of time over the centuries figuring out how we thought rules could be applied and people held to account, and then essentially watched almost everyone simply ignore it by avoiding declared wars and the responsibilities that come with it.. The public reaction is sometimes interesting in that regard too, not sure if you will have seen it, but a Marine in the UK was recently in court because he shot a shot Taliban insurgent under conditions that were not justifiable, the reporting and commentary was.. interesting.

Trump has been pretty normal from what I've seen so far. Our press has been hell-bent on saying things like looking at stairs or talking to people is Hitler 2.0. It's hysteria.

The hitler 2.0 stuff is pretty hysterical, although I'm not sure that this presidency has been entirely normal so far either, although from the election campaign that sort of seems to be he point..

If no one will report on it accurately then it's probably not an important story.

Except it clearly is an important story and the reporting is accurate enough. At the moment the biggest objection seems to be the headline.. Well, apart from the chap up the thread of feels that people suing about being on a kill list are just doing it for personal attention, which seems a little odd.. </TEXT>

'Is Obama a socialist', 'Was Martin McGuinness/Nelson Mandela a Terrorist' etc.. Where there is or has been contemporary discussion about it, it does increase relevancy and potentially engagement and makes things somewhat more interesting and current..

	<TEXT> He has a responsibility to do things he doesn't even know about.

He's the president, he should either know how these systems work, or employ someone who does to be responsible to him on them.. I mean don't get me wrong, I don't expect him to micromanage everything, but I would expect the President to be responsible for what is administration does, especially if that happens to be killing people..

I said I understood that's your expectation. I disagree, but I just wanted it to be clear that's your position. I don't know how responsive he can be before he knows about it, as far as responsibility goes.

You have a point there and a very valid one, although at that point it comes down to where responsibility lies when things go wrong.  To a certain extent isn't that what court cases are suppose determine?

The President is not God. I excused Obama for similar stuff Bush did, but Trump is being lambasted no matter how no hand he had in stuff.

To be fair when it comes to this area, you can't really excuse Obama either. Both Obama and now Trump seem keen to expand on the use of drones and this kind of extraterritorial, legally 'interesting' kill authority, so there isn't quite the same firewall between the administrations and policy.  At least in my view.

The headline should reflect the god damned article. Fuck's sake, that's what I've been saying from the start. If the headline doesn't give a proper summation of what's in the article, it is misleading. This one gives a false implication and encourages people to react to the falsehood without reading the text.

It does reflect the article, but it's a headline, not a summation or a precis of the damn thing.

So nooow you want to distance yourself from the headline. Neat.

....No, again I think the headline is accurate and the article is clear. I don't think the headline is misleading, it could be better, but it is the best one I could find.. Again, it's not like I get to rewrite it..

The press fucking hates Trump, if you've been under a rock for the last year and a half.

I'm in the UK, so the reporting on Trump tends to be either Shrill, or neutral (depending on source..), I've mostly avoided it until more recently because it's horribly divisive with neither side doing themselves any favours. That said, the administration seems hell bent on screwing up things that they could void screwing up, but then I assume there is a domestic audience in the US that that they are appealing to that sees it differently..

Every headline is meant to be "accurate", but create a false implication that creates general smear by the general populous that doesn't read the article. It's total bullshit, and you've helped propagate it. Yay.

The alternative is not posting this story, which frankly seems like more of a loss.  Oh and whilst a lot of people don't read the headline, they are also generally not going to get into any sensible discussion on the subject anyway, so.. fuck em.  

Although to a certain extent I've gotten a little sucked into this whole discussion about headlines now.. So fuck me too I guess..

	<TEXT> EU membership is both a carrot and a stick,Hungary gets billions in EU funds while constantly trying to sabotage the EU.

EU membership is EU membership, it means being in the club, having a say in how it works and abiding by the rules. It isn't a tool for some countries to manage how others work..  Hungary does get billions in EU funds (around 5.5bn in fact..) but that doesn't mean it can't press its interests within the EU, funding doesn't buy the EU the country..

Hungary currently has a parasitical relationship to the EU,one party gains(Hungary) while the other is harmed(EU) in the process.

If that were the case, surely the issue was allowing Hungary into the EU then, now that it is in the EU, presumably on the basis that membership would be mutually beneficial, it's a bit rich to call the relationship parasitical. Surely Hungary has every right to put forward it's views and act on them, even if that doesn't match the current consensus elsewhere...

I believe that if you aid and directly further the agenda of a power that seeks to destroy the EU from within you can no longer be considered to have the best interest of the greater union in mind,at some point it makes sense to cut the leash.

And we are back to leashes again...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So even if he isn't aware, he's the one responsible for all decisions made by the previous admin. Ok, glad that's clear.

Oh come on, that isn't a fair response. He is the president, even if he doesn't know, he has a responsibility. He doesn't have the excuse of saying that it was the previous administration or someone else's job, at best if it's someone else's fuck up he can deflect some of the blame for the situation, but the responsibility still sits with him, and the other mentioned in the suit.

Accurate and clear are different. 

Indeed, and I said accurate, not clear. The article is clear, the headline is accurate, but not comprehensive.

It's a plenty interesting story, but the way it's phrased comes off as if Trump personally put a hit out on these people.

Sort of, it certainly implies that these people have an issue with the President, which isn't untrue either.

It can fucking hint at it though. I don't get how this is such a complex idea here.

I would have preferred 'administration' or similar, but again, it's not my headline, and the alternative sources were on a par or worse..

As an aside, is it just me, or has a lot of the US press simply dropped adding 'President' to the front of the names of Presidents since Obama, and started using the incumbents name rather than office far more often generally? It's a bit jarring at times and it feels more common now.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The trouble is, this is a particularly specialized question. How do you ground these kids in a working concept of political ideology? 

By talking about it and discussing ideologies..

You're talking about a lot of work just to get them to the place they can understand the question being asked. Academically, the nature of fascism is a debatable subject even if you constrain yourself to the obvious European case studies. For example, you can argue that there is not anything that can really be called "fascist economics." Can they recognize the issues with Eco's "ur fascism"? 

Absolutely, defining fascism is hard for academics with specialisms in the field, so I wouldn't expect a teacher, much less their class to do so.  However it does open the door to looking at comparisons and looking for similarities and differences.  Which, to go back to your first point, is a good way of building up an understanding of political ideologies..

Will they just regurgitate whatever HuffPo or Slate article comes up?

That'll depend on what their existing frame of reference is like and yes, the various views that they are exposed to at home and elsewhere. I'd assume it'd play a reasonably big part in how they frame their responses and shape the discussion at least initially.  It'd actually be interesting to listen to a larger group of younger kids do that in the context of history and modern politics..

By all means, discuss Trump, Free Trade, Cultural Marxism, War, Institutional Racism, Civic Culture, etc al. But don't try to fit things into a neat ideological basket that's actually not so neat.

True, but sometimes by asking if something fits in a box, you have a much better environment to do those things in, especially if you are contrasting historical movements with current ones, it means you are looking at something that is relevant now, rather than something that to younger people will seem almost entirely academic.

	<TEXT>  While Hungary isn't an enemy of the EU like Russia is,it isn't a friend either 

It's a member for Christ sake.. It is part of the EU, not some external element that can be deemed friendly or hostile.  Granted elements of the current government doesn't seem overly impressed with certain aspects of the EU, but that is kind of their right as a member isn't it?

On the other hand a Hungary outside the EU would probably turn into a russian aligned fascist state capable of undermining the stability of central and eastern europe so it might be better to keep them in the EU.

You make it sound like EU membership is some sort of leash rather than something intended as mutually beneficial arrangement.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yet the shit headline implies that by him being sued that he had some hand in this at all. It's clickbait and you know it.

He is being sued, and he has a hand in it (not the initial listing, but the continued threat), in that he is now responsible for the fuckup by the Obama administration, it goes with the job..

What the hell is with this bullshit "yeah, the headline included 10% of the info you need to make an upvote or downvote judgement, but it's somewhat accurate".

The headline is accurate, it's clickbaity, but given I can't change that and it's a pretty interesting story I don't know what you want.. As to making an 'upvote or downvote judgement' man, that's up to you. I like to read the articles..

You shouldn't need to read the full article to know that the headline is misleading.

You shouldn't expect a headline to give you the detail either though, that's what the articles are for..

I don't even know what all the kill list implies. 

It would seem that it means that if detected and somewhere within reach of the US, they can and will be targeted (in the case of these journalists, have been targeted, and to be clear, whilst Obama was in office..) by drone strikes.

The term suggests that they're up for assassination, but they're not being assassinated, so something's strange here.

If you'd use the term assassination to apply to drone strikes then that'd be accurate enough. And whilst they haven't been successfully assassinated there have been attempts, not that that makes it a lot better. I suppose if either of the last two governments had been successful there wouldn't be a case to answer in court..

Why is "kill-list" always in quotations? Is it really a kill list or is that conjecture? 

It's formally known as the Disposition Matrix, informally as the kill list, hence the quotes. </TEXT>

Yes.. That would be a group that includes Trump, so the President is being sued, I didn't say or suggest it was only the President being sued.  As you point out, the suit names the President, the Secretary of Defense, the CIA Director, Attorney General and others.

So you either didn't read it or are trying to fuck with people for a political reason.

I read it, I'm pointing out that Trump is being sued so the headline is accurate, but not comprehensive, the article however is fairly comprehensive... At the end of the day it's a headline (and not my headline at that..), you do sort of have to read the rest of it to understand what is going on in full.  

As to fucking with people for political reasons, I'm far more interested in the whole 'being placed on 'kill-list' by mistake' bit, than Obama being responsible for the names being added, or Trump being named as he is currently responsible..

To be honest, it doesn't seem to be limited to liberals.. As a lefty Brit who isn't pro-EU it gets interesting sometimes..  

And as long as its Anti-Trump it gets upvoted with tons of knee jerk comments.

That is broadly true... Although happily even on /r/politics (hell, almost anywhere on reddit) there is still room for discussion.  There was an interesting piece I posted on teachers asking whether Trump was a fascist that sort of has a similar mix, but at least a few people are still interested in the issues.

	<TEXT> Ich mchte mich bei den Mods fr den neuen Flair bedanken.  Ich kann ehrlich sagen das Ich mich nie so Europisch gefhlt habe (mindestens nicht seit letztem Jahr als Ich in Paris vorgab, sterreichisch zu sein)... Mein einziges Problem ist, dass diese nderungen ein bisschen frh waren.  Pnktlichkeit ist ja wichtig..

*I'd like to thank the mods for the flair change, I can honestly say haven't felt this European since pretending to be Austrian in Paris last year.  My only issue is that it's a couple of hour early.*

*nderungen: Jetzt is alles auch in einer verstndlichen und vernnftige Sprache.. Den Titel kann ich leider nicht ndern*
