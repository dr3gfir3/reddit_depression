	<TEXT> Arthur Dent, from the hitchiker's guide to the Galaxy.  He has the Guide, the Babel Fish, the red blood of an Englishman and unfathomable luck.  Strongest person he could defeat?  He'd be hard pressed to beat an average person, let alone anyone with any sort of strength.  Weakest person who could beat him?  Anyone off the street.  If you want a specific person, I'd say the farmer with a shotgun who Raditz killed.

Side note, all of those "so-and-so vs your favorite character" are hilarious.  Poor Arthur Dent. </TEXT>

You also forgot one person who could master the ring on middle earth. *Hey dol! merry dol! ring a dong dillo!

	<TEXT> She got you with the baby anchor.  Normally women do that to rich guys, not broke assholes like myself but to each their own.  But let's be honest, how long did the "fuuuuuuuuuuck" in your head last when it happened?  For me it was about fifteen seconds and some of it was out loud.  

So you're in this for the long haul.  People aren't normally asexual.  Find out if your wife is not attracted to you or not attracted to anyone.  If your physically the problem then /r/fit .  If she finds no one attractive then that sounds like a hormone imbalance or a mental block.  Have her get her hormones tested after she's done breastfeeding and is a year post-birth. ( that's when things go back to normal, I don't envy women of that).  If her hormones are normal then couples therapy time.  If she won't go to therapy, flesh lights are cheap on Amazon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best answer is... Maybe?  On one hand, her hormones are just screaming "fuck you" with everything they have at her, swinging her emotions around like a rag doll and make her physically miserable.  Expect her hormones to normalize around a year after she gives birth.

On the other hand, modern medicine has no idea why my bedroom has stayed dead for almost three years after my wife gave birth.  I got an eye roll when I suggest a handjob on Father's Day.

Jokes on her, I find resting bitch face attractive (or maybe that's the only response I get to my advances and my brain is subconsciously as starved for physical affection as my conscious.) </TEXT>

If you feel up to it /r/fit

Worst case scenario you have built up a sufficient emotional wall and gained an emotion support for the approaching divorce.

The point of the whole statement was to move onto Total War, a tactic used to most conventional wars (including the civil war).  The way it is now, we don't attack you unless you're a combatant.  With total war, we attack your cooks, your uniform makers, your transporters, your mechanics, etc to remove your ability to field combatants.  If you support Isis's military, you're also a target.

	<TEXT> As far as power, Frostmourn is ahead of any other weapon in Azeroth.  It turned Arthas into a death knight, made him considerably stronger, and corrupted him absolutely.  Frostmourn grants casts amount of power.  

The Ashbringer, on the other hand, enhances power.  It works with the power out into it.  Sure, it turned thousands of undead into ash in one swing, but that was with the power of the hundreds of dead Paladins under Light's Hope and a very strong paladin wielding it.  The Ashbringer is not as strong as Frostmourn.

However, it did break it.  Imagine Frostmourne is superman.  You can chuck hundreds of thousands of different kinds of rocks at him and it wouldn't faze him.  Imagine the Ashbringer is kryptonite and you pelt superman in the face with it.  </TEXT>

But with Bilbo's treasure (a chest of silver, a chest of gold, and the treasure of the trolls he grabbed on the way back) I don't think Frodo or any future owners of Bag End have to worry about wealth. </TEXT>

She's incredibly fast, able to speed blitz every cap except the one capable of going light speed.  Ad to this that she can share her power with people and objects, spidey is in a rough spot.  I imagine she would use her power on spidey's web and now his webber is broken.  Once he is grounded, he can't use the environment for fear of her sharing her power with the car he's about to land on as it would throw him off balance and open him up to the very fast Siberian catching him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in a similar situation as you but with the genders flipped.  We can't have sex unless I'm freshly showered, freshly shaved, my hair doesn't look bad, I just brushed my teeth and haven't eaten anything since, and if I don't give oral she acts disappointed in a shameful sort of way.  God forbid if I try to touch her breasts too.  But hey, I'm lucky to be getting sex, right?

Honestly, I think your partner just views sex as a way for him to feel pleasure with no regard for yours.  It would take a lot of counseling and a big change in ideology to even start changing that point of view.  You could cut off the sex entirely but then no one wins.  Does his selfish behavior happen outside the bedroom?  It's subtle in my relationship but it bleeds over there to.

Break if you feel like you've run out of options, but make sure you detail out to him what caused the break.  Write a letter to get it all down that way you want it.

Good luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While things like Super Sayan and the Genkai boost are inherent for his species, Goku ( and Vageta) is a prodigy.  Goku constantly unlocked techniques and pushed himself beyond the limits of any Sayan or being in his Galaxy.  He also accented to godhood with the SSG transformation.

The closest comparison I can think of is Thor.  Asgardians are naturally powerful, but Thor is absurdly strong even among Asgardians before you add in his divine power.  Then he gets the Odenforce (SSG) and is universe-tier.  

Of course, unlike Thor, Goku is going full Saitama where he doesn't seem to have a ceiling.  So we will see where it ends.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was kil'jaden controlling Gul'dan, Sargeras's lieutenant. And he was only initially controlling the orcs to go after the Draenei, whom landed on the Orc homeworld fleeing from KJ and his counterpart Archinonde( who is more of a so-it-yourselfer than KJ) who started out as Draenei (then called Erador, Draenei means exiled in draenish[which should be eradish]) and have a hard on for genociding their own race.  KJ left Draenor, the Orc planet named after the race not from there for some reason, alone after the Draenei left Draenor (wtf Draenei, how many planets will you leave as lambs to the slaughter because you won't face your former people) and Gul'dan went full crazy.  So in game lore, Gul'dan is acting on his own for most of the first game.  Sargeras is possessing Medivh but I don't think Gul'dan knows that.

Edit: also old gods.  Corrupting Sargeras is a theory, canon has him get dishearted over seeing chaos pop up all the time and begin to think chaos is the natural state of things and creates the burning legion.  Also he is stronger than old gods, he's a casual planet buster and the compendium has the pantheon beat the old gods and the burning legion beat the pantheon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I lived in Appalachia for a long time, in a place called Bear Creek, not far from an old strip mine.  Very remote.  It's nice though it depends heavily on the folks around you.  You might have white trash in a dilapidated trailer with trash all over their yard ( no city code, no mayor.  You live in something called a township that has one or two people governing it every dozen or so square miles.). Or you could live by a farmer who's lived in the valley all his life, like his grandfather had and his grandfather had.

Everyone waves.  People hand out extra harvest like you wouldn't believe.  The gossip is horrible.  The roads will get snowed in and stay that way for days.  A few people died every year on bear creek to the roads.  You'll most likely live in a valley, so you'll get less sun in the winter, making it like an ice box but the summers will be nice.

Also watch out for goatmen and the devil, my grandpa told me both walk around in the hills.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're probably feeling a lot of new stresses and strains that you're not used to.  Make sure to give your eyes a break every now and then, five minutes, at least, every hour.  Go to the bathroom or get a snack or something.  Moving to give your eyes a break will also let you move around, which you should also do every hour.  Stretch a bit, pop some bones, etc.  when you're sitting, fiddle with your chair until it is perfect for your posture.  Good posture is important and, just like going from a sit down to a physics job will leave you tired for a few weeks, practicing good posture is going to be hard for a few weeks but it will help a lot in the long run.  Get a thermos and fill it with something, add ice, take a sip of you feel yourself dozing off.  Listening to music during your 5 minute breaks if you want, I do.  Listen to music when you work if you want/can, I do.  Seek people out to be social during your five minute breaks: network, offer help, learn.  This will help you appear more helpful, useful, and promotable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump is a corporate man, but I don't see him a pro corporate so much as pro America.  All of us, even corporations.  The gutting trade deals and crack down on use of illegal/foreign work force will hurt corporations but help the work class immensely.  On the flip side, he supports a flat tax, which has historically benefiting the rich and powerful people/corporations.   I think Trump is just disgusted with the system he's forced to play in to be a competitive business and truly wants to change it to his vision of how it should be.  While he is undoubtably more qualified then myself for the making of this vision, that doesn't mean it all sits well for me.

As for Hillary, she will be the worst president since Andrew Johnson. </TEXT>

Other than that, the only chance Aragorn has is round 4 due to his decades of experience over cap in physics combat, and I would still put that at 6/10 for cap due to modern martial arts.  All other rounds are 9/10 for cap, Aragorn fights dirty and could get a lucky shot it. </TEXT>

Burnscar, Cherish, and Shatterbird could level New York in an hour or so if left unopposed.  The real wild cards are Bonesaw and Jack.  Bonesaw could cure Banner mid fight, undo SW's mutation genes, or just end the world by turning all water into bacteria sludge.  But Jack.  Assuming his powers work on powered individuals like they do in Worm (as they should, to make it a fair fight) Jack could prey on some of the more unhinged in Marvel and get allies.  Also his blaster power makes quick work of street tier like punisher and DD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speed force but let me explain how.  Unlike superman or GL, the speed force allows Flash to ignore things like sonic booms and air displacement.  When the flash runs, he is existing in the normal world and the speed force at once.  The faster he goes, the less of him is in our world and the more of him is in the speed force.  This dimensional/existential fuckery allows flash to do things that bend physics over and make them his bitch.  When he breaks the speed of sound, to our perception, he is just shifting more into the speed force so it makes no sonic boom.  When he goes 1000 mph in between cars down a busy street, people might catch a glimpse of him if they were paying attention, but he's effectively without mass relative to the air and would be like someone flashing their brights.  You would flinch but that's about it.  

Now if he hits you at these speeds, you'll feel it.  If he wanted to, he could go fast enough to spaghettify you with a hit.  But thanks to the speed force, flash can run around the earth at the speed of light with no ill affects (instead of causing a solid line of nuclear explosions in his wake as he turns the atoms he's hitting into pure energy) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Harriet Tubman was a conductor on the Underground Railroad that moved runaway slaves from the south to the free states in the north.  She is famous because she was a woman conductor, never got caught, and did countless runs.  She has also become a figure of the early civil rights movement.  

There are legitimate reasons to chose someone over her for the twenty.  Many people feel she was selected for being a woman or for being black, which is positive racism and sexism.  I personally would have chosen Martin Luthor King Jr. Due to him being the face of the civil rights movement in general but that isn't my call to make.  People will see these legitimate claims, words like sexism and racism being thrown around, and go full KKK in expression their racist/sexist views, it's just the nature of sensitive topics in general to attract ignorant people.   

Edit: as many have pointed out, and I apologize for not explicitly stating this, this was not an actual railroad ( though the railroad was used, I'm sure). It was a route north that constantly changed due to people trying to catch them.  It was mostly through the woods and along rivers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the responses so far, but no one is mentioning the most powerful pereon alive on Azeroth, Malfurion.  Malfurion, the first Druid, went toe-to-toe with the dread lord Kathra'natir, a feat only repeated by the first guardian, Alodi.  Malfurion has been gaining strength for 10,000 years since that feat, able to fight Ancients and even push back Ragneros (with some help) back into the elemental plane of fire.  We haven't sent Malfurion go against something where he loses.  We don't know how powerful he really is.

I'll admit full powered Medivh would win against Malfurion, but without the spirit of Sargeras, and especially without the Guardian's blessing, Malfurion wins all rounds.  He can bear through the Warriors, out-cast the casters, and has too many tricks with too much power behind them. </TEXT>
