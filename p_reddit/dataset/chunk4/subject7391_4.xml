	<TEXT> My brother lost 12 of his brothers in Oahu during an actual training mission back in January. I am fairly certain this exercise is a simulation of that event. so fucking happy to see these men practice and prepare for a similar scenario so we can lower the chances of that happening again. Semper Fi! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Happy Birthday! I had the same feels when I turned 21 a few years ago. Even though the day is almost over, do something for YOU. it's your day to be selfish. I was so sad I didn't hear from family and only a few friends, so I packed up the pup and went for a day hike, something i knew would make me happy. You may have a handful of friends (assuming, going off personal experience) and that is OKAY. accept, own, and be proud of who you are and make today a celebration for just that. </TEXT>
