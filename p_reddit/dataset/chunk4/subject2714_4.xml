	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 3 years ago, I was diagnosed with Severe Depressional Episodes with Psychotic Symptoms, an Eating Disorder and PTSD.  
I was hospitalized for 7 months. In the past year my Psychosis has been getting worse, even with meds and therapy but this is a different tactic my voices have never used before. They remind me of when I was sexually abused, by 4 different people and when I was bullied in school, which sometimes causes flashbacks. I am terrified and have no idea what to do. I was doing so well, taking my meds and I haven't cut in months. Now all I want to do is hurt myself, I have no idea what to do. I'm so confused and sick of this. </TEXT>
