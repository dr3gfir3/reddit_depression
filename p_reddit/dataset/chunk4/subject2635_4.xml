	<TEXT> I like exploring abandoned places with my kids, and we've heard good things about the "hell house altar," aka "creepy college." Has anyone here ever gone up there? If so, how do you find it? I've heard conflicting information about which road to take and which entrances to avoid, people getting tickets, etc. 

Any tips? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was that ever the debate? Did I miss someone making that claim? 

Personally, I've never had car troubles that prevented me from getting to work. If I did, I would use leave to repair it. I really don't see anyone making a claim to the contrary... please feel to correct me if I'm incorrect. 

edit: just read through. I still don't see anyone saying that the business should pay an employee but can't show up to work for whatever reason. Some people don't get paid absences for any reason, so they lose money if they can't get to work. The argument that you're replying to seems to be that the person who caused damage to someone's car should be liable for that lost income. Do you disagree with that?

sigh. edit to your edit. Please point out where I said that the employer is responsible for me getting back to work. Go ahead, quote me. I don't think you can, because you seem to be reading into things that people aren't saying. Do you have these problems a lot? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally speaking, you're correct. The problem is that they wrote the question to eliminate any wiggle room. If memory serves, it's something along the lines of "within the last 7 years, have you used any illegal drug including marijuana," or something to that effect. Even if you only tried it once, the only accurate answer would be "yes." I suppose you could ask the investigator what they consider to be "use," but u suspect that they would specify that trying it once meets that definition. 

As an interesting aside, there's a lot of discussion on how to handle legally prescribed medicinal marijuana. The current guidance is to answer "yes" to the use question and explain that it's prescribed by a doctor.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The other perspective is that you may not lose your clearance if you admit to drug use within the last 7 years, but you absolutely will if you're caught lying about it. You probably wouldn't get caught, but if you do you're sunk. If you do choose to lie, make sure your friends da and family members that may know about it are willing to lie, too (note: I really don't recommend going down that path). The other consideration is that if you ever get a poly, it may come out that you lied on the previous investigation (and yes, I know polygraphs are very unreliable!)

Tl;dr: you will be asked the question specifically. If you lie, you might get away with it. But if you're caught you will not get a clearance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on how old you are now, but I'm assuming this happened within the last seven years. The specific question on the SF86 is:

"In the last 7 years, have you consulted a mental health professional (psychiatrist, psychologist, counselor, etc.) or have you consulted with another health care provider about a mental health related condition?"

If I recall, the question has since been modified to exclude issues related to PTSD or reintegration after a military deployment. 

There are some things that will automatically disqualify you for a security clearance, but this is not one of them. If you answer yes, the investigator will ask for more information. Be honest with them and tell them what happened. More importantly, tell them how you've turned your life around and are no longer a risk. 

The investigator does not make the decision- the entire packet goes to the activity commander who will decide if they want to grant you a clearance. Frankly, I've seen people get high-level clearances with much worse than a suicide attempt at 16.

Please don't misunderstand; when I say "worse" I'm not minimizing what you went through. I'm talking about it from the commander's perspective. They want to know that you can be trusted with government secrets. Large debts (which could open you up to elicitation) are a much greater concern than teenage medical emergencies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But maybe not all of them did know that. Remember what they were told from birth- that the Treaty of Versailles was unfairly punishing the country and that they were being blamed for a war they (that generation) had no part in. All that tension is just seething under the surface, and you're reminded about it often. 

You know, because you were told, that your country will be invaded by Russia sooner or later. And when it happens, Poland and Czechoslovakia will cooperate with the attackers and allow them past your borders. That might sound far-fetched, but the rest of the world appears to agree. They allow you to annex  Czechoslovakia to protect yourself. Maybe there really was something to those claims, you might think, if the rest of the nations are allowing you to take the country. 

But then, it gets worse! Poland attacks a radio station within your borders and kills your countrymen. And then they murder a woman in Katowice. And they attack a railroad line and a customs station. It's nothing less than a campaign of murder and sabotage. It's an act of war, and it's plastered all over the newspapers. This is what you learned would happen- thank God you stopped Czechoslovakia from doing the same thing! 

Of course, you don't know that the whole thing was [engineered by Germany itself](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Himmler) to justify a war. Instead, Goebbels is talking about how regretful it was that they had to do such a thing, and that war had been a last resort. But the brave soldiers that were protecting the nation from a direct attack had won a quick victory, and Germany can finally have peace and be secure. 

The rest of the war, as far as you know, was a brutal reaction from the rest of the world to your justified defensive action. You're not fighting to expand Germany's borders- you're fighting to keep the western powers from destroying your country and those that you love. You're not the villain. You're the hero.

Of course, not every German soldier had such beliefs. But they didn't have the benefit of mass, relatively reliable media like we do today. Instead of the internet, they had radio and newspapers. They might have the benefit of rumors, but all they really knew is what they were told or could observe. 

I know you've already heard several examples of German soldiers doing the right thing when they see something bad happening. That's where the choices are made- when they finally learn that they've been lied to. Remember that the average German soldier wasn't a Nazi, and they certainly weren't privy to the party's plans. 

You're obviously very passionate about doing the right thing, and you're clearly willing to stand by your principles. That's a good thing! Remember that you have many benefits that a young person in 1920's Germany wouldn't have had, so it's really hard to actually put ourselves in their place. The best we can do is stand up for what's right in our own lives, learning from the past. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, Disney is well known for hiding subversive messages like this in their cartoons. 

When Ariel lost her voice, or symbolized her being afraid to speak about her homosexuality to her father. When Cinderella marries Prince Charming, it's clearly because she's only conforming to societal expectations despite her true nature. And the arrow scene in Mulan is supposed to remind us about the time when we all saw our camp counselor's penis after we snuck over to the counselor's cabin after lights out and peeked in the windows. 

So given their history, it totally makes sense that Elsa was gay.

	<TEXT> Tor itself is secure, but the users on it might not be. You're referring to The Hacking Team's browser exploit that targets the customized Firefox browser used as a part of the Tor browser bundle, which requires the target to be identified and compromised first. That can be hard to avoid, but it's not necessarily a flaw in the routing protocol itself. Another way is for a server to be compromised or for your browsing habits to give you away (logging on to your Facebook account in the same session, for example).

So Tor is pretty secure, depending on your usage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember having this conversation over and over again a few seasons ago. Was Carl right or wrong to shoot Jody? I think this episode is a bit of a parallel to that decision. 

When Carl shot the wolf in the leg, he walked closer to the wounded man (by the way, why?? You have a gun- that gives you distance). The man was begging for mercy, but when Carl got close, the wolf attacked. Carl hesitated, and he was very nearly killed for it. He didn't hesitate with Jody, seeing as he was nearly within reaching distance (and was coming closer). 

Does anyone else think the same thing would have happened if Carl had hesitated with Jody? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never had a job where they don't at least check to see if you did what you're accused of. The difference is that most investigations are pretty quick or don't have the same contractual requirements. It's pretty quick to check CCTV footage to see if an employee's stealing from the register. Determining if a shooting was justified is more complex. 

That being said, a lot of workplaces suck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll just play [devil's advocate](https://postmediaprovince.files.wordpress.com/2012/11/devils_advocate_500.jpg) here for a moment. 

The school was competing to win money from a company. This money was to support educational goals. I assume that showing support for the product was either a condition of the contest or increased their odds of winning. 

So maybe the school chose to see those two student's support for the sponsors competitor as a form of defiance that was hurting the rest of the students. I would imagine that students that dressed normally that day weren't punished, so support of the corporation wasn't required although opposition to it was punished.

I'm not saying I agree- not by a long shot. I'm just saying that the school probably saw their chances to win a grant being diminished and handled it inappropriately. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-09-14 23:14:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was traveling through Alabama with my family, on my way to DC from California. That's one hell of a move. A blue car flies by me, then takes the first exit and disappears. I didn't think much of it until a state patrolman comes up behind me and pulls me over, saying I was going 95 and weaving in and out of traffic. I wasn't; I had the cruise control set for the speed limit because Waze warned me of a cop in the area. But I knew that arguing wouldn't do me any good. It wasn't until later that I put two and two together once I saw that he marked my silver car as blue on the ticket.

Alabama doesn't have a trial by declaration option, so I'd have to travel from DC to Birmingham to fight it. Or I could hire a lawyer to do it for me, but either way it looks like it'll cost more than the $300 to just pay the ticket and take traffic school. Plus, if I hire a lawyer and lose, I'd have to pay anyway. And I'd bet the cop would be able to explain the whole silver/blue thing.

I really don't mind paying if I actually do the crime, but it bugs me because I know that he was chasing the other car. And I'm a big fan of 'the principle of the thing.' 

I know that I can't get the dashcam footage before the trial, because it's an active investigation or something like that. But if the camera footage was saved, I think there's a good chance that it might show the other car. If I request it after I pay the fine and it shows the other car, would that actually do anything for me?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [SPOILERS] Nick's seizure </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-02 17:01:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Does anyone else thing that Nick might have faked his seizure? He was trying desperately to stop his sister from leaving, knowing that she'd die if she did. Maybe if he wasn't going through withdrawals, he could have stopped her. But in his state he could barely stand. So he begged, pleaded and debated with her, but she still left. 

I think he used the only tool he had left. He knew that she'd come back if he was in danger. Being already sick, he'd have no shortage of vomit and he knows what a seizure should look like. So maybe he faked it to get her to come back, saving her life. 

Of course, the flaw in that theory is that he couldn't have known that she would hear him fall. But he really didn't have anything to lose by trying, so maybe his gamble paid off. 

When he (secretly) told their mom that she tried to sneak out, they seemed to focus on his expression when he said "I stopped her." He didn't say, "lucky I had a seizure then." It just seemed a little too intentional on the part of the camera work. He seemed proud, or maybe he was just saying (correctly) that he stopped her from leaving, even if he didn't do it intentionally.

Or he just had a lucky seizure. But I choose to believe that Nick's just that resourceful.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I bought my wife the purse she wanted as a gift. She was very excited about it... Until it arrived. 

It was a pretty lousy product. She tried to like it, but she just couldn't. So we try to return it, and that's where the stress began.

First they told us that they have a 25%  restocking fee. I don't know much about amazon, but I think that's higher than the 20% allowed by Amazon. I asked them about that, but they said they're not bound by Amazon's policy. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's not much of a difference if so.

I object, and finally they offer a $30 credit as a "reimbursement" to "cover the restocking fee" since their system won't allow them to waive the fee. That sounds like a copout, but whatever- drive on.

So we're finishing things up, and they tell me the credit is for their store only, and that it can only be used by us. I really don't see how that dies what they promised, and I really don't have an interest in buying from them again.

Should I just take the 75% refund and ship them the product (at my expense), or is there a better way to deal with this company? 

Edit: sorry! I reread the exchange, and this is NOT FBA. I apologize for the mistake.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Maryland / USA-wide]

I think the key phrase might be 'commercial,' but I'm not sure. Does the [CAN-SPAM](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/chapter-103) act regulate how government entities send out mass emails? If not, are there any other legal requirements for sending out mass messages regarding new services to those who didn't specifically opt in to receive the messages (assuming there's no method to opt out).

For example, can the Department of Education send out mass emails about new loan programs? Or can HUD send out tips for getting a mortgage?

Thanks!

edit: according to [this article](http://www.afpnet.org/Audiences/PublicPolicyIssueDetail.cfm?itemnumber=1390), non-profits are covered under the act as well if they're sending out a message advertising a product or service, even if they're not making a profit. I guess that makes sense, since money will change hands. But I'm still confused about what happens if a government agency is advertising a product or service that has no cost associated with it... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm moving in to a new place, and the best viewing spot for my TV puts it right on a... a thing. I have no idea what it is, but it's right in the middle of the wall. 

http://imgur.com/a/C5jdf

I'm really trying to figure out what would look good there, as far as making it look more natural and allowing mounting/placement of the components (DVD player, FIOS box, wii and Xbox, wii sensor bar, etc). The problem is that I have a terrible eye for what 'would' look good. I know what I like when I see it, I just can't figure it out ahead of time.

I'd really appreciate any advice / input. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Update] [MD] "Home Seller Wants to Replace Washer and Dryer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-21 20:02:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Update to [This](https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/3a1lzv/home_seller_wants_to_replace_washer_and_dryer_md)

I know it wasn't a big or exciting story, but we all love a little bit of closure. Just to recap, the home sellers said they planned to replace the washer and dryer set that was shown in the pictures, installed during the tour and specified on the contract. 

They wouldn't respond to the question asking what they were proposing to replace it with, and did end up installing a new washer and dryer without approval. Finally, they answered my realtor saying that the new washer and dryer was installed. They had taken out their fancy set (seriously- wifi on a washer and dryer? Very fancy) and installed one of those double-decker sets work about a third of the original set. It was smaller, had poor reviews and wasn't valued the same as even a used replacement. My guess is that it was the set from wherever they moved into.

So we refused to proceed until they agreed to follow the contract. Part of that was because I thought it was fair that they do what they agreed to do, but I also didn't want to set precedent for letting them violate the contract whenever they wanted to. Their realtor finally called mine back and said that he "didn't think it was a big deal" and that he "does it all the time." But she held firm, and we agreed to accept a gift card for a national chain that sells the washer and dryer we want. It's not exactly valued the same as the set they took out, but it's definitely enough for what we want. Seemed fair, since the set they had in the home would have been technically 'used' anyway. 

So all's well that ends well, and we close tomorrow.

	<TITLE> Looking for web developer / partner to help build niche outsourcing site. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-17 04:47:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This project was fairly well-developed when my original partner disappeared. The risk of collaborating online, I suppose. 

I'm looking to develop a site similar in function to freelancer.com, but targeting a niche market. There is not currently direct competition targeting this niche. The primary competition that DOES exist does not target any particular niche.

I believe that a high profit potential exists, particularly given the low overhead. I will be covering the domain and web hosting costs, and other reasonable costs as they come up. I will also handle the business functions of the site (with full transparency), including building the stable of subject matter experts, attracting clients, etc. We can work together on marketing from our different areas of expertise. 

I could hire someone to build the site, but I think working with someone would be better in the long run. That way, we can adjust to a changing landscape as needed. 

For myself, I hold an MBA and an undergraduate degree in business management. I've started two moderately successful small businesses (which I stopped working on years back due to availability) and a non-profit organization. 

If you're interested in working together on this, please let me know.

	<TEXT> We're in the process of buying a home. The contract has already been signed, and we've seen the home multiple times. 

A week or so ago, the seller's agent told my agent that they were taking the washer and dryer ("washer and dryer " is in the contract and shown / listed in the listing). Before she called them back, they called again and said to disregard that message.

Today, they announced that they will be taking the washer and dryer and replacing it with another set. I told my agent that is only acceptable if it's of equal value, since I'm sure they plan to take their nice pair and replace it with a much cheaper one. 

Do I have any grounds to ensure that the one that comes with the house is the same one or similar to the one in the listing and pictures?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Alabama State Patrol] When does the dash camera start rolling? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was traveling through Alabama, on my way to DC from California. That's one hell of a move. This blue car flies by me, then takes the first exit and disappears. I didn't think much of it until a state patrolman comes up behind me and pulls me over, saying I was going 95 and weaving in and out of traffic. I wasn't; I had the cruise control set for the speed limit because Waze warned me of a cop in the area. But I knew that arguing wouldn't do me any good. It wasn't until later that I put two and two together once I saw that he marked my silver car as blue on the ticket. 

If the officer's dashcam was rolling in the minutes prior to the stop, I'd bet we could see the blue car. If not, I don't know if I could prove my case otherwise. Anyone here have any ideas about their policies or technology?

If this is the wrong subreddit, I'll happily delete this thread. Either way, thanks for any replies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the process of buying a house using my VA benefits, and I'm really worried that I'll screw myself over by not paying attention. 

Currently, I'm working with Quicken loans and signed an application with them. I also paid a $400 deposit for the appraisal, which will be leaving my account on Friday. 

However, I think I've found a better offer- I'm waiting for a GFE from another company that swears they can beat quicken and won't have the unexpected fees that they say quicken is known for (and which I've already been surprised with once or twice). 

If the numbers are better, how do I properly withdraw my quicken application and make sure I get my deposit back? The agreement says that it will be refunded minus any actual appraisal or credit report costs. Is there a standard process, or do I just send an email or message through the portal?

Thanks for any advice.  </TEXT>

When I was a kid, I had a lemonade stand. But I think that technology has created opportunities that didn't exist before. 

Do any of you have ideas for a small, inexpensive startup that can allow him to grasp the basic concepts? I was thinking a basic flipping operation, which should net him a small profit while teaching him about researching products, determining price points, etc.

Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-22 00:18:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this is what's going on for with a friend of mine. It's weird, so I'll just recount it as she told me. She knows I'm posting it here, so I'll relay questions and thoughts. 

Eleven years ago "Jennifer" lived in Las Vegas. During that time, she had a sprint landline, which she canceled after about a year before moving back to California. 

Yesterday, she gets a call from a company called HP Financials. I wouldn't bother trying to look them up- they don't seem to have much of a web presence. I heard part of the call, so I'll just refer to the lady that called as "Mildred," because she sounded like a Mildred. A Mildred that was past her "sell by" date. 

Mildred tells her that she has a debt with Sprint, and they're calling to collect. Immediately, they tell her that they've filed a lawsuit. It was like they went straight to the action and skipped all the foreplay. Normally I'm all for that, but sometimes you need a little finesse or a lot of alcohol before you can climb up someone's ass like that. 

So Jennifer tells the collector that there's been a mistake- that that account was closed years ago. The lady responds that the account was 'actually' kept open until 2011, and that's why they can collect. That would be convenient for the statute of limitations, but neither Jennifer or Mildred had anything on hand that could confirm that to be true. 

Now, normally I'm all for blindly trusting strangers that call up demanding money. And normally it works for me- that's why I've won so many UK lotteries and Nigerian princes know that I'm a trustworthy, god-fearing gentleman. But there was something about this lady that we just didn't trust. So we dug a little deeper. 

She calls Sprint. That was an adventure in itself! They couldn't find her account at all- not by name or social. And she didn't have the old phone number, so they couldn't look it up that way. But she's still pretty sure that the account was closed YEARS before Mildred wheezed that it was. 

So Mildred calls back today, saying that she needs to know if there's an adult home because she's having a uniformed officer come over and deliver some court papers. Jennifer asks "where are you?" (because it sounded like she was outside somewhere on a cell phone, and she was worried that Mildred was outside her house or something). And Mildred replies in a strange non-sequiter. She says that she has a "very heavy" envelope that has "court documents" inside, but she doesn't know what the say and can't open it. That was a little odd, especially since she said before that the uniformed officer already had the document. 

So it seems that there are court documents now. I've learned enough from this sub to go on over to both the original county and the current county court websites and see if anything's on file with them. Nothin'. There's no record that we can see. 

So her husband calls the number that they provided, hoping to get a little bit more traction. First two times he's hung up on. But the third time, he actually reaches Mildred! And before she can interrupt or launch into her spiel, he says that he's telling them as a courtesy that they're violating the fair debt collections act, and that they will be filing a complaint. He briefly explains how before she says, "well, the court documents are already with the server, and don't call again." Then Mildred hung up. 

So that's where we are. An old debt that may or may not exist, a process server that's gone rogue and a lawsuit that the courts don't know about. She knows to respond if anything (legal) does show up, and they've technically been told not to call, although I doubt there's a recording of that. Is there anything that she should do in the meantime? Anything she should watch out for? 

**TL;DR: collection company says old account was closed four years ago, when it was probably closer to 10. Sprint says they can't find the account at all, and the collections lady says a lawsuit's been filed but there's nothing on the court's website.** 

Edit: I should have dug a little deeper first. I looked up one of the numbers they like to use, and it turns out that company really likes to tell people that uniformed officers are on the way. So far, there are no uniformed officers at her house.

I'm writing a novel, and I always try to keep things as accurate as possible. 

When someone dies during surgery, what happens next? Do they put a sheet over the body and wheel them to the morgue? Or do they use a body bag? Do they put the body in the refrigerated drawers (I'm sorry, I'm sure there's a real name for those) or are they left out for a period of time?

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My son went on a field trip to Griffiths Observatory yesterday. As he was leaving, he realized that his phone was missing. It wasn't in the lost and found, and no one else on the school bus had seen it. 

Unfortunately, it looks like the phone has been turned off, so I can't see anything or mark it as lost via android Device Manager. And, because I'm an idiot, I didn't install any tracking apps on it. I did check the location history, and saw where he went on the [field trip](http://i.imgur.com/UelTBtL.png); the SW leg is where I think the phone [went last](http://i.imgur.com/SelDXKi.png), at least when it was turned off. 

I'm not 100% certain of the time stamps. Google also shows that the bus took a [two minute detour down to LA](http://i.imgur.com/J3PINcS.png), so perhaps something's off there. Especially since it says it took about 2 minutes to get to Hollywood as well. 

Is there anything that I haven't thought of? I know not much can be done while the phone's off, but I'm hoping that it's turned back on at some point. I haven't disabled it through the provider because there's a lockscreen and I'm really hoping that the person who found it does the right thing and answers it at some point. I did call lost and found, but they haven't seen it. 

Thank you! </TEXT>
