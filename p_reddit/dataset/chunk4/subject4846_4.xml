	<TEXT> i was in that mindset when i ordered my p90d, if the p100d and p90d were on sale at the same time i still would opt for the p90d. i would not be able to swing the extra 20k. that and there comes a time, redditor, when the lower decimal points cease to matter, when the acceleration becomes problematic, when all other cars become uninteresting, and all that is left is a computer driving you to work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if the cars are ahead of the front bumper when they merge into your lane, autopilot will detect them and apply the brakes. usually not in the most comfortable manner but its not like its a panic stop either. in my experiences at least. car barreling into my lane door to door, autopilot wont see. the sensor ahead of the front wheel might detect them and do something but i have never had that happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> some times i get bored. my drive is 25 miles and about 45 min. but, i get to drive on one of the more picturesque highways in los angeles and just take the time to think or look out at the scenery. it feels zen-like and have zero road rage or even motivation to hurry any place. totally better than having to actually drive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> looking around route 2 just south of Butte the road looks like this: https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8605/28367342962_1e43930a74_b.jpg

 nbsp;
but that is after 6 miles of very straight road. on the other hand he could have been going west from Whitehall. but thats flat farmland for about 10 miles before i see road the likes that autopilot would fail on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> keeping hands on the wheel is the best suggestion for liability and driverbackupyness. after i learned to trust the system on my drive to and from work i know that its got this and i rest my hands on my lap. only about 2 or 3 times for the entire drive does it ask if im still there and awake, via a hold the wheel notification. if i ignore this, its will attempt a second time while beeping and cutting whatever audio i am listening to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i was going to write a long winded response about how AP does not behave that way, and then i researched where the driver said this took place.

behold: https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8605/28367342962_1e43930a74_b.jpg

no way in hell would i run autopilot on a road like that, also route 2 is arrow straight for 3 miles, then bends, then another 3 miles straight then on to what looks like a fabulous mountain road for a miata. </TEXT>
