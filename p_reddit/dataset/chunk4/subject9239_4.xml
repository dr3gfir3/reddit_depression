	<TEXT> This is one liberal request I'll never understand. The practice of politicians releasing tax returns started to see what kind of people were donating to the politicians, to determine if some kind of quid pro quo was going on. Sort of like the Clinton Foundation contributions for State favors. But Trump was never a politician before. There is nothing to see. Stop the madness. Get over the election. You lost. You're just trying to muddy the waters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, this is the good part. We divorced just before the housing market bubble burst. I was paying attention. We owed $270K on the house, but it was valued at $620K. I knew that was way high, so taking advantage of her greed I told her if she refinanced and gave me $125K the house was hers. I got her to sign off my pension in the divorce. She's now remarried, so she doesn't get any of my Social Security. She recently sold the house and only broke even. She ran up her credit card debt to $80K and just lost her six figure government job. She want's to retire, but her new husband said not until she pays off her credit card debt. I've been retired 7 years now and enjoying all my hard earned benefits. </TEXT>

She didn't care about anyone but herself, not me, not our five children. </TEXT>
