	<TEXT> I've been given a task to basically write a screenplay within 3 days. 

I don't think I'm bad at writing, I'm just a really slow one.
 
I would like to ask some professionals who dealt with strict deadlines and managed to atleast made a decent script out of that short amount of time...

I've been given a theme, a basic foundation, not a plot, but a foundation of a story and that's basically it.

But I really wanna see those extra footage, I keep seeing in featurettes, behind the scenes, and mentions in articles and they look pretty stunning and I'm disappointed that I didn't get to see them in the big screen.

 Like I've heard that they could make an entire film with all the extra footage they had.

Will they ever release it in some way? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How about a movie review series?

I loved the Creature Go See series, too bad they stopped doing them. I was kinda hoping one for Rogue One =P

And maybe bring back the skits? It what makes them different from all the other movie reviewers. It all takes place in the office and they have like a ton of props so it won't be that hard to make..

Have the crew watch a movie and review it or it could be just Jordan and Dan, they could dress up like Siskel and Ebert... or something like that =P

This is a content that I would want to see from them

Since I heard that Dan is focusing more on the channel, he should do something he's passionate about. You know instead of eating what their lunch is...

How many of you guys would want to see that? </TEXT>

Don't get too crazy with the "knight in shining Armour" thing you're talking about, I just wanna show some support to them as much as I possibly can.

It's not a derogatory! There's other people showing that more than me, c'mon! It might sound like it for you, but my intentions are not that dude... </TEXT>
