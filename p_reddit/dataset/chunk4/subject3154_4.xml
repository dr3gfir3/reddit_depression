In 3 weeks I've sunk as many hours in TBoI as I've done in DS2 all year. So there's no need to pretend that there weren't good games or games good enough to compete with DS2. Also there where some decent horror titles if you're into that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is one of those movies where I wish it had some little changes made to it and I would already like it much more. For example the CGI eyes or the exaggerated foreshadowing. If they film an object for a long enough time or mention it often enough, you already know what's going to happen if you're familiar with horror films.
Still liked it though. The directing was good imo and it didn't rely on scaring you with jumpscares all the time. The focus on the family problems was pretty interesting and maybe even more interesting than the evil mirror lady part. Probably a 7.5-8/10 for me. (I'm relatively generous) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And what about the buffs you don't seem to notice? The amount of flies, IPECAC, Brimstone, only one fetus item is nerfed actually, becoming guppy has become easier, Chocolate Milk, Magic Mushroom spawns more often (due to being in multiple pools), and also you get more reliable stat upgrades from bosses. (Damage syringes, Cat O'Nine Tails which was garbage in Flash, Halo and some other stuff.) I don't completely disagree but you can't just say everything was nerfed without mentioning the buffs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ITT: People complaining about the Krampus Head nerfs. Seriously, for how regularly it shows up, it was just too strong. It made certain runs just less fun because you kinda had to take it if your run was not great and suddenly you got carried to atleast Moms Heart. For me it made some challenge runs ridiculously easy and also took away a little diversity from my runs in the past.

EDIT: Okay maybe 6 rooms charge is a little heavy but still, it really made the game less fun, for me atleast.

	<TEXT> So I recently watched Oculus and I liked it 
overall but the CGI eyes, the horrorfilm 
clichs and the endless foreshadowing really limited my enjoyment. In spite of all of that I still like the premise of that reality twisting mirror, and the lack of stupid jumpscares. Do you guys have any recommendations for movies like that one? Preferably atmospheric and not jumpscare heavy. Thanks.
