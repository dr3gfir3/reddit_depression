	<TEXT> There is a huge difference: Irrlicht is C++, for native platforms, while CopperLicht is written in JavaScript using WebGL. They only have a similar interface because that's probably how I want 3D engines to work :) Other than that they are both 3D libraries, they don't have that much in common. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CopperLicht (WebGL 3D engine) now free and open source </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-08 08:16:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi,
 we just made [CopperLicht](http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/) - our WebGL 3D engine - free and open source for everyone. If you are planning a HTML5 3D game, maybe this could be interesting for you.


If you ever tried [Irrlicht](http://subject4640.sourceforge.net/), you'll notice that its API is very similar to it, that's because I also wrote that 3D engine originally. 


CopperLicht was originally the WebGL renderer backend for out 3D game editor [CopperCube](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/), so it is quite capable of doing a lot of interesting stuff.
If you have any questions, feel free to ask in here!

You can download the library including its source from its [website](http://www.ambiera.com/copperlicht/) , and use it for every project you like to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, actually, it would be quite easy. It already runs on a Unix (Mac OS X), and the GUI stuff was written using wxWidgets, meaning it would work on Linux as well. Probably just would need a few tweaks here and there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, would be a nice addition. CopperCube is intended to generate apps/website which work also on slow and old hardware, or even WebGL which of course is a bit slower and should run on all systems [it's quite unbelievable with what hardware people surf the web ;)], but stuff like this is also already planned. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> CopperCube 5 released </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi,
 I just released version 5 of the 3D game engine/editor I am working on, [CopperCube](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/). There are a lot of new features in this release, like:

* Terrain support, including own terrain editor
* Physics engine for the native targets - Windows .exe and Mac OS X .app
* Video Playback in 2D and 3D - supported for the targets Windows .exe, WebGL, and Flash
* Network communication - scripting support for communication with your own servers and databases
* iOS 8 WebGL support - apps created with CopperCube and the WebGL target now also run on Apple devices (iPhone, iPad, ...) with iOS 8.
* Shader programming - possibility to create own materials during runtime using JavaScript
* Animation blending
* Attaching nodes to animated meshes - useful for example to let characters carry weapons in their hands
* Directional light - both supported by the light mapper and dynamic lighting
* Procedurally generated trees - generates trees (3d model of plants) based on user specified parameters
* Faster Lightmapper, with Mac OS X support - The built-in lightmapper has been rewritten and is now much faster
* Optimized WebGL performance and compatibility
* Custom Icons for Windows Apps
* Possibility to send commands to the AI
* 15 new prefabs
* and a lot more

CopperCube is a nice tool for people who don't want to us programming for creating games, but it's scripting features are also getting better and better. More info about this release can be found on [its website](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/).

	<TEXT> **CopperCube 5**
* * *
Working on the new release of the 3D game editor, not a game, but very gamedev heavy.
About 95% of the work is done, so I hope the new release will be soon. This week I worked on the improved light mapper, character animation and AI refinements. You can see some of these minor new features I've added in the demo below.

	<TEXT> I wrote a game engine which is similar to Unity (as I've been told, I never tried unity myself) and is named [CopperCube](http://www.ambiera.com/coppercube/), it has quite some features already. I started with [subject4640](http://subject4640.sourceforge.net/) as base framework, and extended it from there. Irrlicht is C++ and not C#, but the code is very friendly to extend and getting used to, so I'd say it would be possible. Definately interesting work, but it is also a lot of work. :)

Blame the legal system: It is not designed to be fair but it has been made so that the one with the most money gets what he wants. Exactly what the CandySwipe developer describes here. If a business doesn't follow this trail, someone else will and crush them instead. </TEXT>
