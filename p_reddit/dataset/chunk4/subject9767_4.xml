	<TEXT> I know they're dormant because the growth is slowed and haven't changed much. Some traps also have a red coloration to them when dormant. You can tell the Sarracenia's are dormant because they're completely red. 

For putting them into dormancy, I grow my plants outside. They were getting 9+ hours of sunlight each day and I watered them frequently as the the heat in Florida can burn plants quickly, so I keep an eye out on them. They go into dormancy when they get less light. The plants know to shut off somewhat and to slow growth because they're essentially resting. They probably get 5-6 hours now. Another factor is temperature. It's now 40 degrees less here and is colder at night. You want to keep them in colder temperatures, however, if you're growing them outside and if you have a long period of freezing, you might want to bring them in. I've heard a couple days of freezing is okay though. You want to keep the waterings a lot less frequent during dormancy. Don't let it completely dry out though. I hope any of this information helps!  </TEXT>
