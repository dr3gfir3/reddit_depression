	<TEXT> We're honestly pretty much "divorced" already. I have my days with the kids, she has hers. I'm paying a set amount now until the actual mediator comes up with a  number. She hasn't, and I don't foresee her asking for alimony. My concern was more in line with a judge saying "wait a minute, you should be getting alimony too" and planting that seed. I guess I could always force the situation of either selling the house, or having her buy me out now, if she was to push that, but I don't think she will because she knows that the reason she didn't work had everything to do with her wanting to be a stay at home mom. I had been asking her during this entire time to get a job because the weight of being the sole earner was heavy on me and she simply said no, that she didn't want to.

The house situation does suck. I know she'll eventually start to date and who knows where that will lead. To me, losing any of my 401k to her is something that would really bother me at a deep level. I'm okay enough not getting that money now, and even offered her paying me 50 cents on the dollar to buy me out so we could be done with it, but she doesn't want to do that and essentially have no savings account. Maybe I can offer something in terms of once our daughter turns 18 she needs to pay me out or start the process of slowly paying me out.

Thanks for the info and positive wishes.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about alimony. Florida native. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-29 19:44:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all! I'm going through the process of a divorce and am becoming increasingly concerned with the idea of alimony.

Me and my ex are not going through attorneys but rather one of those attorney alternative agencies. We've been married 8 years and were separated for a full year 4 years ago where we went through the process of divorce through the same agency. We went all the way through to mediation then and I was only told that I'd have to pay child support.

We eventually reconciled and had another baby. My ex was a stay at home mom the last 3 years (her choice) but has been working the past month making a little bit less than I do on base (I work sale so I get base + commissions). She has not mentioned alimony and is only asking me to help pay half of our 3 year olds day care bill until we get to mediation.

By all measures we're friendly with each other and want this to be as stress free as possible. Our house is paid off and even though I know I'm being an idiot about this, I'm letting her keep the house and whenever she moves or sells, I'll get 50% of what the house is worth at the time of the divorce. I'm not thrilled about that, but I'm allowing it because she isn't touching my 401k after we split our main savings. We have our 3 year old, and 8 year old and she has a 13 year old from a previous relationship. If I forced her to pay me half of what it's worth now she wouldn't be able to and if I forced the selling of the house, she wouldn't be able to find a living arrangement as comfortable or affordable (she only has to be the HOA fees) as she is in now.

Could the idea of alimony be brought up during mediation? Is it something the judge will suggest once she has to report to court to finalize the divorce? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Considering getting a Russian Tortoise </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-27 21:34:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all!

I am considering getting a Russian tortoise. I will be heading over to the pet store today to check them out as well as some of the supplies so I can start mentally piecing things together. I probably wont actually get one for another couple of weeks.

Anyhow, I live in Florida. I just moved into an apartment and am a little nervous about leaving a heat lamp on while away at work. Would the tortoise be okay in my apartments patio? I wouldn't let him wander free, but I'd just carry him and his tote outside. I get a fair amount of direct sunlight.

Also, would one of those Rubbermaid totes be okay? I have kids and am always cautious about having glass around, especially if I'm going to be moving his container in and out. If Rubbermaid totes are okay, would the lamp effect the container? Would one of those lamps that has a clip work as well?

And lastly, and yes I'm going to review all of this with the pet store, I just like to crowd surf as much information as possible, would mulch be good for the tote or do you recommend something else?

Thanks in advance for all the info. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The best way to be a good father to your daughter starts with you taking care of yourself first. Get out of the house as soon as possible, especially if she's messing around with another guy on the side. I don't know how old you are, or who long y'all have been together, but dude, getting out now instead of spending a life with someone who cares so little about you **is** a blessing. Take care of yourself and be the best dad you can be to your girl. Not saying it wont not hurt, the betrayal and rejection sucks, but don't allow her to continue treating you like shit.  </TEXT>

Shame on the other wife for sharing every detail, it's uncalled for and if anything will drive you crazy. I'm really sorry this happened to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually officially move out tomorrow too. Got my keys, checked the place out, dropped some stuff off and bought groceries. I'm excited. Happy to say I have my kids this weekend as well. Really considering allowing them an early Christmas but I don't want to undermine their mom. As is, she gets them Christmas Eve and Christmas morning,and I get them in the afternoon, but I'm really thinking about it.

I wish you the best. </TEXT>

The next day I'm driving around, I make a right turn and I hear my 3 year old go "WOAHHHHH". My son then says "Daddy, look at Zoe!" I turn around and her seat had tipped over. It was funny at the time but I realize how truly fortunate and blessed we were that it was a right turn in our neighborhood and not a car accident going at a higher speed. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [BO] - still good for multiplayer? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi! I had taken some time away from gaming but am planning on getting an Xbox 1 for Christmas for myself and my son. Do people still play Black Ops multiplayer? It's the most fun I've ever had playing a game online and would love to play it again if there's still a community for it. Thanks!

Edit: Thanks for all the good info. Looking forward to getting back in there in a few weeks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Title says it all. Got a new job that is a bicycles ride from my new apartment (for reference, I currently commute 75+ miles/day), got approved to be a volunteer at a U.S. Fish and Wildlife refuge I frequent weekly and my 8 year old son won two awards at school, making him already more successful at school than I ever was. What are some of your all time best days ever? </TEXT>
