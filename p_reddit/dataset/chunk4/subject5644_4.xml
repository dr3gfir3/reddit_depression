	<TEXT> I watched Psycho for the first time 3 seasons into Bates and I would definitely recommend watching the movie. It was great to see some of the subtle references from the movie being brought into play in the series. It also made me realise exactly of what's to come in season 5. Even if you don't watch the series, Psycho is a great film.  </TEXT>
