	<TEXT> I agree with you about the television series. It would work much better on television considering how complex the story is. But since they're doing a movie series. Maybe not just The Gunslinger as one movie. They could combine The Gunslinger and The Drawing of the Three into one, and I think that would be ideal. There is some of both that can be trimmed. </TEXT>
