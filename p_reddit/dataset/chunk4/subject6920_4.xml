	<TEXT> Support from the donald community in regards to your actions? Bullshit. And their behavior is no worse than ETS, SRS, or any of the other super communities that have viewpoints that you actually agree with. In the spirit of healing you decided not to ban the donald? Go fuck yourself. You have no grounds to ban them in the first place. They go out of their way to follow the rules and punish those who don't. Apply the same scrutiny to other subs that you do to the donald then maybe you'll be taken seriously by their growing numbers. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm planning on doing a booking somewhere for 3 nights the first week of January. We like great views of mountains, forests, nature, and nice restaurants on the hotel/Resort or nearby would also be a big plus. I've been digging around on TripAdvisor without much luck. Maybe winter is just a bad time for this type of trip? I don't expect we'll venture outside the resort for hiking or any activities like that, probably just drive around and see the sights. Mountain views are really king. Budget would be $450/night max probably, but I am flexible. 

Does anyone know of a good resort in this area? Or maybe another area in Tennessee I haven't considered? Forgive me if I'm missing some pertinent information I've tried to follow the sticky instructions.  </TEXT>
