	<TEXT> Lets see, monday went fine, tuesday the same. A bit boring without the kid i babysit, but eh. 

Wendesday my depression hit me hard and i tried overdosing on my medication. 

Thirsday I returned to self harming. 

Friday I shut myself in my room with my suicidal thoughts. Was not the best of days. 

Saturday I ended up self harming, a lot and now my arm is fucked. I do have a reason for it though, let me explain. 

See i wa in an on again off again relationship with a girl name shelby, then a year ago he came out as trans, and changed his name to Alex, no big deal im bi. 

So we dated up until last night when i royaly fucked up and made a comment on his status causing him to block me and in my mind dump me. So that has been a huge drain on my life. 

Tried phoning him bit got no response, even made a new facebook to talk to him and he has yet to add me or messge me. 

Its not like i can visit him he lives 8 hours away in America. 

Should have seen this coming though, relationships are not my strong suit. 

Really hope i dont self harm anymore, stuck wearing a baggy shirt to hide it and just feel ugly and like a mistake.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had something similar happen, i went to a local thrift shop to buy a computer moniter, had only $15 on me and it came out to $18, asked if i could just pay the $15. 

Was told no, and a elderly lady behind me asks how much im short, and i told her $3, so i got a $5 and was able to buy my monitor. 

Thanked her a bunch, and the people brhind us remarked how it was a nice gesture.  </TEXT>

Tried talking to my ldr boyfriend about this, but he and i havent been talking in about a few weeks, so that depresses me even more.  </TEXT>
