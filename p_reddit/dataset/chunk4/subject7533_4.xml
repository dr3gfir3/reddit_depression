	<TEXT> Just read this comment from "The Guardian (live)" a couple of mins ago.

 The big picture right now

 Where do things stand, big-picture wise?

 Trumps having a good night. But results in the key battleground state are still out. Pointing to bright points for Trump, we look to Florida, where he is beating previous performances by Republican candidates in many rural counties and in the Tampa and St Petersburg area, which is a lot of people. We look to Virginia, where the race has yet to be called for Clinton, despite strong returns for her in the populous northern counties. And we look to question marks in the upper Midwest, in Wisconsin and Michigan, states that have not gone for a Republican in a presidential election in the last six elections, but where a lot of support for Trump among white, blue-collar voters could tilt the dynamics of the races this year.

 Clinton has bright points to point to as well, including that strong performance in Virginias northern counties, the fact that portions of Florida yet to count are thought to prefer her strongly, and her solid early voting results in Nevada and elsewhere. She has strong precedent to rely on for possible victory in those aforementioned upper Midwestern states, which help make up her so-called blue firewall of states  none of which she has yet lost.

 Its still either candidates race. And were coming up on a new wave of poll closings in states including Nevada, which has a habit of announcing results quickly, and Utah, where the presence of third-party candidate Evan McMullin, and perceived soft support for Trump could be important to the ultimate result.

 We have a ways to go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I hope the money doesn't go to waste.

There's a lot of people to look after in the winter months ahead:

 The money has been used for grocery store trips every two days that cost about $2,000 each, 20 yurts purchased for $160,000, and around $7,000 for bail money. It has also paid for a storage area, composting toilets, tiny houses, tepees, a medical area and generators powered by solar panels and wind.

 A bookkeeper and an accountant now keep track of the crowd-sourced money.

 I got people to take care of, Brave Bull Allard said. I got to provide homes for people and blankets, thermal wear, socks, hats and gloves, and food. Right now, we are feeding 670 people. </TEXT>

Kendall Jack was dismayed when her health plan stopped covering her migraine drug Treximet earlier this year. To buy a pack at the pharmacy would cost $750, compared with a $20 copay when the drug was covered.
Nothings worth $750 for nine pills, she said. Its cruel.

Instead, the 50-year-old stay-at-home mother from Memphis, Tenn., takes Treximets two active ingredientssumatriptan and naproxenas separate pills. For these two generic drugs, her copay is zero.
A spokesman for Pernix Therapeutics Holdings Inc., which sells Treximet, said the drug addressed an unmet need among migraine sufferers by combining sumatriptan and naproxen into a single tablet. He also said Mrs. Jack could get a pack of Treximet for $20 by contacting the company directly.

Treximet is just one of many drugs whose active ingredients are generic drugs that can be purchased separately at a fraction of the cost. Others include acne cream Acanya, Duexis for rheumatoid pain and weight-loss pill Qsymia, according to data compiled for The Wall Street Journal by GoodRx, a group that compares pharmacy prices for prescription drugs.

A spokesman for Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc., which makes Acanya, said doctors could prescribe whichever medication they believe is most appropriate for their patients. Valeant is one drugmaker that has come under fire amid a broader eruption of public anger at drug companies for sharp price increases in recent years.

A spokesman for Horizon Pharma PLC, maker of Duexis, said combining its constituents made it easier for patients to stick with their drug regimen. Mark Oki, chief financial officer of Vivus Inc., which makes Qsymia, declined to comment.

For Treximet, a box of nine tablets costs $728.67, according to Truven Health Analytics. Insurers and employers typically pay less than this so-called list price as a result of behind-the-scenes discounts: the average actual cost for a box of Treximet is about $353, according to an analysis of company-reported sales and prescription data from IMS, a health-care data company. To buy its two constituents, sumatriptan and naproxen, would cost around $19, according to GoodRx.

ENLARGE 

There is no evidence that Treximet tackles migraines any better than a two-pill regimen of sumatriptan plus naproxen. The two clinical trials that led to its approval pitted it against sumatriptan alone, naproxen alone and placebo. Those trials were jointly conducted by GlaxoSmithKline PLC and Pozen Inc., now called Aralez Pharmaceuticals PLC. Glaxo transferred the rights for Treximet to Pernix in 2014.

Some patients avoid paying the full price for Treximet because the cost is partly covered by their health plans. But those whose plans dont cover Treximet face the pharmacy price, which often exceeds the list price.
Pernix and others said they issued coupons to keep patient copays low in some cases. Even so, patients likely will end up paying for it indirectly. Premiums go up, or its passed on to employers, said Michael Rea, chief executive of Rx Savings Solutions, a software company that helps employers and health plans lower their prescription costs by pointing patients to cheaper alternatives. It all comes out of the same bucket.

In some cases, combining two or more drugs into a single pill has benefits, such as added convenience, said Bernstein analyst Ronny Gal. The problem: There is no agreed-upon process for assigning a fair value to those benefits.

This is one more example of the inefficiency of the U.S. health-care system, he said. Mrs. Jack is a case in point: She would be willing to pay a premium price for Treximet, which she finds more effective than two separate pills, but not $750 more.

Whats more, patients and their doctors often have no idea that a cheaper alternative exists. Americans shop [around] for everything in their lives, except medications, said Mr. Rea of Rx Savings Solutions. They dont know how.

Understanding the price of medication with the myriad of health plans offered in the U.S. is extremely complicated, said Anand Rajani, a pediatrician based in Fresno, Calif., who owns a small stake in closely held Rx Savings Solutions. Physicians are totally unaware of the price.
To complicate matters further, some combination drugs use slightly different doses than are easily available to buy separately in the pharmacy. A single pill of Treximet contains 85 milligrams of sumatriptan and 500 milligrams of naproxen. When sold separately, sumatriptan comes in pills of 50 milligrams or 100 milligrams, making direct substitution difficult.
Sharon Orrange, an internal-medicine doctor at Keck Medical Center of the University of Southern California, said she had switched many patients to generics from branded drugs which, like Treximet, comprise two generic constituents. She also works as a consultant for GoodRx on which branded combination drugs can be substituted with cheaper generics.
For many of these patients, the savings are substantial, she said: I have patients who can use the money [saved] to join a gym, or take a trip they couldnt take before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Senator Leila de Lima, has since been accused of corruption and links to drug lords. Her critics allege she was complicit in the drugs trade in the national Bilibit prison when she was head of the department of justice, claiming that inmates raised money to fund her 2016 senatorial bid. She denies all charges, denouncing them as a sham.

As so it begins.... dare to oppose President Duterte and you will find yourself on the wrong side of the war on drugs. </TEXT>
