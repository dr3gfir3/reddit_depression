	<TEXT> Princess by Jean Sasson - biography of a Saudi Arabian princess I found extremely interesting.

Rosemary by Kate Clifford Larson did a good job of staying engaging through the whole work - it's about JFK's younger, disabled sister.

In the Garden of Beasts (Erik Larson)  I found fascinating - about an American ambassador posted to Hitler's Berlin.

Sleeping with the Enemy (Hal Vaughan) is about Coco Chanel, specifically her time in Paris during WW2 and her affair with a Nazi officer.

Unorthodox (Deborah Feldman) is an autobiography of a woman who left her Jewish orthodox community and an abusive marriage.

And if you like animal stories... Dewey by Vicki Myron is about a cat that was adopted by a library after he was abandoned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is some romance in it. It's not the main focus of the series by any means and it takes a bit to get started in the first book, but it is there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Merchant Princes series by Charles Stross - excellent adult female protag, not paranormal - its a dimension jumping fantasy, modern day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Keltiad by Patricia Kennealy (or Kennealy-Morrison depending on the book and edition).  I prefer the Aeron series, but the others are also engaging.   </TEXT>
