	<TEXT> I'm actually pretty active in the gym, I'm 6'3", 205 currently... But I just started lifting again recently after taking about 7 years off from weights other than leg stuff. I literally have done nothing but bike or play basketball since 2010. I've got something called chronic shoulder instability, need to get surgery but haven't gotten around to it yet. Right now I can only bench 160 or it feels like I'm going to lose both of my shoulders. 

It was much easier when I had an athletic trainer to keep me focused.... But I'm getting back into it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Makes sense. Everyone makes fun of me for my aversion to taking risks or dealing with pain since I've had health issues my entire life. They all think I'd be hard to it by now but if anything I have a lower pain tolerance than ever.

Before anyone asks... Broken arm at 3, fish hook stuck in my ass at 4 requiring surgery, fractured skull at 7 after getting power bombed onto a treadmill by my older brother while wrestling, dislocated shoulder at age 8 from being pulled off of a tree limb, broken ribs at age 9 from falling off my trampoline, dislocated shoulder from basketball at age 11, broken middle finger and torn ligament from basketball at age 12, broken leg, dislocated shoulder and broken wrist at age 14 from atv accident, broken leg at age 16 from basketball, torn rotator cuff at age 17 from basketball, broken thumb and pinkie at 18 from basketball, broken foot from kicking a door frame trying to run too fast at age 20, broken ribs and torn cartilage from having legs taken out in a basketball game at age 21, broken and dislocated thumb at 22 from basketball, torn mcl from jumping into the shallow end of a pool drunk at age 23, torn rotator cuff and labrum at 23 from basketball, gallbladder removal at 27, hereditary. Add an extra 3 broken toes and 5-6 concussions from other sports incidents over the years.

So yeah....I don't like pain anymore and I enjoy staying in low risk situations. Edit: forgot one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basketball is great for dealing with horrible situations because it takes so much of your focus. Any time I've had a death in the family or a friend die, I head straight for the basketball court.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shaw is a pretty good assistant coach honestly. The players love him and he's got a ton of experience to help with the point guards. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair to JC, he hasn't had any defensive minded coaches to this point. I'm sure he'll improve as he gets older but you're right, for now he's just a gunner. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only problem I've got with picking up PG is, where does he fit in on the roster? You can't play him at SG, he's too big for that. You can't put him at SF since that will be Ingram's spot. So that leaves PF  and he's obviously not bulky enough to play the 4 spot. I guess they could put Ingram at the 2 but it doesn't seem like Ingram is fast enough to play SG full time. I'd love to have him, I just don't know where he fits in. </TEXT>
