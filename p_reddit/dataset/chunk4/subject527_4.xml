	<TEXT> For me, I started slow. I know I had the gastric sleeve but my main focus for the first couple of months was to get my attitudes toward food balanced again. It took a while! But I also didn't want to start working out until I was at a comfortable weight that wasnt going to hurt my knees, back and lower portion of my body. I found that the pool (Perth gets really hot) was the BEST thing for me, once the stitches were out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A whole new person is an understatement haha. I used to take for granted all the small things like, playing with my nieces and nephews and sitting on the ground without needing help to get back up again. I now try everyday to find something that makes me abundantly happy and I try to be so thankful for everything that comes my way. 
Thank you for your kind words :) </TEXT>
