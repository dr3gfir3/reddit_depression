	<TEXT> It blows my mind this hadn't been posted yet. If you don't like watching foreign movies with subtitles on at least give this a chance. This show was so good that I didn't mind reading subtitles at all. It's one of my favorite crime shows out there and I can't wait for season 3. Even if you don't like The Wire give it a chance because the show is completely different but it also takes a good look at the criminal underworld. 

Seriously, watch it.

	<TEXT> I ask because sometimes I see people on this sub say that the game has gone downhill and that it's only a matter of time before it's dead. As someone who just got this game, is loving it, and is planning to play it for a long time, how long do you think I have? I'm playing in Xbox One btw </TEXT>
