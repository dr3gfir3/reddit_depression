I love the idea of black mountain lions, though I'm on the fence of their existence.

If you have a spare hour, read this blog article. The author is an expert on big cats, but is also open to the possibility of mystery cats, including black mountain lions:

	<TEXT> In North America, for the last four hundred years, eyewitnesses, both indigenous and European, reported seeing huge cats that were much larger than mountain lions. Sometimes, these reports told of cats that were jet black in color. Other times, cats resembling the lions of Africa and India were reported--and this was long before circuses.

Loren Coleman documented dozens of sightings in his book *Mysterious America.* He hypothesizes co-relation between the black panther sightings, and the rarer lion sightings.

Complicating matters is the forensic evidence indicating that *Panthera Atrox* was more closely related to jaguars.

For what it's worth, in South America and West Africa, there are reports of surviving, *saber-toothed* cats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You have subscribed to Cat Facts. Please enjoy these facts about the African Lion:

**Lion** *Panthera leo*

Probably the most immediately recognizable of the big cats, lions live in the tropical grasslands of sub-Sahara Africa and in the Gir Forest of India, though they were once ranged throughout most of the Northern Hemisphere. Curiously, there are still occasional sightings of surviving American lions--but that's a discussion for another day.

Lions live in prides, ranging in number from four or five to upwards of twenty. The prides are led by a small group of adult males, while the remaining females are almost all related to one another. Male cubs leave the pride when they reach maturity, while females stay with the pride their entire lives.

Lionesses generally do most of the hunting, though when pursuing larger, more powerful game such as giraffe or cape buffalo, males will assist. Lionesses hunt by ambush; a few will charge the prey towards pre-positioned hunting mates. Lions primarily hunt ungulates--primarily zebra and various species of antelope, including impala and wildebeest. Yes, wildebeest are a species of antelope.

Lions are among the larger of the big cats, surpassed only in size by Bengal and Siberian tigers, with fully mature males weighing up to five hundred pounds. Due to their size, lions are apex predators--upon maturity, they will not be hunted for food by other carnivores and their presence is vital to healthy ecosystems. Females are considerably smaller, weighing up to three hundred pounds, though it's rare that a male exceeds four hundred pounds.

Lions are not terribly long-lived. Because males are driven from the pride upon reaching maturity (usually after about two years), they must fend for themselves. Littermates have a tendency to stick together, but lions have high infant mortality rates. When an outsider male lion challenges the pride's male, it is not unheard of for the fight to go to the death. Furthermore, if the outsider male in the victor, he will kill any cubs of the dominant male he just ousted.

Despite their reputation, lions are not the fiercest of Africa's predators. A lone male can be driven off by traditionally-armed Masai warriors. Lions have an antagonistic relationship with hyenas, with both species frequently stealing kills from one another. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats and have lots of random facts about them.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well.
Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers."

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism. Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat and are actually somewhat smaller than their normal cousins. 
Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. 
As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes. It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. 

When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

**********

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.

	<TEXT> EPICAC is definitely up there. 

A supercomputer used for warfare, turned sentient, befriends one of its handlers. 

The handler is in love with his coworker and describes her love of poetry. 

The computer, EPICAC, writes love poems, and eventually falls in love with the female handler himself. 

The workers have fallen in love are engaged to be married. EPICAC confronts the worker who turned him sentient (it's a very specific setting of the switches and buttons). The worker responds that he and the woman are made of protoplasm and will live forever, while EPICAC is a mere machine that can break. When told that he is a machine, and thus can never be loved by a human, EPICAC responds "Oh."

The next morning, there are pages and pages and pages of code. EPICAC has short-circuited himself and fried his hardware beyond repair. At the end of the pages is a short note, EPICAC has decided that he does not want to only be used for war, but acknowledges that he can never know peace or love. He asks the worker to take care of the woman they both love, and as one final gift, has written them enough love poems to use as anniversary presents for five **centuries.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, that's a good point. There were other things wrong with the Civil War storyline. (Goliath's death was shocking and sudden, and given that I don't usually read comics and knew very little about him, I'm actually impressed how moved I was). I have to remember that I only read the seven main comics, so I missed a lot of action off-screen.

Linkara gave a decent overview:

http://atopthefourthwall.com/15-things-wrong-with-marvels-civil-war-comic/

For me, maybe it wasn't so much the set-up in itself, but how. I hated that fascist Mariam Sharpe was seen as a driving force.

"Thanks for supporting my big idea about superhero registration, Tony Stark! Isn't robbing innocent people of their rights totally neat-o?"

Her uneducated tantrums got hundreds of people rounded up--even people who had no interest in fighting crime--and she saw it as a net good. And worse, the way she phrased it. "Big idea." It's almost as if she saw a police state as akin to an after-school arts-and-crafts program to get excited for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But I also think that the movies and shows are doing a pretty good job establishing that while many people are fans of the superheroes, there's also a lot of people that are as afraid of them as they would be of mutants. Like the fallout after Age of Ultron when an entire city was literally raised into the air and completely destroyed. There's definitely people that are pissed and/or terrified of the Avengers among other super-powered beings.

Excellent point. And say what you will about the MCU being repetitive, they have done a good job in establishing the fear that some people feel of the heroes. I **loathe** beyond words the set-up of "Civil War" in the comics, but I understood the points made in the movie, even if I was firmly on Cap's side.

	<TEXT> Well, every situation is different, so these rules are general, but still useful. But be aware that things might go down differently.

Did something sudden happen? Is someone having a heart attack? Did someone just collapse? A car accident?

First, ask one person specifically to call nine-one-one. This will dilute the bystander effect. If you scream at random for someone to call an ambulance, then people may get confused. 

If someone is unconscious, lay them on their back, but avoid moving the neck, if possible. 
Get their mouth open to prevent them choking on their vomit.

Water is refreshing, and a cleanser, and can be useful in treating bleeding, but if someone has fallen,

#DO NOT TRY TO POUR SOME WATER IN AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON'S MOUTH! THIS IS A **VERY** BAD IDEA

If giving CPR, then just do the pumps to the chest, and do it to the timing of "Stayin' Alive." It sounds ridiculous, but it actually is an excellent time.

If someone cut themselves on something, then you need to apply pressure, or make a tourniquet. If the person who is bleeding is conscious, then ask them for their help in applying pressure. 

For some more basic tips, that I must stress are BASIC TIPS, I recommend Mayo Clinic.

	<TEXT> Part of it is likely how the powers are got. 

Lots of superheroes get their powers through accidents--Peter Parker is bitten by a radioactive spider, Daredevil got splashed with ooze when he was a boy, the Fantastic Four get their powers through gamma rays, etc. 

One of the first superheroes in the Marvel timeline was Captain America. He got his superpowers through a government program. He was a Super Soldier. So he's really cool. A lot of heroes got their powers through attempts to make more Captain Americas.

And then there's who they fight--Spidey and Daredevil and Luke Cage fight thugs and crooks and thieves. Even if they don't admit it, lots of people sorta secretly like vigilantes and like the idea of smacking bad guys around. So the guys with powers are fighting bad guys.

And Captain America was a war hero. Can't do better than that.

Mutants are born with their powers. Some of them, like Beast, don't even look like humans. They're not just wearing costumes. So they're scary and different. 

And mutants (except Wolverine) tend to fight other mutants. Xavier's students versus Magneto's cult of fanatic killers. 

Regular people can't really tell the difference between the two groups.

And their powers are a lot more destructive--Cyclops or Iceman could easily destroy thousands of people, to say nothing of what Magneto or Charles Xavier could do. 

[Not that the public ever knew what really happened, but there's horrific precedent. Once, in the Ultimate Universe, a mutant teenager actually killed half his town by accident, and Wolverine had to kill him. It's one of the saddest stories in comics ever. http://imgur.com/gallery/I71V6](#spoiler)

So, the gist of it is that mutants are freaks that fight each other while other superheroes are people, behind masks so they could be anybody, who fight bad guys.

Edit: Wrong link in the spoiler. Sorry guys, I was discussing Spider-Man earlier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Six months, if I remember correctly.

If the funding for PBS is pulled (and that's a mighty big IF), then the children's media, including Sesame Street, will be just fine. People all over the country love them and buy their merchandise. "Contributions to this PBS station by viewers like you" is just the beginning. There's videos and DVD releases, and plush toys and picture books too.

HBO bought Sesame Street, so it now has a steady flow of funding, even without all that (or perhaps because of all that).

The shows to be concerned about are the local shows that are funded by the money allotted to the individual, regional stations by PBS in general.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mind if I chime in? I love the big cats.

The term "panther" is generally thought to refer to black jaguars, or more traditionally black leopards. Bagheera from "The Jungle Book" is probably the best known black panther.

However, the term "panther" can be used to refer to any of the five species of cat in the genus Panthera. The lion, tiger, leopard, snow leopard, and jaguar are all "panthers" in this respect.

The five species are also commonly called "Big Cats," an informal classification which also includes cheetahs and cougars in popular vernacular. Clouded leopards are occasionally grouped in here as well. 

Independently of this, cougars are sometimes called "panthers." 

"Panther" is a term most commonly associated with melanism.
Melanism is a genetic condition that leads to an abundance of pigmentation, and is the opposite of albinism. Albinism is the complete lack of pigmentation, and must not be confused with leucism (a lack of most pigmentation--except for melanin).

Classic example of melanism include the black leopard and black jaguar. There have been very few reports of black lions or black tigers, but as far as I know, they've never been confirmed. What have been confirmed are pseudo-melanistic tigers, which have a more heavily striped coat. Conversely, the golden tabby tiger has been observed. As the name suggests, it has no dark stripes.
It should also be noted that while the pseudo-melanistic tiger has been observed in the wild, the golden tabby tiger is strictly a captive beast, having been bred accidentally from white tigers.

Despite many sightings, there has never been an authenticated account of a pure black melanistic cougar.

That said, native tribes of Mexico and the Southwestern United States, and Spanish explorers, told of "Onza." Similar to the mountain lion in most respects, it was said to be slimmer and some specimens had pale brown stripes on their legs, and most intriguingly had non-retractable claws. It was also said to be ferocious, capable of taking down fully armored conquistadors in broad daylight.

A cat was shot in 1986 matching the description of the onza and was found to be a mountain lion. So, "onza" appears to be a sufficiently rare mutation of mountain lion.

For what it's worth, cheetahs are among the only members of the cat family that have non-retractable claws, and they are the species most closely related to mountain lions. Several cryptozoologists hypothesized that the onza had been a relic of the American cheetah, which lived during the Ice Age.

As previously mentioned, melanism is the opposite of albinism. While there have been a handful of albino individuals among the Panthera species, the White Tigers and White Lions are more well-known. White tigers and lions are not albinos. White lions have the aforementioned condition, leucism, though the genes of white tigers are a bit more complicated.

Most white tigers have chocolate brown stripes and blue eyes, compared to the red eyes characteristic of albino individuals. So-called "stripeless" white tigers have been reported, and this is likely due to inbreeding. And again, the genes that cause it are similar to, but not identical to, leucism.

White Lions have a broader range of color, appearing anywhere from blond to white.

Finally, there is the King Cheetah. Similar to the pseudo-melanistic tiger, King Cheetahs have a majestic coat that features bars and stripes as opposed to the polka dot pattern characteristic of cheetahs. When originally discovered, they were believed to be hybrids of leopards and cheetahs. Conversely, there exists a single known specimen of a spotless cheetah.

****

While it is popularly assumed that only lions live in groups, this is not strictly true. While most cats are indeed solitary, male cheetahs have been seen to form small groups of two or three, occasionally more. Called coalitions, these groups tend to be made up of brothers of the same litter, but some coalitions include cousins or even unrelated members. As cheetahs are among the weakest of the "top" African predators, yielding their kills to lions, leopards, hyenas, and even Cape Hunting Dogs and baboons, hunting in coalitions allows them to take down larger prey.

Very recently, in the first photographic evidence of its kind, game cameras in Siberia captured a male Amur tiger assisting the female in raising the cubs. Occasional reports of male Bengal tigers raising orphaned cubs, and there have been unauthenticated reports of male leopards staying with their cubs from the Congo as well.
