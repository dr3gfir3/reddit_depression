Where the fuck do these people come from?

Why are people defending her? Don't they have a modicum of common sense? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, what I mean, can these scammers siphon credit card information from a chip in the same way they can from a strip?

Or are the chips + pins significantly more difficult to manipulate in the scammers favour?

I've been wondering this because for some reason your consumer protection bureau's refuse to make the chip + pin mandatory in the US, which doesn't make any sense from a Canadian point of view as I would assume fraud would be reduced by more systems in place to prevent it.

So I'm wondering if the chip + pin is a false sense of security and the strip isn't much less secure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm hoping this trend gets bucked eventually.

When you use psychology and professional minds to fabricate a game in the hopes of draining players of their money, it isn't what I expected the gaming market to turn into.

It should be all about crafting excellent games with depth and care (ie. The Witcher series and others like it) and you're rewarded with success through being a genuine developer who cares about their gamers and consumers.

I know thats unfortunately a pipe dream right now, but hopefully we as gamers lash out at this freemium nonsense eventually.

Clash Royale is one of the best examples of developers who hired professionals to utilize negative emotions in sparking players to use real money. It's saddening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're misunderstanding my point.

My point is that 1 trillion passes through the American economy everyday. It has a $15 trillion a year GDP.

I know Canada has both positive and negative contributions to the international stage. But if Hillary were to have instead been the Prime Minister of Canada, it wouldn't be a big deal. Now if Hillary were to be the President of the United States, then yes this is a big deal, its a dire situation in fact.

As far as Canada and Russia's GDP comparison, Russia is also corrupt and full of criminals who lie, hence why no one wants to do business there. Russia is the country embodiment of Hillary Clinton.

My point, and i'll reiterate, is that in the scope of comparing countries like the United States to Canada, we are only a blip on the scale. We are Earth, they are Jupiter.

You sound like you have small dog bark syndrome, as though what we Canadians do means anything in comparison to when the United States throws its weight around. </TEXT>

The price for the PSN used to be $0, something Sony used to market against it's competitor. I'm not poor, but it's nice not needing to pay for a service, you plug in your device, hook it up to your network, and voila, it works online.

Then they start charging for PSN; then a couple of years later they increase the price with no new features announced, and it's a GREAT thing.

Furthermore, you come along and offer a solid deal you found, which obviously was a solid deal as it's now SOLD OUT, and somehow in a past thread you were down voted.

When another company can come in and find the initial capital (billions of dollars) to come in a break up the colluding and monopoly the drug companies share, then this company will offer cheaper alternatives and the consumers will move to them.

You either walk away with everything or both of you walk away with nothing. 

It's the perfect example of the free rider theory. Splitting is the idea that the other person is willing to share in the effort for group efforts. I've found that relying on others is usually detrimental.

	<TEXT> The same advice always applies to most adversarial court systems.

Dispute the ticket and hope the cop doesn't show up.

If the cop shows up, request a reduction in the fine.

If the cop refuses, you're really SOL. Not even a blue chip lawyer could argue his way out of a speeding ticket as the municipal/state/provincial foundations encompassing these systems are designed in a way that most of the burden of proof relies on the trust that the officer is upholding the integrity of such laws.

While I find this video cringey, I can understand why she fought it. Her friends tried to play counsel, and only when they got into the court room did they realize the judge wasn't going to have any of it.

Edit: There's this case on youtube where a regular layman fights a Motorcycle Helmet fine, and wins. He went in there calm, asked a few pertinent questions and the judge found in his favour that he didn't break any laws. I can't find it though. </TEXT>
