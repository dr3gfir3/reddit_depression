As for your mother, who seems like the most loving mother to continue to work to support your sister at a late age is beautiful, once again, ask her what she wants to do, something that will make everything in her life worth living for. 
As for your sister, that is a hard situation, she has done this to herself, and its sad to hear has and still continues to struggle, I not really to sure what she can do.

When its someone who is good looking, my first thought is "oh my god, is my makeup okay? Do I look fat in this? Fuck I hope not. Is there something on my face? Oh god I look horrible, why today, do someone good looking have to be checking me out".
But lets say I dont find you attractive, and I put in an effort to look good, I really like that, gives me confidence and makes me feel good. 
The slide clances are always good, or if someone checks you out and they smile at you when you look at them, its a nice feeling.
But yeah, can go both ways.  </TEXT>
