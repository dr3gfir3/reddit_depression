	<TEXT> And if your Heav'en and Hell be true, and Fate that forced me to be born 
Forced me to Heav'en or Hell  I go, and hold Fate's insolence in scorn. 

I want not this, I want not that, already sick of Me and Thee ; 
And if we 're both transform'd and changed, what then becomes of Thee and Me? 

Enough to think such things may be : to say they are not or they are 
Were folly : leave them all to Fate, nor wage on shadows useless war. 

Do what thy manhood bids thee do, from none but self expert applause ; 
He noblest lives and noblest dies who makes and keeps his self-made laws. 

All other Life is living Death, a world where none but Phantoms dwell, 
A breath, a wind, a sound, a voice, a tinkling of the camel-bell.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jesus isn't a religion. Christianity is a religion. Was Jesus trying to start a religion? I would argue: no. Of course there was some visionary stuff going on where Jesus appeared after the bodily death and said something like "OK, please start a Church, will ya?" But I have to dispute the ownership of this line.

Ok, I agree with this. Jesus was not starting a religion (other religious figures like Muhammad were in some sense though and I equate the two as from the same source but let's look at Jesus). He was teaching a group of disciples which became a community. This community preserved and transmitted his teaching - in the Jerusalem Church under the guidance of his brother and other groups.

We don't know if he authorised these groups but we do know that esoteric knowledge is passed down in this way - it's a 'chain' as it were from teacher to student stretching way back. 

My claim that religion is a legitimate entity is that religion (not the Church - the ideology) IS the teaching. Somewhat embroidered and falsified in places but it contains the original teaching in part. I see religion as a Ferrari (say) where the people who are now the 'Authorised Owner's Club' don't know how to drive and haven't for centuries. You can say they are lying when they claim to be able to drive. They are. You can say they do it for power. They do. But you can't (imo) argue it isn't a Ferrari.

I agree with a lot of your points actually. I think you're pretty spot on but the acid test would be whether someone could work with the teachings of the Church - unchanged - in a magical context and gain some degree of enlightenment. I am not a Christian but I have experience of people who have done this so I would argue they could.

Same for Islam which is the tradition I work in. Of course you can go the ISIS route or be some mad mulla in Saudi. But again, I know people reading the same texts and doing the same practices who are very advanced and enlightened magical practitioners.

	<TEXT> Oh sorry. "Real" as in genuine magic. Spells can work but are not 'Real Magic' in my reading as magic concerns itself with non-material development with ability to make changes (with or without spells) as result of inner change.

Picking up a spellbook without inner work and inner change might work because of other factor but is not (imo) real magic in the sense I define it.

	<TEXT> I hear you. But I see some problems. I can see (and agree) how you can apply this definition -"Religion is an attempt to regulate and normalize the magical tendencies of the sentient beings." - to the Church. No worries.

Applying it to Jesus is more problematic no? Or would you go there?

If not, then on what basis do you make the Church representative of religion over the founder?

If you see them as the same - Jesus and the Church - I find that hard to square with a magical world view. 

You see the problem?

	<TEXT> I don't agree there. You have to define what religion **IS** first. 

if you take all the examples commonly used of how it is fucked up: ISIS, fundie loons, the Pope, whatever - you can prove quite easily that these are not in line with the teaching of the founder and are often the polar opposite. 

So once you realise that the bad examples aren't actually following a religion then it's just a matter of seeing whether *anyone* actually is. They may be, may not. Need to take out the trash first in order to see. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Crowley's conception of "the great work" is much higher then merely "gaining things."

Yeah, I agree. I should have qualified it... I was meaning magic in the popular imagination and wider public view. Not many people who are not interested in occultism see magic as a spiritual path... mostly they think Harry Potter. 

But you're right. I should have been more clear. Was assuming it was more of a non-magical audience lol. 

Offensive is probably strong: you must know there are whole systems of magic (cough) Chaos Magick for example, that are predicated on just that. And what are spells if not for attracting something? They are fairly ubiquitous... not everything is High Magic.

I'm not saying this is my take on it - just that it is a common perception and one a lot of so-called magicians seem to share regardless of Bardon, Crowley et al. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One reason: because the reasons *why* a person would give such a demonstration would be the same reasons which  make such things fail. 

I don't know why it is but I have proved it to myself many times. As an example: I can, through a specific method (doesn't matter what) take a newspaper, check the Racing pages and predict which horse will win which race with a 90% accuracy more or less.

If I do this with someone observing to show them it or - especially - if I bet on the horse, the horse will lose. That's pretty much 100% rate. 

I have other experiments in this too, this one is just an example. 

I don't really believe in **The Secret Chiefs** but sometimes I am tempted to believe that there is an operative force of 'someone' stopping these things from happening publically or being 'proved'. 

Maybe you need some sort of permission. Who knows. In any event, I know for sure that if you can do certain things magically then something kicks-in to stop this if it is done publicly as it were.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> and yet you are a muslim...

I think that is probably more of a problem for you than for me. It is fairly routine Islamic theology and has been for 1400 years. 

The basis of Islam is even the *shahada* - "There is no God...... except God".

It's kind of the one fundamental point. All else is pretty much subordinate. There are huge schools of philosophy on just this point - Ibn Tamiyah for example:

God is distinct from His creation; nothing of Him resides in it, nor is there any of His creation in Him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm guessing I'm just failing to see the point. You say God isn't a thing, but then how do you know anything at all about God?

I personally don't think you do - for sure. But the mindset is not a materialistic one, it's a move away from that. "Proof" or "being sure" is not important. 

I don't say it isn't for *some* religionists - they can sink into literalism and materialist views as much as anyone. But I would argue that their views are contrary to the views of the founder.

How do you know Jesus or Mohammad weren't made up, or at least the claims they make about the supernatural? 

Does it matter? They could be 'made up'. It's irrelevant - Jesus spoke in parables all the time. Does it matter if they were 'true'? Maybe in those days there were also a bunch of people laughing at him saying 'prove that happened - you made it up'. Of course he made it up - that's the point. 

It's not about whether it's true... it's about what you can get from it. And likewise, if these guys were proved to be 'made up' then nothing would change (for me). Because it's about what they're portraying. Whether they had historical existence or not doesn't impact what they represent. 

If there really is some super awesome extra consciousness that is out there, what exactly will thinking it help us do? Be more peaceful? Find purpose or self-worth?

That's a question each person who feels the urge to find out must answer for themselves. My answer would not be your answer. And maybe it is not an important question for you? Only the individual can judge that. 

Also, how certain are you on a scale of 0-100% that 'God' the concept really describes something tangible and true and real? Does doubt prevent you from being sure?

Doubt and belief does not really come into it. I think if you do certain things then you get - say - Experience X. This experience is not God but it is an experience where you are aware of many things you are not normally aware of. One of them is something you could give a label to like 'Universe', 'Mind', 'Reality' or whatever. I just choose the word 'God' because I relate to it but it is nothing much in common with the God atheists are claiming does not exist - as I say, I don't believe in that God either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's crazy to me that you only admit to believing in something you claim does not exist.

Well that's what magic is concerned with - in some definitions it's a rejection of such statements as you just made.

A magician would say to this that of course you are correct and magic does not exist - for you. Because *we are all* magicians and we create our reality. 

You are just creating a reality where the only reality that exists is the only one you can see.

	<TEXT> How do you know, that if you spent a lot of time studying this magic, that you have reached this higher consciousness? 

You know because you already have it. You *remember* it when you're in it... mostly states and feelings you had as a child.

Do they provide information that was only attainable through this state, or can it be discovered in any way?

They don't really provide - they tell you a technique (a specific meditation say) which might not be commonly available and what you get from that when you practice it is unique to you. It's almost like this 'Holographic Universe' idea where you are the sole protagonist. But I don't know what I think about that... it's problematic for me but it seems like that. 

 Do you trust your teachers that they've reached this higher consciousness?

Definitely not. Don't trust anything you can't prove to yourself. It doesn't matter about them at a certain level anyway. It's about personal effort - they can't put that effort in for you. You have to do it yourself. 

Could factors like the sunk cost fallacy or confirmation bias lead you to believing that you've reached a higher consciousness when in reality you've just spend a lot of time thinking making you more aware of things.

Definitely. I think a lot of 'gurus' and others are in this boat. They convince themselves and then their disciples bolster it. 

But the main thing that happens I think is that you realise there is no 'higher consciousness' - I don't mean that in some woo-woo way but more that there is no end to it. It's all relative. Compared to someone you may be advanced, to someone else far behind. 

Life is too short for you to reach 'the end' and there may not be one - so instead it becomes a more measured effort to self-improve rather than 'get to the end' if that makes sense. Part of the journey is realising you're never going to be Jesus or Buddha but you can be a better you every day when you wake up - you won't but you decide to live with that goal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Care to tell me what you know about God?

Difficult one. First thing I think to say is that it's just a word. I'll revert to an Islamic terminology - not for any partisan reason but because I'm most comfortable expressing that. 

'Allah' is not a name but just the word for 'God' in the abstract. Jews and Christians use the same word so it's not uniquely Islamic - if this chat was in Arabic you'd use that word in your post above. 

This word can also mean 'Truth' or 'Reality' - it doesn't betoken anything in itself. I take it to mean 'the thing which will exist when everything else ceases to exist' which is another Islamic way of saying it. 

We can't know 'God' because God is not a 'thing' - everything you can conceive of that exists is a 'thing'. If you made a list of all these that ever existed and ever could or will - 'God' will not be on that list. 

So, to me (and this is just me, other may disagree), the process of religion is not a faith or belief but a method of finding how to bridge that gap between us as 'things' and 'no thing'.  Many systems attempt this - Zen, meditation etc.... people attempt it with drugs. There are alternate forms of consciousness and you don't need drugs to access them. To me, magic, spirituality, all these things are methods to access these supra-normal modalities of seeing. 

Of course most religionists in the mosque or at Mass aren't doing this and would object to it....even scream blasphemy, but if you study religious texts objectively then it is clear that was what the founders like Jesus and Muhammad were doing. 

Religion can still work for this but we don't really need it now. There are other ways - I think even an atheist can access these realities though obviously they would not call it God and, depending on their investment, might try to rationalise it. But, as I say, they're often hung up on opposing the 'old man on the cloud' and if you can get them looking up at the stars in the desert (so to speak) they feel the same awe generally. They just don't call that God because they've been conditioned to use that word only for certain contexts. But they can feel it just the same. 

I would say that if we can live in our 'real perception' then we can answer these questions easier. None of us really do. Sometimes we're doing something banal and we just 'wake up' and feel totally alive, wondering why we don't feel like that all the time... next thing we're back asleep again for weeks... sleepwalking through life. 

If we were 'awake' more often we'd know more. Magic and other systems are just methods of bringing these states about.

	<TEXT> How do you study magic? Can you define magic?

You need to find a system to study - there are many - and follow that system, either in a group, under a teacher or a sole practitioner. 

I studied Franz Bardon for a while - basically the curriculum begins with meditation and you master successive stages (making your mind blank, being able to have no thoughts etc) which can take many years. There's elements of yoga and sitting in various postures - all supposed to lead to a mastery of the mind and body and a subsequent change in consciousness. The theory is that this change of consciousness gives insights and access to 'another world'. It's roughly mappable to the Buddhist concept of Enlightenment but not quite. 

For me this is the definition of magic: a system like Zen, yoga, whatever that is designed to lead to some form of higher consciousness. Unlike those systems however which are moral/spiritual in tone, magic focusses also on 'gaining things'.

It's my opinion (I could be wrong) that this element - spells for money etc - is not actually real and, though it can work, is designed to 'tempt' people or test the student. You COULD do this sort of thing but the aim is to bypass it. It's a trap - thats why you see many self-professed magicians who are not rich and have money problems. 

Magic is essentially a spiritual path but one which - again, just my opinion, could be wrong - leads to God. So it sits well with religion imo. My main interest is in  Islamic Magic and I don't see any conflict with mainstream Islam with it - many Muslims do though. But they'd say the same about Sufism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh missed that. It's definitely one of the classics. I think the evidence is pretty overwhelming and he conclusively argues his case imo.

Not much since then in a Christian context. I recommend "Magic in Islam" by Michael Muhammad Knight which just came out and is interesting from an Islamic perspective. 

Islam has a different take than Christianity as djinn are held to be not like demons and can be good or bad or Muslim/Christian even. So there is a large tradition of djinn-related magic in an Islamic and pre-Islamic context.

And then there's the Shamanic subtext which is borderline magical. The life of Muhammad in the traditions overlaps almost seamlessly with traditional accounts of the Shamanic initiation - is a fascinating study.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. Morton wrote a great book on it "Jesus the Magician". Many of his activities can be shown to have roots in Judeo-magical traditions. 

Early Gnosticism also can lay claim to being an authorative Christian iteration - all the more so since its suppression by the emerging Church. Gnosticism is hardcore magic in essence.

	<TEXT> Very often atheist use words intended to insult which *they themselves* would find insulting - they can't seem to grasp that they might not be insulting to the recipient necessarily. 

When someone calls religion a 'fairy tale' I'm thinking 'yeah.. of course'. It's like they've never heard of Campbell or Jung and don't have any connection to the Imaginal - which unfortunately is often the case in actuality. 

It can get quite hilarious in some cases - taken to the ultimate degree extreme hardcore cases go frothing about a God that no religionist ever believed in but only exists in their own minds. I have yet to have a debate with an atheist where I ask them what God they disbelieve in and I end up thinking 'yeah, I don't believe in that crap either'. 

Re Magic: to me it refers to a system which claims to be able to enable a person to impose their will on objects and people through non-material means as a by-product of a certain form of self-development. I have no problem with it at all. Religion is not magic *per se* but the two do overlap.  </TEXT>

I guess for you it was to label people and reinforce your position. All cool.

Thanks, not my first language.

No worries.... not my mother-tongue either. Just happened to pick that one up as I'm called that a lot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it's inherent in Islamic belief. The foundation is that we cannot know God so we don't actually know what He is like except from inference. 

Also, God is dynamic in that He is not limited and could change the rules - most Muslims believe He won't but they can't (unless they are reductionist fundies) believe he *can't*. 

So one must constantly use Reason and seek knowledge. It's less belief than a way to live or a path. Most Westerners, let alone atheists, don't grasp that so well as they're conditioned to Judeo-Christianity.

I've enjoyed talking to you btw - a convo where you can leave feeling some common ground and no entrenched conflict is a real breath of fresh air and it's great we've been able to do it if even for only a little while. Especially here... is very inspiring!

Thanks for your input but you haven't really given anything I can't get down at the local Wahabi mosque or hardcore Christian fundamentalist hellfire revival meeting.

I'll let you guys fight it out over which one of you is going to 'loose' - I don't care about winning.

I get that. You're playing rugby and get to pick up the ball and run. I'm playing soccer and that's not in my rules.

I don't think you're game is better than mine or mine yours. I don't think there is 'one true game' and you enjoying yours - or even claiming that your game's rules apply to every game there ever could be - does not impact the way I play my game at all.

I can't apply my rules to your game. And you can't apply yours to mine. The difference is you think you can. 

Which is also fair enough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True... I also envy atheists sometimes. Not the certainty, you can get that in religion, and certainly not the dogmatism (ditto) but atheism at it's best is sometimes more 'in the moment'. Religion aims at this too but too much gets in the way - atheism (the old school variety anyway) can sometimes be much purer. 

I'm not an agnostic though btw, raised a Christian by fundie evangelicals and found may way to Islam around the age of 18. 30 years ago plus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My theoretical belief system is asinine and ridiculous. Could you imagine if I started making laws based on these beliefs?

Well I think people *HAVE* made laws based on asinine and ridiculous beliefs. I part company with you on this if you're seriously trying to argue our moral and legal systems are somehow not control-systems put in place to keep the elite in a class above the rabble. Religion serves the same purpose - it's a double-whammy.... both are equally fallacious. 

So, can't see how it would be much different. I guess you'd be stealing off your own people rather than other countries but pretty much business as usual. In any event all it would do is give **everyone** a mandate to do what only the elite have permission to do as it is now. No moral difference at least... might be more fair. Even distribution of stolen goods. 

I could be following the words of a complete madman.

Undoubtedly you are in some areas. Lots of madmen out there. But then it depends on your definition of 'mad'. Mine is probably far broader than yours by the sound of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hm, you can prove that earth is spherical - get in the middle of a large plain or sea, or on any high point where nothing stops you from seing the horizon - you'll see that the horizon is a circle around you, and that is applicable to any point on earth. 

Is it though? I don't think it's that simple. I've been listening lately to some Flat Earth podcasts.... I don't believe it and they're clearly batshit crazy but that's not the point: the point is that they can convince themselves and argue their position rationally. Again, I don't believe them but I don't have proof either way and am not interested in that. 

It's not as simple as invoking science - that does not deter these guys. 

The case about a friend is not a different case - it is about you believing he is not able to kill or you believing he is not lying. That is trust - extrapolating the good you've witnessed of this person before to the current situation.

I disagree. I might know he is a killer of other people but believe him in this case because I choose to believe he doesn't lie to me. Many possibilities. 

And yes, since the people who teach about god are religious leaders, they matter when talking about god.

To you they might matter. To me not at all. In fact I don't think they teach about God in the least generally speaking. You are not religious or a believer in God I guess... if you were then you might be able to tell why they aren't. Lots of them are just con-men with no faith at all. Believing what they try to portray about themselves is as foolish as believing a politician cares about the lives and welfare of his constituents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, you are saying you don't care if this is true, but you still believe it? you allow for a possibility that it is not true yet you believe it?

If we are talking about God then yes... I don't feel a need for proof of God in any way and believe in the existence of such a being without any necessity of proof. I think I've always felt this. 

If you mean a specific religious teaching then that's different - obviously, rationally, I can see how many of them are adjusted and utilised as power-structures or whatever. I'd make a distinction between 'religion' and 'God' in some ways. 

And no, sorry, i cannot concieve of any other option. Why would I?

Yes, is an interesting question. I don't know... why would you? I've asked hardcore religionists something similar - they can't imagine any options other than their particular world-view either. I think rigid systems will do this.

If you honestly believe in elves and unicorns then, I guess, believing is god (gods) is understandable, too. But why people never see them?

Obviously I also believe that people do see them. That follows on from the question and answer no? Again though, I don't think people who see them are interested in 'proving' it. 

I have a question of my own - why do you need to believe in god? there is nothing around you in your everyday life that cannot be explained without god - why would you even consider the existence of god possible?

Good question. I think that the question of God arises naturally. That is to say (I speak for myself only here ymmv) I think if I was brought up somehow on a desert island and I somehow was educated enough to formulate the question it would naturally arise. I think when you look up at the stars and wonder the question is a natural one: "is there something more...." is there something "bigger" than me/us?

I think there is. I don't need proof of it and it's not a need. It's just how I answer the question. Maybe God doesn't even know we exist. 

We talked for about three hours, and we could not understand how the other one lives with his/her beliefs/atheism

Yeah, this is what I meant above. I am not trying to be disrepectful to you or say you should change your view in any way but surely an atheist (or religionist) who can totally see and understand all other options is somehow more 'free' (for want of a better word) than one who can only see their own?

Maybe, it is because I was raised in an atheist family and an atheist country, and he was born and raised in a religious environment, I don't know.

Could be. But maybe atheism is your Truth. It might not be 'true' in an absolute sense - in fact nothing may be. I often wonder that if we could somehow 'see it all' then all the talk of God, atheism, religion and all other human ideals would be just not remotely accurate or significant. In fact this is my position - but the thing that is outside of all that... I call God. That's all there is too it really.... it's not about belief at all, it's more that I think there's something more than 'us' and 'this'.

	<TEXT> But in this case a wise person would know that he does exactly this. An honest person will say "I want to believe, because belief gives me comfort, not because I know that my beliefs are true".

But they would still have to take the position they are true. I believe the earth is spherical. I can't prove it and have no interest in it. It may be flat for all I know... I just choose to believe it's spherical.

When you say to your friend "I believe you"...

Different case entirely. Often you believe your friend when proof is impossible... he's going to jail for murder for example and can't prove he didn't do it. But you believe he is innocent. Is a different thing... actually this is more like the religious position. 

Now, I do believe that people preaching religion do benefit from believers, because their belief gives the preachers power. And I do not personally know the preachers to be honest and wise people.

That's kind of obvious no? I thought we were talking about the concept of a God in the abstract - not some sectarian loon who all sane people know to be most likely a con-artist. There's no connection. 

You're half-way down the road to arguing the counterfeit dollar bill proves no real one exists. Everyone knows religious leaders in the main are fucked up. 

What's that got to do with the philosophical question of God?

	<TEXT> Why would you think something is true without proof?

I don't. I am not interested in 'true' or 'proof'. I think this is why Materialists often misunderstand where religionists are coming from. Can you not conceive of any other options? Really?

Give me either a reliable source or the access to primary evidence.

Why? That's like me asking you to show me Science's Revealed Holy Scripture handed down from God.

People who wrote something ages ago about things that only happened once are not a reliable source.

Never said it was. As I said... not remotely interested in 'proof' in this sense. 

See, there were also people who wrote about unicorns and mermaids, nymphs and elves. Why do you not believe them?

Actually I do.

If a woman tells you she got pregnant without having sex with a man, will you believe it? Why?

Depends on the woman and the context. These days in this climate then 100% not. But not because of the claim necessarily. More because of what we might term 'current state of humanity'

If a man told you that god spoke to him, would you believe him? Why?

I would need more data. I'd need to know what he understood by 'spoke' and 'God' and what 'God' said. But I wouldn't *disbelieve* I'd hear him out and assess it. Certainly I think it's possible.

That statement only makes sense *after* you have proved there is someone there.  I think what you mean to say is: "Seeing someone standing behind you is proof that they are there". 

To which I would reply:

So you think perceiving something as being there is proof? Wow.

Sufferers from Charles Bonnet Syndrome for example see dwarves, elves and leprachauns. They see them. You believe in those beings I guess? The person has proof right?

	<TEXT> Faith is required to believe in religious ideas because there is a lack of evidence.

I think this is a misreading. It is kind of true today because there are lots of Materialists about and these don't stop being that even if they get religious but - historically, and particularly thousands of years ago - religion has not been related to faith at all. It's been related to perception of the numinous.

Granted most religious Institutions these days have moved away from that but it doesn't mean they can erase the basis of their systems.  </TEXT>

Could it be you actually don't believe that you owe me money because I've not given you any reason to believe me? :P

No, it's more like I give zero fucks either way. My decision to pay things is based on other factors than whether I owe them. I lack empathy. Sue me.

Seems you're being dishonest with me either way.

Why does it seem? Because you say so? What is dishonesty to you? Could the definition in your view perhaps be "Dishonesty is failing to fit into the framework I declare to be true"?

I am of the opinion that the vast majority of human beings require evidence to believe claims.

What I do care about is stupidity and there is a hell of a lot of it in both atheist 'thought' and religious 'belief'. 

I think one can be rational and be a believer IF one is brutally honest and rigorous in one's thinking (most believers aren't - at least the obvious ones) and I think an atheist CAN (in theory) realise that religion can be a deep philosophical system and not be reduced to some playground Aunt Sally so they can take easy points off hitting it.

Kind of sad no? You're admitting that you think your opinion is the only true one even though the person you have that opinion about - based on nothing - is proving you to be wrong. 

On the other hand nice job comparing being Catalan to being a religious fanatic.

Can't see where I could remotely get that idea. See first comment above.

They could not hate me more so I'm good. Oth there is always the hope that the odd person will see that your attitude may not be 'direct from Mount Sinai'. Slim hope... but it's there.

Nope. Read again.

that I will read your well worded but too long essay on such trivial matters.

Never assumed that you would or could. In fact I was not even writing for you. If you were the only one reading or it was a PM I would not have wasted my time.

	<TEXT> I'm glad you posted this because it strikes at the heart of the very thing I am talking about. 

I criticise lots of things: Catalan Nationalism, Islamic fundamentalism and Wahabism etc - but only if they impact my life and interests. My criticism is, in effect, a way of saying " this interests me, I like this issue but I want it to be better (for Me) in way XYZ....)" I care, in short.

The main thing I am criticising in all these things might be termed as a non-thinking binary reductionist black/white mode which is a kind of moronic dumbing down which currently plagues our societies in the West and East. I love Islam but object to Islamism for example. All Islamists I discuss this with view me as anti-Islam. 

You see where I am going with this? /u/fedezen realises I have criticised certain things from which he derives a certain psychological balance - this, to him, seems to mean that I am a fascist. 

But, if he knew me (which he does not - and tellingly, this does not stop him making a dictat - his 'truth' is The Truth and will continue to be even after this posting no doubt) he would also know I am very active in Antifa and Left-wing radical politics. 

But - for him - this is impossible to be the case. It just doesn't enter his consciousness as a *possibility* because I have criticised something which is at the core of his being. Therefore I must be the opposite to him. I must be the thing he hates (ie some form of imagined and constructed Francoist - the bogeyman in his closet - which has no existence other than that with which he imbues it) because otherwise we would have that troublesome worm in the apple called 'nuance'. 

We're all fundamentalists now I suppose.

	<TEXT> Yes, but they haven't really thought it through have they? 

The Islamic God does not really have any characteristics that are not shared by the Christian God - if you discount the Trinity which many early Christian groups did not adhere to either. 

In another sense, in Islam, God is the thing 'which does not pass away' - and is unknowable. If any other Gods also have that characteristic of continuing to exist when all else has ceased to be, then this is the same thing philosophically.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a dream once which seemed very long. I had committed a crime and I had to consequently join the Army. My job there was assigned as a bomb-disposal expert.

Me and my partner had to find an defuse a certain bomb and we hunted for this bomb through ruined bombed-out houses. After a certain number of these searches we found a bomb in a basement and picked it up to take it back to base for some reason. 

Someone was chasing us and I was carrying the bomb. We went from house to house hiding - all the time trying to avoid the person and stop the bomb from going off.... I was acutely aware it was on a timer and we had to avoid this pursuer and get rid of the bomb before it exploded. 

This went on for a while, hiding in houses, running down streets and eventually we were near Base - but we never made it. The bomb exploded with an alarm sound (ie it was not an explosion but the alarm WAS the explosion) and I woke up instantly with the real life alarm going off.

	<TEXT> Allah is just the word for 'God' in the abstract. Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians use it and if you look in an Arabic Bible you will see this is the word the Christians use and which Jesus uses also. 

It is not a name - it just means 'God'. An Arabic speaking atheist would use it to describe the concept regardless of religious context.

It cannot therefore be derived from the moon god trope - this is a typically ignorant idea promulgated by US right-wing Christians who know nothing of the world outside the US let alone religions other than the one the claim (wrongly) to profess - which depends on the uniquely Islamic context and the 'personal name' (like Jehovah) misreading. 

The Arabic for 'God' and 'god' - let alone 'moon god' also have nothing in common linguistically but that's yet another story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting points. 

I don't know much about Christian theology. Is there held to be a point at which God evolved a plan to sacrifice His son as it were? Or is this held to be a plan from the beginning in the light of some sort of foreknowledge?

I think the latter no? I'm not aware of a teaching that shows God as reacting to human sin 'in time' as it were but surely this must be the case as Adam and Eve were sinless? So He must have come up with this plan as a reaction to the Fall at some point?

That's all fine as far as it goes but why did He stop? Why can't He say (for example) "this plan didn't work - far too many people are still going to hell, I need a new plan again" and have a Plan B?

The God who came up with Plan A (Christ's sacrifice) could surely come up with another plan but the God most Christians seem to conceive of seems incapable of this action.

Is not coherent in the theology is it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In theory but it's not that simple - the resurrection negates the sacrifice. The whole point is that someone 'pays' by dying. And staying dead.

Unless one argues that it is the process of death as opposed to the fact of death (ie no longer partaking of life) which is the sacrifice. But philosophically this has serious flaws too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Evolution is true. It's a fact. 

Actually it's a theory. One of several that are competing models. If you are referring to Darwinism then that is just one model. There are others.

I happen to believe some form of evolution is the correct model but we don't have facts. That's why it's called a theory. 

But I agree with you in the main. I don't believe things that I cannot verify for myself but what does 'verify' mean? For me it does not necessarily equate always to scientific proof. It could mean many things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't. Not until you can SHOW me that they are true. Until then you are just wasting my time.

That depends on your level of understanding surely? Something could be true but it could still be impossible to demonstrate to a five year old (say).

So if you don't take this aspect into account it might equally be possible (likely even) that it is not the demonstrator who is wasting your time but you who is wasting theirs.

Didn't read past this.. too long. But I can tell you the reason: I don't engage in pointless activities that will benefit me nothing. 

It seems you do though as if your view of Muslims is correct you are in a false position trying to reason with one.

My advice to you is to do as I do: when you are convinced someone is not worth your time just move on. 

You should not bother engaging me. It will profit you nothing except perhaps bolster your feelings of being correct and you can better get that more effectively with those who share your world view. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, true, I agree. I think that there always has to be some inflexibility (for want of a better word) or else people could go off reservation and claim orthodoxy. Now when that happens they can be safely just labelled a cult. 

Interestingly Islam does have some flexibility in some sense, if only in retrospect as it conceives that God *did* adjust revelation over time - with the Torah, Jesus and the Qu'ran which are all held to be from the same source but addressing different needs.

The Muhammad last prophet point is a good observation, never thought about it like that before.... but there is a hadith somewhere (can't find it now) that does say that in the end-times a new Book will be sent which the Muslims will find impossible to accept. Wish I could find that saying, will keep looking.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why is God 'Static' in orthodox religious paradigms? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-28 16:51:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> That is to say in the Christian Scriptures (for example), God *reacts* to situations on the ground. In one case Abraham bargains with Him to save members of a community slated for annihilation and God adjusts His plans. In other cases He changes His mind based on certain developments.

The very concept of prayer implies that God can be petitioned and thus His plans can be adjusted in some way. 

But in orthodox established religion God is seen as being static - as being *unable* to change His mind. His word binds Him. He cannot - say - decide to send His Son AGAIN to save the world. He cannot decide to NOT punish anyone and change the deal. 

Or can He?

Can He do these things and still be God? If so, why doesn't He? Why is He limited in this way in these religious views? </TEXT>

I prefer this one from Tukulti-Ninurta I (no meme - I have these in memory):

It's carved by an empty stone throne which is highly symbolic. But I suppose in the current case there *IS* something in the God's place on the symbolic throne isn't there?

It's not God..... but it is perhaps *A* god. Of sorts.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it realistic to try to CF a property for a Holistic Centre? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-28 13:20:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My partner and I have been working on a project for about a year which is essentially a Holistic/Educational centre for the arts (my partner and I are writers/musicians among other things) where workshops and lectures will be given. We've been thinking of renting a place but not found the right one and are turning our thoughts to the possibility of purchasing - would need around 500k realistically. 

The Centre would fund itself by organising retreats and workshops in a variety of topics with lectures by people of influence in the fields we cover: mostly music, writing and the arts. There would be a strong 'relaxation' element alongside the learning one as we propose this in some mediterrenean location.

A key part of it would be some associated land where we would have 4-5 wooden huts where people could come and stay for 12 months (for free - we would gift this) in order to finish their novel, painting or whatever. 

So my question is: is this realistic to try to crowdfund this project? I know nothing of this and we'd been assuming to rent but it is now entering our thinking to purchase a place if possible.

Anyone any tips, hints or suggestions? Much appreciated!

The reason I think it's important is that in Islam there is a separate tradition about Jesus that goes back almost to the same time as Christianity does, which comes from the same region but which has not been subject to alteration by the Church. 

In a way the Islamic tradition of Jesus is what the Western one would be if the Church had not altered the original teachings and adjusted/defined the books of the Bible. 

There are many sayings of Jesus there that are not in the current or Christian or Gnostic tradition - they've been preserved intact and are virtually unknown in the West. Needless to say the Jesus they present is not exactly one the Church would recognise. </TEXT>

I can tell you one thing: it ain't Michael Muhammad Knight. </TEXT>
