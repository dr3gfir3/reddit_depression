	<TEXT> It's so hard to put into words, but when you have thoughts/feelings, to try to imagine yourself as a casual, non-judging, silent observer. Just as you may notice a scene play out in front of you, try to notice what is playing out internally/emotionally/physically. Accepting begins by simply NOT trying to change it aggressively--by saying that was is happening is OK; that it will pass.  I know this is all pretty vague, and I'm sorry I can't explain it much better.

[Here](http://www3.georgetown.edu/student-affairs/caps/pages/relaxation.html) is another link I found with some simpler breathing/relaxation techniques than what I posted before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I first started meditating and studying yoga, I was an EXTREMELY anxious person, and would often have anxiety attacks, especially in the middle of the night. Some were minor, some were very serious. One of the strategies I learned from my yoga teacher was to simply try to *notice* the anxiety happening in as detached a way as possible. I remember one night as I was in bed, my heart racing, panic-stricken, I just tried to very carefully observe what was happening without judging or telling myself to "calm down" (as if that helps anyway). It was like *OK. This is a thing that is happening. Just observe it happen. This is not 'me.' This will pass. Just breathe.* 

I found the key was firstly ACCEPTING the fact that I experienced anxiety. Once you accept it, you can detach somewhat, and it gets so much easier.

On a more general note, meditation combined with yoga was SUCH a transformational thing for me. I attribute most of the disappearance of occasionally severe anxiety with practising these two things, as well as adopting positive thinking. 

[Here](http://www.sivananda.org/teachings/fivepoints.html#meditation) is an outline for the yogic style of meditation that I practise(d), that has been unspeakably beneficial to me. 

Sorry for the ramble. Good luck :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting article. But really, his reason for "why [he's] not a vegan" seems to be that he finds meat "pleasurable" and possibly healthy. He more or less admits that being a vegan is probably best, but that he basically doesn't want to be (not an uncommon standpoint). As for how meat's
concentration of nutrients makes consuming at least some of them convenient and perhaps even smart

um, not really. First, concentration of nutrients? Lol? Compared to refined grains, maybe, but not much else. From what I remember, the most nutrient dense animal product is fish, which is something like 15% as "nutrient dense" as a typical leafy vegetable. Dairy and poultry are about 2/3 as nutrient dense as fish.  Aren't beans and legumes about 3 times as nutrient dense as fish? Unless "concentration of nutrients" means something different than nutrient dense.

Second, "convenience"? What's convenient for the typical western consumer (i.e., driving to the supermarket, picking up a slab of meat, going home to cook it) is more of an illusion of convenience. Are factory farms located thousands of kilometres from where we live, heavily subsidised by our governments and the epitome of waste and cruelty "convenient"? If so, to whom? Such an unsustainable system is convenient only in the short term, to the most privileged members of our planet, and comes at some horrific costs.

	<TEXT> It depends where you are--and where the tats are. Are we talking face/neck tats? That might not go over well at most places. Do you have a small tasteful tattoo on your arm, wrist or hand? Is it a swastika, or a small piece of text? Lots of variables. 

Mind you, if you're applying at an uptight private Christian school, they may be more judgmental than, say, a public school. One of my co-workers had tribal tattoos all up both arms, and never had a problem getting a job or respect (urban public school in Canada). </TEXT>

The 6-7% photograph I find to be on the very unattractive side of that "line" you mention. The 3-6% picture is freakish and disgusting, both visually and along with the thought of the vanity/self-obsession that would likely accompany having that type of body in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As much as I may not like it, I think I would have reacted exactly as Louie's date did in the scene.  There's a cognitive/emotional dissonance there that I recognise, like she did--she even admits that she would have been pissed off if he *had* fought him--it's a very basic, primitive turn-off to see a man emasculated, to be shown possibly unable to defend himself or his dignity.

That said, there are other non-violent ways Louie could have responded that would have been empowering and therefore a "turn-on"--to put the asshole in his place verbally, for example (which I bet real-Louie could do with about 4 seconds forethought). Or to completely ignore him, or diffuse the situation in a way that is in its own way a display of strength of character, brave and strong instead of cowardly and weak. Or a non-grovelling type of pacificism. What would Gandhi have done in this situation? Apart from the absurdity of the idea, I bet he would have handled it right.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right--problems with things like malnutrition and poor water has much more to do with resource distribution than scarcity. I definitely think there's a moral imperative to reduce the suffering we cause as much as possible. My gut reaction is to say that destruction in itself isn't necessarily suffering--so a person who sweeps bugs from her path or refuses to walk through a field or forest. But on the same hand, insects DO experience some type of sentience, even worms, so I'm not sure how that idea holds up either. 

Maybe it's about trying to find a balance, understanding the connections and making out actions count. Not eating meat might be a necessary action, or maybe just making sure the meat we do eat is cared for in a respectful and environmentally sound manner.

Well said! And insofar as, say, killing a pig for food when there are less harmful, healthy, only slightly-inconvenient alternatives: definitely not permissible. As someone who lives in an urban environment where the vast majority of available food is unethically produced, ESPECIALLY meat products, I can't justify supporting it. I wish there were more sustainable and cruelty-free options, but where I live, there really aren't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like there's definitely a spectrum of suffering/harm involved. Factory farming, for example, would be at the far end, whereas eating, say, eggs from free-range chickens on a local farm would be at the other end. But even still: is it ever "humane" to kill another being, especially directly?--or rather, it is not always a direct infliction of suffering to kill an animal?

And is it not even harmful to feed grain to animals (which we then kill for food, or whose eggs we consume, or whose milk, etc.) when 1 billion people suffer from malnutrition and do not have enough to eat? To provide water for animals intended for slaughter or food production when 1 billion people do not have access to clean drinking water? I know that these last two examples involve much less direct suffering, but it's my belief that supporting any unsustainable system is harmful, and unethical, from both a Buddhist and general perspective.

What do you think?

What I cannot understand: how anyone who practices *ahimsa*, be it a buddhist monk, a pracitioner of yoga, or anyone else, can otherwise justify consuming meat, and most meat products. There is so much suffering involved, especially where animal products are a product of factory farming, which is beyond nightmarish in terms of the suffering animals endure there, as well as less obvious harm done ecologically, socially, and politically. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi men! This is the last of 10 questions I've been asking this week connected to love and dating. Thanks for answering!

Imagine that youre dating a woman for whom you have strong feelings. She is an attractive, kind, feminine woman, who is happy and busy. You enjoy each others company. She accepts you as you are, and never tells you what to do. 

That said, there are certain unusual aspects to the courtship. For example, though she always returns your calls/texts/e-mails, she does not call, e-mail, or text you out of the blue.  You generally have to take the lead in the relationship.  She has certain principles, like not living with a man before shes married.  She does not sleep with you until she feels completely comfortable, which takes about six weeks.

How do you feel about this? Does any of these things bother you? Any deal-breakers that would prompt you to call it off?

Edit: clarification on the sex comment. </TEXT>

Talking about your accomplishments and life in the natural context of a give-and-take conversation: good. Monologuing/bragging about your achievements: bad.

	<TEXT> Hi men! I have a series of 10 semi-related questions connected to dating and love for adult, heterosexual men, but instead of posting a huge survey, I thought I'd post a few at a time so you may be more likely to read and respond. Please feel free to answer any or all of the below 3 questions, as honestly as possible! And if you're wondering what this is all about, I'd be happy to explain in about a week's time.

**Question 7** In general, not specifically with women/dating, do you like a challenge?

**Question 8** All other factors being equal, including intelligence, would you prefer to talk to a woman who is usually light and friendly, or serious and heavy? 

**Question 9** Do you get pleasure from taking a woman out (i.e., picking her up, taking her to a restaurant/event, and covering most of or all of the cost)?

Apart from that, I'll give nearly anyone a chance--an impression can be SO far off when you first meet someone, so why not take an hour out of your day to see if there might be something there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi men! I have a series of 10 semi-related questions connected to dating and love for adult, heterosexual men, but instead of posting a huge survey, I thought I'd post a few at a time so you may be more likely to read and respond. Please feel free to answer any or all of the below 3 questions, as honestly as possible! And if you're wondering what this is all about, I'd be happy to explain in about a week's time. 

**Question 4** Do you find chatty women annoying?

**Question 5** Do you find the "unobtainable" exciting (in general, not specifically in regards to women or dating)?

**Question 6** Do you like women in feminine clothing (i.e., skirts, dresses, blouses, heels, accessories, etc.)?

	<TEXT> My mind definitely wanders less, and that it's much more under my control. Like when I'm walking, for example, I really "let" my mind wander, but it's much more a conscious thing, like taking specific turns on a path instead of just stumbling through the thought woods, you know? Fantasy and day dreaming are also much more conscious activities. I still do it, but less often, and only after making a conscious choice to do so. 

Interestingly, I never really "noticed" this change until just now. Thanks for indirectly helping me realise this, OP! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOST, Mad Men, GoT, Breaking Bad, Enlightened, and The Wire all gripped the hell out of me, and all for different reasons--you'd probably love most of those given your other tastes. I'd recommend you watch a few pilots and see which one you're thinking about three days later. 

And for what it's worth, Freud would say you should watch Game of Thrones. In your list, you mentioned it first, which means that on a subconscious level it's foremost on your mind and what you feel you want most. </TEXT>

I have a series of semi-related questions about dating and love for adult, heterosexual men, but instead of posting a huge survey, I thought I'd post three at a time so you may be more likely to read and respond. Please feel free to answer any or all of the below 3 questions, as honestly as possible!  And if you're wondering what this is all about, I'd be happy to explain in about a week's time.

**Question 1** If the woman you loved wanted to wait until marriage to have sex, would you respect that decision?

**Question 2** If you really loved a woman who dumps you, would you try to get her back in any way (big or small)?

**Question 3** You see a woman in a crowded room you really want to meet, but then she seems to disappear in the crowd. Would you try to find her?

	<TEXT> I get that Emmett's played a very strong game strategically, but I'm rooting against him simply because I don't like him. I can't even really pinpoint why--maybe it's this kind of understated arrogance, or his smugness, or something else, but on a personal level, I just don't *like* him--so I don't want him to win. Though perhaps not the best players strategically, I do like Jillian, and I adore Gary, so I'd like to see one of them win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are even some interesting, more subtle political statements with some of the more "traditionally" feminine characters. Look how quickly Sansa is victimised and abused, her various submissions rendering her both sympathetic and pathetic (in a way). And then you have a luxuriously feminine character like Margaery, who is careful in how she uses her feminine charms and sexuality to her own ends. I'm at the point in the novels where the TV show is now, but you can almost FEEL this power emerging in Margaery, based on that "feminine" nurturing perception of her around King's Landing, combined with this sexual energy she emits. 

The characters are not caricatures, not mere symbols, but full of intricate layers and complexities. Most have traits both "feminine" and "masculine"--whatever those terms mean--powerful in some ways, powerless in others, conflicted, sometimes strong, sometimes weak. In other words: like real people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, any real reply I give will be largely redundant of Daemonicus's points--but to say that he "created the entire world soup to nuts" is not true. It is not fantasy or spec fic in its political structure--it is analgous (and in some ways identical) to the political framework of Europe in the middle ages.  Can we fault him for CHOOSING to use this political structure, instead of a completely new one? Of course not. The sub-genre is MEDIEVAL FANTASY. 

Like D says below, creating relatability is probably part of that choice. As a writer though, he was drawn to that for probably several reasons, some intentional, some natural to his vision. To criticise a writer for choosing NOT to write outside his chosen genre to subvert traditional roles as much as possible seems absurd to me.  Yes, political power of the sexes is an important theme in the series, but it's by no means the only one. If it WERE the only one, OK, maybe a matriarchal setting would have been more engaging.  (MAYBE. I'd have to see that story to see either way.) But GRRM has chosen the best framework to explore ALL of the themes of ASOIAF, and he's done it marvelously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For every one scene involving gratuitous nipple exposure, there are seven scenes of a female character kicking serious ass in a MEDIEVAL setting.  This show has the strongest female characters (as main characters, not only supporting) taking place in a setting that is so politically oppressive to women it makes those early Mad Men days look like matriarchy.  Keep doing what you do, Game of Thrones.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd probably be more likely to feel like you were in Saudi Arabia in a men's only gym--because women aren't allowed at ANY gyms there!! (and though once existent, female-only gyms have been banned for about 5 years, I think). I see your point though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm for both men's-only and women's-only gyms. I feel that though it seems to be exclusive by definition, the concept is actually empowering and liberating for both genders. I discussed this with an ex-boyfriend a while ago, an extremely modest Catholic man, who expressed that he'd probably prefer to have a men's only section at the gym, or a men-only gym. Though I don't share his puritanical views, I found his reasoning interesting and convincing: he felt it truly distracting to be around women wearing tightfitting, often revealing clothing (revealing figure-wise, not necessarily skin-wise). He felt like this was distracting both from his intent at the gym--to work out--but also distracted him in what he considered to be a moral sense, causing him to struggle with not-staring, not feeling lust, etc. And in general, men DO struggle with lust more than women--it's a more pervasive drive, in ways both subtle and obvious.  

When I go to the gym, I am often and sometimes constantly checked out by men, probably unconsciously on their part. Occasionally I'm leered at. It all makes me feel uncomfortable. Yes, men may feel unwanted attention from women, too, but I'd say the ratio of this unwanted attention that women experience to men is at LEAST 10:1. Whether it's in an aerobics class, or running on a treadmill, doing pilates on a mat, or using an elliptical machine: the movements are sexy, and when women are wearing, say, spandex, or very short shorts and a tight tank-top, it takes considerable energy for most straight men to ignore their instinctive responses to those kinds of things. 

It is empowering to women to allow them the opportunity to remove themselves from situations where they may feel this to the extent that it makes them uncomfortable. But it's empowering and liberating to all of us to also allow men to remove themselves from these situations that make them uncomfortable too (for whatever reason).  </TEXT>

Nah, jk. I didn't really feel one way or the other about the setting, but it was definitely somewhat inferior to his other specials, all of which I found truly mesmerising, and completely engaged in, whereas this one was more... linear. Great material, good delivery, but something just felt a little.... off. Maybe it's the confidence thing you mentioned, but I'm really not sure.
