	<TEXT> I have been in your shoes. As in, I have also (and still do) want my parents to die. I did get beaten a lot growing up and wasn't allowed to have an opinion. When I was 22 I went nuts and walked in the rain for 7 hours until the cops brought me home because I was basically under house arrest after I graduated college. I turned into a workaholic for a couple years after I got my first job and am now doing well financially, not so well psychologically still but better than I was when I was in your shoes.

My advice: accept a job or two jobs. You can get a place for cheap over Craigslist if you rent a room out of a house. Lots of rooms come furnished already. Get your own bank account and if you can't you can just get cash back when using a debit card at a grocery store to have your own money to spend. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Name Is Malala - girl in Pakistan talks about life under the Taliban. She wrote stories for the BBC under a pseudonym and her dad was an activist. Eventually she even got shot by the Taliban because she was campaigning for girls to go to school. The bullet went through her head, but she survived, and even that is in the book.

This one is lesser known but very well written: Killing Time in Iraq by Colby Buzzell. He was a lazy bum of a 25 year old from the Bay Area and he decided to join the army back in 2003 just for kicks. He talks about going to Iraq, being way in over his head at times, and really messed up stuff. For example there is a point where a female soldier is raped and he and others in his unit were told to say they knew nothing about it - they weren't even asked if they knew something. Then there is stuff about paranoia over the explosions, a guy getting blown up the day he was submitting his resignation to go home, bonding with local Iraqis who are seen as traitors by the Taliban and have horrendous stuff happen to their families, etc. The book goes into his head and he isn't afraid of making himself look bad, which I loved - lots of memoir writers paint themselves as special snowflakes (looking at you Anna Kendrick!) whereas his was brutally honest and effortlessly intelligent. You can find an article by him here to see how he writes: https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/driving-uber-as-an-iraqi-war-veteran </TEXT>

I have noticed Bill Clinton and Pavarotti's memois are super work-focused, Hillary's, Malala's, Adeline's, and Nujood's have great balance of soul and information, and meanwhile Anna Kendrick's memoir was complete self-absorbed shit and made me like her less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno how feminist I consider myself but a boyfriend of mine said I was a feminist just because I would occasionally speak up, so I'd give this question a try.

-Any celebrity who takes off their clothes for a magzine shoot and say it's "liberating" wtf you're giving some guy jerking material because you can't make it on talent alone.

-Blaming the 70 cents on the dollar thing on men. It's not men that's the problem. No one's going to pay you more for working less hours, you can say you have kids at home all you want but there is no reason an EMPLOYER would pay you more for that.

-When I read A Doll's House in high school (or was it college?) it was passed off as a feminist book. Why? Because at the end, the main character abandons her husband and children to ~find herself~. I found it appalling that it's being celebrated when she chose to abandon her children. It wasn't a pro-feminist message at all, a pro-feminist message would be having more inner strength than others, taking responsibility for the people who depend on you, etc.

-Making women seem like the victims for every possible thing imaginable. How the hell is that pro-women? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According to LA Times, the fight went down like a movie scene:

At 8.22 a.m., Molins said, Belgacem grabbed a female soldier who was patrolling the terminal from behind and put his gun to her head. He dragged her backward and ordered her two male colleagues to drop their weapons and raise their hands, telling them, I am here to die for Allah. In any case, there will be deaths.

As the woman, a reservist, fought back, Belgacem dragged her to the ground and tried to wrestle her assault rifle from her. The weapon passed back and forth between them. As he finally wrested the gun from the soldier, she dropped down, allowing her colleagues to shoot him dead

	<TEXT> Yes you can lose upper range by increasing lower range if you push too hard. You can also lose upper range if you strain too much for it. That is why it is so important to get a good teacher. The damage isn't permanent but it could be if you keep doing it.

Also, I remember a previous recording of yours - your technique is all over the place so you really could hurt your voice if you push yourself too hard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got diagnosed with depression myself just a few months ago but I must have an extremely different kind of depression from Plath because I could not relate to the book.

My own depression was brought on by years of childhood physical and emotional abuse. I had strict Asian immigrant parents and little things trigger bad memories for me. I lose my keys? Suddenly I'm a kid again and I lost something small, and my mom is screaming at me and dragging me across the floor.

Anyway, I guess that's why I didn't love the Bell Jar. People say you can really connect with it if you have had depression, but I found myself getting frustrated with the main character. Her problems seem so small compared to mine. Boo-hoo you have lots of options and you don't know which one to go with. I didn't have many options, I was taught that I was supposed to be a prodigy and that average was trash, and had spent years struggling with an extremely low sense of self-worth over the fact that I wasn't the prodigy my parents kept expecting me to be. It just aggravated me how she'd had it so much better than me, and yet she was just being incredibly selfish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Breaking Bad has Walter White constantly fighting Latinos, but the bad guys are very well-rounded (well technically they are all bad guys) so they're not stereotypical less human bad guys. In fact, Gustavo Fring is the most badass cool bad guy there ever was. The show gets criticized for being misogynist much more than racist.

	<TEXT> I have read a lot so I do know what you normally expect from books that normally cater to those target audiences. My first publication (although an indie novella) was very much standard YA - 15-year-old protagonist, teen girl's 1st person voice, coming-of-age love story, etc. 

This second manuscript is harder for me to pinpoint because of the subject matter. It is not action adventure or a love story, it is about a screwed up family so it has a concise, melancholy tone throughout the whole book. Meanwhile, the girl in the story is so sheltered by her parents that she essentially has her coming-of-age in her early twenties instead of her teens, hence why I am leaning YA/New Adult. 

My best friend and my writers group love it and say the length is perfect given the melancholy prose style, my only worry is an agent being immediately turned off by the word count. So far, I have queried about 10 agents and one YA agent has asked for the full, but I am worried that other agents aren't giving it the time of day because of the word count. I have looked over the manuscript and I honestly cannot flesh it out any more without the overall story getting weaker. My worry is that an agent won't give it the time of day based on word count alone, yet at the same time I don't want to do any unnecessary padding. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the audience would be late teens onward. I've submitted it to my critique group and they really got into it even though they were adults, and yet I wrote it keeping in mind that kids would read it too. It's about the long-term effects of a screwed up childhood so the character has to age from childhood to adulthood. At the same time, the character ends up turning her life around so I wanted young readers to draw inspiration from it.

I am thinking of submitting it as YA, to agents who cover both YA and adult fiction. Then if they choose to bump it up to adult fiction that'll work too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when I was 6, I went up to my mom when she was sitting on the toilet. She stood up to flush and I saw there was menstrual blood in the toilet.

I panicked and I asked why there was blood in the toilet, and was it because my dad spanked her too. She thought it was so ridiculous it was funny, so just to troll me she said yes.

I then went to school and told the other kids that my dad hit my mom, and my first grade teacher called my mom for a parent-teacher conference out of concern. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Would you consider this book YA or New Adult (or even just Adult)? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-12 07:59:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the story's about a little girl from a screwed up family whose childhood friend commits suicide. Over the course of the book she goes from 7 to late twenties, although for the bulk of the book she's 9 to 23.

It's first person from her perspective, and the prose is in the style of middle grade fiction. No drugs, no sex.

Text Samples (age 9):

Halfway through the fourth grade, Mrs. Schwaltz gave us a math assignment.

Its going to be a little harder than what you are used to, she warned us, so you can find a partner and work together.

I glanced over at Justin, since he had always been my partner for previous projects. Justin continued to watch the teacher.

Once Mrs. Schwaltz gave the okay, the other students began partnering up. I stayed at my desk, my eyes fixated on the back of Justins head.

Now hell have to talk to me, I thought to myself. I waited.

Instead, Justin turned to the Kevin Vazquez. Hey Kevin, wanna be my partner?

Sure, said Kevin Vazquez.

I felt a slight twang of pain inside.


Second text sample (main character in late twenties):

My aunt sighed. Why cant you just be happy with what you have, Emilia? Why do you have to search for shortcomings?

I wondered why she expected me to turn out any differently.

Just look how far youve come in the past six years, my aunt continued. Look how much you have grown as a person.

I thought about it. I felt guilty.

Why guilty?

I think of Justin. He needed help like I did, only no one was there to help him.

My aunt sighed. Justins suicide opened your mothers eyes. She realize that it was possible for a child to suffer depression and she needed to see things from your perspective. 

A child. The term made me angry. He was twenty-three. How was he a child?

Anyway, the reason I really need to know is because my current word count is fine for YA (58k), a bit low for New Adult, and too low for Adult. It's completely readable for both a teen and an adult. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I think it is possible for too much to go on if there is no sense of progress.

If you have ever seen the show Heroes, it tanked during Season 3 due to the writers' strike. That is when a bunch of non-writers went in and did a bunch of ridiculous stuff to try to keep the story going with no sense of story construction. Suddenly, Sylar (the bad guy) turns good. Oh wait, he's bad again. No, he is getting redeemed by a girlfriend. Oh wait, he kills her and goes full-on bad! The plot had all action, no arc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> German Shepherd attacked my terrier/beagle mix in the park and pinned my dog down by the neck. My dog was screaming, I was screaming, and so I swung a kick at the German Shepherd's head. He let go of my dog to dodge it and I scooped my (still screaming dog) up and carried him a few feet away while the German Shepherd's owner, a girl of about 10/11, restrained her dog.

My dog just screamed repeatedly even after I set him down on all fours, but luckily there was no permanent damage. I think the German Shepherd was just trying to show dominance.
