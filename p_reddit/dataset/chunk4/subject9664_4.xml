	<TEXT> Right, but not every forum is labelled "the breaking bad discussion forum". Don't put spoilers in titles, don't post them in threads that are not about that specific thing, unless you warn people first. If spoiler tags are a hassle, that's a problem with the specific forum or sub that you're talking about. It doesn't mean ignore common curtesy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I agree the method of HOW you avoid spoilers is up for debate. Endless hoops to jump through and tags and rules are frustrating for most people I would think. Those are two different questions, should we respect spoilers and how should we do it. The more hassle free the system is the better I think. It just needs to be one word, it takes 1 second.

As for proving that it's worth it, I mean, what do you want? Obviously I can't prove it I can only reason with you. The excitement that I got from watching breaking bad unspoilt was extremely intense for me and many other people. I enjoyed that show so much and I would have genuinely been very unset if certain plot points had been spoilt. There is a middle ground to be had here. If you put the word *spoilers* on a thread that you start, I won't click on it. If I go in and have it spoilt, then that's on me. However it is reasonable to not expect to see unwarned spoilers on my Facebook feed for example.

Im willing to do what is necessary to avoid spoilers that I care about, but I should not have to have them thrust upon me with no warning at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're acting like it takes hours of your time to protect people against spoilers. It literally only takes one word at the beginning of a post. I really really hate it when people don't respect that people don't want to have things spoilt. I much prefer watching something when I don't know what is going to happen. 

The pleasure that people get from watching a show or film unspoilt far far outweighs the one second it takes to write *spoilers*.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm a very quiet person, but I only find silences awkward when I can tell the other person is uncomfortable with the silence. What I would suggest is when there is a silence in a conversation, make a judgement as to whether the other person seems uncomfortable. If they do, then I think it will probably always be a bit awkward, but if they don't, then there is no reason for you to feel awkward or uncomfortable. If you practise not worrying about filling every silence then they will probably become more comfortable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me personally, I worked a job I didn't care about for a few years, with which I funded my hobbies, my travels, and my social life. I have now just got a full time job doing my hobby (music videography). I realise that many people are not as fortunate as me though, and do not get the opportunity to do the thing they care about for a living. 

Can you give me an example of what you mean when you say that someone should "do what they like to do" instead of working? How would I go and film a band if I couldn't afford a camera. How would I film a band if I couldn't afford food or a train ticket to the venue? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no idea what you mean. So if what I want to do is go to the pub and drink beer, then I should do that? How will I keep my family out of poverty by doing that and how is that sustainable. Also in what way is that a fulfilling life? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you think a man with a family will feel fulfilled while failing at some career that he "loves", while his family live in poverty. What if this man loves his family and what he wants most in life is to see them happy and live to see his children grow up? What if he can't afford rent? What if he wants to take his family on a holiday to a place they've always wanted to go? Is it not possible that a job that he doesn't love will result in a net gain in happiness for himself and his family? He might find that more fulfilling than some job than doing something that doesn't pay, doesn't provide safety, security, a nice place to live. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In theory the directors cut is a version of the film approved by the director which may be closer to their own vision. They're often longer than the theatrical cut, however they're not always better. Also, sometimes it's just a marketing tool. There is a director's cut of Alien, however Ridley Scott has said that the original theatrical cut is the "real" directors cut, and the one he prefers.

Personally I watch the theatrical cut of a film, unless I have it on good authority that a different version is notably superior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kanye is certainly not a technical rapper compared to many, however his music is strongly driven by sounds and ideas, rather than sheer rhyming. My personal favourite song of his is Blame Game, if you want a specific recommendation. His lyrics can be extremely thoughtful and emotive and his production is incredible. It is easily understandable to me why so many do not like Kanye (his personality for one), but talentless is certainly not the word. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imagine conclusions such as "we should raise taxes in this area by X amount", "behaviour X is morally wrong", "we should restrict the use of substance x". Do you not think there could be valid arguments both for and against these claims. Just because I hold a certain position doesn't mean that all arguments against my position are invalid. Perhaps the argument for my position simply outweigh the arguments against my position. Perhaps if I hear more arguments against my position the "against" will start to outweigh the "for" and I will change my mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love the high exposure on this. Two minor things I would say (nitpicking), it looks like the front jar is not flat and is tilting slightly. Also I wouldn't have cut off the bottom of the peel in front of the lemon. Either cut it off slightly higher up so it's more comfortable or cut it off underneath. That is really nitpicking though as this is a critique forum. I love the photo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes but you can't just magic everything better. You can't make prisons better and then just make the rest of life better to make up for it. You might as well say let's give everyone in the world a mansion to live in. It's simply not fair to make prison a more comfortable option than hard working people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're saying that homeless people (people with some of the most difficult lives) commonly commit crimes so that they can improve their life, but you're suggesting that we raise the living standards of prison to such an extent that many many more people would have the option to improve their life by committing a crime. Don't you think that it would be fairer to make the legal options more attractive than the illegal ones?  </TEXT>
