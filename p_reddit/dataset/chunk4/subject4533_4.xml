	<TEXT> It's always interesting going way back to hear your favorite artists past work. I have to say, Shlohmo's discography is some of the best stuff I have ever listened to. Beat Tape '09, 'Fine, Thanks', Shlohmoshun Deluxe, Shlo-Fi, Camping, Bad Vibes, Vacation, Laid Out, No More, and now Dark Red. You can really tell how much he has progressed and moved forward giving it all a listen. 

Even before Shlohmo he went under the name Henry From Outer Space and released an entire album full of the craziest shit that no one can find. I have searched the internet for it and I know its out there but I cannot find it. 

Edit: Keep an eye out Friday onwards for new and limited WeDidIt merch! http://www.kings99.com/category/wedidit </TEXT>

A very very detailed and extensive analysis of our family's history (took months to be processed and confirmed) and also a few interviews.

	<TEXT> Shark films are definitely either a hit or miss when it comes to delivering a solid movie that is both realistic and somewhat scary. The Reef has a lot of intense scenes that made me squirm in my seat while staying in the realistic boundaries of an actual attack. The shark is more of a natural predator rather than a smart and evil beast. 

There were a few problems that were noticeable throughout the movie but I'd say its realistic shark attack scenes made it a great film! Its available on Netflix too.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Shlohmo - Dark Red: First thoughts. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-19 16:24:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all, I am a huge fan of Shlohmo. I will try not to let that get in the way of my first thoughts of his new LP. Yes, it was leaked today and it is out there and very easy to find. I listened to this album in bed, with the lights out, and with my good headphones on.

For those of you expecting something similar to his previous LP, Bad Vibes, prepare to completely shocked. Dark Red is unlike anything I have ever heard before. I am saying that with both positive and negative reasons. A recurring and dominant part of the album is the intricate drum work. The beats on each track are fast paced, loaded with broken, stretched out samples and gritty. Gritty is the word I would use to describe this album. 

Funnily enough, Dark Red strangely reminds me of Arca's Xen. Mainly from the strange synth melodies that are on most of the tracks. The whole album has a VERY unsettling vibe, it almost made me uncomfortable. 

Now, I feel like I should compare Dark Red to Bad Vibes mainly due to the fact that it is Shlomo's only other album and it features some of his most popular tracks that people know of. Firstly, Dark Red did not feel like a 'headphone' album, unlike Bad Vibes. I feel like Dark Red would be most effective when played out loud. Secondly and most importantly, the style and theme of this album is COMPLETELY different to Bad Vibes. 

TL;DR: I really can't describe my experience with this album, it is very unique and you will probably need to listen to it more than once to get the hang of it.

	<TEXT> I went to a sixteenth party and at the end of the night the brother of the host had been sliced in the face with a machete. Yep. A fucking machete. The party was in a slightly dodgy area of where I lived. The party was fine until the parents came out and said to stay out at the backyard because there was a few people trying to force their way in. About ten minutes later a guy came rushing through and screamed GET IN THE FUCKING HOUSE!!! Out of nowhere, I saw bottles being thrown over the roof, smashing everywhere onto the ground. I was one of the last people to get inside and I glanced back and saw about 20 guys with no shirts on sprint through the gates and into the backyard, it was a full on brawl. There was about 60 people in this tiny house. All we could hear was absolute chaos happening outside. The front door opens and the brother of the host stumbles in with his face COVERED in blood! Word had gotten around quickly that he had been slashed multiple times in the face with a machete and the mother had been hit in the back with a table. It was absolute chaos!!! The police arrived later and all of us were questioned. There was a news piece on it which I will link later. 

TL;DR: Went to a party and someone got slashed in the face with a machete. Also had to get plastic surgery.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Very slow Bigpond speeds! Need advice/help. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-04 16:49:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in Perth and I have been experiencing very weird internet speeds recently. I am downstairs and my modem is upstairs (not that far apart) and I could happily get up to around 2mb download speeds. As of the past couple of weeks, it feels like my internet is getting slower and slower. Download speed is currently 0.26mb/s and it absolutely sucks. Could this be my problem? Should I call up Bigpond and ask them to reset my connection from their end? There must be a reason for this! 

I appreciate any help. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DON'T DE-PLETHERISE THE GEL POWERED STATIC TRESPERS! 

I picked up my new System today. It took me days to get running properly with the addition of 4 Static Trespers. I had them connected, 2 into the Sedret De-Esser and the other 2 into the main board. Straight after I did this, an error must have come up somewhere within the main board and it directly de-pletherised the Static Trespers!!! The Trespers unplugged themselves in reaction to the error and began squirting out the Gel that powers them. It went absolutely EVERYWHERE IN MY APARTMENT!! I am so angry and now my Trespers are ruined and my whole System is covered in shitty gel.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> S04E13 - Positives and Negatives </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-28 02:20:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thought I would share what I liked and what I disliked about the finale. Feel free to add to the list!

Positives:
- The massacre scene was very well done. It took our expectations of an ending where all the characters have a happy resolution, which is what most of us were wanting to see, and turned it upside down and completely shocked us. 
- Dandy's character arc was completed and perfected, with the epitome being the massacre. 
- No major characters were left out of some sort of resolution. 

Negatives:
- The massacre scene can be seen as a cheap and easy way of ending the series because of how many subplots there were that needed to be resolved. 
- Most of the episode felt very rushed and left me wanting more. 
- The twins heads. Oh god. This ruined the episode for me at some points because of how easy you could tell which one was fake. Theres even one point where you can see the fake head (during the water tank bit). 
- Jimmy and Desiree seemed to have forgotten about the massacre completely after a few scenes.
- The whole scene where Dandy gets ambushed by the remaining freaks felt very rushed and not even real. I was wondering at some points if this was a dream sequence by the twins. 
- Elsa's visit by the Halloween guy also felt very rushed. When he came previously, he would talk to each character in depth for a certain amount of time. Here, he sort of just walks in and stabs her.

So i go into my players settings to change my regional code, and theres apparently a password I need to put in before I can change it and I have no recollection of making a password in the first place! 

Absolute bullshit. Especially after making the purchase and being ready to watch a movie to be suddenly faced with a stupid and unnecessary problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This question is so hard to answer because you can find them in many different ways. It could be as simple as manipulating a vocal sample from a random sample pack, to the producer actually recording vocals themselves or asking someone for their vocals. 

Best bet would be just to sort through heaps of sample packs to find vocal samples you need. Vengeance have heaps of vocal samples in all their packs.  </TEXT>
