	<TEXT> Has anyone been having issues with mlb.tv recently?

It seems to get worse every single year. Choppy, crappy resolution, buffering takes forever. I've tried in Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge. Same issues. It's unbelievably frustrating. 

**EDIT**: the especially frustrating thing is I can watch it on my mlb.tv app on my iPhone and it streams flawlessly in HD. What the fuck is wrong with mlb.tv's browser support? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Public attention on the Russian investigation over the weekend does nothing to change the course and progress of the investigation itself.

No, but it gives the Trump administration the, "How can you say we're Russian puppets? We bombed a Russian air base in Syria!" defense. 

Which has been blasted all over Twitter for the past 12 hours :-/ </TEXT>

Fifteen years ago I totally agreed. It's a good concept on paper. Any time a dictator can be removed and democracy allowed to take over, that has to be good, right?

Turns out the alternative to dictators (ISIS) is often times much, much worse. The last decade has shaken a lot of my fundamental thoughts about democracy and world politics.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I don't think the new stadium really increased the value of the Marlin's on the market. Yeah, Forbes might say their worth more

I'm not sure I understand. Are you saying the Marlins are worth less than what Forbes estimates?

Because the numbers being thrown around in the news suggest that Loria is selling the team for [**three times** what Forbes said they're worth](https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2017/02/09/miami-marlins-claim-to-have-1-6-billion-handshake-agreement-for-team)

It's a pretty established trend now. When a team gets a new stadium, their valuation skyrockets.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, keep in mind journalists want to get to the *truth*. And part of finding that truth means talking to the accused.

Not to mention, misunderstandings happen. There are scenarios where a newspaper publishes a story and it turns out they're wrong or misinformed, and if they had reached out to the other side they might have discovered as much beforehand. So reaching out to the opposite side to get their comment can cover their ass, too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The people I play with and I have a "gimme range" to speed up the game. Usually 2-3 feet. The unofficial rule is that everyone has to agree to it. "Yeah we'll give it to you," that sort of thing. It's a simple and easy policy.

But we have this one friend who always takes advantage of it. He'll stretch the boundary to 4-6 feet, and take it without asking any of us. And he pulls this shit all the time: the half-ass tap-in while putting his other hand down to "guide" the ball into the hole. And he does the exact same scan-the-green move afterwards to see who noticed. It's the same goddamn look Trump does in that video.

Fuck people like that. I see you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, you seem to be taking this really personally.

All I'm pointing out is that most people are under strict NDAs. I'm under a 10 page NDA for the company I work for. If you think she should have violated that to put that info out, then that's one thing, but let's not act like it's a simple thing here. 

I'm going to disengage now since you seem strangely angry about it all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kelly was a reporter for Fox, not a journalist. I know that may seem like a minor distinction but it's an important one.

Plus, it's not like she was the only person who knew. There are probably dozens who did. I think focusing on Kelly, when she's the only one who *did* eventually call them out on it, is misguided.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  pretty shitty if her to just sit on this info and then put it out in her book when it benefits her.

Well, there were probably NDAs that prevented her from going public with the info while she was still under Fox's employment. 

**EDIT**: to be clear: I'm not necessarily defending her actions or saying there weren't other motivations. </TEXT>
