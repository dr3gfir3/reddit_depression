	<TEXT> If you've seen Logan you would have noticed the Firefly posters during the [attached Deadpool 2 teaser.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I4tFNfROlqk) But that's not what im talking about.  I rewatched the movie tonight and noticed that the main merc with the robot hand has the [Serenity logo](http://i.imgur.com/1nZyCIp.png) on his robot hand.  You only see it for a few seconds when hes working on it.  I tried to get a good picture but none of the streams are very good quality.  I can tell you the logo was added in post because they posted an [early picture](https://www.instagram.com/p/BM4Dyjcj0y7/) and its not there. Im also fairly sure I saw a bluesun T-Shirt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tuesday, I logged into play Borderlands 2 (BC) with my nephew.  We both got in the game and were in a party chat.  When I hit resume he vanished from the list of players.  We were still connected to party chat but I couldn't get him to join the game again.  When I looked into it further he was removed from my friends list and showed as "Offline".  He apparently was on last night and sent me several messages and invites, didn't see anything.  It's been two days, we both have turned our consoles on and off a few times but he still shows as Offline.  Anyone know how to fix this?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was looking at the previews for the shows this morning and realised we get Gorilla City, Mr Myxlplyx, Camelot and The Return of Several Arrow Villains this week. Looking back at all the episodes so far this year, and its kind of mind blowing.  There have been way too many good episodes and far few bad ones this year.  So, which show do you think is the best overall *this year* and why?  
  
For me, I think its Legends of Tomorrow.  Sara Lance is leading the show now, which is awesome.  Nate is damn close to becoming the best character on the show and I'm loving the Heatwave / Vixen thing.  Plus the Legion of Doom is just plain damn awesome. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone remember the old Mace rumore before the season started? [Spoilers] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-17 17:45:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before the season started there was a rumor that the new Director was the original Human Torch.  
   
*The original Human Torch began his existence in 1939 in the laboratory of Professor Phineas T. Horton, one of the pioneers in the field of artificial intelligence and robotics. The culmination of Horton's research was an android who mimicked virtually all of the functions of a human being, including independent thought, but was composed entirely of synthetic materials.*  
  
*The one flaw in the android's design concerned the photoelectric solar cells called Horton Cells which covered every square inch of his body and served as his power source. The cells were too volatile and caused the epidermis of the android to burst into flame upon contact with air but without harming the android itself.*  
  
So here's my theory.  Coulson followed Captain America back in that time, so its possible he'd know about Mace from the same era.  What if the briefcase is another power source, something to bypass the problem with his solar cells?  I also want to point out, this "*secret*" is coming out the same time the show is focusing on robot life, it just seems like there might be a connection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally, the stunt doubles are hidden well enough under the masks and wigs but last night they fought without masks.  If you watch the fight again, Bam Bam used spotlights to drown out the light on the actor's faces.  It's freaking brilliant, and combined with close ups of the actual actors its damn near seamless.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So in the comics, Zoom isn't a speedster.  
  
*Zoom does not actually move at super-speed as most other speedsters do by using theSpeed Force. Instead, he alters time relative to himself. He manipulates the speed at which time flows around him, allowing him to go faster or slower in relative time to everyone around him, making it appear that he is moving "fast"; even most of the Flashes look to him to be moving in slow motion.*  
  
That "Fight" was strange in many ways.  He beat Barry on top of water. The readings on Flash's suit didn't register movement.  Also the running effects with that blue portal tunnel thing.  
  
What if they gave Savitar Zoom's comic ability? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was excited to play this last night.  I come home and the game is a massive letdown.  You have to drastically alter the control settings just to make it drivable.  It's riddled with bugs, I lost several races simply because my car came to a sudden stop mid-drift without coming into contact with anything.  One race an SUV started spinning vertically through the road.  It also constantly bombards you with "BUY THE DLC!" ads.  I saw at least four in my two hours of play time, one of which pretended to be a new game mode. The cop lady told me about it, the mini map comes up to show it in Vegas and I hover over and it says, "PRESS A TO BUY THE DLC!"  Thats when I turned the game off.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's probably nothing wrong with the game.  Bethesda is claiming they are holding back code because the multiplayer won't be available.  Considering they did several beta tests and each one had noticeable performance improvements there is most likely nothing wrong.  But withholding the code could mean that there is a problem and they are banking on people buying the game before word gets out.   </TEXT>
