Yeah, no. I don't have to prove myself worthy of debating you, and were I to respond with the correct answers, you'd probably just claim I didn't know them til you asked. Nice attempt at gatekeeping, though.

That being said, I'm gonna have to peace out of this conversation. You're either trolling or honestly believe what you're saying, and I can't figure out which of those would show you in a worse light. I have to hope that you're a troll, because if you actually think that gay couples are inferior parents, that it's okay to liken those couples to dogs, that being pro-choice makes liberals Nazis, and that forcing a baby to live in pain and discomfort is more humane than allowing it a dignified and peaceful death, then I weep for you. 

Goodbye and have a lovely evening.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Afaik, there are fewer than ten doctors in the US who preform abortion after 20 weeks.  

It's an incredibly dangerous job. When Dr. Tiller was assassinated by right-wing extremists, only three or four late-term abortion doctors were left in the country. Another of the remaining doctors owned a stable and ran a small home business of watching over people's horses while they were away. The stable was burned to the ground by right-wing terrorists, killing several horses and severely burning most of the others. 

After Tiller was killed (*After Tiller* is the name of an excellent documentary on the other doctors and their lives in the few years following the assassination, by the way), the handful of Tiller's colleagues left realized that their lives were in danger and that, if they were killed, women would be unable to find the help they needed. A few new doctors have since worked with and learned from them, and I believe there's an effort to train as many as are willing to do the procedure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Killing innocent human beings for convenience  is a medical procedure!!!

Abortion is, no matter what your opinion on it, literally a medical procedure. 

And it's interesting to me that you say "not being able to feed another child" is "convenience."

It's based on the scoience fact that it's a human being that is being exterminated. You know, the offspring of two human beings that conceived it!

I'm loling so hard at the patronizing tone you exude while misrepresenting (and misspelling) scientific fact. 

A human zygote/embryo/fetus is no more than a mass of cells with *the potential* to become a human life. Women's eggs have this potential, as do men's sperm, yet women are not considered murderers when we menstruate nor are men when they masturbate.  

The vast majority of pregnancies end in miscarriage, which is the female body's way of terminating pregnancy when most chromosomal defects are present in the fetus. However, many serious or fatal fetal defects are not "shut down" in this way, and many of those are undetectable until the third trimester. 

In these cases, the fetus is still *technically* a potential human life, but the quality of the child's life would be hellish  asphyxiation, regular invasive medical intervention, sensory deprivation, and constant pain  and short. Even *with* costly and constant medical attention, the child would never live a moment without pain in the short time it were alive. 

Do you consider that a life worth living? Do you think it's less humane to abort the child before it comes into this world than it is to force it to live a short and horrible life? And what of the parents? Would you prefer to helplessly watch your baby suffer for days or weeks, or give it a peaceful death before it leaves the comfort of its mother's womb? 


 All a child needs is a loving support system.

Like a puppy needs, right?

No one likened people to dogs but you. It's a nice indicator of where your mind is, though. 

Gender is irrelevant.


Because children are stupid animals and cant tell, correct?

No. Because they don't care until they're taught to, as you obviously have been. Bigots are created, not born. 


Duh! On what planet does that even make sense that an abusive house is better than say a single loving mother!!!  WHy do you even bring up such an obvious point!!! 

Because your comments have been wildly anti-LGBT and prejudiced, lol. 


Ask the person that was raised by two women!

So you're going to tell a person that their mothers were inferior because a man isn't involved? Or that a woman is required in order to have great parents? I'm gonna just let you sit and think about that whole line of reasoning. 

     And two mothers never will?? What's your point? You think I'm saying even bad mothers and fathers are good? How old are you??

That's true, since it's not likely they can have an accidental pregnancy! So yeah, the data is going to be skewed to make heterosexual parents that can have kids accidentally look worse!

Yeah. So why are you saying that the group of people who will literally *always* have to plan their families and work to get them are inferior parents?


That's why I go by the science fact that it's A HUMAN BEING! The offspring of TWO HUMAN PARENTS!

Again, that is not a scientific fact. It is a mass of cells with the potential to grow into a human being. A mass of cells which takes several months to develop a conscious mind and even longer to become viable outside of it's mother's body. 

I agree. You want to do what the Nazis did. You want to make human beings non-persons so you can throw them in your ovens. 

Fucking lol. Okay, cool, I guess thinking women should decide what to do with their bodies makes me a Nazi. Never mind that Nazis raped Nordic women and forced them to bear officers' children.

That teaches nurture. Caring for life. 

I thought that was the goal of liberals was to make everyone care and help others suffering?

I am of the mind that the best way to keep a child who will die in pain after days of life from suffering is to end its life before it *can* suffer. And I'm not alone in this. It is the most humane way for both the child and the parents.

That's stupid. Dogs cant raise a child!  How old are you!

Lol. I could ask the same of you, friend. 

Yes, I made a spelling mistake once. let's now use that to kill the unborn!

Entire civilization of strawmen up in that sentence. 

Says the person building abortion clinics to exterminate your mistakes!

Hahaha that doesn't even make sense.

That's the same standard for bringing a dog home.

Yes, keep comparing same-sex parents to dogs. That'll win you the argument.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um. Please look up Margaret Sanger, the founder of PP. She was a eugenecist who wanted to exterminate the black race. So she set up abortion clinics in poor neighborhoods and encouraged the poor (mostly black) moms to kill their preborn infants rather than bring them into this world.

Um. Please provide a source, because Sanger's work in the African American community was done with the likes of W. E. B. Du Bois, cofounder of the NAACP, and was praised by Martin Luther King Jr. Unless literally everything everyone knows about these men is wrong, I don't think they were for the decimation of the black community or eugenics. 

The only reason anyone thinks she was a racist eugenist is because of a letter written by Sanger to another leader of a group providing contraception to poorer black communities which has been misrepresented in conservative media as proof of her supposed racist motives. It's also falsely claimed that birth control was something pushed onto unwitting and unwilling black women, even though a large portion of that demographic had been aware of and wanted access to it even before Sanger began her  minority outreach campaign. 

So, basically, that's a misleading and blatantly false spin on a woman whose legacy in with minorities is nothing but positive. It's been pushed by anti-choice groups as a means of vilifying Planned Parenthood, and it would appear that you swallowed it hook, line, and sinker.

Before you tell others to look something up, you might want to do so yourself. 


Also abortion is not without complications.

http://www.lifenews.com/2006/01/02/nat-1941/

Life News is literally an anti-choice opinion site with extreme bias and has a history of reporting falsehoods. It's not a good source. 


You guys also keep saying that conservatives don't care about children after they are born which is far from the truth, especially for religious ppl. They are more likely to support social programs and charities. 
 

Conservatives in the government don't care at all. They're actively trying to dismantle our social safety nets, and their policies most often hurt the poor and middle class and elevate the ultra-rich even further. By voting for these officials, conservatives appear to be either ignorant or supportive of these policies.   </TEXT>

He's spent his life trying to live as close to Jesus's teachings as he could, and hell hath no fury like my grandpa when someone speaks hypocritically about Jesus.

If you're a MD as you claim, you should know that abortions near "the day of delivery" don't happen unless the mother's life is on the line. And you should also know that "partial birth abortion" is a name coined by Republicans in Congress in order to brand *all* late-term abortions as violent and inhumane procedures, which they aren't.

	<TEXT> That's a different subject that on demand abortion. Which is what this is really about.

It's not a different subject when abortion bans cause women to die because doctors are not allowed to abort and evacuate a late-term pregnancy. 

Then PP should have no problem dropping it in order to get their federal money!

This talking point is ridiculous. Abortion is a medical procedure and PP is a medical provider. In any case, federal funding is not spent on abortion at PP. 

The opposition to abortion is majorly based on religious belief. Religion and government are meant to be entirely divorced from one another in this country. Therefore this argument has no place in politics.

So fathers are irrelevant, eh? I mean, you are proof a father is not necessary, correct?

Wow, the condescension and blatant attempt at trolling. 

All a child needs is a loving support system. Gender is irrelevant. Being raised by two men or two women who give the child unconditional positive regard and stability is better than being raised by a heterosexual couple who neglects their child or can't provide them with a stable life and vice versa. 

No one said fathers are irrelevant but you. 

And two mothers never will?? What's your point? You think I'm saying even bad mothers and fathers are good? How old are you??

With what little data we have on the subject, same-sex parents are much less likely to abuse their kids. This probably has to do with how hard it is for them to *have* children, compared to straight couples who can just *accidentally* end up with ten of them.

That's a good reason for a private citizen to kill another human being?

I don't think arguing the idea of fetus =! person is a valuable use of our time. I just think that you should take into account this difference of opinion when discussing the topic. 


Heath issues or the baby has a fatal illness.

It's eugenics over nurture?

You'd rather a baby be born with zero chance of living anything but a short (meaning days or weeks at most), painful life of impotent and invasive medical intervention and struggle while its parents are forced to watch helplessly? Because that seems more cruel than a painless (for the child) and quick abortion. 

Want to try again?

I think they covered it pretty well, why bother restating it?

For example, liberals understand that science has demonstrated that children raised by same-sex parents are at no disadvantage compared to heterosexual couples.

Dogs also dont need or deserve a mother and father. Are human beings no better than dogs to you?

By drawing this comparison, you've just proved that you yourself consider same-sex parents no better than dogs. 


You forgot to the part where liberals teach that abortion clinics are where you terminate your mistakes.

Have you never made a mistake? Has a preventative measure you've taken never failed? Do you really believe that mistakes and bad luck should have life-shattering consequences, or that people who made mistakes or had bad luck should be forced to take on the awesome responsibility that is raising a child? 

Never mind that not a single liberal I've heard of has encouraged the use of abortion as anything more than a last resort. We tend to focus on teaching sexual responsibility and encouraging contraceptive use. It works much better than shaming teenagers for their natural urges.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A) Liberals cant claim they care more about life while building abortion clinics for the genocide of the poor and undesirable.

I don't think you know what genocide means. Abortion is not something that hurts the poor. Access to abortion and contraceptive services help low-income families financially, whereas abortion/contraception access restrictions make their financial burden even more dire and debilitating. Never mind that the majority of women who have an abortion have children later in life, when they are more able to provide their families with a stable life. 


B) the right has always held that the BEST welfare for children is a ready and married mother and father. Liberals don't teach that high standard.

I'll ignore how dismissive that claim is of same-sex parents (don't worry, I'll make my point on that hideousness elsewhere in the thread) and get to the meat of the issue:

Liberals *definitely* teach that standard. That is why we want to provide people with the option of abortion/contraception in order to plan when and with whom to have children. By defunding PP and restricting abortion access, the GOP forces children to be born into broken, dysfunctional, and destitute homes. 


C) In fact they have abortion clinics because they do  not teach you to wait until you are married and ready. 

In my hometown, all sexual education classes are strictly abstinence-only and do not cover contraception or family planning at all. The teachers responsible for those classes can be fired if they even say the word "condom." 

Incidentally, that city's rate of teen pregnancy and STI transmission is one of the highest in the state, a state which has one of the highest rates in the country. 

Teaching you to keep your dick in your pants or your knees together doesn't work. Literally every peer-reviewed scientific study supports this. And abortion rates are higher in abstinence-only sex ed areas than in areas which teach comprehensive sex ed and safe sex.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think of it: the issues that caused this monstrosity of an election and presidency are focused on and repaired to ensure it can never happen again. 

Education systems are better funded, media literacy and critical thinking are given more focus, and history is given more attention in public schools. Citizens United is overturned, grassroots campaign funding becomes the norm, and the public remains politically engaged. Candidates' tax returns are a legal requirement and divestiture is required of presidents. Gerrymandering is illegalized and districts are drawn impartially. News media are held to a high standard of factual, nonbiased reporting, and "fake news" is struck down and corrected. The electoral college is either restructured or gotten rid of, and every vote is equal. Green energy is expanded and workers retrained. 

What a pretty picture. I hope that's the one that'll come to pass, and not that one where leprosy is common in the population of Americans who survived the nukes and flooding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TrumpCo's rejection of norms is one the most disturbing aspects of his admin.

Abso-tootin'-lutely. They don't give a shit about *obvious* conflicts of interest, much less the appearance of conflicts, as every other WH in my lifetime has. Cheney wasn't even as obviously connected to Halliburton as this administration is to their various puppetmasters, even though we all knew what he was up to. That's disturbing because the possibilities for corruption are unknowable and probably limitless. 


Hubris. The thing about hubris is that it is always fatal. 

Trump is like the protagonist of a Greek tragedy but without any redeemable traits. 


Coverage did not elect him; American stupidity, bigotry and racism did. The GOP ranted non-stop about Obama and anyone capable of reading remained immune to Birtherism, Benghazi and apology tours. The others, which unfortunately is enough to elect someone president, believed it.

I agree that the news coverage is not the sole culprit. Media literacy in this country is shit, the fault for which lies on the shoulders of the Republican legislators who have been gutting public education in the states  and now federally  for decades. The GOP has bred a whole generation of voters willing to swallow news that "feels" right over news that *is* right, and that is the biggest threat to this country since the Cuban Missile Crisis. 

My mom has been a public school teacher since the 90s in Arizona, one of the lowest-ranked school systems in the country by state, so you'll never hear me say that ignorance and poor education  two root causes of bigotry and inequity  are not the worst crises in America right now. The GOP knew what they were doing when they systematically fucked over my entire generation's education. 


Now we have a situation in which western intel cannot rely on the U.S.; Euro militaries must start debating re-arming; China fills the TPP void; all future negotiations with the US must include the possibility of being ignored by the next administration. Mostly, TrumpCo ushers in doubt. Everyone, even our trusted allies, must now question America's word and priorities. 

I agree completely. My quip about Putin was more of an observation than a belief that it was dangerous to the country. This election is the biggest monkey wrench ever thrown into the post-WWII liberal world order, and Putin fucking loves it. Right now, I'm putting my hope into the investigative journalist community to save the world order and the country. If Putin has anything to fear about Trump, it's that Trump's carelessness and impulsiveness will cause the story to blow open, which could lead to war. Our military and our allies outnumber and outgun the Russian military and allies exponentially, and the only way Putin can achieve his goals is by covert means and peace with the US. 


I am way off topic, but I mostly agree with you. I am glad to see r/politics remain a thoughtful place.

No worries  I'm a poli sci and journalism student and can really about this for days.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> if the author is insinuating that his letter is just a cover story so that he can actually cooperate with the investigation (tinfoil hat theory). 

Doubtful. The author, Ali Watkins, has been covering the Russia intrigue for quite awhile and her reporting has been both in-depth and compelling. She doesn't strike me as a tinfoil hatter. [This article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alimwatkins/the-strange-case-of-the-russian-diplomat-who-got-his-head-sm?utm_term=.lgg9AlYko#.fbylk5YgK) and its follow-up describe a possible link between one of the eight Russian officials who've died in the past few months and the election (he died the morning of Nov. 8th) and the frustrating inaccessibility to reliable information regarding it.  

The title seems like an editorial choice for clicks. The article is great and informative, but the title is misleading and has nothing to do with the information whatsoever.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None of it. The whole "scandal" was a nothingburger. 

The reason it had such an effect on the election was how much airtime it was given. Every day, another batch of nonstory emails were the main story on cable news shows, and so the candidates' policy proposals were never mentioned. 

Hillary's policies were her babies. Policy is what she lives for. Her plans were solid and deeply thought out, whereas Trump's were usually random brain misfirings blurted out during unscripted rallies which CNN covered live and in their entirety. 

If this election had been about actual fitness for president and won on merit, Hillary would've won in a landslide. However, this election was a reality show where the most obnoxious, offensive asshole won on a technicality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This likely explains most of it, subject3355. Manafort, Flynn, Page, Tillerson and Trump all had perfectly legitimate contact with Russians and/or Ukranians. Maybe a bit shady, but all defensible. 

I would only consider those ties defensible if the others didn't exist and, once in office, ***everyone*** in the administration divested their assets, released comprehensive public statements on their connections to Russian officials, and accepted constant scrutiny concerning US-Russia relations.

But, once he takes the nomination--and then the WH--why did they not immediately stop all contact? Hustling an ambassador in the backdoor (not proven, but likely); five phone calls on the day of announced sanctions; tweeting praise of Putin's restraint? 

Hubris. I really think that's the answer. Hubris and narcissism and the "magic R" that Bill Maher talked about.


I agree that up to a couple of months into the primary I am certain Trump and Co just wanted a polishing of the brand and the ego, but once they caught the bus, how could they be so stupid as not to cut all suspicious ties? But then again, this is also the administration who nominated anti-candidates as secretaries and complains about lying photographs. 

Trump managed to survive scandal after scandal after scandal because, at the time, the news media was (whether knowingly or unknowingly) helping him win with wall-to-wall emails coverage.  They think they can still distract and misdirect the journals and public, ignorant of the fact that we're not letting this one slide. 


Nonetheless, thank you for the reply. Some slack should be cut for a group of people who had no expectation of actually winning. 

I don't know about that. I mean, even as a campaign, you'd think they'd be more careful, but Trump isn't one for forethought or caution. I bet Putin is kicking himself over this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Everything about Krivov's "heart attack" is sketchy as fuck.](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alimwatkins/the-strange-case-of-the-russian-diplomat-who-got-his-head-sm?utm_term=.lgg9AlYko#.fbylk5YgK)

The man was unconscious and unresponsive, with an unidentified head wound  blunt force trauma, in cop parlance.. . . 

Edit: In a [follow-up article](https://www.buzzfeed.com/alimwatkins/medical-examiner-contradicts-nypd-dead-russian-diplomat-had?utm_term=.nhxBvO4D00#.ctY8MjORkk), the NY medical examiner's office has denied the head around described by the police existed. No explanation has been given for this descrepancy, among about a million others.

**Initial reports said the nameless man had plunged to his death from the roof of the consulate. . .  consular officials quickly changed the narrative. The anonymous man had not fallen dozens of feet from the roof of the consular building, theysaid, but rather had suffered a heart attack in the security office**, and died. . . . 

. . . the New York City medical examiner isnt sure he had a heart attack after all. . . . 

. . . its proven nearly impossible to find out how he died, who he was, and how, if at all, federal authorities were involved in any investigation.

English-language newsreportssaid Krivov, identified then only as a 63-year-old Russian national and Manhattan resident, was a security officer. But a Novemberreportfrom Sputnik, the English-language Russian media outlet, says he was a consular duty commander. . . . 


. . . **it was Krivovs job to make sure US intelligence agencies didnt have ears in the building**. . . . 

The duty commander would also have **had access to . . . the top secret codebreaker used to encrypt and decrypt messages transmitted between the consulate and other Russian channels**.. . .

Despite being described as a Manhattan resident by the NYPD, Krivov is a phantom in public records. **No one with his name, or any iteration of it, has lived in Manhattan for years**. . . 

An NYPD officer looking at the case file told BuzzFeed News no family was listed. . . .

But when BuzzFeed News went to **Krivovs address, listed in the NYPDs files, at 11 E. 90th St., it wasnt a residence. Its a Smithsonian-owned office building . . .  located a block behind the Russian Consulate, which is at 9 E. 91st St**. One of the consulates public entrances is 11 E. 91st St.

Its unclear how thoroughly or for how long the NYPD investigated Krivovs death. Multiple officials declined to offer any details about the investigation. . . . 

 . . . . With all cases like this, it is investigated by the detective squad, he said. **For some reason it was closed out.**

A separate officer said the case was listed as no criminology suspected, natural causes.

The medical examiners office, though, says **their investigation of Krivovs death remains open**. . .

 . . . others who spoke with BuzzFeed News said **this disconnect between the medical examiners office and the NYPD is not normal**. . . .

Its open until you can get a cause of death.there has to be a complete circuit with a case, said Marq Claxton, a former NYPD investigator. . . .

A separate medical examiner official said **Krivovs body had been released the day after his death, but declined to say to whom the body was released**.. . . 

The NYPDdeniedBuzzFeed News request for the incident report, saying the request did not contain enough details, including the date, precinct, and location of Krivovs death, or the incident number. ***BuzzFeed News request in fact included all of that information.***

It stands to reason that . . . much of the hand-wringing over the incident is due to bureaucratic red tape rather than suspicious circumstances. But given the unique circumstances  and a backdrop of plummeting USRussia relations  the lack of information has done little to quell theories. **The more questions that were asked about Krivov, the less people wanted to talk**.

**The State Department also refused to say whether Krivov was registered as a foreign agent, how long he had been in the US, what his immigration status was, and whether they had any contact with the Russian mission regarding his death**.

The FBI said it was not involved in investigating Krivovs death. It declined to comment further and deferred to the NYPD.

Edit: In the aforementioned follow-up, the FBI admitted to involvement in the investigation. Again, no explanation was given for the descrepancy. 

The NYPD did not give BuzzFeed News an official comment on the investigation. 

Its an open secret, US intelligence officials say, that **the consulate is a staging ground for Russian intelligence operations.Its also a coveted target for US agents.** And its importance, officials say, has been underscored as US intelligence agencies try to get their arms around the Russians sweeping operation to manipulate the US election.

Nov. 8 began with his death, and ended with one of the most contentious political upsets in history. After that, Sergei Krivov simply vanished.

This type of shit is not uncommon for Russian officials and Putin critics who are either loose ends or nuisances.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They have to stand up for the poor innocent and underappreciated men.

John Oliver's bit on IWD was great, it's on YouTube if you haven't seen it. Greta Van Sustren (sp?) used her IWD show to say something along the lines of, "we American women are so lucky to have American men, American men are the best men in the world. Let's make sure to appreciate them today."

John Oliver's response: that's the most American response to IWD ever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First time I was screamed sexual obscenities and honked at while walking down the street was when I was 11. **11**. I was a child, and I know this is not an uncommon experience for women. 

And it's happened nearly every week at least twice since then. 

Men get harassed too, but how often do random strangers twice their size scream "lemme fuck that big white ass raw" at them in public? How often do unwanted sexual advances get brushed off as "compliments" by the harasser? Jesus fucking hell.   </TEXT>

I was lucky enough to be born in a family of strong feminist men and women who taught me right away that society is not individuals, and that most people who do perpetuate misogyny and bigotry do not do so consciously. Because of that, I didn't go through that "radicalization" period, but I've seen many of my friends do so. 

As with anything, young, new feminists are often not mature enough to separate the person from the group, and it's something that takes time, experience, and education to learn. In all I've learned through study and life, I've come to the conclusion that a) I am blessed to have multiple examples of pragmatic feminists in my family and b) education is the cure to all that ails every society. The more I learned, the more empathetic and humbled by just how much I will *never* know I became. 

Third wave feminism is a group of people who need to learn more about life and philosophy, nothing more than that. Just because they're easy to see on the internet does not mean they're the majority. In fact, the more a person screams about a cause, the less they usually know about it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand and I agree to an extent, but considering how often I've seen thoughtful, fact-based discussions of female genital mutilation get bombarded with "but male circumcision is worse somehow!" makes it a pretty sore subject for a lot of us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Judging a movement by its college representation is usually not the best way to form an accurate opinion on said movement. In college, people are still young and naive. They're just learning about these issues, and they tend to be less rational in their discussion and action. 

If you want a good example of modern American feminism, look to our incomparable Michelle Obama. She's the epitome of a strong, smart woman whose actions actually outshine her (incredible) words.

Or Hillary Clinton. She's been smeared to shit by the right, but if you watch "The Choice 2016" on YouTube or just look into her life's work, she is an incredible woman and an incredible person.

When it comes to American feminism, the loud but tiny minority of "kill all men" types give the silently incredible feminists doing good works a bad rap. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only downvoted you for your edit. In this subreddit it's necessary to mention that you aren't minimizing the suffering of women when talking about the issues men face, and it's always important to mention that, while having a hard time in society knows no gender, men have a much easier time than do women by sheer number of inequities. 

As always, I acknowledge that men and boys face serious issues and pressures from society which need to be addressed. In fact, many/most of the problems *women* face would be lessened alongside those of men. But when discussing women's issues, bringing up men's issues is rarely received well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That didn't answer my question. 

Do you truly not believe that Trump's rhetoric has enflamed racist attacks on minorities? Do you deny that the Trump administration took white supremacists off of the list of hate group subtypes? Has he even acknowledged a single attack done by these groups in his name on his own volition? 

Brushing my take on this phenomenon aside and claiming I won't listen to reason does nothing but discourage conversation and belittle me. It's not much of a defense for you and makes it seem as though you can't come up with a substantive response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good on you. My dad banned me from dating servicemen when I was younger because a sad amount of them aren't like you or him. 

One of my favorite memories with my dad was when we were out to dinner at chili's and a group of drunken marines sat by us. I was maybe 8 at the time, and the marines were cursing and talking loudly and inappropriately about a woman who worked on base. My dad walked over to their table and told them their behavior was unbecoming, that there were children listening to them, then asked for the name of their CO. He had been out of the marines just a year or so and worked as a civilian contractor for one of the proving grounds, so he was on a first name basis with most of the local officers. He told them that if he had to come over again, he would drop a line to their superiors and they'd be made an example of. 

I respect those who serve, but only when they deserve that respect. My dad taught me how to determine who does by example.  </TEXT>
