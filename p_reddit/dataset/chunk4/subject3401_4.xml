	<TEXT> It's a little more tricky than just running independent. Many states have deadlines to get on the ballot that have already passed, such as Texas. Other states have 'sore loser' rules which basically means if you finish second in a race you can't be on the ballot.

It should be much easier than it is. Perhaps in time. </TEXT>
