	<TEXT> As a norwegian, the picture from Norway seemed crazy at first. But then I thought about it. And, it is not that outlandish really. Fuck it is crazy to think that we use 550$-700$ a week on food.

But yeah, taxes.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pretend to be bad at lying when I don't really need to lie.
So when I actually do lie, people think I say the truth.

Not proud, but a good trick I have learned over the years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right!

I really do not understand this. Maybe chiropractors in the US are different than them in Norway, cause I have never heard about this bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dont understand all the hate against chiropractors. I used to ride dirt bike/MX, and I had a huge crash once. My back got fucked, my spine was all fucked up and my shoulder kept on falling out of its position.
I went to a chiropractor, and he helped me ALOT. What is all this talk about them being bullshit? Cause I can right now look in the mirror and see that my back is good again.

I also went to a physical therapist, and he said I should keep going to the chiropractor. 
(The physical therapist was fixing my shoulder, and the chiropractor was fixing my back). </TEXT>
