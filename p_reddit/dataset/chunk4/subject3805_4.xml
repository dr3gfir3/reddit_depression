	<TEXT> Haha! I used a Woobat on my first playthrough and became too attached! I realized that he wasn't exactly the best member of my team.

But recently I've been wanting to do a theme playthrough where I use very basic/weak Pokemon for the entire game- Pidgey, Zubat, Weedle, etc...not sure which version I'm going to play, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never played, but if someone enjoys Farmville, then they play video games in my opinion. It might not be considered "hardcore", but it is a video game and requires an amount of time, patience, and skill. It is also fun, or so I've heard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I come to here to read stories that fall under a broad range of horror, and write stories that fall under a broad range of horror. I'm sure what I write pisses some people off because it isn't technically "believable horror". But to lay down the law, as if horror can be dictated in a certain, specific way, is uncalled for. I understand your concern and I'm sorry if I'm being rude, but to limit so severely is trouble. </TEXT>

And the Japanese/Latin thing? I could be very uneducated...or I could be making a joke about the fact that they sound nothing alike! The world will never know... </TEXT>
