	<TEXT> This may seem like a stupid question but the reason I'm asking is because I recommended a cool shirt design that got approved by upper management. The only problem with it was that it wasn't professional enough. When I came up with the idea I thought of something trendy that not just employees were forced to wear, but also something that customers might want to purchase for themselves (kind of like Torchy's Tacos). Everyone that has seen it says that they would wear it, but now I won't be put through because it's unprofessional (in other words doesn't have a collar and is made with Cotten instead of polyester). </TEXT>
