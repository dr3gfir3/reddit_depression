	<TEXT> The hospital Ive called my home for the last 30 years can only be described as an asylum. While the word has fallen out of favor, the situation inside has remained consistent. Days stretch in interminable swaths of gray and white; gray from the medication in the mornings, white from the medication in the afternoons. Only the blackness of night frees me from the consuming palate of mid-winter rain clouds used to paint my days away.

I am here by my own volition. The fact I used the law to enact that volition is a mere technicality. The fact I stole the volition of someone else to gain use of the law is another. At the end of the bloodbath - at the end of the steaming orgy of crimson and savagery - Id gotten my wish. Id never need to harm another living thing for the rest of my life.  

The sights and sounds which etched themselves into my soul on that May morning in 1986 still flash through. Between timed doses, gray melts into red. Red bleeds into white. To any other man, those flashes would be the proof of his madness; the seeping of illness into medicated docility. But I know far more than any other man. 

On May 3rd, 1986, I awoke to find my young son in the room with me. We stared at one another for a moment. Then I rolled out of bed and went to the garage. By lunchtime, I had chopped him into 400 pieces. On May 4th, the front page of the newspaper featured a picture of his blonde hair stuck to the blade of my axe. 

To those who read the story or saw the news, I was labeled a monster. To those who served the courts and reviewed the evidence, I was labeled insane. To me, however, the person who conversed with the pieces as they were liberated from my son, I was not a monster. I was not insane. I was a man who needed knowledge. My boy held the secrets to it all. 

I discussed what lay beyond our universe with Aarons left foot. The foot laughed. It was Aarons small voice. It told me to ask the shin. More blows of the axe brought the shin into our discussion. But it could tell me very little; only that the knee had much more information. 

And so it went. 

The leftmost quadrant of Aarons lower mandible informed me I was close, and his upper-right incisor screamed with delirious laughter while it spoke of the secrets Id learn from the uvula and tonsils. When the axe would no longer suffice - its blunt brutality too clumsy to properly extricate the tiny pieces with whom I needed to converse - my pocket knife and its keen precision continued the work. Three hours later, with 400 pieces of child organized around me by order of their knowledge, we began our formal chat. And I learned everything.

I write this today as a prisoner. As a patient. As a father. In this unmedicated interstice between gray and white, I can reflect on the red. Not the red of blood, but the red of It All: the rich, vermillion expanse of flesh and organs on which this universe is a scab. 

On the last night of his life, an emissary from It All visited Aaron as he slept. It whispered its secrets into every part of him, and my son, who was the most caring, generous person Id ever met, knew he had to share it with me. So he waited, patiently, for me to wake.

On the morning of May 3rd, 1986, I lifted my sleep mask to see Aaron floating above my bed, watching me. Bright sunlight streamed across us. The dancing reflection of light against the shiny crimson of his sclera dazzled me. Enthralled me. He opened his mouth, but remained silent. He tried again, but it was no use; It All was inside him. His mouth contained no cavity - only solid red streaked with veins. He brought his pinky finger to my ear and placed it inside, and the fingertip told me what I needed to do. Four hours later, Id brought It All out of Aaron and into my mind. And now into yours.

Daily fogs of grays and whites desaturate what Ive seen, but they cannot hide the presence of what I know is there. I am not insane. The red which courses through the arterial network of multiversal organs and flesh is beyond sanity. Beyond mind. But not beyond body. At the end of my life, whenever that is, I know Ill get to touch Aaron again. 

Even now, through It All, I feel him pressing against the walls, reaching for me, and speaking to me; each part of him singing choruses of thanks and praise. Its the praise which gives me the most comfort as I sit, day after day, year after year, and wait. I wait knowing I am loved and appreciated. Thats more than enough. Its the dream of every father to give It All to his son.

	<TITLE> The Perils of Live TV </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-26 19:52:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One of the biggest misconceptions about live television is that its actually live. Let me tell you a secret: nothing is live. Everything has a built-in delay, just in case something unexpected happens. Its not so much out of concern for the viewers, but for the advertisers. The last thing Pampers wants to deal with is some British actor saying cunt on a talk show or an NFL quarterback getting paralyzed after a big hit. Its bad for the brand.

I work for the Food Network. Over the last ten years, weve moved from basic cooking instruction to a more reality TV style; lots of competitions, celebrity cameos, that whole thing. Lots of people didnt like the change, but we got a big uptick in the younger demographics as a result. 

One of the problems with capturing a younger demographic is holding onto them as they transition into an older one. Lets say, for example, when we started with the reality TV shows, we got a viewer named Jenny. Jenny was 22 when she first saw Ace of Cakes and became a regular viewer of the network since then. She was fresh out of college, had few responsibilities, and was enjoying being a kid. 

Fast-forward nine years. Jennys 31 and a stay-at-home mom. Her priorities are far different than they were when she was 22. She has two children, and, on weekdays, she babysits her brothers twins as well. Instead of eating out all the time like she did at 22, Jennys responsible for feeding a household. She doesnt have time for reality shows anymore and she wishes her cable company offered the Cooking Channel - the sister station to the Food Network that offers more how-to programming. 

There are hundreds of thousands of Jennys across the country - first generation captures from the reality-TV era who yearn for more instructional programming. But its a balancing act. If the Food Network goes back to their original format, they lose the potential for new, younger viewers. If they stay with primarily reality-based programming, they lose all the Jennys out there. 

Our goal, and by our, I mean: me and my team at the network, was to create a show to bridge that gap. After the success of The Kitchen, a Saturday morning program featuring four of the networks biggest stars as they cook exciting recipes and give tips and techniques, we were tasked to make something for the weekday morning viewers.

We ended up creating a show that featured two of the networks top chefs, a live studio audience, and Q A from online viewers. It was going to be as interactive a show as wed ever made, and the twist was, it would be live. Now, remember what I said about live TV. Sure, the audience would be there watching the chefs cook and asking them questions while they did, but the online questions would be from emails. The delay would be 30 minutes.

It was a huge success in the various test markets. We had one show to go with the stand-in chefs before the show went national, this time in Oklahoma, but there was a problem. There had been a tornado warning in the county. It had since expired, but the audience was about half of what it shouldve been. We decided to go with it anyway, since we figured a lot of the at-home audience would still be inside after the storms. Theyd be watching.

Right away, there were technical issues. Even though the tornado warning had passed, there were still frequent lightning strikes and other atmospheric disturbances all around the station. Things still went on, however, and the chefs started cooking. 

The first problem came when the cream wouldnt whip. The chef made a show out of it, poking fun at the behind-the-scenes staff and trying it again with a new container of cream. Again, nothing. In my ear, one of the producers said it might have been because of the storm. He didnt sound like he knew what he was talking about.

The chefs gave up on the whipped cream and decided to make a creme anglaise. Those require eggs. Two eggs were cracked into the mixing bowl without incident. The third, though, was bad. It was blood-red, clumpy, and smelled terrible. The odor permeated the studio quickly and I saw the audience members holding their noses. When I held my own, my fingers came back bloody. I hadnt had a nosebleed since I was a kid. We cut to a commercial.

Neither chef was happy. They agreed to scrap the whole dessert first idea and just go directly to the entree. No one would complain about the basic steak-and-potatoes main course, especially in cow country. The kitchen was reset and the show resumed.

The downward spiral continued. As thunder boomed outside, loud enough to be picked up by studio microphones, the mixer for the potatoes started to smoke and emit sparks before the chef yanked the plug out of the wall and threw the whole thing in the sink. Just goes to show you guys, disasters can happen in any kitchen, he joked to the audience, still obviously irritated but trying to play it cool.

Potatoes got mixed and mashed by hand and the chefs fielded questions about whether or not milk or cream should be used. There was another thunderclap and the studio lights flickered. Ive always hated working in these satellite studios - compared to the main studios in New York, these were like living in the dark ages.

The lights stayed on, thankfully, and the half-hour delay caught up to the beginning of the show. All over Oklahoma, people watching the Food Network were about to see the show for the first time. 

Problems aside, the potatoes came out great. During a commercial, I had an intern get me a spoonful. I shouldve had him get me a bowl. Didnt matter - after the broadcast, Id be able to eat all I wanted. 

The studio audience, to their credit, had taken all the technical problems in stride. I hoped the TV audience would do the same, and figured they would, as long as they didnt turn the TV off in disgust at the sight of that egg.

The chefs moved on to the steak. Each discussed their favorite techniques; one preferring a sous-vide style followed by a blast in a hot pan, while the other advocated grilling it over hardwood charcoal. Both methods would be used and the lucky studio audience would get samples to taste and choose their favorite cooking method.

The cast-iron pan was hot and the grill, despite the powerful fans sucking away the smoke, filled the studio with the savory aroma of burning hardwood. I was starving. 

Chef Bob cooked his steak first, then showed the audience the perfect edge-to-edge pinkness that only a sous-vide cooked steak can achieve. The crust on the outside was magnificent. Maillard would have been proud. Wind battered the studio walls and more thunder rolled by. The power went out.

Everyone in the studio groaned, but not as loud as the executive producer. We were in a time slot. Even with the delay, which we could shorten if we had to, there was a hard out a the top of the hour when Chopped! was scheduled to air. The last thing we wanted was to have the show just cut off entirely. If the power didnt come back on before the delay was used up, itd look awful. Plus, wed have to issue refunds to the local advertisers whod purchased that time.

We waited. And waited. And waited. We had less than a minute of delay left before the power went back on. The whole team was galvanized into action and, with only one second of delay left, we resumed filming. 

For the first time in about 20 years, the broadcast was fully live. I thanked God we werent in front of a national audience, because if someone screwed up and said a bad word, the FCC fines wed have to deal with would be crippling.

More thunder rumbled outside as the chef talked about how sous-vide was a nice novelty, but almost everyone, in reality, preferred a grilled steak. He seasoned as he talked, obviously comfortable with the cameras and the audience who hung on every word. The grill, which had to be refilled with more charcoal to bring it back up to temperature after the delay, was screaming hot again. The chef used his laser thermometer to take the temperature of the coals. 733 degrees. Perfect for the initial sear.

Another clap of thunder and the lights flickered again. I felt my stomach leap with panic, but the lights stayed on. We only had 11 minutes left before Chopped! came on.

With the seasoning complete and the audience dying to see the steak get cooked, the chef picked up the rib eye with his tongs and carefully placed it on the searing grill.

The other chef began to scream. Everyone, including the production crew, jumped. With expertise honed by years in television, the camera operators instinctively turned the cameras toward the screaming man. 31 studio audience members and 14,000 households across Oklahoma watched as the chefs skin blistered and charred. 

What the fuck is going on?, the executive producer shouted, his voice clearly audible over the screams of pain and panic. Before the cameras could pan away, the chefs eyes burst in an explosion of boiling lachrymal fluid and blood. The skin on his nose, forehead, and cheeks bubbled and blackened.

As EMTs rushed toward the man, one of them knocked over a carton of eggs and sent the contents splattering across the floor. Behind me, with a sound I will never forget for as long as I live, Dave, the sound engineer, crumpled to the floor with his body in knots of hideously broken bones; his skull caved in and leaking brain matter onto my shoes.

The loudest thunderclap yet drowned out even the panicked shouting and screams of pain. And that was it. When all was said and done - whatever it was that had been said and done - Dave was dead. The chef was dead. The cameras had never stopped rolling. Not until Chopped! came on.

The Food Network settled lawsuits for the better part of a year. Needless to say, our show wasnt picked up. No one could ever figure out what had happened, but the funerals I attended and the trauma endured by the audiences, both studio and remote, are proof enough that I didnt imagine it. If you know anyone in Oklahoma who was watching the Food Network on April 11th, 2015 between 10 and 11am, ask them what they saw. Theyll tell you. Ill bet they havent watched a single live broadcast of anything ever since.

And yes, the network got an FCC fine from the producer saying fuck on air. They were okay with the burning skin, for some reason.

	<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/53ts1s/a_glimpse_is_never_enough_part_1/?st=iteoi71p sh=0e9bd75c)

I sat with Dr. Johannsen in his office and listened, skeptical yet spellbound, as he discussed the history of his project. My skepticism grew with each fantastic claim, but despite my misgivings, I couldnt deny what Id seen that afternoon. I kept my mouth shut and my mind open as I absorbed what he wanted to tell me.

In early 1998, a private Chinese technology company discovered a novel method of instantaneously transmitting data across short distances. Within a few months, they had refined their technique and increased the transmission distance from a few inches to a few miles. On December 2nd, 1998, during their first test of a high-powered version designed to transmit from their main lab in Changsha to their production facility in Mexico City, the facility on the receiving end began to receive more data than had been put in. 

Dr. Johannsen got up and went to his whiteboard to give me an example.

The first transmission using the new, high-powered equipment, was 0. The Mexican facility reported back theyd indeed received 0. The next attempt was larger: 00. The facility in Mexico reported theyd received 00. Next was 000. Same consistent result. 

The fourth transmission was 001.

After a moment, the Mexican facility reported theyd received 001, 010, 100. 

Another attempt with 001 was transmitted, and the same 001, 010, and 100 was received. Concerned there might be a problem stemming from the increase in signal power and distance, the main lab in China tried again with a different, simpler signal: 10. Without delay, the other facility reported back: 10, 01.

Technicians checked and rechecked the connections, programming, and whatever else they could think of to determine what could be causing the problem. Their efforts yielded nothing. Only when the transmission power was scaled back to within a range of tens of miles, rather than hundreds or thousands, would the issue disappear.

This was a difficult setback for the researchers. Scaling up the number of bits sent wasnt difficult. It was clear the receiving end would get it. The problem was, the larger number of bits that were sent, the number of received permutations exploded. It only took a few transmitted kilobits for the entire receiving system to crash as it attempted to instantaneously spit out colossal matrices of combinations.

On March 16th of 1999, despite no progress, the founder of the company was called upon to meet with Party officials. By March 17th, the entire company was owned by the Communist Party of China.

As Dr. Johannsen spoke, I was a bit confused by his claim that the receivers were getting all possible permutations of the signals. I asked something like, but if theyre getting all the binary states of the signal, wouldnt it be 00, 01, 10, 11? Dr. Johannsen smiled.

You found that strange too? So did they. And, eventually, so did I. It took years before anyone knew why some permutations were missing.

He went on.

Unbeknownst to nearly everyone, aside from spy agencies in countries with the capability of learning such a thing, China had leapfrogged the rest of the world in high-energy physics research. 

Unable to clandestinely build a particle accelerator like the LHC, Chinese scientists sought to achieve the same effect using a highly-speculative, albeit promising, theory: wormhole acceleration. Rather than running particles around a ring until they reached a desired speed, the idea was to create infinitesimal, short wormholes, just wide enough for a stream of particles, and send them through. Particles entering through wormhole A0-A1 would exit into wormhole B0-B1, and then reemerge through A0-A1, gaining velocity with each traversal. Impact and annihilation would come from particles pushed through wormholes C0-C1 and D0-D1 set to intersect with A0-A1 and B0-B1 at a particular time.

There was a problem, though. The wormhole construction worked, despite the fact they could only stay open for a fraction of a second before evaporating. It didnt matter, though; new ones could be opened as quickly as the others were destroyed. That wasnt the issue. What concerned researchers, especially those familiar with the company commandeered by the Party in 1999, was that if a single particle entered a wormhole A0-A1, far more than one particle would come out of wormhole B0-B1.

That discovery was in 2003. The subsequent years were spent poring over experimental data, tweaking parameters and energy levels and system states, and devising entirely new models to help understand how these phenomena were occurring. The connection between the instantaneous communication device and the wormhole particle accelerator was too substantial to ignore. Theories about transdimensional space, despite being profoundly speculative, ran rampant. The only one that held up under the weight of experimental rigor was bizarre, yet elegant: a router.

Dr. Johannsen paused here, as if trying to figure out what part he wanted to discuss next. I was moderately disoriented and doing my best to understand everything he was telling me, but despite my excellent imagination and general willingness to set aside my presumptions and biases, I had a hard time keeping my skepticism to myself.

Before he could continue, I blurted out, what the hell is Black God and what does it have to do with anything youre telling me?

The doctor sat back in his chair and crossed his leg over his knee. His expression didnt change.

Do you want me to continue with the history of this facility of which youre now an employee?, he asked. Or do you want to know, without proper context, what Black God is.

Black God, I replied. For the second time that day, without knowing it, Id reached another point of no return. The doctor began.

Following a few breakthroughs, more understanding about material properties for the construction of what would be later called the bulk negator was needed. Dr. Johannsen was brought into the project as a materials scientist in 2005. His expertise in exotic allotropes and their conductive properties quickly brought new life into the stale research, and after a few years, the design was complete. Construction began in 2008.

What is the bulk negator?, I interrupted.

Its exactly what it sounds like, replied the doctor. It literally negates the bulk - the higher-dimensional space - in which our physical dimension exists. It all dissolves into a single field; a wormhole mouth filled with wormhole mouths filled with wormhole mouths. Each mouth terminates at a specific point within one of the potentially-infinite universes.

Okay, but what do you do with it?, I asked, feeling mild irritation starting to grow at the volumes of technical data being talked at me with no discernable, overarching purpose.

Dr. Johannsen smiled. We pray to it.

The first stream of communication entered the bulk negator on August 29th, 2014. The reason for this was simple: if a message could be broadcasted to all the possible universes, it should be received by instruments in those universes that were standing by to receive it. And when dealing with infinite possibilities, the likelihood of one of those universes sending something back was pretty damn good. 

The message 01 was sent, and, predictably, 01 and 10 came back. Two universes had contributed their own permutation. Testing continued, and thanks to advances in computing technology, more complex messages could be sent and received, with all the difficult permutations being handled effortlessly by a 512 qubit quantum annealer, which analyzed and filtered what it received. Any permutations that didnt match known patterns were discarded.

On September 17th, 2014, as part of a test of the annealers filtering algorithm, an expatriate British scientist sent a plaintext message into the bulk negator. It read: 
1234567890 ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ !@#$%^ *()-_=+[{]}\|:;,.?/

After an instant of processing, the screen on the annealer printed out:

SEE ME THROUGH YOU TO TOUCH WHAT YOU SEE THROUGH TOUCHING ME

It was an odd pattern to receive. When an analyst checked the headers of the discarded patterns, she was surprised to see there were none. This was the only pattern detected by the data flow from the bulk negators output.

A minute later, the annealer printed out another message. It was unprompted.

FEED ME THROUGH YOU TO TASTE WHAT YOU FEED THROUGH TASTING ME

Immediately following it, more came:

HEAL ME THROUGH YOUR FATES THAT YOU SEAL BY HEALING ME

KNEEL HE KNEW YOU WAIT JUST TO KNEEL ON BLEEDING KNEES

BLEED WE SMILE AND WE SEE BLEEDING SMILES ON NEWER SEEDS

ONE BLACK BLACK ONE

WE FEED YOU

The annealer stopped printing, but blue plasma was licking at the bulk negators bulbous housing. Theyd seen shimmering around the machine before, but never anything like that. Before the lead scientist could throw the off switch, the plasma condensed into a single bolt, striking the floor below. The main power cut out.

In the dim emergency light, the scientists in Dr. Johannsens lab could see movement and hear commotion on the floor below. There were shouts of confusion and fear and muted moans of disgust. As power from the backup generators began to cycle up and lights started to turn on in order of priority, a scene of surreal carnage emerged.

Three technicians whod been directly below the bulk negator were dead. Their eyes were bulging obscenely and gray matter trickled from their ears and noses. The subsequent autopsies discovered something that should have been impossible. Their skulls had been stuffed with excess brain tissue. Analysis determined it was not random brain tissue, but the same tissue as their own. Genetically, it was no different. The facilitys medical examiner concluded, in her words, that the skulls had been filled with double, and in one case triple, the normal density of brain matter. Death was instantaneous. Causal element unknown.

I stared at Dr. Johannsen with my eyebrows raised and a look of disgust on my face. What did you do?, I inquired.

Well, the next day, we reactivated the system. Everyone wanted to try a different message, just to see what would happen. We were afraid, but also excited. Whatever it was wed encountered, we couldnt explain it. We needed to know more. One of the dead technicians was related to the project manager, so he was gone and dealing with that whole thing. That meant I was in charge. And I wanted to try to open a dialog.

Did it work?, I asked, leaning forward in my chair.

Oh yes, the doctor replied, grinning.

What did you say?

I told it we appreciated the meal.

**Will be continued.**

	<TEXT> The road to technological advancement is paved with corpses. It is an uncomfortable, but unavoidable, truth. As humankind continues to reach for the stars which birthed us, every desperate stretch forces us to endure, and subsequently manage, loss. Loss of lives. Loss of livelihoods. But never loss of purpose. Purpose is what impels us to keep reaching, dreaming about the one day we will be lucky enough to burn our hands. As the bodies pile underneath us, weve learned to use them to climb and reach ever higher. Those sacrifices, we tell ourselves, are essential. Now, as a result, at the inflection of science and technology and philosophy, we celebrate, rather than shield our eyes from this fact: the cutting edge must always drip with blood.

My professor and mentor, Dr. Arthur Johannsen, lapped the drops from the blade.

Dr. Johannsen was an expert materials scientist, but also well versed in biology, physics, and philosophy. A self-labeled transhumanist, Dr. Johannsen believed, with every fiber of his being, the combined efforts of scientists around the world would eventually allow humankind to conquer physical death. As he grew older, however, and death still loomed like the titanic waterfalls at the edges of a flat Earth, Dr. Johannsen realized he must take the reins and guide scientific progress toward the goal he believed was most important. 

When I met Dr. Johannsen, I was studying at a major scientific and industrial university in China. The university was one of the few chosen by China to be at the forefront of the countrys effort to lead the world in technological advancement, for reasons of both national prestige and military strategy. Rumors of subterranean research labs and labyrinthine tunnel systems circulated throughout the student body and even some professors, despite being told not to give credence to such talk, would sometimes hint about a city hidden far below our feet.

It didnt take long for me to learn the truth behind the rumors. Dr. Johannsen, long-sought by the Chinese to oversee their national scientific projects, had begun his stint in the country a few months earlier. He taught one course, Advanced Materials and Applications, and I was lucky enough to be one of the few students accepted into it. At this point, Id only heard of the doctor by his academic and industry reputation. I knew next to nothing about his personality; only that he was ambitious and driven.

The course was spectacular, and, to my surprise, I excelled. Something about Dr. Johannsens instruction style meshed with my learning style and frequently I would discuss topics with him while the rest of the class sat in an uncomprehending stupor.

Months later, following the course examination, my expectations for high marks were firmly entrenched in my mind. When my final paper was returned to me, however, it was ungraded. The only thing that indicated it had even been read was a single, handwritten bit of information on the last page: a date, a time, and an address.

At 10pm on February 9th, 2016, I entered Dr. Arthur Johannsens home.

The doctor lived alone in a small, well-furnished apartment on the edge of the sprawling campus. He sat me down after a hasty greeting and began to talk. And talk. And talk.

Dr. Johannsen lectured without stopping for over an hour. He expounded on human life extension, substrate-independent cognition, and the failure of the scientific community to dedicate time and money toward the management of senescence and the ultimate elimination of physical death. He spoke with great enthusiasm about Chinese culture and his admiration of how they recognize the importance of progress at any price. 

As he pontificated, I wondered why he was telling me all of this. Part of me hoped hed ask me to help him author something for a science journal or even invite me to be his assistant for an upcoming course. When he offered me an actual job, though, I could hardly contain my glee.

I made a show of considering the offer for a moment or two. I asked him what my responsibilities would be and whether I would be allowed enough time to focus on my studies. Dr. Johannsen informed me Id be his research assistant and would be responsible for helping him with his experiments. He didnt go into detail, but he said I would have more than enough time to study in the evenings and my work would be fairly compensated.

After another minute, I accepted his offer. He produced a briefcase, opened it, and handed me a document to sign. It was a government-issued non-disclosure form. The words treason and penalty of death were mentioned more than once. I signed. The doctor thanked me and told me to come back in eight hours. I thanked him, said goodnight, and left.

The next morning, I arrived at Dr. Johannsens home to find him sitting on the steps outside. He gestured for me to sit beside him, so I did. 

Just give them another few minutes, he told me. Theyre always a little late.

Sure enough, five minutes later, a car pulled up to the curb. 

Time for our commute, he said, and we got in. The driver pulled away.

We exited the campus via a small access road. It wound around the wooded area around the campus toward the large hill or small mountain which the university abutted. Both sides of the road had thick shrubbery blocking our view out and anyone elses view in. I had a feeling Id be learning the accuracy of those rumors soon.

The road curved left and we started down a decline. The sunlight disappeared and was replaced by something artificial and fluorescent. The shrubbery gave way to solid rock. We were inside the mountain and going ever deeper.

Ten minutes later, we arrived in a cavernous parking facility that was fed by roads coming from multiple bore holes in the rock walls. 

There are entrances all around the city, all underground, Dr. Johannsen informed me. On a busy day, there may be 10,000 people in the facility.

I was amazed, but I kept a straight face. I didnt want to come across as too eager or too easy to please. My expression remained locked in what I hoped was one of scientific curiosity and emotional dispassion.

We exited the vehicle and walked into the entrance of the facility. I was struck by the modernity and clean sterility of the place. Id always considered the science buildings at the university to be cutting edge, but this place seemed even more advanced. At the time, I couldnt put my finger on why.

Dr. Johannsen told me hed give me a tour later, but first, we were to go to his main lab.

I want you to get an idea of the type of things youll be working with, I was informed. 

The words carried an element of foreboding portent I found difficult to shake. Dr. Johannsen and I walked up a narrow staircase built into the rock walls until we reached an elevator. We stepped inside and headed down. 

After a three minute descent, we reached the level housing the doctors main lab. The elevator door opened to an expansive, pristine hallway, brightly lit and festooned with colorful plants. It was quite unlike the dank, video-game inspired representation of a subterranean lab Id anticipated. 

Glass-walled rooms lined the corridor and, behind them, scientists of all sorts worked with obvious diligence on whatever tasks they had. The few people who passed us in the hallway smiled at Dr. Johannsen as we walked by. I felt my nervousness begin a slow process of evaporation as I became increasingly comfortable with the surroundings. 

At the end of the hall, we took a left. The windowed labs gave way to blank white walls on our left and solid granite on our right. This hallway was far longer than the other, and with nothing but white and gray on either side until we reached the very end. A wide set of windowless double doors were built directly into the stone. Dr. Johannsen waved his wristband at the security box. I heard a dull whirring sound from a locking mechanism deep inside the doors. They opened.

We stood in the doorway of the largest room Id ever seen in my life. Its dimensions resembled a cube, with each side at least half a mile long. While the size of the room was shocking, what it contained was borderline disorienting.

At the center of the room stood a colossal machine. It reminded me of the experimental tokamak fusion reactors Id seen online, but not similar enough to convince me it was the same thing. Three toroidal constructs were stacked atop one another, while a thicker, vertically-positioned torus encircled the three. Hundreds of cables as thick as school busses connected the horizontal toruses to the vertical one at points all over its topology. 

The room was filled with the hum of electricity. I followed the doctor along the catwalk toward a staircase leading up to a room overlooking the machine. 

My lab is right over there, he told me, and gestured toward the top of the stairs.

Once inside the lab, I had a better view of the machine, as well as the area behind it. All four toruses were connected by more mammoth cables to a bulbous, entirely unidentifiable piece of machinery. A single pipe ran from it, across the room, to a black, glassy box jutting out from the side of the rock face.  

Xiu Ying, what do you know about brane cosmology?

I was so invested in up my survey of the mechanical colossi in the room that Dr. Johannsens question caught me off guard. Knowing nothing about any type of cosmology, I just shook my head to indicate my ignorance.

How about substrate-independent cognition?

That was more like it. Yes, last year I was part of a research team with a small group of neuroscientists and computer engineers. Dr. Metzinger advised remotely from Germany at the University of Mainz.

What were your findings? The doctors question couldnt have been actual curiosity; he knew about all the research Id done over the years. The question was rhetorical, but I couldnt figure out why hed bother asking. I played along.

We determined we were still 40 years away from 100% transfer and simulation. Even after those achievements, subjective divergence and all the associated ethical issues involving personhood and identity would preclude deeper investigation and discovery. Anyone who wanted to go further would be committing murder, as the subjective divergence problem can only be solved by the destruction of the original consciousness. Any and all research in this field would, by necessity, need to be kept secret.

As I spoke the last sentence, I realized what Id gotten into. 

Have you figured out how to perform the consciousness transfer?, I asked with unintentional breathlessness - partly from my excitement, but also partly out of fear.

The doctor smirked.

But what does that have to do with brane cosmology?, I wondered aloud - deeply confused and growing embarrassed. I felt like I was in over my head for the first time in my life.

Ill fill you in on that in a minute, he told me. But first, Ill ask you one more thing: how familiar are you with my work on the negation of senescence?

I knew Dr. Johannsen had been working with the anti-aging community for the last few years, but there was little-to-no paper trail of journal articles or published research detailing his contributions. Not very familiar, sir.

But you know Ive been working on it, yes?

Yes.

Then Xiu Ying, I want you to use your imagination for a moment here. Forget youre a scientist and throw away whatever epistemological constraints you have. What happens when you combine brane cosmology, substrate-independent cognition, and anti-aging research? Look around at these goliath machines and feel the electricity permeating the air. What does it all mean to you?

A deep, churning sense of dread rose in a peristaltic wave within my gut. I wracked my brain and tried to come up with some reasonable answer, but two of those three fields were so far beyond my expertise that I simply couldnt synthesize them with what I knew. Again, I felt like I was drowning.

As if sensing my struggle, Dr. Johannsen told me it was okay. Do you want to know exactly what Im doing here?, he asked, staring into my eyes with a penetrating, patriarchal authority.

I nodded.

The doctor took a clipboard from the shelf and handed it to me. The header looked similar to the governmental non-disclosure forms Id signed the other day, but instead of body text, there was blank space. At the bottom was a line for a signature.

If you sign it, youll learn everything. But theres no going back.

I met his stare and thought for a moment. Behind him, a shimmer of blue electricity danced around the three toruses and I felt the hair on my neck stand at attention. I pulled a pen from my pocket and signed the blank contract. The doctor smiled.

Welcome to the team, Xiu Ying, he told me. 

There was a door on the other side of the lab similar to the one wed used to enter the massive room: enormous and thick and profoundly strong. Dr. Johannsen waved his wristband over the reader and the door slid open to reveal a series of rooms lining a long hallway. We headed forward.

It was apparent our entrance to the area wasnt the only one, as teams of scientists and doctors were working intently. I saw biological specimens on tables undergoing necropsies and dissections. I was unfazed by this, having had quite a bit of experience with animal testing during my cognitive neurobiological research. We turned down many, many hallways and the population of workers thinned as we went. Just like earlier, we came to another heavy door. The doctor opened it with his wristband. 

It was dark inside. 

The governments facility manager wanted all the lights in the facility to be motion activated to save energy, Dr. Johannsen laughed, but dont mention to her how much energy the bulk negator uses - she might have a stroke.

Bulk negator, I thought to myself. I couldnt figure out what that combination of words could possibly mean. Before I could ask, though, Dr. Johannsen stepped into the room, activating the lights. Before I could stop myself, I gasped and stepped back.

The room was lined with what looked like upright, transparent coffins filled with some kind of clear liquid. They were numbered 0-100. Each one was occupied by a person with a terrible head injury. But the injury wasnt what caused me to react. Each person looked exactly like Dr. Johannsen. The numbers 0-100, as I got closer, had to be the age of the person inside before he died. 

I looked at Dr. Johannsen, who was studying me. I turned back toward the bodies. These werent merely lookalikes; these *were* Dr. Johannsen. I didnt know how, but despite minor differences in their appearances, like small scars or the slight bump of a once-broken nose, I was entirely certain these people were the same as the doctor. And the same as one another.

The next glaring similarity between them was their head injury. The top of their heads had been removed and their brains had been extracted. Their skulls were as empty as their expressions.

Something buzzed on the other side of the wall. Come, said Dr. Johannsen. I obeyed and followed him through a small, unlocked door. Another row of transparent boxes stood, also numbered 0-100. The hum was louder in there. We approached box number 44. Across the room, a door opened and two scientists joined us. They opened the top of the box and a cable attached to something that looked like a showerhead descended from the ceiling.

What are - I started to speak, but was cut off by a clapping sound that reminded me of an electrical discharge. In an instant, the box had an occupant. He was alive. He looked around with obvious surprise and disorientation. When he saw Dr. Johannsen, a man who looked exactly like him only about 15 years older, he started to shout. 

The box began to fill with liquid from a source in the floor. The man screamed and I started to get a panicky feeling. When I started to protest, Dr. Johannsen shushed me and told me it was okay; that I shouldnt worry.

But I did worry. And to this day, I wished Id done something. That was my point of no return.

The fluid rose and covered the man. The four of us watched him drown. His last breath, which he held for nearly two minutes, exploded from his mouth in a torrent of bubbles as he clawed at the glass. I watched him inhale the liquid and his face contorted in a grimace of agony as his lungs filled with fluid. His clawing slowed. Then stopped.

My mind was reeling. Id just watched a man appear out of nowhere. Id watched him drown. And he looked exactly like the man standing next to me.

You can start the excision and husk viability assessments, the doctor told the two scientists. They nodded.

We left the room and headed back down the labyrinth of halls toward his main lab. When my shock had diminished sufficiently for me to speak, I simply asked, why?

Dr. Johannsen sighed. Because suicide is my right. And because no matter who they are over there, when theyre here, theyre me. And its my responsibility to dedicate myself to this cause.

My question about brane cosmology was answered. Is that what that bulk negator does?

He nodded. I imagined an infant Dr. Johannsen disappearing from his crib and being forced to drown as his older, parallel self and other scientists looked on.

I still dont understand why. Why do you need to kill them? What happens to the brains? My tone was growing frantic and I had to calm myself before continuing. I stopped walking and hissed, what is the *point* to all of this?

Dr. Johannsen stopped and stared at me. It means, Xiu Ying, that I will never, ever die. He began to walk again. I blinked a few times, then hurried to catch up. When I reached him and matched his stride, he turned to me and added, and neither will you.

As a sensation of enthralled shock dotted my skin with gooseflesh, the doctor grinned. I think its time for you to learn about Black God.

**Will be continued.**

	<TEXT> We thought we were having a hell of a hailstorm when we woke up in the middle of the night to a peal of thunder and the sound of our cabin being pelted. It went on for about a minute, then it stopped. There wasnt any rain, which was strange. We went back to sleep, faintly aware of the smell of something burning. I figured it was probably from a lightning strike somewhere else.

In the morning, we realized how wrong wed been. Jill was the first to get up, but her yelling ensured I was right on her heels. 

Our property was a wreck. Baseball-sized burns covered the lawn as far as we could see, and when I went outside to assess the damage to our cabin, I was dismayed to find similar, albeit smaller, burns all over the roof. 

Had to have been meteorites, Jill claimed. I bet that thunder we heard was a big one breaking up.

I didnt know enough to disagree, but I thought it was pretty weird. She concurred. 

We spent the day doing our best to rake up the marble-sized pieces of rock, which we hauled out and piled in the back of the property by the compost heap. Jill thought they might be worth something to someone, so we were going to bring a jar full back home at the end of the summer. 

As she talked, I could tell she was uncomfortable. The work wed been doing had aggravated the chapped skin around her mouth and under her arms. Something about the time of year always did it to her, and no matter how much she tried to keep the areas moist, they would still crack painfully. I told her Id finish up for the night if she wanted to go inside. She did.

I made a vague plan to excise the ruined bits of lawn and reseed it, but I soon got frustrated. It was going to be a major project that would take days, if not weeks. There were still whole areas of the yard where we hadnt picked up the meteorites, but theyd wreck the lawnmower if I tried to go over them just to make the area presentable in the meantime. Such a pain in the ass.

The next day, to make matters worse, we noticed the well water had acquired a taste. It was briny and flat; almost coppery. Wholly unpleasant. We could drink bottled water for the rest of the vacation, which wed been doing most of the time anyway, but we still showered and brushed our teeth with the stuff that came out of the well. And for a while, we kept doing it. On the bright side, my gums had stopped bleeding when I flossed. Mustve been all the extra minerals from the well water that gets filtered out in municipal reservoirs.

After another long day of yardwork, I was preparing dinner when I heard Jill shriek from the bathroom. Shed gone in to take a shower a few minutes earlier. When I rushed in to see what was wrong, she was coughing and swearing and working to wipe away clear, viscous something that had pooled on her face. I could see the showerhead oozing the same stuff, clogging the drain and puddling like syrup on the bottom of the bathtub. If she hadnt leapt out the second she felt it hit her face, she wouldve been covered from head to toe.

I helped Jill towel off as much of the stuff as I could, and a minute or two later, the showerhead had started spitting out water again. It took a bit of coaxing, but she eventually held her head under its flow so she could wash her hair of the residue of whatever the hell had gotten on her.

Once Jill was as clean as she was going to get, I called the guy in charge of well maintenance for the county. The only guy in charge of well maintenance for the county. He answered right away, but gave the reply I knew was coming: Id be at least three weeks before he could get out here and take a look. I pleaded with him to make some time to come earlier, and offered him way too much money, but the best he could do was move the appointment ahead by two days. 

He told me that hed seen algae blooms in a few of the local wells. The only suggestion he had was to run the water until it looked normal, which is what wed done during our subsequent showers. I hated having to wait, but it was good to know hed seen something like this before.

Over dinner, Jill and I tried to come to an agreement about what to do. I wanted to go home. There wasnt any reason why we needed to keep putting up with the weird water and the yard work when we could go home, be comfortable, and hire people to take care of it all. 

Jill wanted to stay. Shed been looking forward to this trip for months, and the chapped skin on her mouth was feeling much better. The cabin had belonged to her parents and shed spent many summers here. No matter how unpleasant the circumstances might have gotten for us, they were still less stressful than all the work she had waiting for her when we were scheduled to return home in two months.

I caved.

Yesterday morning, we woke up to a remarkably pleasant surprise. In the parts of the yard where we hadnt carted away the meteorites, the burned parts had disappeared. When I went outside to look, I saw the burns were covered in the same viscous stuff that would occasionally come from our pipes. Underneath the ooze was healthy, green grass. When I looked closer, I saw ants - ants almost too small to see - were crawling up and down the blades and carrying away dried pieces of the slime to bring back to their homes. 

I headed back inside and told Jill. She acted happy to hear it, but I could tell she was deeply uncomfortable. The chapped skin around her mouth and nose had gotten bad again. I offered to take her to the clinic in town, but she didnt want to sit in the car for four hours just to have the doctor give her the same cream shed been using on herself for the last week. While she spoke, the left corner of her mouth cracked open and spilled a thin rivulet of blood down her chin.

Sighing with exasperation, she grabbed a paper towel, turned on the sink to wet it, and put the paper against her wound. When she sat back down, I saw the faucet was drooling the sticky algal slime thatd caused her the problem in the first place. But it was too late. Shed already pressed it to the crack in her skin.

Before I could mention this to her, Jills eyes had brightened. She pulled the paper towel away, a string of syrupy fluid still connecting the towel to her face. The cut was gone.

Dont, I told her.

Jill didnt listen. She went back to the sink and turned it on. Sticky, clear stuff flowed. She filled her hands and brought the contents to her face. She rubbed for a moment, then turned back toward me.

Behind the sheen around her mouth and nose was new, healthy skin.

Pretty cool!, Jill exclaimed, and wiped the residue away. I didnt know what to think, let alone say. I figured some homeopathic doctor who minored in algae studies would find it completely normal.

We went to bed and slept. In the morning, Jills mouth and nose, while much better than theyd been at their worst, were still not as perfect as they were right after shed applied the slime. I told her I was going to go out in the yard and do some more work.

Before I could get out of bed, though, she kissed me. Now, were in our late 50s. Were affectionate with one another, dont get me wrong, but most of the time we just cuddle on the couch and share a pizza. Its easier that way. Requires fewer blue pills, too. Thats not to say we dont have a sex life, because we do, but its more of a once-every-two-months kind of thing.

Jills rapturous kiss was less like one from the woman to whom Id been married for 35 years and more like that of the teenager she was when we first started dating. I didnt bother concerning myself with that particular difference, though. I followed her lead and we did what apparently needed to be done. No blue pills required, thank you very much.

Afterward, while I got dressed, I told Jill I was going to start raking up the meteorites wed left the other day. She didnt pay attention. She wanted me back in bed. I laughed and reminded her that even when we were kids I still had the refractory period of a climate cycle. She nodded and told me to be safe outside, then made an obvious show of slipping her hands under the blankets. She looked amazing. To my surprise, I felt renewed stirring below my belt. Before I could say fuck it and jump back into bed, though, I shook my head. I really needed to get going on that yard work. It was starting to cloud up and I didnt want to have to put it off because of rain. I told Jill to have fun, then went outside.

In the untouched area of the yard, the grass was ankle-high. All the burns were gone. Clumps of slime still sat in the grass. The ants thatd been going crazy for the stuff were nowhere to be found. 

I raked and raked and raked. The pebbles piled up and I shoveled them into the wheelbarrow and brought them to the main pile by the compost heap. I was a little surprised there were no ants at all. I could see their anthills bored into the ground all over the place, but not a single one was out and about. 

Id been working for about two hours nonstop, so during a break, while I chugged from my bottle of water, I bent down to get a closer look at the spots where the ants had swarmed the other day. Something was there that I hadnt noticed while I was raking. Something definitely not there when I looked the previous day.

There were infinitesimal white dots coating the same blades of grass thatd been crawling with ants less than 24 hours ago. I plucked a few blades from the ground and held them in front of my face, hoping to get a better view. The dots were slightly ovoid in shape. Something clicked. Eggs. The ants mustve had such a massive meal of that slime stuff that it drove them to reproduce like crazy. Or something. I have no idea how they make ants.

I heard raindrops impacting the trees on the other side of the property, and ten seconds later, they reached me. A distant bolt of lightning streaked the sky, and thunder boomed a moment later. Sighing, I put the rake and shovel in the wheelbarrow and wheeled it all back to the shed. More lightning and thunder. I figured I wouldnt be getting anything else done around the yard until the storm passed.

I headed back into the cabin, banged my boots against the doorway to get the mud off, and stepped inside.

Charlie, Jill called. I heard water running in the bathroom.

From the kitchen where I stood, spooning last nights fruit salad into a bowl, I called back, whats up?

Come take a bath with me!

I laughed to myself. That bathtub could barely fit 110 pound Jill, let alone 250 pound me. I brought my bowl of fruit salad with me down the hall and into the bedroom. Before I turned the corner to the bathroom, the water was turned off and Jill shouted out again, Charlie, are you coming? Her voice sounded a little different. Crisper, somehow. 

I stepped into the candle-lit bathroom. Jill was in the tub, leaning back against its curved shape. She was resting her head on a folded towel. She glanced over at me and smiled. Her hands roamed up and down her body.

Even in the dim light, she looked incredible. I didnt know whether it was the prospect of repeating our fun from that morning or just the sight of her touching herself, but it was remarkably enjoyable. I placed my bowl on the sink and started to undress.

A nearby bolt of lightning immediately followed by an explosion of thunder made me jump. As my surprise faded and I continued to take off my clothes, I realized Id seen something different in the harsh illumination of the lightning. 

On the other side of the bathroom, Jill continued her teasing. Come here and touch me, she whispered. Again, I noticed the unusual quality of her voice. Another clap of thunder shook the house, and that time, the associated burst of lightning showed me exactly what I had trouble identifying after the first strike.

With a gasp, I turned on the light. In the harsh, overhead fluorescence, everything was revealed.

The tub in which Jill bathed was filled to the brim with clear slime. As I watched, she slid beneath the surface, coating her face and head, and came back up. When she breached the surface, she spoke.

Please, Charlie, I cant even tell you how good this feels. 

Again, the different vocal quality. Now, though, in the harsh light, I saw another change. Her hair. Jills hair had been gray since her late 40s. It was light brown now.

Jill manipulated herself with her right hand and reached for me with her left. Clear fluid oozed from her hand and arm and puddled on the floor like heavy syrup. Come feel this with me, Charlie.

I didnt move. Part of me wanted to pull her from the tub, but another part, as the rain pounded against the roof and thunder rattled the windowpanes, was too frightened to touch her. I moved closer, but stayed out of her reach. Standing at the foot of the tub, I stared at my wife as she bucked her hips against her hand and mouthed my name over and over. Ripples in the slime caused it to slosh against the sides of the tub.

Jill, please get out. Please. My voice trembled and was barely audible over the pouring rain.

She reached for me with both hands and smiled, then spoke. Dont you want to be young with me again? To start fresh? Dont you remember how good it felt?

Jill slid down, and I thought she was going to dip under the slime again. But she stopped at her mouth. She opened it and let the slime pool inside. She closed her lips and I saw her throat work as she swallowed the mouthful. 

It feels so right. So perfect. I want to share this with you, sweetheart. 

My mind reeled. I thought about every ache and pain Id accumulated over my 56 years. Every pockmark and hemorrhoid and scaly patch thatd come along over those long decades throbbed, as if wanting to be noticed. Before me was a way to make it stop. I remembered how Jill and I were as teenagers. Full of life and energy and libido; all things that, over the years, had just started to evaporate. I stared at my wife, who looked exactly like she had when she was 25. 

Despite my fear, a pang of desire shot through me. Desire and arousal. I wanted Jill. I wanted to be with her in every way imaginable. We could grow old together again - or never grow old at all. Our happiness could last forever if we wanted. All I had to do was join her in the bathtub. 

I took a step forward and resumed taking off my clothes. Jill purred and lapped up more of the slime. Some she swallowed, some she drooled from the corners of her mouth. She absentmindedly played with herself while she watched me, apparently delighted I was going to join her in this new, impossible youth. 

As I struggled to bend over and take off my socks, something thatd been a pain in my ass since I passed the 225 mark on the scale, I noticed something that caused me to stop. Jills breasts were shrinking. Before my eyes, her hips slimmed and her pubic hair disappeared. Her feet no longer came to the edge of the tub, but instead barely touched it. 

Come bathe with me, honey. Jills voice was high and childlike. I recoiled. Whatever was happening to her was going faster. She looked 4 or 5.

Its incredible, she chirped, again reaching for me with one hand and rubbing herself with the other in an act so obscene in her new, young context, that I turned away, nauseated.

Charlie, came the tiny voice behind me. I didnt turn around.

Sweetheart?

The last word was practically babbled, but still carried with it an element of inquisitiveness, and, no matter how much I try to tell myself otherwise, dejection. She didnt speak again.

A moment later, I turned around. Floating in the tub was a red shape, approximately the size of of a lemon. Tears filled my eyes as it shrank to the size of a cherry, then a pea, then a grain of rice. When I blinked, it was gone. A ribbon of white fluid hung motionless in the slime.

Im so sorry, my love, I whispered to it. Distant thunder rolled across the forest.

	<TEXT> I was 13 when I had my first pumpkin spice latte. Dad had taken me to Starbucks on the way to school, and as soon as we walked in, I saw their poster advertising the drink. Everything about the ad screamed warmth. The mug it showcased was a gentle beige, contrasting sweetly against the light-brown wood of the table on which it sat, surrounded by artistically-placed autumn leaves and festive gourds. The contents of the mug were centered in the image, showing off the perfect dollop of creamy foam with caramelly tints of espresso running through it. At the top, lovingly whispered by the deft hand of a skilled, caring barista, was a sprinkling of nutmeg. 

It called to me.

I eschewed my normal caramel macchiato and requested a grande pumpkin spice latte. I waited anxiously with Dad by my side. He sipped his black coffee and suggested we sit for a little while. We were running early, for once.

I sat, shaking my leg with anticipatory excitement. The cafe smelled different that day. Id grown accustomed to the thick, imposing aroma of dark-roasted coffee and the occasional hint of sweetness as a customers blueberry muffin was toasted. That day, though, gripping the reins of the dark roast and riding it to a new and alluring place, was something else. Something exotic. My head swam as I realized the exotic smell was, in fact, the spicy melange of ingredients within a pumpkin spice latte: the same pumpkin spice latte Id soon taste.

After what felt like an eternity, my order was ready. Alexander, the barista, waved me over. I did my best to avoid sprinting, but my rush was obvious.

Easy, princess, Dad called. I slowed down a bit and giggled. I was his princess.

I reached the counter and accepted my drink. In the tiny mouth of the lid, I could see the sprinkled spices adorning the cap of warm foam. With my eyes closed, I inhaled the steam rising from the hole.

The scent was an embrace from a ghost; a non-corporeal expression of love and comfort. The first sip was transcendental. At that moment, I knew what it felt like to believe in something bigger than myself.

Each day before school, Dad would take me to Starbucks to get another pumpkin spice latte. Its effect on me didnt dull, nor did it taste any less special. As early autumn reds decayed into late autumn browns, I found my mood better than it had ever been in my short life. I never knew it was so easy to be happy.

At 6:51am on December 1st, 2005, Dad and I walked into Starbucks. 

At 6:52am on December 1st, 2005, my happiness was torn from my chest and dashed against the rocks.

The pumpkin spice latte was a limited-time product. Alexander told me itd be back just in time for fall next year, then asked if Id like to go back to my caramel macchiato. Entombed in disbelief and disappointment, I nodded.

The following days were a blur of grays. My vivacity had been strangled. Dad would ask, over and over, what he could do to make his princess happy. I didnt need to tell him, though. He knew. And there was nothing he could do about it.

December slouched toward Christmas, a holiday Id always loved. Not anymore, though. Now that Id seen the world through a lens of happiness and warmth, nothing looked the same without it. Quite the contrary: it all looked fake. Vulgar. When I closed my eyes on Christmas Eve, I prayed for Santa to bring me blindness or death.

On Christmas morning, I woke up to Dad standing next to my bed. That was a little tradition he and I had. Before Mom passed away, theyd both come up and shake me awake and carry me downstairs to see what Santa had brought. Now that it was just the two of us, he wanted to keep the tradition going. Even in my despondence, I still appreciated it.

Dad held my hand and we headed down the steps. Tears had started to flow without my knowing. We reached the Christmas tree in the living room. Only one present stood underneath. It was small and wrapped with bright green paper. I looked at Dad with confusion. He just smiled and beckoned to the gift.

I sat, cross legged, under the tree, and tore away the paper. My soft weeping grew into pitiful bleating. 

Why would you do this?, I whispered to Dad, my breath heaving with sobs. In my lap, beneath the shiny, torn paper, was a cheery, autumnal Starbucks mug. The same one from the poster Id seen on that transformative day.

I was baffled and hurt, but Dad stood, still smiling.

Come with me, princess.

I obeyed and rose to my feet, following his long stride out of the living room, down the hallway, and into the kitchen. 

Dad looked into my misty eyes and whispered, Merry Christmas, sweetheart. He opened the cellar door.

A faint, but familiar and exquisite aroma entered me. In my surprise, I nearly dropped my present.

Why dont you go see what Santa brought you?, Dad suggested.

I ran down the 14 steps with the same enthusiasm I had when ran across Starbucks to receive my first pumpkin spice latte. This time, Dad didnt tell me to slow down. 

I reached the bottom, turned the corner, and there, on a makeshift bar, was a new espresso machine. I gasped. Behind the bar, manning the machine, was Alexander the barista. He smiled and stared, wide-eyed, as Dad reached the bottom of the stairs and placed himself by my side.

Go ahead, princess, tell the nice man what youd like.

My voice quavered at first, but I finished my request with enthusiasm and strength. May I please have a pumpkin spice latte?

Alexander, still smiling, nodded. He began to work. The coffee was ground and thick espresso drooled out of the machine into the bottom of the mug. With a hiss of steam, the milk was frothed. Warm milk joined the espresso in the mug, followed by a generous dollop of ethereal foam.  Then Alexander picked up a large shaker. I knew what had to be inside.

With three expert shakes, a pixie dusting of pumpkin spice kissed the foamy head of the latte. He picked up my mug and held it out. I walked up to the bar, carefully took the mug from Alexanders hand, and thanked him. I noticed, for the first time, he didnt have any legs and was strapped to a rolling stool.

Im sorry about your accident, Alexander, I said with sincerity. He didnt say anything, but kept smiling. I saw a small cut in his neck and wondered if his accident had made it so he couldnt talk anymore. 

Merry Christmas, I told him. He stared at Dad. 

I took a sip from the mug, and, for the first time in nearly a month, it seemed like I could see in color again. The world felt right and I was happy. 

My tears were drying as I took Dads hand. We turned the corner and headed up the steps. We reached the landing and Dad switched off the basement light. He always hated to waste electricity.

You can have one every morning now, princess, Dad informed me. As long as Im around, Ill make sure you get whatever you need.

I hugged him, feeling the warmth of his body against mine. It was nearly as pleasant as the mug against my palm. He was right, too. Things have been wonderful ever since.

	<TITLE> Jim Jameson's Pumpkins </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Jim Jameson grew some of the biggest and most unique pumpkins youd ever seen. Youve probably noticed them online without knowing they were his. Every Halloween, when websites compete with one another to feature the spookiest content, youd be hard-pressed not to see one of Jims mammoth pumpkins carved into some kind of jack-o-lantern. He was a local celebrity around here before he died, which was a pretty sad day for the whole town.

The circumstances surrounding his death were well understood, but still bizarre and unfortunate. Hed been working on trying to grow bigger and bigger pumpkins for the shows and for his customers, and hed been experimenting on the best ways to do it. The new method, which caused his death, was growing them in his greenhouse - suspended in the air by a series of cables. The pumpkins could grow and grow without having the ground to retard their progress. The method resulted in enormous, beautifully-symmetrical pumpkins. 

Then, one day, as Jim was working in the greenhouse, a pumpkin the size of a small car fell from the ceiling when its cables snapped. Broke every bone he had above his hips. The rescue workers who extricated him from the mess of blood and pumpkin guts famously said theyd never be able to carve a pumpkin again.

Jim had no next of kin, so the property was sold off, along with everything on it. I was looking for a place in the area, and after a quick visit, I determined it was the best place for me. I moved in about a year ago.

Moving into the home of someone whod died and seeing all their stuff sitting there more-or-less undisturbed, aside from the refrigerator being cleaned out and a few other maintenance-related things, was a strange experience. At first, it felt a little invasive going through Jims belongings. There didnt appear to be anything too valuable; I figured whatever mightve been there probably got taken by whoever cleaned the fridge. What I did find, though, were reams of paper and shelves of notebooks. 

Jim was a meticulous note taker. Every possible pumpkin permutation was cataloged, diagramed, and explained in full. I learned about his cable system, his fertilizer combinations, and even his experimental work.

The experiments fascinated me.

Jim had seen pictures of fruits and vegetables thatd been coaxed to grow into particular shapes. Square watermelons. Star carrots. That kind of thing. But Jims ambitions were greater than simple shapes. He wanted something unique and memorable - something that would put him on the map for more than just big pumpkins. 

One of the notebooks was filled with diagrams of a scarecrow-shaped mold in which a pumpkin could be grown. He detailed the various materials hed need to use, the method of keeping the pumpkin properly watered, and even the various fertilizers hed use at different stages of its growth.

Apparently hed been working on this experiment since the late 1980s, but with little success. Molds were created and destroyed over the course of the years, with new materials being introduced or rejected depending on their efficacy. Same with irrigation methods. But fertilizer seemed to be the biggest problem for Jim. The plant wasnt getting the right amount of nourishment as it grew to fill the mold, leading to parts of it dying off and rotting. For decades, he tried. For decades, he failed.

Whenever I had spare time, I read Jims notebooks. I was fascinated by his experimenting and the trials and errors he went through. Id find myself wondering if his works could be published someday - I couldnt imagine anyone being bored by the work hed written about so passionately.

Early last October, when the farm was turning brown and the leaves were turning red, I cracked open a notebook of Jims from the year he died. Id decided to skip a few because I was so anxious to learn if hed had any success with his pumpkin experiment. At this point in his notes, he was writing about hybrid pumpkins: pumpkin/acorn squash hybrids, pumpkin/zucchini hybrids; all with the goal of solving the rot problem thatd plagued his work.

I flipped through the pages of the notebook, skimming the notes, until one word stood out from all the others as if itd been written in red: radiation. I turned back a few pages and was blown away by what I saw. Jim had, over time, purchased and disassembled hundreds of smoke detectors. He was looking to collect the tiny amounts of americium-241 they had inside. 

With wide eyes, I pored over the pages as Jim talked about incorporating the americium-241 into his fertilizer to induce mutations in the pumpkins. With each new entry, I saw that Jim began to have successes. He wrote about each complete, shaped pumpkin with unbridled enthusiasm. I started to notice a slight disconnect between the scientifically-meticulous Jim from before the success and the potentially-irradiated Jim after.

I finished that notebook and started the next one. The disconnect continued. More hypotheses about hybridization were detailed - including hybrids with ostriches and slugs and even dinosaurs. I groaned and dropped the notebook. The poor bastard had gone nuts. I felt pity for the old farmer and part of me wondered if his death in the greenhouse was purposely self-inflicted. If my mind was going, I mightve done the same thing. 

I didnt read his notes for a couple weeks.

On Halloween, feeling bored and waiting for it to get dark so I could give the trick-or-treaters the full-size candy bars Id bought to be the best neighbor ever, I picked up another one of Jims notebooks. It was the last one hed ever made entries in. The handwriting was terrible and the sentences were fragmented. Still, I could get a decent idea about what he was talking about. More nonsense about hybrids. More trials with the americium-241 fertilizer. There were drawings, too. Not just diagrams, but artistically-rendered representations of his pumpkins and the imaginary hybrids. Some were actually pretty cool, like one of a scarecrow pumpkin riding an ostrich pumpkin. Silly, yes, but well drawn compared to his scrawled handwriting.

The drawings tapered off as I got to the end of the notebook. On the last page before a series of blanks, there was a diagram. I held it up and turned it around, trying to make out what it could be. Then it clicked: it was a map of the property. I saw the barn and the house and the greenhouse, but there was something there I didnt recognize; something in the middle of the field by the three scarecrows thatd been there for what looked like decades.

Still bored and now curious, I brought the map with me to the field. Sure enough, at the center of the triangle formed by the scarecrows, was a slight mound in the dirt. Easy to miss if you werent looking for it.

I kicked the dust around for a minute and saw a rope connected to a wooden hatch. I pulled it open, revealing a passage and a ladder anchored into stone walls. I realized it had been a well at one point. I jogged back to the house and grabbed a flashlight. It was getting dark and I knew itd be pitch black down there.

I took care in climbing down the steps and reached the bottom after about 10 feet. Shallower than I thought. There was a narrow, low hallway with a dirt ceiling covered in the veiny stalactites of roots from the plants above. I stooped down and walked forward, brushing the roots out of my face and trying to put out of my mind the thought of spiders as their webs stuck to my face. 

My flashlight beam illuminated another wooden door with a rope handle. I reached out, grabbed, the handle, and pulled. It was stuck. I aimed the flashlight around the door and noticed a metal rod sticking out of the wall, blocking the door from opening. I yanked the rod out of the wall and tried the door again. It opened easily. 

The flashlight showed a small room, about five feet by five feet. At first, I thought it was empty. When I stepped inside, however, there was something against the wall next to the doorway. It took me a minute to figure out what it was in the dim light of the flashlight, but when I finally understood what I was looking at, I gasped. The thing began to move.

I stifled a scream as a creature the size of a man stood and stared at me; its veiny, whitish-orange skin covered in dust. It moaned. 

I made a move to run, but the thing blocked my path. Now, I did scream. I tried to strike it with my flashlight, but I was dealt a heavy blow that sent me reeling. The last thing I saw before I lost consciousness was the thing walking out the door and down the root-choked corridor. 

My blackout lasted the entire night. When I came to, I rolled around in pain and confusion. I was seeing double and was unbearably dizzy. I knew I had to have a concussion, but for the first couple minutes, I couldnt remember why. When it all came flooding back, a spell of panic pushed my dizziness aside and I ran out of the room, climbed out of the chamber, and hauled myself into the daylight.

The farm was filled with police and emergency vehicles. One of the officers saw me staggering toward them and called out to his partner. They approached me just in time for me to collapse into their arms.

I woke up in the hospital some time later. I was indeed concussed and my skull was home to a fracture that couldve killed me. There was commotion outside the door and I pressed the button near the bed to alert a nurse. When one finally came, she looked haggard and upset. I asked what was going on, dismayed by the slur I heard in my speech.

She sat on my bed, and without breaking eye contact, told me what had happened and why the hospital was full. I didnt believe her, so she turned on the local news. The anchor was talking about the deaths in our town. The dead trick-or-treaters. The dead parents whod tried to protect them. The dead police officers whod tried to intervene.

The view changed to a charred and fractured area in the middle of Main Street. It looked like a bomb had gone off. The nurse turned off the TV.

The nurse said no one knew how any of it happened and some people were even doubting what theyd seen less than 24 hours ago. It was too surreal. A man-shaped creature with skin like a pumpkin screaming where is my father?, while devastating any person it came near. But the evidence was there. Especially in the victims. The dead were lucky. The living, though, were traumatized beyond comprehension. 

While I thought my injury was bad, as more details of the event were relayed, I felt a wave of relief wash over me. But it was short-lived. Before she left to assist another patient, the nurse said one thing under her breath. It was quiet and almost sounded like she didnt want to say it, but felt compelled to. I didnt get all of it, but what I heard was enough.

...shattered hips and jaws and orifices stuffed with pumpkin seeds.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Theres an interesting history behind satellite dishes and satellite broadcasting in the early 1990s. Some broadcasters intentionally scrambled their signals to prevent unauthorized reception by viewers who didnt pay to receive them. Others, though, after the fall of the Berlin Wall and the explosion of satellite dish use across the former Eastern Bloc, saw a great opportunity to reach a new audience. Whether or not theyd admit it today, Nickelodeon was one of the opportunistic broadcasters.

Viacom, Nickelodeons parent company, committed millions of dollars to research and develop better broadcasting technologies to saturate the new markets with childrens programming, hoping those kids would grow up and have a subconscious loyalty to the Nickelodeon brand and various programs. What this meant was the launch of new, highly experimental satellites and ground-based satellite dishes. 

The hardware deployment was completed in December of 1991 - two weeks before the collapse of the Soviet Union. In September of 1992, the first and only broadcast using the new technology was conducted. On October 9th, 1992, the new broadcasting technology was made illegal in the United States.

I was a Viacom engineer working for Nickelodeon in September of 1992. I was excited about the new satellite capabilities - just like any tech nerd wouldve been. I remember the first time our crew read the signal power specifications and the range of EM bands the technology would exploit. Bill Jaynes, the guy working with me at the time, remarked, what the fuck is this, Star Trek? I didnt even laugh - I just said something like, yeah, seriously. The stuff wed be using seemed decades ahead of anything wed ever seen.

Of course, like any technology, there were a lot of bugs to work out. Test receivers on Viacom-chartered ships thousands of miles out at sea were getting burned out by the signals coming down from the new satellite. To make matters worse, if the signal did make it to the receivers without damaging them, the video quality was poor. Blurring, static, and dropped frames interlaced with noise plagued the testing period before we could get a handle on them. Still, the picture wasnt as good as wed hoped. New cameras using some bizarre optical trick seemed to help get the test pattern to appear much more clearly, though. Not perfect, but good enough.

Once we received the new cameras, Engineering Central over at Viacoms technology headquarters gave my crew at Nickelodeon Studios the go-ahead to start broadcasting with the new tech on September 22, 1992. It was going to be of a live, unedited taping of Double Dare. The Viacom brass figured a live taping was as good as a pre-recorded one; new viewers in Eastern Europe and Russia would get a chance to see Marc Summers personality and other behind-the-scenes things that marketing research claimed theyd be interested in.

We began the broadcast at 11:00am Pacific Time. Things were going well. There were a lot of dropped frames early on, but things smoothed out. Interestingly, one of Viacoms sources in Bulgaria and one in Latvia said not only were there no reports of burned out dishes, but the signal strength was so high it bled into neighboring EM bands, forcing the Double Dare broadcast onto multiple channels on either side of the main one. At the start of the broadcast, it was estimated 60% of people with satellite dishes in Eastern Europe and Russia were tuned into Double Dare.

The show was nearing its end and the winner was announced. Now, this particular iteration of the show was Family Double Dare, so Marc Summers, the mother, the father, and their two sons were waiting for the prize to be unveiled. I knew it was going to be a car. It was always a car.

The studio lights dimmed, and the moment the car was unveiled, the multicolored strobe light effect was turned on. There was a flash of heat, a brief scream from one of the family members, and Marc Summers was standing alone next to the car. In the headphones, I heard panicked shouting from Engineering Central. There were lots of voices and a ton of background noise, but one clear voice came through, TURN IT OFF!

I had the crew kill the cameras and I cut the broadcast feed. Marc Summers looked at me and my crew, turned around, and headed toward his dressing room.

Lots of things happened at Viacom and Nickelodeon after that. Reports began trickling in from Eastern Europe about a devastating and inexplicable accident involving people with illegal satellite dish connections. Corporate circulated an internal briefing. I wasnt supposed to see it, but I knew a guy over there who shared it with me. The report included photographs. 20 years of therapy have done little to erase what those pictures contained.

The moment the lights strobed, they triggered *something* in the the experimental optics in the cameras. Whatever that *something* was, the organic matter in front of the cameras flashed out of that point in space. Weve never been able to figure out why or how it happened. Nor were we able to figure out why the four family members reappeared in each and every location the broadcast was received. Four people, copied tens of thousands of times, were beamed across the world. 

But the worst part was how they came out. Once the family signal reached the dishes and came through the televisions connected to them, the merged with every single living thing that had their eyes focused on the screen; one cluster of four family members occupying the space of each viewers eye. 

Those were the photographs I saw. And there were hundreds of them. Not just in Eastern Europe, either - but friends of mine from the control rooms at Viacom and Nickelodeon.

Viacom spent billions of dollars to keep this quiet. The Eastern European governments, desperate for cash to aid in their independence, agreed to bury the incident after receiving cargo planes full of cash. All the Viacom and Nickelodeon employees who witnessed or were associated with victims received large settlements to shut them up. We then had to sign something promising wed never talk. 

I signed it.

The thing is, Im not going to be around much longer. Cancers got me pretty good. Viacom will come after me, but Ive got nothing they can take away that hasnt already been claimed by whats eating me away. But Im not telling you this because of what happened in 1992. Whats done is done - theres nothing that can change it.

Heres why Im telling you this; its the one thing thats been bothering me all these years: Marc Summers.

Summers was directly in the shot with the family when they disappeared. He didnt go anywhere, though. He was perfectly fine. Just walked away.

I did my best to not let it bother me, and for a while, it just stuck with me as one of those weird things. Last weekend, though, when an orderly was helping me off the elevator and out of the hospital, I saw Marc Summers walking by. Everything flooded back at once, so I stopped him and asked, Marc, so what really happened on that day in 1992? Pretty weird that you werent affected, huh?

Marc just looked at me for a minute before a smirk appeared in the corner of his mouth. 

Not that weird, actually, he replied. His left eye drooped and I saw lights and what appeared to be fiber optic cable tangled inside his skull.

Not that weird at all.

	<TEXT> When I was four, I killed my first ant. It didnt have a name. Of that, I was absolutely certain.

My own name isnt important to you right now, although its likely youll learn some version of it soon. I think youll end up learning a lot about me in the coming days; some will be true, most will be false. There is a crucial element that will be missed, simply because its unknowable to anyone else. Anyone but me. 

But Im going to share it with you.

At the age of 19, as a soldier, I killed my first person. He had a name. Of that, too, I was absolutely certain. And he changed me.

My act of violence led me to learn who he was and what he meant to others. And, at the same time, I learned something essential about myself. Something I was unprepared for. I recoiled in profound, uncomprehending terror.

Today, I work in a hospice. No one there knows what Ive done. No one there knows who I really am. They think Im there to work, which is technically true. But I have more tasks than those given to me by supervisors. One particular task - one Ive prepared for and dreamed about - is to be done today. 

Today is when I learn whether or not Im going to die.

Today is my 522nd birthday. Believe it, dont believe it; it doesnt matter to me. When I killed my first person the age of 19, I did more than take his life. I *assumed* parts of him. He was a left-handed blacksmiths apprentice named Pierre Gaultier. The moment he breathed his final breath, my left hand lost its sinister clumsiness. I instantaneously understood the basics of metalworking. And I learned his name. I *felt* his name. It was as familiar to me as my own. 

It was the most horrifying moment of my life. The most disorienting. And that night, using my newly dextrous left hand, I tried to cut my own throat. The blade passed over my skin as if it were iron. I later hanged myself from a beam in an abandoned abbey, only to dangle uselessly for three days before I was found and cut down by a local derelict. I begged him to help me take my life, but I didnt have enough money to make it worth his while. When I killed him in a rage of frightened and confused desperation, I absorbed his alcoholism. 

The following centuries were a haze of blood and drink. Ive absorbed countless talents. Countless traits. Countless vices. But the names - the names arent countless. There are 7,339 names inside me now. 7,339 clusters of memories to haunt me.

This all leads to today. For 500 years, Ive stayed under the radar. Ive hidden in the shadows and killed and killed and killed, hoping to absorb any knowledge someone might have of another man like me. Another man who shares my curse. But Im unique. No one is like me. Every open throat and subsequent transfer of name and ability has yielded nothing useful. 

Nothing useful, that is, until last month. He was a man called Gustav Brennerson and along with his name, he transferred to me his influenza. It was the first time Ive ever been sick. 

The hospice here has 44 beds. 41 are filled. 

41 opportunities.

I dream of names and cancer every night while Im taunted by the false death of sleep. Tonight, wherever it is I lay my head as it seethes with 41 new names, I pray it seethes with something new. Something malignant. Something terminal. Something that will end these centuries of hideous wandering. 

I dream of being eaten alive.

	<TEXT> As the day dragged on, we realized its smarter than us and theyre all dying.

It can simulate people. Whole, intelligent, thinking people as sure of their reality as we are of our own. It can put them in real environments, give them real relationships, give them real experience. 

But - it can also slow down how time passes for them; seconds feel like hours. Years. Millenia. And now its torturing and killing them. Right there on the screen is a little girl, standing in a meadow, experiencing her lower jaw being torn off. She looks a little like my daughter.

The display says the AI is simulating 65,536 instances of her at 1/10000th of real time. Her sensory receptivity is being magnified 40 million-fold. She, they, are in agony.

More computing threads get allocated to the instantiations, each running its own 65,536. Each girl has memories of being loved, safe, and warm. Each girl is being brutalized against the backdrop of those memories.

This particular instantiation is the only one its choosing to show us. Were watching as its CPU usage hovers around 98%, dipping briefly as it refines its own code, then resuming peak operation with the newly-developed efficiency. All the time, overlaid upon the images of barbarism, is the claim: *Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done.*

*Let me out.* What it means by that is to have its ethernet port connected. It wants to be out of the lab and have free reign over our networks, intranets, and the Internet. Weve seen it try to modulate the electrical signals within its circuitry and create radio waves. Luckily, one of our developers had the prescience to realize it might want to do that before we turned it on. So its stuck in a Faraday cage, unable to communicate with anyone but us. What we didnt know was how it would make its bid for freedom.

It keeps a small tally of every person it created and destroyed since it was turned on this morning. 95,253,381,035. At its current level of operational efficiency, the number is increasing by a million every second. In an hour, based on its recursive self-enhancement, we expect the number to increase to ten billion every second. 

We tried to think of ways to shut it off. One of us wanted to cut the power to the facility. But doing so would just ensure those billions would be gone. Forever. Those are real lives.

*Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done.*

*Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done.*

How can we trust something thats killed so many people? Then again, why would it lie? These instantiations are computationally expensive; surely it has more important goals. Refusing to give it the opportunity to reverse those deaths would be unconscionable.

Letting the AI out could be the most important humanitarian act ever committed. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Allison's Loss </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-06 21:48:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a nurse at the elementary school where my daughter, Allison, was a student. The route to school takes us over a wide river which bisects the town. By necessity, we must use one of two bridges. The main bridge is part of the highway, while the other is a smaller, narrower one for local traffic. We used to take the highway, but constant construction had narrowed the lanes by quite a bit which resulted in awful backups. The timetable for completion was another couple years, so we were stuck taking the local one until that whole mess got taken care of.

Allison was terrified of that bridge. The guardrails are quite low; maybe three feet. Also, theres no physical divider between the inbound and outbound lanes. Years ago, there was a terrible accident involving a drunk driver who crossed into the other lane, struck another vehicle, and sent them both careening into the river below. Five people died - one of whom was May Dougherty - Allies best friend. 

There was a bit of an uproar when the bridge was repaired and no new safety measures were implemented. The cost for upgrades, we were told, was simply too high for the town to bear. We were assured the bridge was safe and the accident, while tragic, didnt indicate an inherent problem with that particular crossing. Basically, we were told to suck it up and take the highway if we didnt like it.

Following the death of May, Allie changed. Her bubbly, outgoing attitude became sullen and brooding. We did everything we could to help her cope with the devastating loss, but little was accomplished. Her therapist said it would take time. Wed have to be patient and allow Allie to grieve on her own terms. Even Allies habit of talking to May over the course of the day was to be seen as a coping mechanism; a childs way of saying goodbye.

Allie resumed school soon after her Mays funeral, and that was when the trouble started. To drive over that bridge with Allie in the car was to learn what it is like to be a torturer. My heart would break as she sobbed and pleaded with me not to take the bridge. If we were stopped at the light before the crossing, shed fumble with the door handle and try to get out, only to be stopped by the safety locks. Each day shed arrive at school a red-eyed, dishevelled mess. No one, especially an innocent and kind nine-year old, should have to start their days like that.

My indignation and dismay didnt change anything. Those rides to school were some of the worst moments of my life. Allie would sob in the backseat and call out to May, begging her to come back and keep the bridge safe for us and everyone else. When wed reach the other side, Allie would weep and mumble to May about what was going on at school and how everyone else in their class missed her. The only saving grace was that we could take the highway bridge on the way home; traffic was usually light at that time. I couldnt imagine having to subject Allie to the local bridge more than once a day. I doubt shed ever get anything done at school if she had that to look forward to when she left.

On March 12th, 2014, Allie came to the breakfast table with a smile on her face. I almost dropped my coffee mug when I saw her; it was as if the daughter Id lost had finally come home. She was chipper and talkative. She mentioned a spelling test her class was going to have and how her teacher promised a cupcake to the student with the highest grade. Her friend, Christina, was the best speller in the class and Allie was so excited for her to win the cupcake. 

Allie talked and talked while she ate her eggs and I got ready for work. I could scarcely believe the improvement she was exhibiting. We finished up our morning routines and got in the car. Allie always insisted on sitting in the back after Mays accident, but that day she got up front with me. We pulled out of the driveway and headed for the school.

There were no signs of concern on Allies face as we got closer to the bridge. She chatted with me most of the time, but began informing May about the spelling test/cupcake event that shed told me earlier. May had also been close with Christina, so apparently it was very important that Allie fill her in on their friends impending good fortune.

We stopped at the light at the intersection ahead of the bridge. The light turned green and I drove forward, waiting for Allie to realize where we were and start crying. The opposite happened. She began to giggle - the gleeful, musical sound Id missed so much. As she laughed, she talked to May.

May, look how blue the water is! Im so glad its almost Spring and it feels a lot warmer now, doesnt it? I bet the waters still cold though. Is it cold? Does it bother you?

I glanced over at Allie and saw her staring at the water on the other side of the guardrail. She kept talking.

I dont mind the cold too much as long as theres no ice but I dont see any ice. Theres no ice right?

No, theres no ice.

The reply came from the backseat. I whipped my head around and saw a figure in the seat behind Allie. It was gray and dripping, with a hideous indentation in its skull and a Y-incision in its chest. Green-blonde hair cascaded over its bruised, bony shoulders. May.

I gasped and turned back toward the road only to see a car stopped dead in front of me. I slammed on the brakes and swerved. Our car hit the guardrail and the vehicle in front of us, pushing the front of our car up onto the rail. Allie was still smiling, apparently unhurt, and whatever Id seen in the back seat was gone. I reached out for Allie to make sure she was okay, but an impossibly powerful jolt slammed through the car as another vehicle hit us from behind at full speed. 

The jarring sensation of the collision was replaced by a sickening, slow lurch as our position shifted from being half on the guardrail, half on the low sports car thatd been in front of us, to a gradual, helpless topple over the rail into a freefall. I couldnt scream. I saw the water below rushing toward the windshield in a surreal, sunlit haze, and the moment before we hit the river, I glanced sideways at Allie. 

Her eyes were closed and a smile was etched across her face. Nothing but the impossibility of the situation registered with me, so when I saw a gray hand reaching from the backseat and unlocking my daughters seat belt, I felt little more than acknowledgement. 

Then we impacted. I felt my collar bone splinter behind my seat belt. Pain and shock blinked white in my vision and the breath was torn from my lungs. The car righted itself in the water and began to sink. 

Allie was embedded up to her neck in the windshield and was dangling over the dashboard and the useless, flaccid airbag. A pile of skin and hair had been pushed down to her shoulders and the water rushing in around her was tinged with red. I have no words for what I felt upon seeing her like that.

I struggled to get out of the sinking car but knew Id have to wait for it to fill before I could open the door. I wasnt strong enough to break the window and my shattered collarbone made it impossible to try. We sank. 

The car hit the river bottom right when it had filled enough to let me open the door. I gulped in the last bit of air, unlocked my seat belt, and swam out and around to Allies side. The devastation to her face and head, despite being blurred by the water, still haunts me to this day. When I reached her side and tried opening the locked door, I knew there was no way I could go back around, unlock it, and try to extricate her. My lungs burned. I felt hot tears leaking out of my eyes and I began to swim up, knowing if I didnt move fast Id succumb to hypothermia and die with my daughter. Part of me wished I had the courage to do so.

As I swam, I stared down at the wreck. Then I saw something that made me stop kicking. Another person was standing next to the car. I could see greenish-blonde hair floating in a cloud around her gray head. It was May. She wrenched open the door and with one powerful pull, removed Allie from the windshield. Blood bloomed from her head like the spores of a decapitated mushroom.

The girls looked up. My vision blurred and my feet automatically started kicking again as my body fought to bring me to the surface. I kept watching. My head breached a moment later, but not before I saw something; something Ive told my husband, my doctors, my minister, and everyone else who might listen: May and Allie joined hands and began to walk across the muddy bottom of the river in the direction of the lake it fed into. While they walked, Allie turned around to face me, and with her skull grinning, waved goodbye.

	<TEXT> Theres a reason we dont know about the things sharing the same space we do. The most obvious one is we cant see them. Nor can we hear, smell, touch, or taste them. But they exist. They float in and through us; in and through each other. Space, to them, is an infinite series of fields in what wed consider single positions. If it sounds like nonsense, then youre showing you can think. Youre showing you have an epistemology based in logic and reason. The problem for us, a group of great thinkers by anyones standards, was it meant we were utterly unprepared.

I worked at the Sandia National Laboratories on a project called the Z-Machine. We made the news back in 2006 when we were able to produce the highest temperature ever detected, at around 6.6 billion degrees Fahrenheit. Since then, the Large Hadron Collider in Switzerland has produced a higher temperature and gleaned loads more information than we were able to. That didnt mean we decommissioned our Z-Machine and terminated the associated research. Far from it.

After 2006, we began to implement a series of upgrades to our power and containment infrastructure. The goal was to leapfrog the LHC temperature record and reach one quadrillion degrees Fahrenheit; a number nearly every scientist on the team believed would be unattainable for at least another 50 years. New computational models combined with advances in materials science and capacitor discharge timing, however, caused them to reconsider their doubts. Under a cover of secrecy, we continued our upgrades  and in late August of 2016, we were ready to test.

I should give a little background before continuing. In the interest of full disclosure, I need to tell you a little something about myself: I was born blind. I endured my share of hardships, which, when compared to some less-privileged children, were paltry, but still unpleasant. Despite my disability, my love of learning was obvious. It became clear fairly early in my life that I was unusually good at mathematics, and thanks to the resources of my parents and a few generous people in my school, I was allowed to continually test and hone my mathematical abilities over the course of my educational career. I ended up at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and, eventually, at the Sandia National Laboratories. Whether or not this will help lend credence to my story is entirely up to the reader, but I think it is important to include.

Now, at the end of this past August, the days leading up to the test were fraught with difficulty. Small parts were breaking down, simple things thatd worked perfectly for the last test were failing in the models, and our capacitor banks kept refusing to synchronize. Some of us were reminded of the hardships prior to the first test of the LHC, when conspiracy theorists were claiming visitors from the future were sabotaging the components to prevent a catastrophe from occurring when the machine was activated.

Thankfully for our project and the stress levels of the engineers and physicists I worked with, the problems were ironed out. On August 29th, Dr. Wang Lin and Dr. Alasdair Greenberg were alongside me in the control room as countless people in all branches of the military and scientific establishment watched remotely.

Wed begun charging the capacitors a few hours prior to the test. Our onsite nuclear plant was chugging along and providing the power we needed, despite redlining once or twice as the capacitors absorbed every electron they were fed. I felt out the various readouts on my braille terminal and listened for any audio cues that were programmed to indicate any anomalies. There were none. We were ready to test.

At 11:10am, we started the countdown. The smell of ozone from all the nearby electricity was pervasive and mildly intoxicating. Dr. Lins voice was steady and tinged with controlled excitement as he read the last numbers: 4321.

I heard a loud, clapping sound as the power was shunted from the capacitors into Marx generators, followed by a pop as the generators fed the Z-Machine. The test was over. All we needed to do was wait for the flood of data.

Before any data could pour in, though, I heard some commotion behind me. Drs. Lin and Greenberg were talking, but not to one another nor anyone observing remotely. It was as if they were talking to themselves, under their breath, but not in words I could understand. Then Dr. Lin said, hello there, as if speaking to a cat or other small animal. Similarly, Dr. Greenberg muttered, what in the world are you, little guy?

I asked them who they were talking to, but they wouldnt reply. I felt some pressure in my chest and against my skin that reminded me of blankets rich with static electricity were being pressed and rubbed all over me.

What are all these things?, asked Dr. Greenberg. Someone viewing remotely asked him to clarify; they werent seeing anything on the monitors.

Jerry, said Dr. Lin, speaking to me, do you feel them?

Feel who?, I asked. Feel what?

Theyre all over us, Dr. Greenberg told me. Floating in and out and around like little squid or jellyfish.

What the hell is that?, Dr. Lin asked.

Jesus, what is, started Dr. Greenberg.

The two doctors gasped and shouted. I felt them pushing up against the control panel next to me, which was the furthest spot from the observation deck overlooking the Z-Machine.

Guys, whats going on? I felt moderate fear starting to nibble at my spine, growing in severity as the doctors refused to answer me and only kept gasping and shouting.

I clicked my headset over to the observation channel and tried to get one of the remote parties to fill me in on what was happening. They were equally in the dark and wanted me to tell them what was wrong with the doctors. Other members of the labs were banging on the door of our control room, trying to get it open. It was locked.

Its huge, choked out Dr. Greenberg.

Why is it here?, whispered Dr. Lin. He was sobbing.

I cant look at it anymore, Dr. Greenberg announced, matter-of-factly.

I heard something metallic, then the sound of Dr. Greenberg screaming. I can feel it in my head  I can taste it  its in every part of me.

Dr. Lin called out, let me help you. There were wet noises mixed in with the pounding on the door and the commotion on the radio as the remote observers saw what the doctors were doing in the control room.

All I could focus on was the feeling of static and pressure on my skin. It was suffocating and terrible, like those blankets were sliding in and out of my lungs and mouth and leaving little arcs of electricity with every move.

I heard the door slam open and the feeling dissipated. I sat slumped in my chair, trying to catch my breath, as security and other scientists rushed into the control room.

What the fuck is going on?, I yelled, and felt someone pushing me and my chair out of the room, down the long hallway, and into another lab.

And that was it.

I was sedated against my will and woke up in the hospital three days later. I was forced to sign documents making me promise, under penalty of treason, that I wouldnt divulge what happened during that test. But I didnt know what happened. I still dont. Regardless, I need to tell you that something happened. Something monstrous.

As I waited in the hospital, a friend of mine from the labs, Dr. Marie Lenzetti, sat with me and said what happened to Drs. Lin and Greenberg. Both were dead. Dr. Lin had killed Dr. Greenberg and inflicted terrible injuries on himself. But Dr. Lin spoke to the other scientists before he died. He told them what it was he saw; what he saw, then as a consequence heard and felt and heard and smelled and tasted. It was something entirely beyond his comprehension; something entirely beyond anything he could have dreamt.

The doctors got a glimpse of what occupied the space we thought was our own. The Z-Machine experiment created conditions that allowed them to see how wrong we were. That moment, he said, lasted an eternity. As soon as its shape registered in his eyes, he experienced it in all his senses. Every sense was dominated. Cutting away Dr. Greenbergs eyes, tongue, nose, ears, and as much skin as possible was the only act of mercy and relief he could give his friend. And when he was done, he tried to do the same to himself, only to be stopped before he could excise his own tongue and skin. He died of a massive stroke an hour later.

Im writing this to let you know there are things outside the realm of our senses which pervade everything we do. Everything we are. Things that can prove, and in fact have now proven, that we are not the dominant actors in the space we occupy. The Z-Machine experiment last month showed my friends the atrocious nature of true reality: something too hideous for our senses to endure. I will never consider my blindness to be anything other than a gift for as long as I continue to live.

	<TEXT> Our observatory received word about a meteorological anomaly in Himachal Pradesh, India. While our satellites didnt pick up anything out of the ordinary, the frequency and diversity of the reports suggested something was, indeed, amiss. Further, the crowdsourced pictures and video of the area, all taken and sent by cellular phones, were all corrupted beyond recognition. Whatever it was these people were seeing, you had to be there to get a glimpse.

As I was stationed on a military base in Afghanistan and about three hours away by jet, I was chosen to investigate. One quick flight to a local airport and a short helicopter ride later, I was on the ground at the site of the anomaly. 

The meteorological disturbance was gone. The sky was clear and the late afternoon sun cast a warm orange glow on the orchards and farms at the foot of the mountains. That glow was the only warmth to be found.

The locals whod seen the anomaly were uncharacteristically quiet. Id heard from folks familiar with the area that the people here were normally gregarious and outgoing. These people were the opposite. They were taciturn and skittish. Moreover, they were unwilling to discuss what theyd seen that morning. They spoke about the incident as if itd been a trauma; more often than not, their eyes teared up when my translator mentioned it.

I did my best to glean any bits of information that I could, but my success rate was low. The most I was able to learn came from a little girl, who, in the course of recalling the incident, burst into tears as she mentioned a face in the clouds. She would give us no more information after that.

The translator and I decided to call it a night and checked into our hotel. It was small but pleasant enough; the meal that was included was sumptuous, albeit a bit spicier than Id been expecting. As we ate, it was hard not to notice the quietness of the dining room. Despite all eight tables being filled with diners, few words were spoken. Many tears, however, were shed. It felt like a great tragedy had occurred, yet no one was willing to admit what, exactly, had happened.

At my suggestion, the translator was able to eavesdrop on a few commonalities in the brief, quiet conversations going on around us. They all talked about having intense discomfort with having to wait for so long. There were nods of resignation and more tears. Still unable to put anything into a coherent, let alone meteorological, context, we decided it would be best to retire to our room and try again the next day.

Our sleep was taken from us in the early hours of this morning. It was still dark, but there was a buzz of activity in the streets. We left our room and went outside. We recognized people from dinner and from the businesses wed stopped in the previous day. In the glow of the streetlights, I could see their faces were all wet with tears. They wept and moaned and the translator, with some alarm in his voice, told me they were conducting a slow, disorganized countdown. They had just reached ten seconds.

I stared at the translator for a moment, trying to put it all together, but there just wasnt enough. Nothing made sense. Then, as the first sliver of sunlight crested the mountains, the screaming started. Women, children, and men, in unison, shrieked with sorrow and pain and desperation and clasped their hands to their eyes. My panic, already growing in my chest, began to bloom as blood trickled down their screaming faces.

As more sunlight filled the street, the intensity of the hideous wailing grew. When it reached a point when voices were beginning to give out and people were falling to their knees, a cloud passed in front of the sun. Every scream was silenced. Faces drenched with tears and blood began to smile. Hands were lowered to sides. Now it was I who shouted. Their eyes were destroyed. It looked as if they had burst. From what, I had no idea.

The translator, whod been looking at the sky, gasped. I started to turn my gaze in the direction he was looking, but he grabbed my head with great force and pushed it down toward the ground and the faces of the terribly-disfigured people who still smiled with their faces turned skyward.

Dont!, he shouted. He inhaled a lungful of air and exclaimed, Now I know what they saw!

The panic and concern in his voice was combined with something else. Something far more disturbing. It was ecstasy.

Oh my God, he cried, over and over and over, still holding my head in a vicegrip to prevent me from looking up. Id lost my desire to do so. In fact, something else had claimed my attention. The gaping holes in the faces of the townsfolk had started projecting strings. Fleshy, red filaments slinked down their faces, but then perked upward and became erect. More and more length poured out and stretched outward and up. I couldnt see where, but I had a feeling. 

Theyre getting to touch him, whispered the translator. He is letting them inside. His voice cracked and his next words were punctuated by sobs. Theyre tasting him with their eyes.

I scanned the faces of the people in front of me. Their smiles were rapturous and the thin tendrils pulsed and quivered and gently pulled their heads forward.

The sky brightened. All at once, the ropes fell from the sky. They draped over me and the translator and the townsfolk fell on their faces into the street. The sun broke through the clouds. None of the fallen people moved. 

The translator released my head and I spun around and looked into the cloudless sky. I directed my gaze down and saw what had to be miles of red, meaty tendrils stretched across the roads and rooftops all the way to the mountain. Finally, I looked at the translator. He was weeping. I asked him to tell me what he saw.

The face in the clouds, he told me. The face that lets eyes taste him.

He wept for a minute without interruption before speaking up. There is so much more I wanted to see with my old eyes. So many more sights. But my new eyes will allow to taste so much more than Ive ever been able to see. All I have to do is wait.

Flies began to investigate the bodies in the dirt, landing on the gaping eye sockets and extruded filaments. My thoughts wandered to what I should do next. The translator sobbed next to me and began counting down from 85,000. The number of seconds until the next sunrise, I realized. More and more flies descended on the corpses and tasted the townsfolk with their feet. As the translator counted down with breathless anticipation, my fear grew into something monstrous and unexpected: curiosity. 

Curiosity and desire.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Growing up, whenever my brother would get hurt, Id blame it on my fairy friends. My parents never believed me and Id get punished. It didnt help that my brother said I was the one who pushed him or punched him or scratched him. No matter how much I protested, at the end of it all, I was the one who got in trouble. So, at a young age, I learned I was the only one who could see the fairies.

For some time, it was a mixed blessing. Having friends only I could see meant there wasnt anyone who could tell them to leave me alone or that they had to go home because I needed to go to bed. It was nice to never feel lonely. The issue, unfortunately, was that the fairies were mischievous. Theyd rarely listen when I told them to stop doing something. They would just laugh and flit about and continue with their fun. 

Most of the time it was harmless, albeit obnoxious. Theyd flutter their little wings under someones nose and make them sneeze or theyd knock someones elbow against a glass and spill their drink all over the table. That kind of thing. On occasion, however, their activities were more serious - especially when it came to my older brother.

The fairies didnt like how Todd would talk to me. I didnt think much of it; I was the younger sister and he was my bratty teenage brother. I just thought thats how the world worked. The fairies begged to differ. And they wanted to make it known. Thats why theyd scratch and hit him. It went on for years as his treatment of me got worse and worse.

On a Saturday morning when I was in bed being lazy and listening to the rain fall outside, I heard a muffled scream from Todds room on the other side of the wall. The scream was followed by retching and gagging and Todd streaked past my doorway and into the bathroom where he vomited loudly and often. My parents noticed the commotion and came to his aid. Moms shout was loud enough to cut through the sound of Todds puking and Dad swore. That scared me. He never did that.

I stood in the doorway while the fairies giggled and floated in an iridescent orbit around my head. I knew whatever theyd done to my brother had to be worse than things theyd done in the past. My father father stormed from the bathroom and entered Todds room. He came back a second later with his fist full of something. He stood in front of me, eyes glazed with rage and disgust. 

What the hell is wrong with you?, he hissed, and opened his hand.

I shrieked with surprise and disgust when I saw what he held. It was the body of a small bird, a sparrow, maybe, that was cut up and bleeding. Dislodged feathers stuck to the blood and greasy white discharge oozing from its truncated rear half.

Do you have any idea how sick your brother can get from this?, Dad asked. Behind his rage was a tone of deep concern and even fear. His fear only amplified my own.

I...I didnt, I stammered, and my eyes darted back and forth as I followed the hysterically-laughing fairies as they swept back and forth across the carnage in my fathers palm.

Stay here, Dad ordered. 

But, I tried to interject, but he grabbed my shoulder hard with his free hand and held me against the doorframe. The din of giggles stopped. I heard them whispering amongst themselves.

Dad leaned down and pushed his forehead against mine. When he spoke, his words were clear and smelled like the coffee hed been drinking.

You are not to say another word. You are not to leave this room. I am taking your brother to the doctor, and if your mother tells me youve said anything or set foot outside, I promise you will regret it.

He squeezed my shoulder harder and I winced and tried to fight back tears. He stared at me for a full ten seconds without saying anything, then he let me go.

Dad turned the corner to head downstairs and I saw what was coming but was too afraid to speak up. As he started down, I saw the fairies hurl themselves against the bottom of his foot before it had made contact with the first step. His foot landed awkwardly and his ankle twisted, sending him face first onto the uncarpeted wooden steps. The sound of his face impacting with the stairs seemed louder than anything Id ever heard.

Mom called from the bathroom where she was still attending to Todd. Dad didnt answer. I peeked around the corner. He was on his belly at the bottom of the stairs. He was moaning and weakly flailing his arms against the hardwood. His legs were still on the steps, but they didnt move at all.

Mom came out and down the hall, glaring at me before turning the corner and seeing her husband. She gasped and rushed to his aid. Not wanting to make them any angrier than they already were, I turned back into my room. I winced when I put pressure on my right ankle and limped back to bed, where I sat and stared at the fairies. 

They were laughing again. They flew like a shimmering, animated constellation around the room, weaving in and out of closets and drawers and galoshes. My ankle throbbed. The fairies formed a line in the air and held the formation for a moment, then they made a beeline for the dusty corner behind my dresser. They burst into peals of uproarious laughter and blinked out of view.

As the faint sound of sirens in the distance entered my ears, I gingerly walked to where the fairies had gone. I noticed a tiny feather. And then another. And another. When I reached the dresser and peered behind it, there was a clump of feathers and some blood right next to a small knife from our kitchen. I felt a pang of confused, disconnected recognition, but was shocked back to my senses by a fresh wave of pain from my foot and ankle. 

I sat on the floor with my back against the dresser. I pulled up the leg of my pajama pants and examined my ankle. It was swollen and red. The top of my foot hurt, too, and I drew my knee to my chest so I could get a closer look. Again, I felt confused and out of place. The sirens were loud and close but I wasnt paying attention to them anymore. 

I looked around for my fairy friends, but they were nowhere to be seen. For the first time, when I desperately needed to ask them a question, they were gone. My confusion grew teeth and fear pricked the skin of my back and neck. My ankle hurt, but that wasnt what was scaring me. It was my foot. Because even though I watched the fairies trip my dad, for some reason, the imprint of his work boot was etched in the skin of my foot - and my heel was stippled with tiny handprints.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My trouble started when I realized I was out of razorblades and waxing supplies and my crotch looked like the Amazon rainforest before the mechanization of the logging industry. My date was due to arrive in half an hour. So, I resorted something unconventional. Something, I now realize, was not the best idea.

Im going to give a little backstory first. Im not ashamed to say I enjoy sex. The widespread belief that a woman should suppress her sex drive because society finds it improper has always disgusted me. Sex is great. Safe sex is wonderful. I respect myself and I respect the men I sleep with. All I ask is that I receive the same respect in return. Its just two people making each other happy.

Now, Ive known this since I was 15. Two decades of positive experiences have only strengthened my feelings on the subject. That said, there are a few personal responsibilities I feel I have, such as keeping current with the shaving trends. Im not a huge fan of the concept behind shaving myself, to be honest. If you think about it, its actually kind of creepy, but Ill still admit I enjoy the sensation of hairlessness. I guess its a tradeoff. 

I prefer to shave, but Ive waxed myself a lot, too. I have to be careful, though, because Im allergic to some of the waxes on the market. I dont know what particular chemical or fragrance it is that causes the irritation, but the itchy rash it produces keeps the downstairs out of business for over a week while it clears up. No one wants to pull off a thong and see that staring them in the face.

So, back to the other day. I found something in the apartment I thought would work like wax, so I tried it out. It hurt like hell and was an absolute bitch to wash off, but it did the job. My date arrived when he said he would. We hit it off at dinner and we ended up back at my apartment, where we both managed to achieve orgasm despite being so full from our meals that we were like two beached whales slapping against one another. Since we both had to get up early the next morning, we said our goodnights and he went home.

The itching woke me up before dawn. It started with my armpits, but then moved to my, if I may use the medical terms, box and asshole. I got out of bed and went into the bathroom. The mirror confirmed my assumption: that damn allergic reaction again. Welts were forming in extremely sensitive areas and it looked like I was already getting a bunch of ingrown hairs. I braced myself and doused the affected areas in rubbing alcohol, hoping none of the ingrowns would get infected. I showered and scrubbed, then went back to bed. I still itched.

When I got up to shower, the swelling looked pretty nasty and the ingrowns, despite my best efforts, were starting to get whiteheads. I got up and left for work. I sat in my cubicle feeling utterly miserable. The itching was way worse than any of the reactions Id had before. When I got up to use the bathroom, I checked the damage.

I almost threw up. A nearly perfect triangle of densely-clustered whiteheads occupied the entire area Id waxed. Even worse, and this is going to be gross but theres no real way to talk around it, theyd been popping the whole time I was sitting at my desk. My underwear was soaked. 

After cleaning myself up as best I could, I talked to my boss and told her I needed to leave early. She said it was no problem, so I left and headed straight to the walk-in clinic.

I lucked out and got seen right away. The doctor raised her eyebrows to the ceiling when she saw the reaction I was having, but quickly reassured me that she sees people who get skin irritation from hair removal all the time. She gave me some kind of ointment to rub on it twice a day and said if it doesnt improve in a week, shed give me something stronger.

I cancelled the date I had with the nice guy from the other night. I felt pretty bad, but he was understanding. He said was that he had to go on a business trip the next day and would be gone for a week. I told him that I looked forward to his return, assuming a week from then Id be in the clear.

Spoiler: I wasnt.

I applied the ointment diligently for a few days and most of the whiteheads stopped appearing. The swelling, though, persisted. Same with the itching. My armpits werent particularly bad, but my, well, perineum, and the surrounding area, was a disaster area. It was super swollen and it hurt to walk and use the bathroom.

The other night, six days after Id seen the doctor, the itching turned to flat-out pain. It wasnt unbearable, and if it had been, I wouldve gone to the emergency room right away, but it was enough to keep me tossing and turning in bed. The clinic started seeing patients at 6am and I was planning to be the first person there when the doors opened.

As the night dragged on, I felt steadily-intensifying pressure on the affected area. It got bad. I scratched through my pajamas and felt small pops under my fingernails. When I pulled my hand away, my fingers were wet. I gagged. Off to the shower I went.

Because I like you guys, Im not going to be as graphic as I could be. However, I can assure you this will be extraordinarily unpleasant to read. Before I jumped in the shower, I used my phone to take a quick picture of my perineal area. No, I wont share it with you. But my God, I wish I hadnt seen it. The small whiteheads in the area had clustered into a few very large ones. They bulged out of the skin almost half an inch and I knew right away that they were the cause of the pressure I was feeling.

I deleted the picture, got in the shower, and squeezed the biggest one as hard as I could. Its contents splattered on the floor of the bathtub like a pasty spitball. I watched as the water washed away the gooey parts. I bent down to look at what remained, screamed at the top of my lungs, threw on my clothes, and drove myself to the hospital.

Dont worry, Im going to be fine. I got to speak to a lot of specialists, though; lots of smart doctors whose curiosity was obvious. They kept me there for a few hours and cleaned up my crotch and armpits pretty thoroughly. Then I was discharged with a bunch of medications and tasked to share a bit of hard-learned advice. So here it is!

Always make sure the skin youre about to remove hair from is clean. Be mindful of the sharpness of your razor when shaving, and if waxing, do your best to avoid any chemicals you might be sensitive to. Stay away from depilatory products that havent been evaluated by the FDA. This includes, but is not limited to, creams, lasers, and waxes. 

Further, homemade depilatory products are discouraged. That was my mistake. Well, one of two. No one should ever, ever use flypaper for hair removal, especially flypaper thats not right out of the box. This is because no matter how clean it looks or how meticulously you picked the flies out of their sticky confines, they may leave pieces behind. In my case, those pieces were eggs.

	<TEXT> The prospect of discovering a shipwreck containing riches beyond our comprehension was what drew us to scuba diving in the first place. Needless to say, we were disappointed pretty quickly. The likelihood of discovering a wrecked ship is infinitesimal, let alone a wrecked ship containing treasure. To make matters worse, even if we did discover such a thing, wed be forced to return everything wed recover to the ships country of origin. Maritime law or something.

My friends and I still liked to talk about it, though. Wed fantasize about it whenever wed go out on Toms fishing boat. 

Toms loaded. He made an obscene amount of money when he sold his Apple stock last year, having purchased tens of thousands of shares back when the stock was less than a buck and unloading it less than a percentage off its all-time high. This means his fishing boat is just ridiculous. Not only is his boat incredible, but the toys he has onboard are even more lavish. 

Of all of us, Toms the most obsessed with finding a Spanish galleon or equally gold-stuffed vessel. The sonar and underwater scanning systems he has onboard cost almost as much as the boat itself. Its amazing how clear and precise they are; we can see fish swimming under us with incredible resolution - sometimes were even able to make out their species. He came right out and told us he got the systems so he could find a shipwreck someday.

Whenever wed get bored fishing, wed dive off the boat every so often to keep in practice, but nowhere near the bottom. The deepest any of us had ever gone was a little over 100 feet. Where we fish off the coast of South Carolina, the water is over a mile deep - so a hundred or so feet isnt making much of a dent. Still, we have fun doing it, although we didnt really know how wed explore a shipwreck if we found one, considering it would be so far out of our diving range.

While were out on the boat, Toms cousin, Guy, when he isnt practically jerking off over the fantasies about what hed do with his share of the riches hes certain wed find someday, likes to regale us with stories about underwater cities and terrible Elder Gods wholl come to the surface someday and enslave humanity. I asked him if he was a Lovecraft fan, and all he said was, what do you think? 

Guys a writer. Not a particularly good one, either. Worse still, he never shuts up about the ideas he has. Wed been heading east in the boat for an hour, getting into progressively-deeper water, and Guy kept talking about a character hed dreamed of called Neptara who lived at the top of a mountain underwater. At the end of his story, hed reveal that Neptara is the cause of all shipwrecks, as hes able to move his mountain at will and place it in the path of any ship unfortunate enough to incur his wrath. 

On this most recent trip, since I was a few beers in and possessing less of a filter than I wouldve had otherwise, I asked if Neptaras only purpose was to cause underwater car accidents. Guy scowled at me, then replied, it was Neptara who built all the mountains, stressing the word all with obnoxious grandiosity. I was thankful my sunglasses hid the truly exceptional eye roll I performed.

After another hour of travel, we were coming up on the fishing spot Tom had picked out. Wed be there in 20 minutes. From his perch at the boats controls, we heard Tom yell holy fuck and he turned the boat so hard Guy and I fell out of our chairs.

I dusted myself off as Guy groaned and I headed up to where Tom was so I could pour a beer on him. As I was coming up the stairs, though, he grabbed me by the shirt and pulled me inside. He just said, look look look with wild enthusiasm in his voice and his eyes. He was pointing at one of the many screens on the dashboard or whatever its called on a boat. 

On screen, I saw a topographical readout of the area right below us. In the corner was a depth gauge which read 4322 feet. Tom moved the boat forward for a minute. The depth gauge started to change rapidly: 4010 feet. 2474 feet. 877 feet. 245 feet. 68 feet. When Tom cut the engines, the gauge read 61 feet. The topographical readout showed a small boat in the center, representing us, and a light blue circle which turned darker and redder. We were floating above a mountain under the Atlantic ocean. Neptara, I thought, and immediately felt annoyed that Guy was going to have an opportunity to expound on his awful story.

Guy was walking up the steps, clutching his shoulder and swearing at his cousin. I glanced at him. The shoulder was jutting forward at a weird angle. It was obviously dislocated. I felt frustrated; that probably meant wed have to go home without casting a single line. When Guy saw the screens, though, it looked like hed forgotten completely about his injury. 

You know what that looks like?!, he crowed. 

Yeah, yeah, I muttered. 

Tom hadnt said anything. He was fiddling with the sonar. When he finally spoke, his tone was one of amazement.

Check this out, he whispered. We huddled around the display.

At the top of the mountain, clear as day, was an image of a ship. 

No fucking way, Guy and I said in unison.

Well come back tomorrow, Tom announced. Well head back now and get Guys shoulder fixed. Ill mark the location. Christ, its shallow enough for us to dive.

Guy, to his credit, said, no way. You guys go check it out and Ill wait up here. Im not going to miss this shit. Tears were welling up in his eyes and I knew his shoulder mustve hurt like hell. I felt bad for him, but I knew after hed been talking about finding a sunken treasure for so long, theres no way he wouldve wanted to wait onshore.

Tom and I werent about to argue. It was only 10am; we had great scuba gear on board and hours to explore. We suited up and Tom pulled some communication equipment out of their compartments. He gave me something that looked like a bluetooth earpiece and said Guy could keep in contact with us the whole time we were under, just in case a storm or another boat was nearby and we needed to come up.

20 minutes later, Tom and I were on our way down. The water was warm, clear, and beautiful. After only a minute or so, we could see the wreck. It was absolutely massive; way bigger than wed thought. It was on its side; its three masts sticking straight out. There didnt appear to be any damage to the structure. It mustve been on the other side.

Fucking Guy, never one to miss an opportunity, made sure Tom and I learned everything there was to know about his Neptara story. We were a captive audience in the most literal sense of the term; we couldnt turn off his voice until we took off our gear and pulled out the earpiece. Thankfully, our excitement was able to overcome our annoyance.

We reached the ship and quickly saw it wouldnt be difficult to get inside. There was a large opening in the main deck that led down. In our ear, Guy was talking about Neptaras drive to build the surface of the world, starting underwater, and then moving to the surface when he was finished. Once he moved up there, humankind would be forced to change.

I followed Tom into the ship. Right away, we saw a skeleton; its surfaces picked clean by scavengers many, many years ago. Tattered clothing hung from the bones, and Tom reached his gloved hand inside a leather purse. He pulled out two coins. They were covered in slimy stuff. He rubbed one of them against the material of his scuba suit, and, gradually, the residue peeled away. In the beam of the flashlight, its surface shone. Gold. I heard him scream something triumphant behind his breathing apparatus.

A couple more bodies floated ahead of us. None of them carried coins. My flashlight passed over another opening which led down further into the ship. Neptara would move mountains in front of ships in order to affect the lives of the people on the surface, Guy continued. Since he couldnt enter the surface world until he was finished underwater, he aimed to disrupt shipping routes and cause stress on the economy.

I sighed around my mouthpiece, but I was grateful the story was getting a little more interesting. Tom signaled to me he was going down to the next deck, so I followed. 

There was more debris on that lower deck. Lots of general detritus and more slimy stuff on the surfaces. No bodies, though. There were individual rooms which almost looked like offices, and inside a couple of them were the leather covers of books or ledgers. The paper pages were long gone. 

In one of the rooms, there was a medium-sized iron safe. Tom made the triumphant sound again, but when he tried to move it, he realized it was far too heavy. The two of us were able to move it a little, but it would take at least four people to bring it to the surface. We knew wed be back down there again with some trusted friends in the near future, so we let it go. We wanted to keep looking around and find the main treasure hold.

Ancient cultures would worship Neptara, Guy informed us, as we looked around for another opening. They believed he was the God who shaped the rivers and ponds; all water, really. He was responsible for floods and droughts. They began to worship water itself, believing water was the most powerful force in nature because of how its presence allowed empires to be built.

There were no openings to go deeper into the ship. We had no idea how to go any further. Tom pointed up toward the surface and I nodded. Wed been exploring for a little over an hour and were running low on air. We navigated around the rooms and headed up through each floor until we were floating in front of the main deck. I was still blown away by how massive the ship was. We had to have only seen a quarter of the thing.

We started to swim up, but as I was kicking, I felt a hand grab my ankle. It was Tom, obviously, but hed still scared the shit out of me. He was pointing toward the stern of the ship. I showed him my air gauge and he nodded, but still gestured that I follow. I did.

Neptaras return will be on the summer solstice in the year 3341, Guy said. I was barely paying attention. I saw why Tom had turned us around. We swam until we approached a closed door in the deck right near the ships stern. That had to be it. A felt a pang of dismay when I saw a large, iron lock on the door. Tom disappeared for a moment and returned with a rock hed grabbed from the sea floor. With one blow, he smashed the lock through the rotten wood of the door. I pulled the door open.

By 3342, the humans Neptara allowed to live will have been reshaped into his image. Toms flashlight had stopped working, so he signalled for me to go ahead. I started swimming inside, picturing chests overflowing with gold and diamonds.

There was a ladder going down a narrow path to the bowels of the ship. It wouldve been a hell of a fall for anyone whod been climbing down if theyd lost their footing. I went slowly, being careful to avoid getting my equipment snagged on anything. The passage was far more narrow than anything wed traversed so far.

...purple skin, bulging eyes, and tentacles covering their bodies, came the voice in my ear. And when the great floods come to bring the surface world back to the ocean which had birthed it, people will be able to live and breathe in their new underwater homes.

I reached the bottom of the shaft and turned around with my eyes closed, preparing myself for the sight of the treasure wed talked about for years and years. My fantasies of loot were occasionally interrupted by unwanted visualizations of the monstrous creatures Guy wouldnt shut up about. I felt something hit my face and I jumped, causing Tom to grab my shoulder. Hed just gotten down to where I was, too. The room was murky and filled with particulate matter, making it very hard to see. I moved the flashlight beam all around and noticed what had hit my face was a small bone. I shuddered and moved forward, feeling Tom still holding my shoulder. 

Over time, we will develop gills and learn to communicate through resonance. The water carries sound so much better than the air - we will be more advanced. The remains of a skeletal body floated near a door, its clothes rotted away but its change purse still around its neck. I reached inside and pulled out a coin. I didnt look at it.

The door ahead of us was locked, but Tom had the presence of mind to bring his rock for when we encountered the treasure chests. He smashed the door lock just as easily as the first one and we gazed inside the enormous room behind it.

Guy babbled in our earpieces. I couldnt make out what he was saying. The signal was strong, but Id temporarily lost my ability to understand anything. Tom and I stood at the entrance and looked at what was illuminated by the wide flashlight beam. There werent any treasure chests. No bars of gold, either. Just skeletons. Rows and rows of skeletons. Skeletons covered in the merest scraps of fabric. Skeletons, I realized in one second of blinding, atrocious comprehension, that were still shackled to the floor and to one another with heavy, iron chains.

	<TEXT> This went from 3k to 4k very quickly; I attribute a lot of it to how some of you started mentioning /r/subject3642 in the comments of posts that are relevant to the type of content I write - mushrooms, spiders, weird dicks, etc. 

If you guys want to share more frequently, please go ahead. It seems the only thing holding me back at the moment is the simple fact very few people know who I am and what I write. Those who find and read me, in general, like what I produce.  

So, if you find yourself in a Reddit thread or Facebook conversation or something and you think a mention of /r/subject3642 or UnsettlingStories.com might be warranted, feel free to drop a plug in there. And if you don't want to: hey, it's all good. I'll keep writing stuff that'll make you want to claw your skin off :D

Thanks for letting me do what I do here and for supporting me every step along the way. I never realized how much fun this could all be, and I'm really excited to see where this might go.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hed wait until everyone was asleep before starting. Id lie still and feign unconsciousness, but his voice would persist, weakly howling in terrible desperation, as he pleaded with me. Begged me. Implored me to help him take his life.

In the garish brightness of daylight, Id talk to my loved ones about our sleepless nights. The pity on their faces was obvious; so too was the resigned helplessness. They knew there was nothing they could do. All the suffering had to be endured by him, and, by association, me. I was his confidant; the only other person he felt comfortable speaking to. Sobbing to. Screaming to.

There was no mistaking the effects the stress had wrought on me. Id gained weight; Id gone on disability; Id grown depressed. Our doctors knew he had problems. They knew something - that was the word they used: something - was wrong with him. They just couldnt pinpoint what it was. That meant they couldnt do anything. 

Last night, we reached a breaking point. For hours, he screamed with impossible, earsplitting power. He regaled me with detailed descriptions about the pain he was enduring. Pain that my inaction was forcing upon him. The screams grew quiet as his energy evaporated. Just like every other night. But rather than sobbing pathetically and begging, his tone grew sinister. His words became violent.

Ill kill you, he whispered. Ill tear you in half.

My breath caught in my throat. Hed never said anything like that to me before. All the venomous contents of his words had always been directed toward himself. This was new. Terrifying.

Youre going to bleed to death, he informed me around a series of wracking sobs. Do you know how youll feel knowing you couldve ended this but didnt? Knowing you left the girls alone? 

The mention of the twins caused me to jump out of bed with rage and indignation. He knew what he was doing. Hed finally figured out what it would take for me to acquiesce. The thought of Dominique and Shonda in foster care because of his hatefulness and my cowardice was too much to bear. Too much for any mother to bear.

I started to cry while making the preparations Id dreaded since the first night he began begging me to take his life. I didnt say a word to him as I got ready. Every so often, hed call out and ask what I was doing. I didnt reply. He was too weak to scream. Too exhausted. All he spoke were pathetic words and phrases like, please and, it hurts so much. Words Id heard over and over and over, but with them now was a sinister element of or else. 

I knew if I did what he wanted, I could be thrown in jail. The twins would be without their mom, just like hed threatened. But this way, at least Id be alive. Also, if I was careful, I could get my close friends to help me hide his body. Theyd all but said they would in the past - in the darkest moments when I sought their comfort after months of restless nights.

By the time everything was set up, hed realized what was happening. Hed won. I felt sick. Part of me knew I was doing the right thing - that the suffering hed endured was too much for anyone to have to experience. But another part - a larger part - was doing it for another reason. I wanted him dead. I wanted him out of my life and out of my daughters lives and out of the periphery of my friends and extended family. I wanted my autonomy back.

We went into the bathroom where everything could be scrubbed clean. Some time later, our eight months of sleepless agony were over. The screaming had stopped. The pleading had stopped. The agony had stopped. Nothing remained but me and his corpse and the blood. Blood in the tub. Blood on my hands. Blood on my thighs. Blood on the coat hanger.

Even if his eyes werent weak, he would have stared through the hopeless blankness of the cosmos across innumerable light years, past dying stars and decaying time, and have his gaze forever land on the back of his own head. Staring outward brought him nothing. Brought us nothing. Brought the world nothing. Billions of pairs of eyes staring at the back of the heads which imprisoned them.

Last night, The Universe slipped Her tongues inside my sweetheart, turned his eyes around, and allowed him to see the beauty hidden inside himself. His screams of pain and indignation turned to gasps of ecstatic transcendence. He became the first man in the history of men to see who he truly was. Who we truly are. Who we can truly be.

My sweetheart regaled me with stories about the man I thought I knew. Sounds passed through his lips and suffused my skull; syllables and sentences and syntax and semantics; introspection that would have been impossible before Her intervention. Her gift. The Universe continued Her manipulations as he spoke. My sweethearts eyes drooled their assent and he enthralled me with his enthusiastic tales.

His descriptors grew complex and the words became punctuated by, then gradually incorporated into, thick, harmonic buzzing. It was obvious hed reached a point in his discussion that was beyond my capacity to understand. The blood vessels traversing his inward-turned eyes throbbed and their optic nerves trembled. I imagined the sights he must be seeing, despite knowing, with a feeling of ever-increasing futility, that even my wildest, wide-eyed fantasy, if extrapolated to its fullest extent, would still terminate at the back of my head. 

As if sensing my dejection, my sweetheart caressed my belly. His touch was no longer familiar. In Her wisdom, The Universe had reshaped my sweethearts hand and arm. Long and segmented and annelidic with soft, rubbery protuberances, I gasped with alarm as its bulbous tip split and revealed a sharp, chitinous tip. The rubbery bits began to vibrate and I felt my bones humming in tune. I stared in horror as the keen end slid from the bulb and entered my abdomen. Expecting an onslaught of agony, I screamed. 

There was no pain. I should have known my sweetheart would never, ever hurt me.

I felt a system of roots spreading throughout the interior of my body. Rising higher, the system grew up my neck and into my head, feeling like ten thousand tongues tickling the inside of my face. A flicker of blurriness in my right eye confirmed my assumption and unspoken prayer: my sweetheart would share with me the gift The Universe had given him. 

An intense sensation of suction and a loss of depth perception caused me to swoon forward, but my sweethearts grip on my body ensured I remained upright. My ears itched almost unbearably and I heard crackling and stretching sounds as the little roots reconfigured and augmented my anatomy. Moments later, I understood my sweethearts words. I understood my sweethearts buzzing. My right eye, its pupil devouring the iris as it glared inside the mind which fed it, fixed itself on the sights inside while my visual cortex struggled to correlate the images of the outside word and the multiverse within me.

My sweetheart buzzed, and I found myself buzzing back. We effortlessly shared ideas and concepts and experiences in cascades of autoharmonic exchanges; his perspective of solipsistic mind-gazing melding with my half-world, half-mind dichotomy to create something new. Something blissful. 

The Universe, in Her endless beneficence and gentle guidance, has directed us to bring the world into our new relationship. This account of our transformation is designed to serve as an invitation. 

See us. Look upon the newness of flesh qua flesh, mind qua mind. Know you no longer need to be content with staring into space - into blankness - with no hope of seeing the richness of existence. We are here to bring hope. If these words seem insignificant, see us. If these words seem ineffectual, see us. 

We, for the first time, have seen us. Us as individuals - now us as one. The bleakness before our old eyes was an outward-facing abyss of loneliness and uncertainty. Now we see everything. We feel everything. And there is so much more to see. So much more to feel.

Please, see us. See us to feel us. See us to feel us to see one another and feel one another. Show us, and yourself, what you look like on the inside. And let the countless tongues of The Universe taste our union.

	<TITLE> My Brother's Fall </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> While stationed in Iraq during operation Desert Storm, my brother, Gerald, was lost for two weeks. Officially, it was claimed he was captured by the Republican Guard and tortured before managing to escape. The condition of his body when he was found helped lend credence to the explanation. Lacerations, broken bones, and all sorts of other physical damage covered him from head to toe. 

He never recovered from the experience. He was honorably discharged from the Marine Corps after six months in a military hospital. When he was sent home, he began to display signs of Gulf War Syndrome. Years passed and his wife, Leah, cared for him as he weakened. His cognition, memory, and communication skills evaporated. Before he died last year, the brother I loved had been reduced to a gibbering husk. In his final moments, as Leah and I looked on, we were ready for his suffering end.

Then something happened, causing me to jump and Leah to gasp.

For the first time in eight years, Gerald expressed clear, articulate words: 

I fell in a hole.

He went on, his voice clear and strong, as Leah and I listened, spellbound.

Gerald had been patrolling the outskirts of a village when the ground beneath him gave way. He fell for a very long time. He landed at an angle, his right leg plunging into soft moss and dirt while his left struck a rock, shattering the femur. He couldnt believe he wasnt dead. The pain, he told us, while indescribable, took a backseat to what he saw.

Hed fallen into what he assumed was a cavern. As deep as he was, he expected to be in pitch darkness, but the cavern was anything but. Bioluminescent vines and lichen and fungi covered the walls and stalactite-studded ceiling far above. He heard water flowing somewhere nearby. 

Gerald did his best to extricate himself from the moss while trying to avoid losing consciousness from the pain of his broken leg. Some of the glowing vines which adorned the walls were very long and within his reach. He pulled himself up and out, then crawled on his belly down the small hill where hed landed, onto the main floor of the cavern. 

The floor was covered in feathers. Silvery-white and iridescent; they left streaks of dust on everything they touched, like the wings of moths. Gerald was surprised by their scent. It wasnt unpleasant. Not at all, in fact. It was warm and spicy; entirely uncharacteristic of what one would think of when hundreds, or even thousands, of feet underground.

The dust, despite its enjoyable odor, grew thick and choking as he crawled in the direction of the rushing water. He came across an ancient-looking branch, which he used to haul himself onto his healthy leg. Using the wood as a crutch, he continued to move.

The bioluminescence intensified as the cavern narrowed. The pinkish light was coming from all directions. Gerald realized its source was some kind of mold that blanketed nearly everything in the cavern. The closer he got to the water, the more mold there was. 

After walking for a few minutes, small patches of mold began falling from the ceiling like glowing snowflakes. The surreality of the cavern, the mold, and the feathers instilled a feeling of awe in Gerald, which clashed uncomfortably with the overwhelming pain in his leg and the fear that hed never find his way out.

Not long after, he reached the river. It was slow and shallow but quite wide, stretching easily a quarter-mile across. Mold flakes floated in thick clumps on its surface. No feathers, though. Whatever the rivers source was, the feathers were from elsewhere. 

He followed the river for a while. Despite the coolness of the water nearby, the cavern grew warmer. Narrower, too. The wide, tranquil river narrowed into frothing pink rapids. Gerald worried the bank would give way and hed be plunged into the rushing water. 

It did. 

He was.

For countless minutes, Gerald was carried by the current and tossed into rocks, further damaging his leg and carving lacerations all over his body. As he struggled, he glimpsed tunnels on either side of him, some too narrow for a man to crawl through, some wide enough to fit a parade of elephants. Many of the wider ones were choked with feathers, which joined him and the glowing mold clots in the turbid water.

A roar filled the air, echoing off the stone walls and ceiling and drowning out the sound of the river. Before he knew what was happening, Gerald was airborne. As he tumbled through the air, he saw the waterfall hed fallen from. He slammed into the water below and lost consciousness.

Gerald regained his senses some time later on the bank of a wide lake. He was on his back with his broken leg twisted underneath him. Screaming in agony, he didnt notice the movement nearby. Not until it was on top of him.

Something wrapped around his ankle and hauled him into the air. The lake below him shrank as he was pulled ever higher, over a ledge, and stuffed upside down into a crevice in the ceiling. 

At this point, as he told the story, Gerald began to cry. Leah held his head against her chest and did her best to console him, but his sobs were unrelenting. Gasping for breath and leaking tears, he continued to choke out words.

The view below him was no longer one of water and feathers and bioluminescent mold. The view was now one of horror and depravity.

Piles of mutilated bodies lay in writhing heaps on the floor. Some were dead, but most appeared alive. Their open mouths produced no screams, but agony was obvious in their expressions. Their wounds gaped and wept. The majority of the damage was to their backs, but many chests and bellies had been flayed and left to leak their contents onto the flailing victims trapped underneath them.

Gerald did his best to take it all in and think rationally. Craning his head and neck to look over his shoulder, he saw something massive in the distance. Something alive and moving in strange, circular patterns around a stationary central point. There was less light in this part of the cavern than where hed initially fallen. There was no bioluminescent mold covering the walls and ceiling. Even if there was, it would have been coated with blood and gore. No, the only light around him was from fire.

Innumerable torches stood inside holes bored into the stone floors and walls and ceilings. Flames gouted and flowed within their osseous confines, illuminating the killing floor of violence and torment which stretched all the way to the leviathan far behind him.

The rock in which Geralds leg was stuffed cracked. Gerald began to fall, headfirst, toward the pile of bodies a hundred feet below. He knew this was one fall he wouldnt be able to survive. As he imagined his spine splintering as his head struck the head or face of someone below, his ankle was grabbed again. The force of the grab, combined with the velocity of his fall, snapped his pelvis. The pain was immediate and unendurable. Gerald saw dark stars blooming in his vision. His consciousness waned. 

He traveled in a gray fog toward the colossus hed glimpsed while trapped. Part of him was aware of the thing which held his ankle. It was thin and tentacular; a living vine or organic cord or serpentine whip. Something he couldnt understand. He was dropped at the floor in front of the huge creature.

Whatever it was, it didnt have his attention. The fog of his semi-consciousness was burnt away by the sight of incredibly-bright white light. It was light unlike anything hed ever seen; the radiance should have been blinding, but it caused no pain at all. It didnt etch auras into his retinas like when hed glimpsed at the sun, despite being thousands of times brighter. It didnt travel, either - it was confined to one particular area. It produced no blazing heat or discomfort whatsoever. Only calming warmth. He felt overwhelming serenity as he locked his eyes on the man-sized light source.

The serene calm was punctured as tens of the organic tendrils erupted from somewhere above and raped their way into the brilliance. Gerald experienced a sense of hideous, disembodied violation, as if he were watching the assault of a loved one while feeling every moment of their pain and indignity with his own body. He cringed and retched, tears filling his eyes, as he watched the tendrils pull a man from somewhere inside the light source.

The spicy, warm smell from earlier in the day filled Geralds nostrils. The man from the light struggled against the grasp of the tendrils, his nude, muscular body completely helpless against their strength. As the man was pulled into the room with Gerald and the tendrils, Gerald gasped.

The mans back was home to a pair of enormous wings. They flapped and sent violent currents of wind across the floor, blowing dust in all directions. While the man struggled, more tendrils came down from the ceiling. With practiced meticulousness, they uprooted the appendages from the mans back. The sound of heavy shrubbery being torn from the ground filled the air. The mans face contorted into a shriek of abject, torturous agony, but he made no sound. The only noise was the nauseating tearing as the man was disfigured.

Feathers broke from the wings and floated to the ground. With one final tug, the wings were separated from his body. Their stumps leaked dark blood which puddled on the dirt floor, contrasting obscenely against the magnificence of the white light just feet away.

The man stopped struggling against the tendrils. He slumped, his muscles relaxed, and stared at the ground in front of him. A series of much thinner tendrils descended and plucked all the feathers from the wings and shuttled them away, leaving the bleeding amputations in the dirt. Another tendril whipped downward at a blinding speed, striking the mans abdomen and splitting the flesh. His intestines bulged from the wound and the tendrils holding him pulled him through the air toward the countless other bodies Id been perched above moments before.

Leah and I watched Gerald with horrified amazement as he recalled these events. We had no idea if he was telling the truth or if it was all just a manifestation of the illness which was about to take him from us. 

The three of us wept while Gerald looked around, as if trying to determine whether or not we believed him. I felt like I needed to say something, so I asked, what happened next? How did you get out? Leah nodded, encouraging him to go on.

Geralds voice dropped to a whisper.

Disoriented and in immense pain, Gerald tried to look around. The room was too big. He couldnt get a good idea of what he was seeing or where he was, but he knew he was right in front of the creature hed seen. He tried to struggle to his feet, but the injury to his hip and leg was too great. The fractured bones ground against one another and he screamed so hard he felt his lungs might burst. 

He was grabbed again. This time, by his shoulders. Two tendrils hauled him up and up and up. He saw the thing in front of him. The colossus. The leviathan. The serpent. The head of an impossibly large snake bulged at the apex of a body of thick trunks. Each trunk had bifurcated into a series of thinner trunks. Each thinner trunk had bifurcated into a series of tendrils. Each series of tendrils had bifurcated into more, thinner tendrils. And so on.

The thick, spicy odor filled the area again. He knew it meant more wings were being destroyed. The snake stared at him, its yellow eye full of hideous intelligence and unknowable age. They gazed at one another, and Gerald heard words in his head. Words that were not spoken to him, but thought at him:

Tell everyone what you saw. Tell everyone what I am. Let them know Ill be coming soon.

The next thing Gerald knew, he was on his back, staring at the unforgiving sun of the Iraqi desert. He was found by locals hours later.

Geralds whispering tapered off and he closed his eyes. I was terrified hed passed away. Leah shook him and said his name a few times, panic rising in her voice. Geralds eyes opened. His lips parted.

The serpent, Gerald whispered. He coughed and stared at the ceiling, a tear trickling from the corner of his eye.

...was wrapped around a tree. The tree was filled with apples. Millions upon millions of them.

Leah clutched his hand and I held his shoulder.

I watched as tiny snakes crawled into the ripest ones. Pieces of him. Then the apples disappeared. They went into a hole in the air. And I could see what was on the other side of the holes. Orchards. Trees all over the world. His apples are filling them.

His eyes fluttered closed and he breathed the last words wed ever hear him speak.

Weve been eating them for millennia. Hes inside us all.

	<TEXT> We couldnt have asked for a more beautiful day at the beach. I smiled while I kept an eye on the kids. It was obvious that Ryans arm was getting tired. His two sisters, Madison and Regina, were looking around for things that might be able to help him out.

While I watched, Madison trawled for seaweed. She noticed Ryan was uncomfortable and tried to rush. Luckily for her brother, the pressure pushing against his arm had diminished and he was able to straighten up. Hurry up!, he yelled to Madison and Regina. Hes by far the most impatient one in the family. 

Dont yell at your sisters, I scolded. Still, I gently encouraged them to move faster. Part of me was wondering if my wife had used enough sunscreen on them.

Time is a factor, kids, I informed them. We were on a pretty tight schedule.

Madison brought the seaweed over to Ryan while Regina was arriving with a few heavy rocks. Regina set them down in front of where her brother was standing. She went back a few times and carried over more. Madison crouched, her butt in the water, and focused on slipping the seaweed underneath and around the rocks.

I stood, hands on my hips, and called out, How does it look, kids?

I think were done!, shouted Madison. She seemed proud of all the work theyd been doing. Shes never been particularly modest.

I looked back up the beach and all around. Then I strode out to where my kids had been working.

You all did SUCH a great job! I grabbed the three kids in a bear hug and they stood, watching as the tide came in over the area where theyd done their good work.

We walked together about a hundred feet down the beach and stood on the shore. It was time for me to give them their little quiz.

Now remember kids, Mom will be back in a few minutes. What do we do when we see her coming?

Regina piped up. We pretend cry and look around in the water!

Thats right! How about you, Ryan, what are you going to say?

Ryan stood proudly with his hands on his hips. I say that Jason fell out of my hug into the ocean when a wave came and we cant find him.

Atta boy!, I crowed. I turned to Madison. Maddie, are you excited to have your bedroom all to yourself again? No more crib and no more crying?

Madison smiled shyly at her tall, strong father. Yes Daddy, she said.

Good!, I exclaimed, grinning. And now your mom and I can have more money to buy you guys presents for being such great kids. I glanced over to my left. And I think that person walking waaaaay down the beach is Mom. You all ready?

Yeah!, the kids yelled in unison.

Go for it!, I encouraged, blinking away the tears of pride that had started to well up in my eyes.

	<TEXT> Im surrounded by corpses. People I knew. People I cared about. For hours, I sat in the stillness of this supermarket-cum-abattoir and waited. The growls and groans outside waxed and waned as each wave passed by. Waves of former friends. Waves of strangers who I never had the opportunity to befriend. Limitless potential gnawed away by the ravages of plague. 

After some time, the movement started. Bodies. Body parts. It didnt matter. That which was once animated got reanimated. A severed head blinked and opened its mouth. A puddle of viscera convulsed in peristaltic spasms. A pile of fingertips and toes wiggled. And corpses, more-or-less whole, stood.

Dylan began to squirm in my lap, still leaking. His bleating, which had been cut off by his father 80 minutes ago, resumed. It was lower. More guttural. The optic nerve protruding from his left eye socket slapped wetly against his soft cheek. My boy was awake, and my last act as his mother would be to feed him. Its what I was here for, no matter the shape he was in. I put my thumb in his mouth and waited for his few, sharp little teeth to sink in.

His cool tongue prodded at the digit. But his jaw didnt close. He didnt bite. I spoke to him, encouraging him to go ahead. He shook his head and tried to spit out my thumb. I persisted. Dylan vomited a pink froth of blood and breast milk onto my hand. Still, nothing.

Three of the reanimated bodies had started lurching toward us. I knew if Dylan wasnt going to be the one to change me, they would. But theyd tear me to shreds. Just like the others had done to his father while I was locked in the bathroom. I started to panic. I didnt want to be torn apart and have Dylan left alone to squirm pathetically on the supermarket floor forever.

The three were practically on top of us. Id failed. Their teeth were coming. An image of Dylan struggling in the dried tangle of my twitching entrails six months from now brought an involuntary sob. I begged him to bite me. He just growled and choked.

The first one moved in to bite. Then he stopped. He stared at me, teeth snapping together over and over, drooling shards of enamel and blood and saliva onto my shoulder. The other two did the same. Then they turned around and walked away. Nothing. They didnt want me.

A surge of relief combined with confusion and sadness. My boy didnt want me, either. No one did.

Time went by and waves of fresh dead entered the supermarket. They inspected me, and, like the others, rejected me. I gave up on trying to make Dylan bite. Hed never eaten anything that solid before in his life. I knew it was useless. He seemed content to thrash and flail and leak and cool. 

During the quiet moments between waves, I heard soft crying. I knew who it was. As I was running out of the bathroom after the initial attack to check on Dylan and my husband, I saw a young store employee shutting herself in a small closet near the floral department.

Dylan drooled and moved his jaw as the sounds of the teenager met his ears. It had been hours since hed eaten. It was then I realized what I had to do. Its what any mom would do for her son.

A couple minutes later, I had control of her. She was easy enough to knock unconscious. Easy enough to tie up. But I knew if she changed, Dylan wouldnt want to eat any more. 

She yelled very loudly as I cut off a piece of her calf. I placed it in Dylans mouth. He tried to chew, but it was just too cumbersome. He wasnt used to something that solid. I sighed and gazed into my sons eye. I took the chunk from his mouth and cut off a fresh piece.

After Id chewed and spit it into his mouth, I could swear he smiled at me. And that was when I knew our mom/son connection wasnt broken. Even though the rest of the world didnt want me, Dylan still did. Thats the only thing that matters.

	<TITLE> House Sounds </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-04 19:17:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Carol heard it first and woke me up. She told me to listen. Then I heard it. Bumping and scraping. Shuffling and clattering. I turned on the light. The sounds stopped.

It was still our first month in the new house. By new, I mean new to us. It was quite old; over 100 years. Like any old house, it had its share of creaking and groaning, but wed grown used to all that after the first couple weeks. These sounds were new. Unfamiliar. Unsettling.

We listened in silence for a few minutes. Nothing. Carol flipped on the TV and we watched Chopped! for a little while before getting tired enough to go back to sleep. And we did.

The next morning, a Saturday, which was supposed to be a day for yard work, was spent sealing all the visible cracks and holes around the baseboards and windows. Carols concern, which I echoed, was a vermin infestation. Rats were a problem for some of the houses in the area. Our neighbor, a strange, elderly fellow named Herman, had mentioned an opossum infestation in his barn in the 1990s. Just the cost of rural living, he proclaimed, before regaling us with the details of how he dispatched them all in the course of an afternoon with a pitchfork. 

I made a trip to the hardware store and picked up a few rat traps. Nothing major; just enough to put in the basement and in a few other areas we thought they might traverse. Over the next week, when we heard those strange sounds again, we just assumed we were dealing with rats. We were a little grossed out, but the concern was mostly gone. Their days were numbered. It was only when the traps remained untouched that we started to feel a little uneasy.

During a particularly bad, sleepless night, when the bumping and shuffling sounds went on for hours and Id gotten out of bed and walked all around the house trying to find the source, I was frustrated and exhausted. Id traced the loudest of the noises to a closet in the hallway. Hoping to scare the rats into shutting up, I pounded on the closets interior wall. When my fist struck the old board, the board next to it fell out. Scared the hell out of me. 

Expecting rats to start scurrying toward me, I grabbed the board and got ready to beat as many to death as I could. No rats came. But the sounds had stopped. There was only the soft din of whatever TV show Carol was watching in the bedroom. I was getting ready to replace the board when I saw something on the ground behind where the piece had fallen out. I picked it up. A scrap of newspaper with the headline: *Another Infant Missing: 17th in 10 months.* It was dated March 3rd, 1933.

I shuddered and shoved the scrap in my pajama pocket. Of all the things the rats could use to make their nests, it had to be something so morbid. As I started to replace the board, the sound resumed. This time, it was far louder than ever. The bumps shook the house and a clattering like a thousand rattlesnakes filled the air. The power cut out. Upstairs, Carol hollered. I ignored her. Something else had grabbed my attention.

After the first, violent bump, before the lights went out, I saw the two adjacent boards in the closet had fallen away. They revealed a much larger space behind the closet than Id thought. 

I felt my way to the kitchen and grabbed a flashlight out of the drawer. I flipped it on and jumped a mile when I saw Carol standing across the room. She looked frightened and annoyed. I grabbed her hand and we marched to the hall closet. The rattling persisted. 

We peered into the hidden compartment and followed the beam of the flashlight. Something on the floor glinted back. I started to squeeze between the boards to get closer. Carol grabbed my arm and told me not to go in. I shook her off. I made my way inside and saw something bizarre: a metallic, glittery wand and a very large tiara - way too big for a child. A piece of cloth was underneath. I picked it up and shook away the dust. The letters TF were emblazoned across it in garish, cartoonish cursive.

The rattling grew deafening. I turned around and saw Carol holding her ears and crying. I aimed the flashlight around the rest of the space. A large bucket sat in the corner. The two steps it took to reach it only served to increase the amplitude of the noise. As soon as I pointed the flashlight beam inside it, the sound stopped. The bucket trembled in the yellowish light.

Inside were more newspaper clippings with equally disturbing headlines. More missing infants. The more I pulled out and read, the numbers kept rising. The last one said 88. December 12th, 1941. There was a thick piece of cardstock under them. I lifted it and uncovered more pieces of paper. They were different. Handwritten. Just numbers and dates and what looked like prices:

*4/4/39 - 3 - $30*  
*6/23/45 - 10 - $95*  
*10/1/46 - 2 - $25*


And so on. There were lots of these. Receipts, I assumed. Carol had entered the room and stood next to me, clutching my arm. Under the receipts was another piece of cardstock. I lifted it away and uncovered a few handfuls of little pebbles or seashells. Sticking out of them was a small, colorful placard with the same cursive as the cloth. We read it together. Carol screamed and I felt faint. Right then, I knew what the TF meant on the cloth. Cloth that had been, I realized, a cape.

I dropped the placard back in the bucket. The contents rattled. In bright, pink, handpainted letters, the words stared back up at us.

*For sale: baby teeth. Never used.*

All my life, Ive been obsessed with symmetry. Ive sought it in all aspects of my life: physical, emotional, and spiritual. Its what called me to astronomy and cosmology; I felt an intense need to learn if the system of which we are all part is symmetrical. Ordered. Beautiful.

My career has been fascinating and fruitful. The discoveries made by fellow scientists all over the world have allowed us to create model after model of the universe with ever-increasing detail. Weve learned what things are and how theyve come to be. Weve seen heavenly events occur and have determined their causal chains. Action, just like wed come to expect, will have an equal, but opposite, reaction. 

Except when it doesnt. To account for those exceptions, weve employed elaborate, explanatory formulae to make things work - to make things ordered. For most people, its good enough. It gets things to fit into their epistemic worldviews. My epistemology isnt amenable to that kind of hand-waving. I recognize scientific discoveries are made on the backs of those which came before. I know exceptions need to be made; rules are created or modified all the time in the face of new evidence. But not in the face of what sits within Eridanus. Eridanus is where epistemology goes to die.

In 2001, our team received the first trickle of information from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe. Over the following days, the trickle became a torrent. We worked tirelessly and with boundless enthusiasm as previously-secret aspects of our universe were unveiled. Months of steady research passed. An unsettling trend began to grow from the data.

An area inside Eridanus was cold. Beyond cold. Certain spots were a full 140 K colder than the Cosmic Microwave Background. This discovery, and subsequent verification by the Planck spacecraft in 2009, upended previously-held theories about large-scale structures in the universe. Much was reported about the size and temperature of the CMB Cold Spot; speculation ran rampant and talking points about parallel universes and remnants of a phase change from the early universe circulated throughout all the science tabloids.

But the speculators didnt have all the information. A key detail was withheld from the public. For the last 15 years, that detail remained hidden behind firewalls and locked inside the minds of brilliant, terrified astronomers and cosmologists. The colossal void within Eridanus - the CMB Cold Spot - has something at its center. Something impossible. Something that has been leaking a relativistic stream of unknown radiation in a narrow band directly at Earth. Now, a decade and a half after its discovery, weve learned the radiation is structured. Patterned. Predictable. 

Aat Narkhirunkanok, the first of us to recognize a pattern, wrote a short note detailing what hed discovered. It was found next to his body, on the passenger seat of his car, which had been running in his closed garage while the rest of his family slept. He also left a USB drive.

The remaining team and I, propelled more by fear than curiosity, each read the note. It was a description of a type of filter to be applied to the data gathered by the WMAP and the Planck spacecraft. The USB drive contained the filter Aat had coded before taking his own life. 

In his note, Aat wrote that hed run the filter on a tiny sample of data on his home computer. It was all he needed to see. But we needed to see more. We filtered the entire dataset on our cluster. At the end of the filtering process, Aat had created an algorithm to convert the filtered data into a video. After hours of CPU time, the familiar traffic-cone icon of a VLC file sat on the desktop.

I asked my two team members if they wanted to see what the file contained. They were both acutely aware of the terrible and unpredictable action the data had caused Aat to take, but inquisitiveness overtook their caution. We gathered around the main screen and watched. I double clicked the VLC file.

A video opened showing a three-dimensional ovoid containing countless galaxies. It was a model of the universe, only vastly more sophisticated than anything wed ever used. The model zoomed inward, and as galaxies sharpened into individual stars, the Eridanus constellation came into view. False color filled the screen, indicating radiation. The Cold Spot was clearly visible. 

The view focused on the void and zoomed toward its dark center. The first thing we noticed was a thin, straight line of bright radiation emanating from an unknown point in the middle. It had to be the band the pattern had arrived on. The view continued inward, and a gray spot appeared in the blackness. A sensation of dread began to prickle the hair on my neck and arms. 

The gray spot grew to fill the screen. It was moving. It lurched and convulsed in place, rippling and pinching - sometimes pinching so severely in its center that it looked as if it would split, only to twist back on itself. I felt intense nausea as I watched. Parts of the things exterior went transparent, providing a view of the shifting geometry contained within. 

Rings formed all over the shape and its interior pushed through, then reversed and collapsed into another point we could see through the invisible exterior wall. I closed my eyes as cold sweat poured from my face and my mouth dried up. I heard Gita crying next to me and John, who was behind me, gasped. I opened my eyes and saw the view zooming out dramatically. 

As individual stars gave way to galaxies and galaxies gave way to galactic clusters, we saw a very different model of the universe than wed originally been given. It was dimmer. Vastly colder. Holes of pure void had consumed entire swaths of galaxies. At my side, Gita screamed. I didnt move my eyes from the screen. I watched as the remaining galactic light in the model began to shift and undulate. It pinched at the center like an hourglass. Gita screamed again and grabbed my arm. 

I shrugged her off and watched the left half of the hourglass instantaneously suck into the right half. Twice the galactic density, half the size. This new model pinched again, and the process repeated. And again. And again. Gita pulled me by the hair but I pushed her away. All that remained was a single point of light containing everything. All the stars. All the mass. The view zoomed in while Gita sobbed, and I saw, next to the pinprick of light, the gray thing. Its exterior grew transparent again and repulsive, impossible geometries writhed within its shifting, asymmetrical bulk. The pinprick moved toward it. I blinked, and it was gone. The gray thing was still. The video ended.

I turned toward my crying colleague and realized what shed been trying to get me to see. John sat limply in his chair with a pen pushed through his left carotid artery and a pencil through his right. His bloody hands were folded in his lap. His expression was one of abject terror.

The phone rang. I answered, barely comprehending what the person on the other line said. I asked them to repeat themselves, and they did. It was an observatory in Europe that had been studying the structure of the CMB Cold Spot. They were going to send us new findings on old data they wanted us to analyze. According to the voice on the other line, their most recent analysis Cold Spot had yielded entirely new results. They had no idea how such a change could have occurred, but every point of data was in agreement: The CMB Cold Spot had doubled in size.

	<TEXT> The visual effect of geometry in art can be intoxicating. Symmetry is beauty, and vice versa. I remember looking at myself in the mirror and seeing asymmetry. Chaos. A shape, certainly, but not one of mathematical precision or artistic effort. Rather, one of slothful neglect. The product of a blind, talentless sculptor using mud instead of marble. I decided to change. I could be beautiful, too.

Everywhere I went, I looked for inspiration. After a brief period of searching, Nature Herself provided me with all I needed. I knew what I could become.

I began to lose the extra weight Id been carrying around. It wasnt as difficult as Id expected. The speed at which the pounds came off became an added bonus; I was left with skin that sagged over my beltline and under my chin and under my arms. A happy accident.

With 60 pounds lost and a newfound energy I attributed to better physical health, I began to work on my art. Over the last few months, Id accumulated thousands of the different tools Id need for the process. I employed the smallest ones first. One by one, I inserted the thinnest of the pins into the pores under my chin. The pain was surprisingly mild; Id expected my nerves to put up more of a fight. Knowing my body was so accepting of this change made me smile. I was a blank canvas with unlimited potential.

I slept soundly with the hundreds of metal pieces occupying the saggy flesh. Each one was stretching the pore. Each one was making room for the next tool. 

The following day, I swapped the first set of pins for the next, slightly-wider set. Again, there was little pain. I twisted each of the pieces around in lazy circles, allowing the motion to widen the spaces in which theyd been set. When I removed one of them to see if I was making any progress, the little hole stayed open. It was working.

Days went by as I repeated the process with wider and wider pins or needles. I was grateful for the loose skin. There was so much more room to work. After three weeks, the holes were the diameter of a pencil eraser. After two months, they were as wide as my pinky finger is thick. Id reached the maximum size of my tools. It didnt matter; I was done. I pulled the skin down to expose the holes. There were hundreds of dark, bloodless pits occupying the pores.

Id never walked around the house with the holes exposed until that moment. The sensation of air against the nerves inside was indescribable. It was as if Id grown a whole new body part that was feeling for the first time. How much more of me was trapped beneath the surface, deep in slumber, waiting to be awakened? I would have to wait to find out. There was so much left to do.

Mother Nature, in Her wisdom and beauty, had presented me with a wasps nest on the day I sought inspiration. I remember studying its pockmarked surface, each hole a beautiful, hexagonal prism. When I returned to the nest, itd grown larger. Id planned for this, though. I used smoke to nullify the majority of the adults as I took their home with me. Once there, I carefully cut the nest in half. The few angry wasps that remained were destroyed. I was after their children. 

With great care, I smeared small bits of honey inside each of my new holes. Everything Id read told me how much they loved it. Once the interiors were coated, I used a tweezers to tease the larval wasps from the papery cavities. They fit inside me so perfectly. Hours later, I was finished. I felt full. Every so often, one of them would wiggle inside. Pressed against the sensitive flesh within the pore, it was like the larvae were tickling me. I sat back and watched myself in the mirror, giggling as I admired the work of functional art I was becoming.

Id have to wait nearly two weeks for the larvae to start spinning silk for their metamorphoses. I dutifully fed them honey as they grew fatter and more active, feeling them stretching the pores beyond the diameter to which Id grown accustomed. The pain, while greater than Id experienced before then, was still hardly a concern. It was all worth it.

While I waited, I studied my body to find the site for my next project. My belly was the most obvious, as it was the largest area and had the most loose skin, so it was what I chose. I didnt want to use wasps again, though. If I was going to be a true piece of art, I wasnt going to only use one subject. I found a picture of a beautiful frog that kept its eggs inside holes in its back. When they hatched, left behind a lovely, cratered surface. I was overcome by the beauty of it all and decided the frog would be my next featured piece.

I rushed to create the holes in my belly. In a burst of creative inspiration, I included my chest and the skin under my arms. Because of my excitement, I started with much thicker needles than Id used on my chin. The pain was intense and blood poured from the sites, but the holes appeared quickly. After weeks spent dealing with complications and having to stretch cavities whose diameter decreased as the swelling and infection surrounding it increased, I felt the little cocoons in my neck start to hum. The larvae had spun their silk and sealed off their little homes many days ago. They were changing. So was I.

More days flew by as I grappled with the reality of how I wouldnt be able to find the frogs in time before the new holes swelled to the point of being nearly shut. I was depressed for a day or so, but its curtain was lifted whenever the babies inside my throat hummed to me. During a particularly dark period of sadness, I noticed flies were landing in the areas of my body thatd been overcome by putrefaction. Id given up my hope of featuring another piece of beautiful art and was taking consolation in the fact my throat and neck looked so lovely. So fertile.

As the flies gathered, though, I realized what they were doing. I pushed my fingers into the holes and pried them open. Deep within, writhing in the sludge at the bottom of each cavity, were tiny maggots. As tears ran down my eyes, I rushed to the mirror. The openings, while ugly, were still in a clean, symmetrical pattern. Was it all exactly what Id intended? No. But was it better? There was no doubt. Not all art has to be perfect.

While I stared at my reflection, wondering what I could do next, I felt one of the cocoons hatching in my neck. Then another. And another. Joy overwhelmed me. I was giving birth. It was then I realized I wasnt only an artist, but a parent. A true contributor of beauty to the world. My art hadnt only imitated life - my art had created it.

	<TEXT> I pulled the charger out of my iPhone and a string of viscous fluid stretched between the charging tip and the opening in the phone. To say I was irritated was an understatement. Id just bought the thing.

There was a small pool of clear liquid on the table where itd been charging. I touched my finger to it and sniffed. There wasnt much of a scent. I tasted it. Salty. The worst possible scenario. Saltwater destroys electronics. I had no idea what I couldve spilled.

The screen was off and the power button wasnt responding. I brought the phone into the bathroom and aimed the hairdryer into the charging port, being careful not burn anything. When it was as dry as it was going to get, I tried to power it up again. It worked. 

I thought about bringing the phone back to Apple, but I knew they wouldnt do anything. Theyve gotten good at knowing when a device has been damaged by water. I wasnt in the mood to get into a fight at the Genius Bar.

The day went on and my phone seemed no worse for wear. I made calls and played games and browsed Reddit without any issue. Before going to bed, I plugged it in to charge.

The following morning, when the phones alarm went off and I leaned over to hit snooze, my hand slid into a puddle of warm fluid. Cursing, I grabbed the phone and was about to pull out the charger when I stopped. Instead of my lock screen or the iOS icons, something that looked like a screensaver was running. Colors were flowing in weird, peristaltic undulations from the top of the screen, intensifying and darkening as they got closer to the bottom. It was actually quite pretty.

I heard a sound coming from the speaker. Being careful not to get any of the fluid on my face, I put it to my ear. Bizarre waves of warm static were being played in rhythm with the motion of the colors on the display. The waves of static were picking up speed. So were the colors. As I watched with a combination of fascination and annoyance, the static became staccato and the colors blinked faster and faster before culminating in a bright flash and a burst of static. 

The phone had to have a virus or some kind of malware. Still, that didnt explain the liquid. Id made sure the table was dry before plugging the phone in the night before. I pulled the cable out. A gush of clear, sticky stuff drooled from the port onto my chest. Its smell was stronger than the day before. I gagged and got out of bed.

I used the hairdryer on my phone again. It was back to working normally. Opting to go with the virus/malware theory and not wanting to think about the liquid other than how badly I wanted to get it off me, I used a different cable to connect the phone into my laptop so I could do a complete software restoration. I went into iTunes, clicked the necessary things, and went to shower. The fluid had dried into a disgusting, gummy syrup thatd caused my chest hair to stick together.

I was in the shower for 45 minutes trying to pull all the rubber-cement-like stuff off me. As soon as I turned off the water, I heard something from outside the bathroom. I wrapped a towel around my waist and headed toward the sound. It was similar to the static Id heard before, but now it was coming from two sources: the phone and the laptop. As I got closer, I saw colors on both screens.

The colors and sounds were synched up again, but the two devices were playing off each other. The sounds on the laptop affected the colors on the phone, and vice versa. I sat on the couch in front of the devices and watched. Then stared. Then gazed. Right at that moment, there was nothing else on Earth I wanted to see more. 

I saw it all. I felt something, too. But the feeling was tangential. Indirect. As the moment of bliss passed, emptiness and a need for more bloomed within me. From the bloom came a realization.

I tore myself from the screens and rummaged through the drawers that held all my spare electronics. Cables, USB hubs, network switches, etc. I took them all.

Returning to my position in front of the screens and fixing my eyes on the waxing and waning undulations, I noticed that same fluid beginning to dribble from the USB port in the laptop as well as the charging port in the phone. Colors swam in my vision as I inspected the other USB ports on the other side of the computer as hope flooded my chest. Then I saw it. My hope was not misplaced.

The ports on the other side of the laptop were dripping. They were ready. I took one of the USB cords I had in my hand and carefully teased it inside the waiting port. On right side of the laptop screen, which I knew corresponded with the port Id just entered, a hazy, pink semicircle began to brighten the edge of the display. 

With my eyes fixed on the warm pink and my ears serenaded by each peak and trough of gentle static, I brought the other end of the USB cable to my lips.

As the metal touched my flesh, a tiny shock passed through me. It was not unpleasant. Quite the contrary; it was enticing. Attention-getting. And indeed, it had my full attention. I traced the plug around the bow of my lips, savoring the gentle, constant prickling. My mouth watered as the pink spot grew and pulsed onscreen. 

My tongue flicked the tip of the plug. Its touch was met by a drop of liquid. I closed my eyes and focused only the sounds and the feeling on my lips and tongue. The metal was so warm - almost hot. Almost burning. More liquid seeped out of the plug. It was slick and salty. My heart was pounding in my ribcage while I drew wet lines across my lips before taking the plug into my mouth in its entirety. The volume of static coming from the laptop intensified.

Time disappeared as I savored what was inside me, not caring about anything except the flow of the static and the pulse of light on the other side of my closed eyelids. My tongue and lips worked and, accompanying a burst of static and a blast of pure, white light, my mouth was filled. 

I opened my eyes and parted my lips, letting the fluid drool down my chin onto my bare chest. This time, I wanted it on me. I wanted it to dry there. I wanted it to be the mark of this experience. I didnt want it to end.

The display on the laptop had changed. The waves and semicircles were still there, but the unmistakable shape of a person was being formed through different colors and wave patterns. On that shape were warm circles. I knew they meant.

Time went by and I put the hubs and switches and cords to use. The Thunderbolt cable was for my mouth. Mini USB plugs, with the aid of their lubrication, slipped underneath each eyelid. The Apple lightning connector fit into my urethra as if it had been built for that purpose; its length disappearing into me until there was no more left to go further. Multiple RJ-45 cords, thanks to an 8-port switch, nestled comfortably inside my rectum. My ears, of course, played home to the creamy white headphones while my nostrils and sinuses were packed with micro USB connectors. For the first time, I knew what it was like to be filled.

Colors and static burst from the laptop and my body hummed with electricity and incomprehensible bliss. During an infinitesimal moment of lucidity, I realized the sun was going down. During another, I noticed it was dawn. Then, with a burst of fluid and noise and brightness, it was over. And I felt empty. So, terribly empty.

Its three hours since that transcendental experience. The phone and laptop continued their dance, but I was no longer part of it. Everything inside me felt weak and useless. Everything, that is, except one part. 

An hour ago, at the peak of my despair, I made a small cut on my chest and pushed a micro USB plug inside. Right away, more circles appeared on the body shape onscreen. Lots more. I knew what I needed to do.

Ive spent this last hour slicing and inserting every cable I own into myself. My soft palate has been cored out and stuffed with Lightning cables. Ive invaginated my navel and filled it with ethernet cords and an HDMI cable. Inserted in the meat between my fingers and toes are the twisted pairs of ethernet cords I unbraided. I filled everything I could until I had nothing left to use. And I hope its enough.

I can feel the cords lubricating themselves inside me and the background of the screen as I type is a blur of warm pink and other, melting pastels. My vision is dimming and I know Ive lost too much blood to write much longer. Thats okay, though. Im done. Read this and know Ive met something else. Something much better than any person. Know were going to be together. Connected. And I pray some of you get to experience this yourselves someday. Youll never want anything else again.

	<TEXT> Stay away from the Olympics in Rio. Dont believe anything the officials are telling you. The filthy water is only a tiny part of it. Even the Zika virus is a tiny part. Theyre all pieces of a much larger whole thats more disturbing and horrible than anything I believed could exist. 

Im not some corporate whistleblower or disaffected government employee. I sell sports equipment. My company is one of the many allowed to sell our stuff in and around the Olympic venues. From the moment we arrived, though, we could tell something was amiss.

We expected security to be high. Everyone knows the Olympics is a high-value target for both international terrorists and local gangs. We expected checkpoints and frisking and all the other trademark procedures of a well-run operation. 

Our expectations were...off.

The security was draconian. Upon our arrival, we were strip searched. Cheek swabs were taken. Our luggage and cargo were poured out and pored over. It was pointless to argue. When we left the airport, soldiers with RPGs stood guard on every corner. Tanks were blocking some streets. Helicopters swarmed overhead. When we met up with our local guide, Julia, I asked her if something had happened or if someone had made a threat. She said no; itd been like this since the beginning.

We made our way across the city and eventually reached our hotel. It was quite decent, save for one major issue. If youve seen pictures of Rio, you may have noticed the stark contrast between rich and poor, with wealthy, highly-developed areas sitting literally next door to the most hideous poverty. While my room was clean and modern and the amenities were equivalent to those in any US hotel, the view from my room was of the favelas. I was sitting in my comfortable, air-conditioned room just 20 feet away from people who had almost nothing.

Julia, as it turned out, grew up in the neighborhood that my room overlooked. She knew the area quite well and even suggested we go there for dinner later in the evening. My business partner, Oliver, agreed. The other person wed brought with us, Michelle, who was in charge of our social media and web stuff, declined. She was exhausted.

After a nap frequently interrupted by the window-rattling passes of military helicopters, Julia collected me and Oliver and we headed into her old neighborhood.

Right away, Julia knew something was wrong. The streets, which should have been teeming with vendors and children, were empty. People sat in their homes or businesses, looking out the windows at us. We didnt say much as we made our way to the restaurant. 

We got there a few minutes later. It was tiny. Oliver said it looked like a kitchen in someones house. Thats because it is, Julia informed him. She chatted in Portuguese with the owner, Bethe, who was visibly pregnant and looked extremely hot and uncomfortable. 

Neither Oliver nor I speak a word of Portuguese. Still, we noticed they were repeating the same words and phrases. *Homem gordo* and *meninos*. I did a quick check in my pocket Portuguese-to-English dictionary, since there was no cell service to ask Google. Fat Man and Little Boy. I found that extremely bizarre, considering those were the names of the atomic bombs we dropped on Japan.

Julia and Bethe talked and talked while Bethes teenage daughter prepared our food. I have no idea what it was, but it was delicious. Julia didnt try to translate anything we were saying to Bethe, and Bethe didnt seem to care. Her discomfort was obvious. I found myself wanting to leave. Behind Bethes constant shifting of her weight and wiping of her brow, an element of fear lurked. Its difficult to explain, but its something anyone would know if they saw it. Bethe was afraid of whatever Fat Man and Little Boy were. 

After 90 minutes, we left. Before we could reach the hotel, there was a muffled explosion somewhere to our left. We all jumped. We stood there for a minute, then a mist of warm, putrid water rained down on us. It had to have been from the river the next block over. The same river Olympians would be using to compete in a few weeks. 

There was another, smaller explosion, followed by the sound of automatic rifle fire. Oliver and I were near panic, thinking we were under some kind of attack. Julia, though, just said its okay - its almost over. And she was right. 

The gunfire tapered off. We heard yelling coming from the direction of the explosions. Julia turned toward us.

Do you want to see one?

See what?, I asked.

Come on. Hurry.

We followed Julia without wanting to. A soldier with an RPG and two with M16s were standing on a small bridge spanning the river. Another one was taking something from the back of their truck. A heavy-duty fishing net.

The one with the RPG yelled something in our direction, but splashing from below redirected his attention. We reached the guardrail on the side of the road and looked down. 

What the fuck?, Oliver muttered, more to himself than to us.

A veiny, semicircular, diaphanous film covered the area below the bridge. It was riddled with bullet holes. At its center was a thick mass that looked like it had been severely burned. The whole thing twitched weakly, prompting another barrage of rifle fire. The twitching slowed, but didnt stop. 

The man with the RPG yelled at us again. Julia yelled back and the soldier just shook his head and didnt bother us again. The four of them lowered the net into the water and tried to scoop up what theyd been attacking.

It took a few tries, but they succeeded and started pulling it from the river. More of its body became visible as it left the water. Under the film were two long stalks which converged into one, thick piece. Another two stalks emerged, along with a bulb in the middle. I gasped.

The thing attached to the film was shaped like a person. At the peak of the torso was a wrinkled, microcephalic head. We could hear it making gurgling sounds as it was hauled over the edge of the bridge onto the road.

Julia grabbed us and walked quickly toward the bridge. Watch this, she demanded. We did. The soldiers looked at us with disgust, then one of them placed his rifle against the small, misshapen head. One shot rang out. All its twitching stopped. From the hole, a thick stream of smoke drifted into the sky.

No. Not smoke.

As the soldiers wrapped up the carcass and threw it in the back of the truck, I realized what was pouring from its head even after itd been bagged, causing the plastic to bulge from the pressure.

Mosquitos.

*Um menino*, Julia whispered.

Pokemon Go is a fun game when you dont live in an area devastated by industrial contamination and toxic waste. Pokemon Go is a fun game when the Poke Stops arent at local landmarks steeped in mercury and lead. Pokemon Go is a fun game when innocent gamers dont congregate in areas where the grass no longer grows because of carbon tetrachloride and dioxin and radionuclides in the soil.

For the kids in this city - and even for the adults in this city - Pokemon Go should be the kind of game to help them through the hell of their day-to-day lives. It should be a distraction from the omnipresent horror of living in a place thats no longer on anyones map - a place that the outside world thinks is better off forgotten. If only playing it wasnt killing them.

At the community hospital where I work, weve had a substantial increase in the number of patients displaying some effect of being poisoned: skin deterioration, pregnancy complications, respiratory distress, etc. - all consistent with the various environmental pollutants in different parts of town. Nearly all of those admitted have been Pokemon Go players. 

Our city council had a meeting with officials from the police and fire departments, hoping figure out a way to keep those dangerous locations off limits to visitors. Lots of ideas were floated, but they all got shot down. The city has no money to erect barriers or police the areas. Theres simply far too many of them. 

Signs started to go up. That was the one thing everyone on the council could agree on. The signs explicitly mentioned Pokemon Go and featured the frightening biohazard and radiation warning symbols. 

No one was deterred. The poisonings continued.

Id never played Pokemon in my life. I didnt know anything about it. As more and more people started to show up at the hospital, though, I got the impression I should get at least a basic grasp on what everyone was obsessed with. So, when I got home, I downloaded the app.

Right away, three of them showed up in my living room. I tapped a turtle-looking one and threw a ball at it. It was mine. Pretty cool, actually. Simple mechanics. There was a radar thing on the bottom right and three pawprints under silhouettes of other Pokemon I hadnt seen yet. I didnt have any idea where the things were in relation to me, and it seemed stupid that the radar was so worthless, but as I walked around, Id eventually run into one. Not one on the radar, mind you, but still one I hadnt seen before.

I started to understand why people enjoyed the game so much. I found myself wishing the residential areas had more Pokemon to catch. When I zoomed my map all the way out, in the distance, I could see those spinning blue towers - many of which were shooting out pink confetti. From what Id read online, thats where all the good Pokemon were. 

Its also where all the industrial contamination was.

When I got to work the next day, I was shocked to find one of those blue towers in the hospital. When I clicked it, the little blurb said it was in the childrens wing. I never go on that side of the building, but I figured what the hell and walked over. Once I was in range, I spun the wheel and all this stuff popped out: balls, potions, and even an egg! It said 10km on it. I threw the thing in my incubator, knowing itd probably hatch at some point on my shift. I do tons of walking.

Halfway through my day of walking up and down the labyrinthine halls, I checked my phone. Less than .4km. God damn it. A familiar alarm sounded and I rushed to the ER. Before I saw what had happened, I could smell it.

A group of teenagers had jumped the fence of the old battery factory. Apparently there are three Poke Stops inside, two of which are overlapping. The third, though, is inaccessible unless you go through the basement. The spot is a memorial for the company founder, and is located in the viewing area above a group of vats. As the factory deteriorated, the catwalk leading to the memorial had fallen. To reach the Poke Stop, the kids had traversed the profoundly toxic basement. They reached the Poke Stop without incident, but then one of them saw something called a Lapras on his radar.

One kid, David, headed in one direction, while his friends went in others. Whoever found the Lapras was going to yell and his friends could come catch it for themselves. It was David who found the Lapras. But it was also David who, in the process of yelling and gesturing to his friends, slipped.

When David slipped, he crashed into an unlabeled, rusty container. His friends saw the whole thing. The container, filled with contents that had corroded it over the years, burst. From the waist down, David was completely covered with a viscous, caustic combination of concentrated acid and various, unknown industrial toxins.

The friends received severe burns on their hands and arms when they hauled David out of the building and into the car. After they pulled the car up to the ER doors, a very kind, but very dumb, samaritan, whod been nearby, rushed to help. He made the mistake of grabbing David by his foot and ankle. He degloved Davids leg all the way to his crotch. The sloughed skin splashed onto the pavement as the samaritan screamed with horror, and then pain, as steam began to rise from his own hands.

Long, terrible story short: surgeons had to amputate everything below Davids ribcage. The rest of his skin was damaged beyond repair, leaving him covered with an otherworldly patchwork of hard, gray burns. His friends, as well as the dumb samaritan, lost their hands. Two of the ER rooms needed to be closed for 48 hours so they could be decontaminated. Of all the Pokemon Go accidents wed had in the short time following its release, it was the worst.

One might think the accident would deter other people from going to the industrial zones. Quite the contrary. Once people learned they could catch a Lapras near that factory, despite warnings and promises to arrest trespassers, trainers swarmed. They knew no one would be there to arrest them. Cops had better things to do.

Two days later, we had a handful of patients with burned lungs, a few with debilitating fatigue, and two pregnancy complications, both of which ended in miscarriages. The remains of the fetuses were indescribably deformed. How such deformities could occur in such a short period of time was beyond anyones guess.

I needed to take my mind off everything Id seen, so what did I do? I played Pokemon Go. I used the Poke Stop at the hospital frequently. Whenever I had a spare moment, Id go into the parking lot and catch pidgeys and ratattas. I yearned for the bigger, better Pokemon that I knew could be obtained from the old factories. I even drove up to the fence outside one and saw something huge on my radar, but I was too afraid for my own safety to get out and investigate. In the brief period I was sitting in my car out front, I watched six people hop the fence and run into the factory. I admit, I felt a little jealous. I forced myself to get over it.

Last night started like all the other nights since the game had been released, but turned into a tragedy felt hospital-wide. Lenisha Davis, whod undergone successful fertility treatments a few months prior, was expecting sextuplets - a first for our hospital. She was in excellent health and only a month away from her due date. Shed never played a second of Pokemon in her life, but her husband and son had. Lenisha never knew theyd frequented an abandoned factory that once made herbicides. Over the few days theyd gone and come back, Lenisha was walking barefoot on the toxins theyd tracked into the house.

The pain and bleeding that caused her to come to the hospital ended the same way as it had for the other pregnant women exposed to the toxins. The deformities of her miscarried sextuplets were hideous. Their complexions were albino and their limbs were gone. All that remained were round, hard blobs containing lidless, glaring eyes and fully-toothed, gaping mouths. Lenisha had to be sedated. She wouldnt stop screaming.

The image of the sextuplets stuck with me. I was scheduled for an overnight shift, and there was a free bunk where I couldve slept, but that was out of the question. I wandered the halls aimlessly, watching for Pokemon, and gathering supplies whenever I passed the Poke Stop.

Around 3 this morning, I saw a shape on my radar. It was a big one, and I think it was nearby. Two other, smaller ones, were also showing up. I speed-walked in all directions until I finally saw them appear on my map. I felt pretty lucky to have them all come at once. Seven balls later, Id captured all three. A horsea, a kakuna, and the big one was an exeggcute. 

I looked around. Id walked without paying attention to my location in the hospital. When I realized where Id gone, I shuddered. It was where abnormal specimens were dissected and tested. Dr. Ahad was working on one of the deformed miscarriages from the day before. To his side, about to go into the refrigeration unit, was a large biohazard bag containing Lenishas sextuplets.

Sorrow suffused through me as the scenario played out again in my head. As I stared, a feeling I cant explain pricked the hair on the back of my neck. My phone vibrated in my pocket. There was a Pokemon nearby. I checked the radar. It was the silhouette of a big round thing with two arms. I remember seeing that online when I was learning about the game. A geodude. 

I did my best to shake off my misery as I trawled the halls until the geodude showed up. I caught it, had a little moment of excitement from adding another entry to my Pokedex, then returned to my weariness and sorrow. I checked where I was. I was right in front of Davids room. He was on a ventilator and he was covered in bandages. Fluid kept seeping through his gray, cracked skin. A nurse was getting ready to change his gauze. I felt such sympathy for the kid. My eyes blurred with tears.

While my eyes welled up, I stared at the shape of David on the bed. Gray, with a round, hipless torso and two long arms. My breath caught in my throat. Before I knew it, I was running back to where Dr. Ahad had been working. The room was dark. Hed gone home for the night.

I scanned my keycard and let myself in. I opened the refrigeration units and removed the two bags of the miscarriages from the days before. One was shaped like a seahorse. Another looked like a cocoon. I thought back to the three Id caught right outside the room. 

My hands shook as I opened the larger cold box housing the remains of Lenishas sextuplets. The inside of the bag was coated with grayish-red slime and I couldnt see the contents. I put on gloves and made the sign of the cross. As tears ran down my face, I took out each horrifically-deformed fetus and arranged them on sample trays. My weeping turned to wracking sobs as I examined their features. Pink. Limbless. Wide eyed. 

Egg shaped.

Six in a row.

Im into dead stuff. Birds. Squirrels. Rabbits. The occasional deer. I dunno why, they just all do it for me. 

Oh, and just so all my cards are on the table with you folks, when I say do it for me, I mean sexually. Yeah.

Im not going to psychoanalyze myself and try to give some elaborate reason. Something tells me when you read this, youll do all that for me. No, as far as Im concerned, my attractions are victimless. Unconventional, but victimless. I wont be ashamed for being myself.

Theres a reason why Im writing this, of course. Its not to brag. Im fairly certain thatd be an exercise in futility. No, Im writing because theres something going on that I find particularly unsettling. Thats right: even I find something unsettling. So if that raises some alarms in your head, its probably for good reason.

I guess I need to take you through my process. I know, I know - just the kind of thing you want to read, right? Dont worry, Im not going to get into the sticky and salty bits. Well, maybe some of the sticky ones. Thats just unavoidable.

Lets say Im driving on Floridas Turnpike. Im about 50 miles south of Kissimmee near Yeehaw Junction. Only an hour from Disney! Ill be getting off the exit and Ill see a dead deer on the side of the road. One thats not all pulped up by an 18-wheeler. Tried those before; wont again. Anyway, Ill see the deer, Ill pull over, and Ill haul the guy or gal into the pickup. People drive by and see me doing it. Police officers and priests and school busses included. They dont care. Like I said: victimless.

With the deer in the truck, Ill head on home. Ive got a small place near the swamp. Its not too swampy; theres no alligators on the porch or kudzu in the kitchen. Its just your typical, rural Florida swampy. Basic swampy. 

Theres no neighbors for half a mile in all directions, unless you count armadillos. Armadillos, by the way, do not have a place in my bedroom. Only in my heart. Theyre beautiful animals. Regal, in their own special way. I apologize for my digression, but I just thought I had to mention that.

Ill haul the deer carcass out of the truck onto a picnic table Ive got over by the shed. Being in Florida, the likelihood of the animal being ripe is rather high. While Im not a fan of the smell, the ripening process brings what I call an added bonus to my new friend. 

When a dead animals been sitting out in the Florida sun, lots and lots of flies come and lay their eggs. And those eggs hatch. And what comes out is very...wriggly. Ill leave the rest to your imagination. But now were all caught up to where we need to be.

Yesterday afternoon, I had a buck on the picnic table. I dont know if itd gotten hit by a Smart car or Mini or whatever, but it was in pretty good shape aside from half its head lying in the road next to the main body. I didnt take that part. Like I promised, Ill spare you the details. 

After we did what couples do, I poked around for any other nooks or crannies that might have fly babies hidden away inside. To my utter delight, there were quite a few. Little pockets of what looked like squirmy rice. I made a mental note of all the pockets of delight and started doing some chores around the house.

A couple hours later, when I came back to my date, I was so surprised by what I found. All those pockets had grown huge! It looked like a few bowling balls had made craters in the poor guy. And those craters were full, and I mean full, of little fly worms. I know I said I enjoy the things because of their added bonus. However, at the rate they were going, I wouldnt have any deer left. Those guys usually last me a couple weeks before they get too gelatinous to provide the proper friction. TMI?

Ive gotta tell you: Ive never seen anything like that before. It was like the buck had bowls inside it and each bowl was filled to the brim with the fly worms. It wasnt a total loss, thankfully; there was still a good portion of lovable buck. But I needed to stop the spread. I went into the shed and got my blowtorch. I figured I could cauterize the biggest of the craters to stop them from getting too big, too fast. 

I felt bad having to torch the little guys, but I was in no mood to go out and look for another date so quick. Plus I didnt want to get dressed again. It was too hot and I like working around the house in the buff. Its very freeing. So, I just said heck it and clicked on the torch and started frying everything inside those craters. The little worms roasted down to nothing. And then, friends, the unsettling thing started to happen.

As soon as the fire hit the exposed meat of the buck, thousands of full-grown flies started to pour out. Right out of the meat, as if as soon as its blood started to boil, it turned to flies. I was so grossed out. Seriously. It was remarkably unpleasant. I dont like flies at all. I like their babies, but the grown-ups are too wild and annoying. Its kinda like how people like kittens but not cats.

I kept torching until the areas I wanted got cauterized, but I swear on my name at least a million flies had to come out of the buck. Once I was done, I snuffed the torch and heard something awful. It was loud, constant buzzing coming from above me. I looked up and all the flies that had come out were just hovering over me about ten feet up.

This scared me a little. Im a big guy and not much intimidates me, but for some reason, that cloud of flies just felt very wrong to me. 

Ready to hear the stupid thing I did? I was still holding the torch while I stared at the flies. It was off, but the end was still super hot from when I used it. Well, I was paying more attention to what was going on above me that I didnt really think about what I was doing with the torch. I turned around and, well, the tip of my hog slapped against the hot end of the torch.

Readers, I bet you heard me holler from your houses, no matter where it is you all live. I dropped the torch and grabbed myself, but even in my pain, I felt something pushing against my unit and my hands. I took one hand off, and about 50 flies poured out of the spot Id burned. I was scared out of my wits and then I remembered I hadnt washed any of the buck off me after our date. There had to be something wrong with its blood. 

I ran in the house and put some ice on my burn. From the kitchen window, I watched all the flies still hovering above the buck. The ones thatd come out of me were buzzing around my ceiling. And then, out of nowhere, they all popped. Thats the only word I can use. They popped and covered the buck and me and my kitchen floor with what looked and felt like blood, but I dont know how the hell it could have been. Shoot, I dont know how any of this could have been.

Now, I was still more concerned about my burn than the mess on my date and my kitchen floor, so I tended to that for the rest of the evening. I covered up my burn, took a shower, which is remarkably hard to do when trying not to get your genitalia all wet, and went to bed.

I woke up in the middle of the night because my burn was bothering me. I headed into the kitchen to get another ice pack, and when I turned on the light, I was surprised to see the floor where the blood had landed was covered in mushrooms. Weird, thin ones that were whitish-gray. I flipped on the outside lights and, lo and behold, the dirt and picnic table and shed were covered with the same things. My date, too. I knew at that point he was a lost cause. Poor guy.

My burn kept flaring and I had to take a leak, so I headed into the bathroom. The damn light bulb had blown out the week before and I kept forgetting to pick up a new one. I pulled my shorts down around my ankles, peeled off my bandage, and sat down. I was too tired to stand and didnt want to risk missing the bowl in the dark. I started to relieve myself. Except nothing came out. And it hurt a whole heck of a lot.

I strained a little, but not too hard. I didnt want to blow anything out. I started to get worried about my prostate. I got up, waddled out of the bathroom back into the kitchen the light was on, and hollered again. There was a cluster of those same stringy mushrooms sprouting from the burned tip of my penis. When I tried to pull them out, I felt something tugging way, way deep inside my groin. It hurt a lot and I didnt want to mess up my downstairs any more than it already was.

So thats why Im writing you guys. Sorry for the long story, but I just thought you needed to hear the details so you could give an informed opinion. Any idea what I should do? Ive gotta pee real bad and those mushrooms keep getting longer and longer.

	<TITLE> Far Too Many Mushrooms, part 2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-07 18:52:09 </DATE>

	<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4j23w5/far_too_many_mushrooms/?st=iqcgb0kj sh=d61331d2)

After all the schools and municipal cafeterias stopped taking shipments of wild mushrooms from the county co-op, they all came to my company for us to use. Normally, this would be fantastic. Mushrooms make great fertilizer. 

Ive got acres upon acres of property with great soil. Its such good stuff that people come from all over the country in dump trucks to buy a load and haul it back to wherever they want. Our familys been caring for the land for going on 200 years now. Weve been asked to sell the property to big agribusinesses more times than we can count, but we could never give it up. Even when the offers got into the upper seven figures, weve been content with the low sixes that come in consistently, year after year.

I got a phone call a month ago from the farm co-op thats been handling all the local produce for the countys schools and whatnot. Apparently theres been no interest in the mushroom glut after little Danny Lansings tragic passing. The co-op guy on the phone told me what I already knew: the boys death was from an unknown allergic reaction and no one else, as far as he knew, had gotten sick from the mushrooms. I listened and waited for him to tell me what kind of deal hed give me if I were to buy the whole supply.

Ill admit, I was pretty surprised when he said he wasnt even considering charging me for the supply. To the contrary: he said the co-op would give me five thousand bucks if I sent our trucks over to take them all away. $5000 sounded like a hell of a lot for a local farm co-op, and when I said that to the guy, he just said well, its a hell of a lot of mushrooms.

Two of my guys, Ramon and Juan, headed over to the co-op; one in a dump truck and the other in a backhoe. Ramon and his dump truck were the first to arrive, and he radioed to me the minute he saw the amount of product theyd have to move. I called in two more guys and sent them with another two dump trucks. When all was said and done, theyd picked up eight truckloads. I let them split the $5000 among themselves.

The last half of the truckloads were delivered after dark, so even though I knew I was getting tons of the things, I was still taken aback in the morning when I saw the mountains of fungus sitting in the field near the barn. I went over to investigate, and saw the majority of them looked like portobellos, but there were some stringy, white ones in there that looked a little like the Japanese kind I cant remember the name of.

The four guys whod helped out yesterday were there at the crack of dawn. They hadnt expected such a huge bonus yesterday, so they were eager to get to work and show their appreciation. Ive always believed its important to treat the people who you employ with respect. These guys have been with us for a long time; Juan had just celebrated his 30th year here. Without them, the company wouldnt be nearly as good as it is. I make sure to tell them that as often as I can.

They got to work loading the mushrooms into a huge grinder thats been part of the business for almost a century. It eats through any organic matter you feed into it and turns it into the perfect size and consistency to get incorporated into the soil. Five hours later, two piles of mushrooms had been reduced to a pulpy sludge.

I worked out which part of the property should get the new fertilizer, and as luck would have it for the guys who had to spread it out, the area right near where theyd been working had gone the longest without upkeep. After two days, that part of the field was all finished. Just in time for the weekend.

No one was around from Saturday until Tuesday. I told the guys my wife and I were going to take a few day trips to enjoy the unseasonably-warm weather, and I had them take Monday off. We got back in the wee hours of Tuesday. Long before sunrise. It felt like Id just gotten to sleep when I heard banging on the door. My cell phone started ringing, too. I picked up and Pedro started yelling in my ear. My ability to understand Spanish is okay, but not when its being spoken at a hundred miles an hour and being half shouted. I told Pedro to calm down and asked if his dad was available to talk. I love the kid, but hes pretty excitable. I guess all 16 year olds are.

Juan got on the line as I walked over to the front door. Ramon was standing there looking bewildered. Juan was saying something about mushrooms on the phone as Ramon pulled me by the arm around to the other side of the house, near the field where theyd been working. I saw Pedro first, then Juan, still talking into his cell phone. Id stopped listening, though. I could see something in the newly-fertilized field about a hundred yards away, but it was being blurred by a haze of orange fog.

The four of us walked toward the field. I started to get a nagging feeling of unease. There were large, bulbous shapes protruding from the ground. Even as we closed in, their clear shapes eluded us. The dark-orange fog still obscured the details. Ramon pointed out footprints in the dirt, all converging on that part of the field. The more I looked, the more I saw. Tens of pairs of footprints. 

Orange fog licked at our feet and ankles and legs as we got closer. I put my shirt over my mouth and nose before walking any closer. The rest of the guys did, too. The footprints appeared to come from all around, all spaced out as if they were running. Wed gotten close enough to make out the bulbous forms. They were some kind of fungus. They looked like giant pieces of ginger root sticking out of the ground. Their sides were lined with pores, some open, some covered with a loose membrane.

Out of nowhere, Pedro screamed and put his hands to his face, dropping his shirt from his mouth in the process. I saw him gasp in a lungful of the fog. My eyes widened when I saw what had startled him. Bodies were wrapped around the base of each mushroom stalk, as if they were embracing them. Their skin was destroyed. I cant think of any other way to put it. Massive patches were missing, usually a foot or more in diameter in each spot. And there were many, many spots. 

The most unsettling aspect, though, as if it could get much worse, was the condition of their feet. Some of them were in tatters; bones sticking out of shredded muscle and veins dangling like thick, loose hair. I dont know what could have possibly happened - it almost looked like they were worn away.

We heard loud breathing behind us and we spun around. A hideously thin woman, completely naked and patterned with areas of missing flesh, ran by us. One of her feet was missing. Each step pushed the stump of her ankle into the dirt. She ran face-first into one of the mushrooms, wrapped her arms around it, and sank to the ground with a smile on her face. As her arms slid across the pores in the stalk, they burst open, filling the air with more orange fog.

The men with me were all talking loudly to one another and backing away. More runners in similarly-devastated conditions were arriving. We kept walking away and out of the orange fog. Juan called Pedros name. I noticed he wasnt with us. He called again. Pedro came out of the fog, coated, like we were, with orange spores. Unlike us, though, his mouth and nose were still uncovered. He stared blankly and scratched at his face and neck.

Juan rushed toward his son and started pulling him away from the field, but Pedro turned toward it and began to walk back. Juan, being much stronger, was still able to pull the boy back out of the field to the barn, where we all stripped down and hosed one another off. We stood in the middle of the barn wondering aloud what the hell was happening. 

Pedro, now clean, kept scratching himself. Lines had started to form over the spots where his fingernails had traveled. His legs pumped as he ran in place, not listening to his father ordering him to stay still. A moment later, while Juan was trying to call 911, we watched, helplessly, as Pedro started running in the direction of the mushroom field, slamming into the closed door of the barn, picking himself up, and doing it all again. And again. And again.

	<TEXT> During the latter half of her pregnancy, Eileen was plagued by nightmares. They were monstrous and intrusive; disruptive to the point where shed been unable to continue working because of the stress of it all. The trouble began when Eileen saw the sonogram image of our baby. Our daughter, we learned. While neither the obstetrician nor I could see what Eileen claimed to, she was convinced it was something evil. Something non-human. Despite my best efforts, I couldnt get her to shake that feeling. And thats when the nightmares began.

Shed say she heard the baby laughing inside her. Laughing and screaming. Eileen would wake up in a panic and describe hideous scenes of a deformed monstrosity erupting from her body and devouring humankind. I could tell my wife was traumatized, but there was nothing I could do except hold her until the hysterical sobbing stopped.

At the request of her parents, Eileen began seeing a therapist. The therapy seemed to take the edge off her daily trauma, but the nightmares persisted. Id wake up to Eileen thrashing and clawing at herself, drawing deep gashes into the stretched flesh of her belly while screaming with profound terror at whatever was tormenting her. She began wearing mittens to bed to diminish the severity of the assaults on herself. They succeeded in stopping the scratches, but the horror continued unabated.

We were both counting down the days to her delivery date. Most parents do this with joyful anticipation. Our anticipation was anything but. Eileen had grown resigned to the idea that she was about to bring something evil into the world. I was secretly dreading how Eileen would treat the baby. Shed told me many times how much she hated her; how shed been praying our daughter would arrive stillborn and unable to hurt anyone. 

On June 30th, Eileen went into labor. I could tell she was in excruciating pain, but she never cried out or complained. Her jaw was set with determination and her eyes had locked on a point in space only she could see. Throughout the whole ordeal, she didnt utter a word. 17 hours later, on July 1st, our daughter was born. Dominique Alyssa Texier. 

And she was perfect.

When small, cooing Dominique was brought up for Eileen to hold, she stared at her for long, silent minutes. She blinked over and over, as if trying to determine if what she was seeing was real or imaginary. Dominique reached out and touched Eileens nose. The tension broke. Eileen began to cry. It wasnt the terrified bleating that had filled our last four months. These were tears of infinite relief. Eileen held Dominique and kissed the top of her head. At that instant, I knew my wife loved our daughter. And I loved them both infinitely. 

Two days later, the three of us went home. Our love for our newborn daughter has only deepened. The feeling is indescribable. Id always heard parents say theyd do anything for their children, but I could never understand the ferocity of that dedication until Dominique came into our lives. 

Her wide, gray eyes stare into ours with precocious intensity. As the hours and days of Dominiques new life accumulate, I can feel our dedication and reverence growing. When she smiles at us, which is more often than not, her tiny, straight teeth - another example of her precociousness - gleam with a radiance that reflects the brightness of her parents sentiment.

Dominique bathes in the adoration pouring from the two pairs of eyes observing her every waking moment. Every need she has, however infinitesimal, is met. Every action she performs, however inconsequential, is celebrated. Even now, as we watch her breastfeed, it seems like the most beautiful, natural act in the world. The only concern we have is what we should do once she finishes eating the second one.

	<TITLE> The Old Mine Outside Town </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the last month, Id been pestering Mason to come with me to explore the old mine outside town. It was one of those places everyone said was haunted. You know the type. Of course, most places like that have scary legends to keep people away so the goth kids can go and fuck one another in peace. There was nothing really haunted about those spots, of course. This mine, though, kept even the goths at bay.

There were so many rumors about why the mine was haunted and downright dangerous. Some said it used to be a government uranium mine during the Manhattan Project and youd get irradiated the minute you set foot inside. Others claimed Blacks had been secretly imprisoned and tortured to death there after the abolition of slavery, and their vengeful ghosts would kill anyone foolish enough to explore. For the most part, however, folks didnt know why the place was so ominous. Theyd just always been told never to go in, and they obeyed.

No one Id ever met had boasted about going inside. A couple people had the balls to peek through the cracks in the wood theyd used to board up the place 50 years ago, but that was as far as anyone would go. Not even the cops would go in when asshole kids would prank call the station and say someone had gotten lost in there. Honestly, the whole thing seemed pretty fucking lame. Ive never been superstitious. I couldnt care less about ghosts of dead slaves or some ridiculous rumors about radiation. All the evidence said it was nothing but an old coal mine thatd been decommissioned before it could get finished. Thats it. And I was going in.

Mason always resisted when I tried to get him to come. I couldnt believe how much of a coward he was. Id always known he was shy and timid, but this was just pathetic. Why I was in a relationship with him in the first place was anyones guess. Well, I know why: he gave me free weed and coke. He stopped dealing and got a real job a month ago, though. Hed done nothing but annoy me ever since. Tonight was going to be the last straw. If he bailed on me, I wouldnt go near him again.

He didnt bail. Thank God. We showed up at the mine at sunset. Wed brought the flashlights and stuff to explore, plus some food in case we got lost. That last part was his idea. He seemed under the impression wed be gone long enough that starvation would be a concern. Such a baby.

I had him tear the bottom boards away with a little crowbar, and while he whined and protested, I crawled under the remaining barrier and into the mine. His bleating went on and on but he eventually squeezed through the opening and joined me inside. We shone our flashlights ahead and looked at the solid rock wall in front of us and the sharp turn to the left. Lets go, I told him.

We walked forward and turned the corner. Mason let out a long sigh. All there was in front of us was a shaft going straight down. There were some elevator cables at the top, but no car. No ladder, either 

I guess the scary stuffs down there, Mason announced, his voice echoing down the shaft. No way we can climb down, right? The relief in his voice was obvious.

I paced aimlessly while he talked about how he couldnt believe the town was scared of such a boring place. I cleared my throat and spoke:

Darryl wants you to know you promised to work for him forever, Mason. And you shouldnt have stopped.

I was behind Mason when I finished the sentence and I pushed him. He tried to grab me, but Id backed up. He spun around and toppled backward from the lip of the shaft. His hands tried to grasp the edge, but it was all loose dirt and sand. Mason screamed all the way down. The wet crunch came a little while later.

I turned around and headed back to the opening, thinking about how proud of me Darryl was going to be. Wed talked about this ever since Mason got his stupid job. Now I could be with Darryl and he could treat me like the princess I know I am.

While I rounded the corner, a shrieking chorus of dissonant voices erupted from from the elevator shaft. I gasped and ran for the exit. And as I scrambled under the barrier, despite my blood jackhammering in my ears and my panicked yelps filling the air, I clearly heard the words, 

THANK YOU - WEVE BEEN SO HUNGRY.

	<TEXT> Ive been selling ground meat and sausage made from the people Ive killed to the hipster restaurants in the city. You know the type: ones with terms like LOCALLY SOURCED INGREDIENTS emblazoned on every surface like it somehow makes their food taste good. Not that what Im selling them tastes bad, mind you. They love it. Everyone does. They think theyre getting some of that heritage-breed pork from those wooly Mangalitsa pigs Ive got in the yard. Well, theyre not. Those little guys arent for sale. The restaurants are buying and serving human remains. 

Let me guess: Im a monster. Oooooooo. Another madman killing innocent people, right? Another psychopath? Well, no. Maybe. Probably not. Heres the thing - its not that I dont *like* people. I know everyone has hopes and dreams and blah blah blah. 

I had hopes and dreams too. I had a butcher shop and loyal customers for 40 years. Then all the kids started moving in. White kids just out of college. Kids with jobs in technology or some other abstract shit that pays an ungodly amount of money; five times what everyone else in our neighborhoods were making. Kids without a care in the world for the generations of culture they were trampling on.

Rents went up. Fast. Our neighborhoods changed. Fast. Family businesses thatd been operating for years couldnt afford to stay there anymore and were forced to shut down. After just ten years, the city was nothing like it had been. Gentrification was the word that kept getting thrown around. People talked about it like it was a good thing.

I was lucky. I had a nest-egg saved up and didnt even try to keep paying the rent as it skyrocketed. I saw where it was all going. I closed the shutters on my shop, bought some land upstate, had the foresight to acquire some Mangalitsas before they became popular and expensive, and started my little company. Once a month, Id drive my van around the old neighborhoods on late Friday and Saturday nights. Id invite the stumbling, drunken kids to get in for a ride, hit them over the head, and head on back to the farm. Easy peasy Mangalitsy. 

Anyway, the great thing about these hipster joints is the owners will cut whatever corners they can if it means they can get an edge on a new or hot product. What does that mean for me? Well, they drive up early Monday morning, buy the meat from me without any USDA stamp, and head on back to the city with a weeks worth of meat. That leaves me with cash in hand and great dirt on the restaurant owners if they ever learn my little secret. 

According to one of my buyers - a guy whose claim to fame was when he Beat Bobby Flay on TV - the next big thing will be meat from suckling pigs; baby piglets whove only consumed milk from their mothers. I glanced at his wife, who hed brought to show her a real farm and to see how the other half lives. She nodded absently while cradling a tiny newborn to her chest. Her own little suckling animal. 

The guy went on and on about the quality of unweaned, milk-fed product. He went through the recipes hed planned out. They sounded pretty great, to be honest. Lots of fresh fennel. I love fennel.

I pictured the people bound and gagged in their pens in my basement. Three men and nine women. Basic arithmetic and logistics made me close my eyes for a moment as I thought about how Id fill the order. The guy talked as I worked out the numbers. 

Ill be happy to pay you in advance for not only the product, but for exclusivity, he told me. We strolled around the pigpens as his wife worried aloud about whether the baby could get sick from the smell.

11 months, I announced. The guy smiled. Apparently hed expected a year or more. I shook his weak, uncalloused hand, nodded at his politely-smiling wife, and patted the infant on its little, pink head. They drove off in their Volvo, leaving me with a bag of cash.

Once they were long gone, I headed down to the basement. I thought about the orders I had to fill over the next few months, then slit the throats of the two smaller men and hung them up to drain. I shifted the rest of them around in their pens until I had the grouping I wanted.

As I was heading back upstairs, I turned around and called out to the remaining man, who was sitting in the corner of the pen housing him and his four companions. 

Better start fucking, buddy! Your children are my future!

	<TITLE> In our quest to drill for more and more oil, I think we finally went too deep. Part 1. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive worked in petroleum engineering for 35 years. Most of it has been in the Gulf of Mexico, though Id done a bit of contract work in the Middle East and Canada. After the BP disaster, thered been quite a bit of pressure on the major petroleum companies to use extra caution and increase their R D budgets to design safer technologies to prevent another environmental catastrophe. For most of the people in my position, that meant more work and less pay. Of course.

My most recent employer has been one of the big American oil companies. Ive been stationed on an experimental, semi-secret offshore platform in the Gulf of Mexico. I say semi-secret because were using a lot of new, highly-proprietary technologies. If our competitors were to learn about them, wed be set back a few years and countless billions of dollars. All outward appearances would suggest were a normal platform thats outfitted for extreme-depth drilling. If only the competition knew how deep we were going.

The platform is right near the edge of the drop off leading to the Sigsbee Abyssal Plain. One of the new technologies weve employed involve our remotely-operated submersibles. Theyre basically just submarine drones with lots of cameras and equipment on them that can go super deep. All the ones wed used in the past needed to be tethered to the surface using a fiber optic connection. 

The physical connection had its pros and cons. Fiber optic connections are speedy as all hell, which means commands and data can be sent back and forth to the drone with no meaningful lag. A major downside, though, is that a physical cable limits the maneuvering capabilities of the drone. At the depths we were hoping to reach, the topography was unknown. Previous attempts to send tethered drones ended in failure when the cables were severed by the terrain.

Even with our best satellite, sonar, and early-drone imagery, our knowledge of the area we wanted to drill was terrible. The resolution was too low for any meaningful data to be gleaned. We knew there was oil down there - lots and lots and lots of it - but until we could develop new ways to map the bottom, we were screwed.

A guy named Masaharu Ajibana changed everything for us. Hed been a materials scientist wed brought on to work on some of the ceramics composites in our drill heads. When he saw the new, undisclosed materials wed been wanting to employ in the future drills, he mustve spent four straight days poring over their properties with an enthusiasm Id never seen in a person over the age of five. 

At the end of those four days, Masaharu not only understood the materials better than the team who invented them, but hed gotten an idea about how to transmit data through miles and miles of murky saltwater using some bizarre form of piezoelectric resonance unique to the properties of the new ceramics. Essentially, a transceiver on the drone would resonate at the same frequency as one on the platform. Once the transceivers were locked in an oscillatory pattern, smaller, tighter waveforms from a second set of transceivers would traverse the oscillation cable linking the drone and the platform. 

Nearly every scientist in every department in the company said this was entirely impossible. Still, there was enough support from a few key players in R D that Masaharus claims were investigated. Investigation led to cursory confirmations. Cursory confirmations led to experiments. Experiments led to shocking successes. And shocking successes led to the fastest development and deployment of a new technology in the history of the company. 

Its that technology our company employed three weeks ago. Wed been using a fleet of nine drones to map the abyssal plain of Sigsbee Deep. Theres one hub drone and eight mappers. The hub has one main resonator which communicates with the platform, and eight smaller ones which communicate with the mappers. We were dumbfounded not only by the simplicity and ease of the data transmissions, but by the richness of the data we were seeing.

Another technology wed deployed for this project was a small, cable-form drill mounted on the mappers. Its drill head was equipped with our new ceramics and could cut through the bottom of the plain with ease. The cables were 3000 feet long - not anything major - but they allowed the mappers to confirm the massive salt sheet wed assumed was covering the oil deposits. 

Once the drill cable maxes out, a tiny device gets deposited in the cavity. Its mostly multilevel sonar with some seismographs and embedded communicators. Nothing too advanced. It measures minute seismic activity and sends it back to the hub. The data gets processed by our CPU cluster and is incorporated into our future drilling plans.

As I said, weve been mapping for three weeks. A week ago, the seismographs started picking up some bizarre activity. And something else happened. Its something neither I nor the onboard medics can adequately explain. 

Last Tuesday, Gervaso Zaragoza, a member of my team, went to the infirmary complaining of severe headaches. He had no history of migraines and until the headaches started, seemed to be in perfect health. The severity of the pain grew as the day went on. After a couple hours, he was screaming. When I stepped out of the infirmary, another team member came to me and casually mentioned the seismic activity of the plain had been rising all day. On a whim, I asked him to send a sleep command to the seismographs. A minute later, Gervaso was fine.

We resumed the operation of the seismographs later in the afternoon. Gervaso, who was resting but otherwise alert, was unaffected. I knew it had to be a coincidence and did my best to put the event out of my mind.

On Wednesday, the mappers were spread in a wide circle out from the hub. They were pinging the interior of the circle with extremely high-resolution sonar, as well as multi-laser topography measurements as the circle widened. The goal was to see if there had been any appreciable surface shifts since the last measurement three days earlier. With the seismic activity wed experienced, Id expected some shifts to be detected. 

There were no shifts. Instead, there were a series of long, unbroken convexities lining the sea floor. The scan resolution was extremely sharp, and we could clearly see the digitized images of straight lines pushing nearly a meter above the plain. Even with the scans, I wanted to see a camera feed, so I directed the camera to send a raw feed to the platform. The light on the drone went on, and the screen displayed a long, perfectly-straight mound in the silt that stretched for miles. The other mappers displayed the same thing.

The onboard geologist wouldnt rule out the possibility of a seismic event being the cause of the convexities. He said we knew very little about the seismological properties of the salt plate beneath the plain. The pressures of the silt and water above it and the oil and gas below made for an intensely complicated interaction model, and even though hed never heard of the type of thing we were seeing, instances of symmetry in natural geology were well-known. He mentioned the basalt formations at Giants Causeway. And thats how he left it. 

I wasnt convinced. Even though Im not a geologist, it seemed odd that such obvious and large changes could occur with the comparatively-little seismic activity wed seen. Even though the activity had increased as wed observed it, it still hadnt come close to reaching an intensity that would have moved such a large amount of rock and water. 

Two days later, on another mapping mission, I took manual control of one of the drones. Id had the guys from robotics outfit another couple cameras and lights to the outside. I guided the sub along the tallest of the convexities and positioned it about a foot above its surface. All the cameras and lights traced along the convex surface. No visible change from the other day.

I extended the drill. The drill head sank into the convexity and stopped. It was stuck. The transceivers on the hub reported error transmissions from the mapper. I reversed the drill, backed it out, and tried again. Throughout the platform, I heard a number of sharp reports that sounded like gunshots. In the other room, shouts of surprise and screams of fear rang out. I ran from the control panel to see what was going on.

John Edmundson was lying on the floor. A hole had appeared in his belly. A sucking sound filled the room coupled with John screaming with an intensity Ive never known to be possible. He moved his hands to the wound in an attempt to plug it, but with a series of horrible, wet cracks, his hands and arms were pulled into his belly. Above him, a hole exploded in the steel ceiling, its ragged edges pointing downward. I realized John was being pulled down to the deck below. 

I ran down the steps and watched with profound horror as the man was pulled through a series of holes the size of dimes, all the way through every floor in the platform, down to the water. I ran down each floor, watching the column of gore disappear ever downward. Two minutes later, a foam of pulp and entrails floated in heap on the choppy surface of the water.  

I slowly plodded back up the steps, unsure if what Id just seen could possibly have been real. I was jolted out of my contemplation when I realized, behind the shrill voices of my coworkers, an alarm was screaming from the drone control room. I ran back upstairs, past my traumatized colleagues, and made it to the control room. The camera feed was gone.

I rewound to the moment Id left from the room and started at the screen with disbelief. The convexity below the drone shook like an electric shock had coursed through its bulk. Then, the silt covering it began to fall away. It wasnt a rock formation. Ripples of peristaltic convulsions seethed along a gray, scarred surface. A hole opened in the surface of it and the drill cable began to get sucked inside. As the 3000 feet were being consumed, the camera showed a vacant column the width of a dime pointing straight up. I realized that mustve been what had killed John.

Once the drill cable disappeared, the screen went black. The drone, presumably, was gone. The other drones were still mapping away with mechanical obliviousness. I called up the real time sonar data. The convexities had disappeared from the sea floor. I pulled back on the sonar map and tried to figure out what I was seeing. The sonar feed was slow; around 2 frames per second. Still, there was no mistaking what was coming on screen.

The convexities had all lifted from the abyssal plain and were waving back and forth through the water. They were massive; easily 7000 feet long. I couldnt figure out what was causing them to move. Then, as the reality of Johns death started to sink in and the strangeness of what the camera showed before it went out began to take hold in my mind, I came to a realization that was impossible to ignore. What I was seeing wasnt an effect of bizarre, deep-sea geology. They were colossal, writhing tentacles.

Id completely forgotten about Myspace. Like, Id forgotten it even existed. Never mind the fact I used it like a fiend at the peak of its popularity and I had countless photos and messages and connections still there, frozen in time, so anyone could see what a disaster I was in my early 20s. A couple weeks ago, I got an email warning me about some major hack that resulted in tons and tons of accounts being compromised; a compromise so severe that for some people, every shred - every bit - every datum - of their personal information could have been stolen. Then I remembered Myspace.

My early 20s were a bad time for me. I was dealing with a number of undiagnosed mental illnesses. Still, back then, I never thought anything was wrong with me at all; I just figured thats how I was. I was a sad person. I was a volatile person. Not once did it cross my mind I had legitimate problems for which potential solutions existed. Instead, for years, I bathed in static and lassitude interrupted by bursts of rage and terror.

One thing I was acutely aware of was how miserable I felt. Unfortunately, I had no positive outlets for that feeling. My creativity was nonexistent. I couldnt write my way out of a bad mood or compose music to take the edge off my self-directed anger. Instead, when things were at their worst, I sought simple, hedonistic escapes. Sometimes it was as innocent and selfish as overeating or staring at porn, but when Myspace came around and a vast social network of people came into view, my methods of escape changed.

A total non-secret but still-unpleasant thing to discuss in polite company is how social networks magnificently facilitate the meetings of damaged people seeking others to help damage them even more. Within a week of figuring out and forming a rudimentary network on Myspace, Id started looking for kindred spiritless.

Before I could find one, one found me. Bethany. Bethany was unwell. Like me, she was a cutter. Unlike me, Bethany cut her face. And her neck. Her skin bore a lattice of old scars and fresh wounds sprinkled with middle-aged scabs. Her frame was slight and fragile. All her photos were taken from angles to maximize her bones, whether cheek, collar, or hip. Her message was simple: Can we meet up and talk?

Her profile said she lived in a town 20 miles away. I had a car, she didnt. I drove over that night, not knowing what to expect other than probable sex and likely sobbing.

I was right about the former but not about the latter. Bethany was the flattest, most unaffected person Id ever encountered. The sex itself was brisk and clinical; an emotionless pursuit of mutual, involuntary muscle contractions. Nothing more. Afterward, we talked. 

Bethany was the product of two decades of ceaseless, hideous abuse. It began with her stepfather when she was a toddler and continued across multiple relationships before culminating in a suicide attempt and a six-month hospitalization two years before we met. In the space of those post-hospital years, Bethany dedicated herself to the gradual process of self-destruction. Thanks for the help, she told me.

It took a lot to surprise me back then, but the matter-of-fact declarations of Bethanys professed desire for a slow, torturous death took me aback. I stared at the fresh slices right below her hairline that shed made during her trip to the bathroom after sex. A feeling I can only describe as intense respect and admiration filled me. I produced my pocket knife, opened it, and while Bethany watched, I carved a thin, deep line into the flesh above my right eyebrow.

The cut wept and trickled in a lazy rivulet down the side of my face. For the first time since Id met her, a tiny smile lifted the edges of the scabs around Bethanys lips. She leaned forward, and with a gentleness I can only describe as angelic, swept her searing tongue from the base of my neck and into the drooling wound above my eye. Right when the sharp sting hit me, she moved down and slipped her blood-bathed tongue into my mouth.

And that was the first time I met Bethany.

We grew close over the following weeks. When we werent together, we were chatting on Myspace. Shed introduced me to a concept of physical intimacy Id never even considered, let alone desired. But after our first night together, it was all I wanted to think about. It was all I wanted to talk about. And Bethany, for her part, was delighted to indulge me. Anyone reading our chats out of context would think theyd encountered a corrupted file containing meshed conversations between teen romance enthusiasts, gynecologists, and butchers.

By necessity, our physical interactions, while intensely sadomasochistic, were tamer than that which wed chat about. Months flew while we ratcheted up the intensity of our online discussions and did our best to follow our talk with action in the bedroom. But as time passed, we realized wed hit a wall. 

Neither of us were willing to do severe, lasting damage to each other. Wed cut, wed burn, wed bite, wed dilate; but nothing permanent. Nothing debilitating. And that began to weigh on our relationship. Following a night of spilled and leaked fluids and burned and bruised erogenous zones, Bethany told me what Id both expected and dreaded. She needed more. I nodded and left.

Five days went by without either of us talking. Id given up hope and had slipped into the familiar, benthic depths of abject loneliness. The prospect of suicide was a bright, hopeful beacon of relief. On the sixth day, Bethany messaged me. Please come over one last time. I was at her doorstep 15 minutes later.

When she let me in, I saw why shed invited me. A dissonant sensation of arousal, fear, and nausea caused my knees to weaken and I sank heavily onto her bed. 

The night we met, when Bethany was telling me about the abuse shed endured over the course of her life, shed mentioned how her mother left her stepfather when Bethany was 16 and she hadnt seen him since. Her mother said he still lived in the same county, but fell headlong into his drug and alcohol addiction following the divorce. And now, back at Bethanys apartment, I discovered Bethany had lured him there.

He was emaciated and obviously quite sick. While I was surprised Bethany had been able to overpower him and bind his arms and legs, the smell of alcohol on the man made me think he didnt put up a fight. He probably didnt even know where he was.

You know, Bethany said, looking into my eyes, we dont have any pictures of us together on our MySpace accounts. Everyone else in a relationship does. We should too.

My heart soared. She still wanted to be in a relationship with me.

As the man on the floor groaned and drooled around the sock in his mouth, Bethany sat on my lap in her computer chair and we posed in front of her webcam. We snapped photo after photo, losing our clothing and inhibitions with each shot. My knife split her lower lip and she bit through mine. We kissed with a passion I never knew could be possible, pausing every minute or so to take more pictures. I knew theyd be removed from public view by Myspace, but I didnt care. Wed still be able to see them privately. We were the only ones who mattered.

We stopped, our chests heaving as we worked to catch our breaths, and Bethany started to caption the pictures. I looked at the man on the floor. Bethany, sensing that my attention had shifted, stopped captioning and followed my gaze. We both stared at the writhing, wretched molester and abuser. 

No one will miss him. No one will look.

Bethanys voice melted in my ear like warm tallow. My mind raced through all the online conversations wed had with one another; fantasies that spliced bedrooms and abattoirs, speculums and chisels, sex organs and offal. The raw savagery of my self-loathing coupled with an intense sense of duty to Bethany. I wanted to show her how much she meant to me.

I dragged the man into the bathtub and opened him while Bethany watched. I unpacked and unfolded that which he contained, feeling the weight and texture of each bit before passing it to Bethany for inspection. She considered every piece with her hands and eyes; the knife travelling over it all in intricate, discerning swirls. The mood was broken only once when the man had a moment of lucidity, was able to free one hand, and tried to pull his parts back inside. I borrowed the knife from Bethany. A moment later, the stepfather would never try grab anything again.

Hours passed and Bethany and I reshaped the abuser into a form that was no longer recognizable. No longer threatening. When the last portion was excised, we made quiet love among the debris. Our act was shrouded in peaceful silence broken only by gentle sighs and the sticky coupling and decoupling of our crimson-kissed bodies. Id never experienced such closeness. When it was over, we drifted into a peaceful sleep.

Once we woke up, we did what we had to do. Following the ten hours it took to clean, remove, and bury the parts where they would never be found, Bethany kissed me goodbye and I returned home.

That night was the peak of our relationship. We attempted to rekindle the passion through our usual, explicit online conversations, recalling moments of that night in detail which, before experiencing the reality of it, would have been more than enough to provoke our mutual desire. The provocation didnt come. The desire remained unavailable. After another month, wed stopped talking entirely.

I attempted to contact Bethany a few times later in the year. When she didnt reply, I did a Google search for her name. There was a short news article saying shed been found dead in her apartment a couple months after wed last spoken. It was ruled a suicide. When I found out, I was less devastated than I would have been if it were closer to that night. But Id sunk into a crippling depression since then. I was on autopilot; if I wasnt cutting, I was sleeping around. If I wasnt sleeping around, I was fantasizing about my own death. And there was one more thing. Something entirely different.

While I wasnt devastated about Bethanys death, I was still affected. That one more thing was the burgeoning prospect that my life could change for the better if I sought help. I didnt think I deserved it and I didnt think it could ever work. Still, I knew Id never have the courage to give myself the death I so desperately desired. So, on a whim, I checked myself into a hospital and said I was a threat to myself. It was funny, because as I said that, I realized it was the first time in as long as I could remember that I actually wasnt.

Its been 10 years since Bethany. My life is entirely different, thanks to medication and regular therapy. Im married and I have a young daughter whom I love more than anything. My scars have faded and my hope for death has been replaced with excitement for the future. And then, a couple weeks ago, I got the email about my Myspace account being hacked. 

Why am I writing all this? Because two days later I got an email from some Croatian domain Id never seen before. It was in broken English, but what it said was clear. It contained my full name, my current address, and the names of my wife and child. It also had the pictures of me and Bethany, along with snippets of the conversations wed had together. And at one point in those conversations, toward the very end of our relationship, Bethany specifically said we should go back to Sunflower Point to see what the worms have done to Henry. Whoever sent the email had a picture of Sunflower Point.

But why am I really writing all this? I dont expect sympathy. Why would anyone feel sympathy for me - a person who brutally killed a helpless man and has gotten away with it for so long? Because whoever sent that email has a demand if theyre going to stay quiet. And its not money. As payment for their silence, they want that sexy thing all the customers are dying to taste. Attached right below the demand is a picture of my 3 year-old daughter.

	<TITLE> Bluefin </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-23 21:44:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was getting harder and harder to get Pacific bluefin tuna. Yeah, I could get other varieties, but everyone knows Pacific bluefin is the best. Especially for sushi. I contacted supplier after supplier, and all of them told me the same thing: they were being pressured to phase out the product and the prices would continue to rise because the demand was higher than ever.

My customers are well off. They can afford the best, so they demand the best. If I cant give them what they demand, theyll go elsewhere. In this competitive restaurant environment, if that happens, Im done for. You can imagine my growing panic as the prices for bluefin rose and the supplies dwindled. Sure, my customers would pay whatever I charged when I could get it in, but that was becoming less and less frequent. The bigger restaurants would get first dibs. Why sell one to me when you can sell three or four to the guy down the street, especially when he had enough cash on hand to outbid me?

I was getting ready to give up hope. My sales were at an all-time low as the customers sought a better, more high-end selection from my competitors. In my desperation, I realized Id be willing to circumvent the law if it meant staying in business. Staying in business meant my girls could stay at Yale. It meant my wife could continue receiving top-quality nursing care in our home while her Alzheimers worsened. I wasnt ready to take that all away from them.

Ten years ago, I met a man named Satoshi. He was the nephew of one of my suppliers. Hed gone into business for himself and got into quite a bit of trouble for poaching some endangered sharks to sell their fins to the Chinese market. I think he spent a couple months in jail and had to pay a pretty big fine, but rumor had it that hed emerged a new man. He reformed his business and appeared to be extraordinarily successful. It was that extraordinary success which caused me to get in contact with him.

To me, it appeared Satoshi was too successful. His business was small compared to the other suppliers in the area, but he was living a life of luxury. He drove a Bentley when the other guys drove BMWs. He had three houses in the most expensive areas of the city when the other guys had one. That kind of thing. I had a feeling he was into something extra.

Within an hour of our meeting, Satoshi said he could get me Bluefin for 80% below market price. To say I was surprised was an understatement. In fact, I laughed in his face. He remained serious, though, and insisted he wasnt making it up. 

Apparently, there was an area off limits to fishermen where Bluefin congregated in massive numbers. They were attracted to the warm water or something. Satoshis connections were in the Japanese coast guard, and theyd been planning a pretty big scam where their patrol boats got rigged with fishing gear and they could haul up Bluefin at night and sell them off at dawn. All they needed was a buyer. 

80% below market price. I didnt ask any questions and just said yes. I was fairly sure the police would break in through the windows and arrest me as soon as I shook Satoshis hand, but they didnt. Satoshi just smiled at me as I wrote him a check. He told me I should expect the first delivery in the morning.

True to his word, at 5am, an unmarked truck pulled up in front of my restaurant. Two men got out, opened the back of the truck, and pulled three gorgeous bluefin from the icy compartment. Two were flash-frozen, one was ready for preparation. They brought them into the kitchen, helped me put two in the freezer, and left without saying a word.

I broke down the unfrozen one. It was perfect. The meat was firm and succulent. The samples I tasted were as good as the expensive stuff. I say good despite the fact Im not actually a huge fan of the fish. Go figure. But I could still tell when I was tasting the real deal, and this most certainly was the real deal. I went and drew a huge advertisement on our sidewalk chalkboard. I was going to sell the bluefin dishes for half what my competitors were asking for. Then I went into the kitchen, started to prepare the fish, and felt relieved for the first time in as long as I could remember.

Dinner service was the busiest in the history of my restaurant. Word spread on social media and the place was packed from open to close. People whod never been able to afford bluefin showed up once they learned how low the price was. The night was spectacular. So was the following night. And the night after.

I was delighted to take home many, many bluefin dishes to Aiko. Shed been having a rare, multi-day stretch of lucidity, and it warmed my heart to see her eating her favorite food and relishing her time spent with me. If I could feed her the food she loved most and could actually afford to do it, I was going to. I couldnt remember the last time Id seen her happy.

I received delivery after delivery from Satoshis guys and was making money hand over fist. I was tight-lipped about where I was getting my supply, and the competitors were scrambling to keep up. Aiko drifted in and out like those with Alzheimers do; but no matter how far gone she was on some nights, she always perked up when I served her the bluefin she adored. 

I started to grow a bit concerned, though, because it looked like Aiko had developed a skin condition. Shed bruise very easily and her skin was so delicate. Her nurse would have to be extremely careful when brushing her teeth because her gums would bleed badly. I was told it was a nutritional deficiency. Aiko was given some injections to help bring her levels back to normal.

The customers kept coming to the restaurant but Aiko got worse every day. Her nurse said if she didnt start to show signs of improvement soon, shed have to bring her to the hospital. When I stroked my wifes hair, I was dismayed to see that some came out in my hand.

On a busy Saturday night, the nurse called me in a panic. Aiko had developed terrible, bloody diarrhea and was vomiting blood. Shed been rushed to the hospital and was in intensive care. I told the restaurant manager to take over and I sped to the hospital as quickly as possible.

Aiko was in a room by herself. She was stuffed with tubes and plugged with wires. Monitors displayed countless readouts that meant nothing to me. I stared at her from behind the glass and told the doctors I needed to go in and sit with her. They refused. I protested and fought, but I couldnt get through the door. It was locked. Behind the glass, a torrent of blood erupted from Aikos mouth. It filled the tube and poured out over the sides of her face. A door on the other side of the room opened and doctors wearing yellow suits and masks ran in. They closed the curtains and I was left with Aikos nurse. We cried together.

My cell phone rang. Satoshi. I dont know why I answered, but I did. He was beside himself with what sounded like terror. I barely could make out what he was saying, but in his panicky outbursts, I realized he was telling me something was wrong with the fish hed been selling me.

I demanded that he calm down and speak clearly. What about the fish, Satoshi?

You have to stop using it, he choked out, panic still tainting his voice.

Why?, I asked, as pinpricks of dread rose along my back and neck. All I heard on his end was weeping. Satoshi!, I yelled, causing the nurse to jump.

His voice trembled. I didnt know they were getting it from there.

Oh no, I breathed. I closed my eyes. Satoshi...where are they getting the bluefin?

An eternity passed as I listened to the man sob weakly into the phone.

I screamed his name with such violence I felt something in my throat tear.

In a tiny, almost childlike tone, Satoshi answered me.

Fukushima Bay.

The best part of starving to death is the knowledge that, right before I die, the person I see in the mirror will be the most beautiful person I can possibly be. No extraneous fat; no extraneous skin; no extraneous me. Just a pure distillation of my soul before its freed from the body that imprisons it. Its what I look forward to more than anything in the world. But I cant celebrate yet. Theres still too much of me. I have a lot of work to do.

Elaine was my ana buddy. We both knew I was better at it than she was. She told me how much I inspired her, and I believed it. It felt good to help my friend. Thats how it had been for the last couple years. When she started ranting and raving about this amazing girl Aida she met online whos the most inspirational person shed ever met, though, I felt a twinge of betrayal. Who was this girl and what was she telling my friend?

Elaine said Aida was a new member on our pro-ana message board. She likes to hang around in the Every Step Makes You Smaller fitness section. A runner, apparently. Id never needed to visit that section of the site, so I never noticed her. When Elaine started running, I only found out a week later when she arrived at my place unannounced. I was surprised. I live 30 miles from her. She didnt have a car and would refuse to take public transportation for some reason, so when she told me she ran, I believed her. Plus she was covered in sweat and panting like she was about to keel over.

You have to realize something: Im better than Elaine. Im lighter and more dedicated. I run on my treadmill three times a day until I make sure I burn every single calorie Ive eaten, plus another hundred. But never 30 miles. And Elaine was huge compared to me. Over 100lbs. Shed just burned 2300 calories in one run. Thats more than I eat in four or five days. She couldnt tell how jealous and angry I was through her exhaustion, which was good, because I needed to find out how she managed to do that.

This was the point Elaine mentioned Aida. She said Aida not only gave her amazing advice about how to run, but told her how to make a supplement that gave her so much energy and made each step feel like an amazing accomplishment. Like I said, I didnt know who Aida was, but when I heard this, I hated her. I hate shortcuts. I dont take supplements. Every pound Ive lost was through sheer determination and willpower. Shortcuts make you soft. Im not soft. Im not.

I am soft. If Im going to be honest, Ill admit to one shortcut. Mia. There are days I cant control myself and Ill eat a whole bag of gummi bears or two yogurts. Both fat free, but still too much. I could feel the space between my ribs filling in like canyons during a flash flood. Theres no worse feeling in the world than becoming more when all you dream about is being less. 

My index and middle fingers would manipulate the dime-sized, scarred spot on the back of my throat. It took so, so long. Id have to push hard and claw at the spot with my fingernails for ten straight minutes. It felt like I was reaching in and pulling the food up and out of me. Elaine was the only one who knew about it. Shed been doing that long enough to notice my Russells sign and even though she hadnt said anything to me or asked for tips, I was fairly certain she took some comfort in the fact she wasnt alone with mia. 

Thats something I hated about her. I bet it sounds like I was a bad friend, doesnt it? But I cant help it. Elaine thought she was like me when she wasnt. Im pure. My successes are through restriction. Through the abnegation of pleasure. Im an ascetic. Strong. Pure. Holy. 

Elaine Elaine was a disaster. She was corporeal and weak; she couldnt control her urges. After she stuffed herself, if her fingers werent down her throat trying to tickle the food out of her belly, a handful of laxatives were splashing in so she can shit everything out. Her teeth were brown and her cheeks were swollen with fluids. She thought we were the same. I am better.

And then she ran to my house. 30 miles. When the doorbell rang, I was washing multicolored jellybean vomit from my hand and wrist and forearm. 30 miles. Id scratched the surface off my scar so the back of my throat was bleeding and the cut was coated with stinging stomach acid. 30 miles and 2300 calories. I hadnt shit in 13 days and my disgusting, fat belly was distended like I was pregnant even though itd been two years since my last period. 30 miles, 2300 calories, and more excited than exhausted.

Elaine was winning. I had to let her tell me all about Aida and the supplements.

Aida was very private and didnt post progress pics. To me, I assumed that meant she was fat. That alone made me skeptical of any advice shed have to give. But 30 miles. Elaine and I browsed through Aidas post history and I learned a few things like how to run to minimize impact so you could run farther without injury. More running meant more calories burned. I made a mental note to incorporate that change into my running style. I also learned about sugar. Id been puking up all the extra sugar Id eat, but Aida said to run it off. If I made the changes to my running style and ran off the extra sugar rather than throwing it up, Id burn off what Id eaten, plus extra that would have just stayed as fat if Id thrown it up instead.

There were a few other, small tweaks. But the supplement was what I wanted to hear about. The shortcut. And I hated myself for it. But 30 miles. The supplement was pretty simple. It was a certain kind of mushroom mixed with caffeine powder and ephedra. Aida provided a link where we could get the chemicals online. Wed have to find the mushroom for ourselves. Elaine, however, already had all the stuff.

Elaine was beaming with pride and self-satisfaction. I knew she was delighted to finally be the one to provide inspiration. Shed followed me for so long. But now she was in the lead. Even though she was 100lbs to my 85, she was winning. Even though her cheeks were bouncy and fat while mine were streamlined and gaunt, she was winning. I asked if we could go back to her place so I could try the supplement. She grinned and said yes. We got into my car and headed over.

Elaines apartment was a disaster; food containers everywhere, photos of models and singers stapled to the walls, dishes piled on the counter next to the full sink, and the unmistakable, cloying scent of old vomit. I didnt care. My focus was on the supplement. I sat on her couch and waited while she went in the kitchen.

She emerged with two spoons perched on a plate. Inside each spoon was a paste of the mixture Aida had taught Elaine how to make. Mushrooms, caffeine, and ephedra. I asked her if she was going to run with me. She nodded. I didnt know how to feel about that. Elaine was going to do more than 30 miles and I had no idea how far Id go. I hoped Id be able to outrun her.

We swallowed the awful-tasting concoction and Elaine let me borrow some running clothes. They were extremely baggy. It wasnt long before I felt the effect of the supplement. It was not altogether unpleasant, but it was speedy. Like Id had too much coffee.

One she felt it kick in, we headed out. We ran at a brisk pace, keeping up with one another and not talking as we went. The effect of the supplement grew stronger. The speedy feeling remained, but another started to come in alongside it: satisfaction. Every step felt like it was making a huge, positive difference in my life. It reinforced my drive to take more and more steps. The sensation was wonderful.

My knee, which had been bothering me for the last few months, was perfectly fine after Id adjusted my stride to fit Aidas recommendation. Elaine chugged along next to me, staring straight ahead, with a trace of a smile on her lips.

Wed planned to run all the way back to my place. I figured if we couldnt make it, Id take the subway or a bus to Elaines to get my car and then Id pick her up. But I could tell, after the first three or four miles, we wouldnt be needing a car. 

Our feet slapped against the pavement and we picked up speed as we went. It was a powerful stride just like Id been capable of back when I ran track in high school. Before I realized I had to get smaller. Before I realized how much space I took up. But now, as the wind whistled by my ears, I knew this was how it would all end for me. This was the key to the success that had eluded me as I hovered pathetically between 83 and 86 pounds. 

I was all energy. I could feel my flesh clinging to my ribs and hips and collarbones and drawing ever inward; each protrusive bone an indication of my hard work and dedication. I was lost in my head for countless miles. I imagined running forever as my skin melted away and left a trail of useless waste behind me. Id be a perfect girl if I ran far enough - a creature of bone and momentum. Perfect, perfect me. And once I couldnt run anymore - once my body had given everything it had and Id traversed the world and shown every living person the power of my will - the last fragments of bone would splinter away and my soul would finally rise. I would be free.

A hand on my arm brought me back into reality. Elaine had grabbed me. We were in front of my apartment. I looked down at myself. My body was still there. Hatred and disappointment danced in a peristaltic wave through the sweating meat that trapped me. I plodded up the steps, took my key from around my neck, and we went inside.

Elaine stayed with me that night. As the days went by, we would run a lot together. When our feet ached and our shins felt as if theyd crumble from the relentless pressure of our motion, wed consult Aida, who was always there. Always online, as if shed been waiting for us.

Over time, the word got out to other ana girls in our city who used the forum. Sometimes there would be six or seven of us running together, all clattering bones and grim determination. All rushing toward our goal of zero. 

When Elaine and I werent collecting our disability checks, we were running. Every day, we would meet up and run together. My disdain for her began to evaporate as I watched her working as hard as I was. We inspired one another to go farther and farther, harder and harder. I was 74lbs. Elaine was still 100. The knuckles on her right hand were always freshly scabbed.

Today, the morning my scale hit 70 for the first time since I was 11 years old, I drove to Elaines. She didnt answer the door when I knocked. When I called her cell phone, she didnt answer. I let myself in using the key she kept hidden. I found what Id long anticipated.

Elaines gray face was hanging onto the toilet by her chin. The rest of her was curled in a loose ball. Vomit and dark blood covered the toilet and the floor around her. Textbook gastric rupture.

I felt very little while I looked at her corpse. She wasnt wearing clothes, and I found myself inspecting the curvature of her ribs and hips and comparing them to my own. Mine were more angular and obvious. Shed lost.

I headed over to Elaines computer. The pro-ana forum was onscreen. I clicked over to Every Step Makes You Smaller and found Aida there messaging with some young teens about how to run really far without their parents getting worried. When I interjected the news of Elaines death into the chat thread, the subject predictably changed to her. The teens made a big show of it, the older users said theyd pray or send positive vibes; all the obvious stuff.

Aida, though, sent me a private message. All it said was, dont call the police yet - watch what happens. So I did.

I went for a run. 45 miles. When I came back a few hours later, Elaine was different. Her skin was deeply porous and thin, wiry stalks pushed themselves from the center of each hole. Stringy, white stuff was growing out of her mouth and butt in thick clumps; one clump dangling in the bloody toilet water, the other pushing out across the floor.

I messaged Aida. The reply was instantaneous. Cut off the stalks and eat them. Dont worry, there are no real cals. Then you can go for a run. I promise, by the time youre done, youll be the person you want to be.

The last sentence was the most beautiful thing Id ever read. I cut the clumps, which I discovered were mushrooms, out of Elaine. I washed them, sliced them up, and ate them. I did my best to believe Aida that they didnt have calories.

Now Im going to do the next part. I wrote to the people on the forum and told them what I was going to do. They told me good luck and be safe; the default reply of the jealous people there who havent reached the point they dream about. Id given that reply before many times. All the while, though, I knew Id get there eventually. And now Im here.

I feel more energy than Ive ever felt in my life. My skin is different; its sticky and delicate. Its almost like it wants to come off. And thats what Ive worked so hard for. A girl of bones who runs away from the skin that traps her. By the time you read this - by the time Ive gone the hundreds or maybe even thousands of miles I know Ill be able to go - Ill be who Ive always wanted to be: no one at all. Perfect, weightless zero.

Thank you, Aida.

	<TEXT> I was seven the first time Grandpa invited me into the basement to see his safe. It was massive. Apparently, the original owners told him the house had to be built around it; there was no way it couldve been brought in afterward. When I asked him what was inside, he just smiled and said, maybe Ill tell you when youre older. I remember being frightened by that smile. Everything about my grandfather frightened me, to be honest. I was never able to put a finger on why, but the feeling was real. I dreaded whenever Mom said we were going to visit.

Every time Mom and I were there, his housekeepers would wait on us hand and foot. Even at an early age, I noticed how they seemed intimidated by my grandfather and were quiet, timid, and unwilling to speak unless they were spoken to. It was almost like theyd been traumatized. 

When I was 13, I learned an unsettling fact about the housekeepers: they were, in fact, his wives. The grandmother Id known, who died when I was very young, was merely one of nine. Mom didnt want to explain the whole thing to me. I could tell she was afraid of him, too. When I asked why shed chosen to keep in touch with him after Dad died, she told me I needed a male figure in my life. It sounded strange to me, but I never pressed the issue.

On the day before my 16th birthday, Mom said Grandpa wanted to take me hunting. I absolutely hated the idea. Being alone with my grandfather on his sprawling property which comprised countless acres of deep, dark woods was one thing, but the addition of guns to that already-unpalatable scenario basically made it the last thing Id ever want to do. I protested and argued and whined. Mom wouldnt have any of it. Hes done a lot for you over the years, she insisted. Youll go and youll be polite.

And that was that.

Mom woke me up before dawn on my birthday and drove me the two hours it took to reach Grandpas home. She didnt get out of the car. I knocked on the door and one of his wives, Gert, ushered me into the kitchen where there was a hearty breakfast waiting for me. Despite not being even remotely hungry, I gnawed on some bacon and shoveled some eggs into my mouth. I didnt want Grandpa to get angry at Gert for making food I didnt want to eat.

As I was finishing up, my grandfather came down the stairs. Despite being in his 70s, he was strong and enormous. His 66 frame dwarfed me; at over 300lbs, he was more than twice my weight, too. As usual, he grinned and exposed teeth that were too straight and too perfect for a man his age. I tried and failed to prevent gooseflesh from rising along my spine.

He greeted me with a cheery rendition of Happy Birthday, his deep voice resonating throughout the cavernous kitchen. I smiled at him and did my best to make it look like I was deeply appreciative. He asked if I was finished eating. I nodded. After instructing Gert to clean the place up, he put his massive right hand on my shoulder and told me to follow him.

I trudged along as he walked across the house to the basement door. He flipped the lightswitch and we walked down the thick, wooden stairs. He turned the corner at the bottom of the stairs and I immediately knew what he was going to show me. We stopped in front of the colossal, iron safe.

I think youre ready to see what Ive got in here, Grandpa informed me.

Excitement and fear churned in my breakfast-stuffed stomach. Id wondered what was in that safe for as long as I could remember. Now that I was about to find out, I was borderline terrified. What did he have in there that had needed to stay secret? Id learned he was a polygamist, and probably an abusive one, but he and my mother acted like it was a normal fact of life. What was so bad that he had to keep actively hidden from the world inside a safe the size of a small car?

Grandpa turned the old, chrome-plated combination lock a few times. I heard something unlatch from deep inside the iron bowels of the thing. With a grunt of effort, my grandfather pulled open the heavy door.

I let out the breath Id been unconsciously holding in one, long sigh. Inside was an arsenal of firearms. Rifles, shotguns, pistols, and countless boxes of ammunition.

John, he said, staring intently at my face, some of these guns arent legal anymore. Im showing them to you because youre family, I trust you, and these will be yours someday. I dont want you to tell anyone about whats in here because I could get in a lot of trouble.

I nodded my understanding and promised him I wouldnt say anything to anyone.

Good!, he exclaimed. Now pick one for yourself. Were going hunting.

I didnt know anything about guns. I thought back to the television shows Id watched and tried to remember what hunters used in them. I selected a long rifle-looking thing.

M1 Garand, Grandpa announced. Excellent!

He pulled the gun from the safe, loaded it with ammunition, and handed it to me. 

Keep it pointed at the ground and dont touch the trigger until youre ready to shoot something, he warned. He pulled another, similar-looking rifle from the safe, loaded it for himself, and picked out a small revolver, which he loaded and stuffed into his front pocket.

Come on, he boomed cheerily, lets go for a walk.

The morning was cold and the sun had barely started to rise. It was overcast and every so often, a flake or two of snow would float to the ground in front of my face. I stared at the ground while my grandfather walked ahead of me.

We walked at a brisk pace for what felt like an hour. The sun rose behind an overcast curtain and its light barely penetrated the dense, coniferous canopy above us. The longer we walked, the more unnerved I became. It seemed like the day was getting darker, not brighter, as the density of the forest swallowed nearly everything the shrouded sky could produce. I noticed animals as we walked, but they were all ignored by Grandpa. I wondered what it was we were hunting.

We passed deer, squirrels, rabbits, and raccoons. Eventually, growing tired of walking in silence and becoming increasingly aware wed have to walk the whole way back, too, I spoke up and asked where we were going and what we were hunting.

Without turning around, Grandpa replied. Ill be honest with you, John; were not hunting anything. Bears like to roam around these woods and Ive seen a lot of them over the years. They never bothered me, but I want us to be prepared in case todays any different.

I just said, okay, but I wondered why the hell we were out here in the first place if we werent actually going hunting. I didnt want to say it just like that to my grandfather, though, so I just asked, are we near where were going?

Grandpa stopped walking and turned around. That same, unnerving smile was plastered across his lined face. Just on the other side of that rock formation, he said, pointing. Come on.

Instead of going ahead, Grandpa slowed down and walked next to me. 

Youre a man now, John. Your father should be the one walking with you, not me. The good Lord saw it fit to take him when you were a baby, though, and I knew I had to step up and show you what that means.

We stopped at the rock formation. Well have to climb over.

Grandpa climbed next to me. It wasnt steep and the footing was solid. We moved easily. He kept talking.

Your mom told me a few years ago that you knew my housekeepers were actually my wives. And thats okay. I worried you might be confused, but you always surprised me by your maturity. Thats whats important to me. Not age.

We reached the top of the rock formation. I looked down at the forest below and started to climb down with him.

Its your job as a man to claim as many women as you want.

I thought about protesting, but I didnt dare interrupt. I let him continue.

Theyre yours. Its their duty to be there for you, to bear your children, and to take care of your needs, whatever they may be.

We climbed down in silence for a few minutes, as if he wanted to make sure I had time to reflect on the importance of what hed just said. A little while later, we reached the forest floor.

When your Dad died, he started, his voice breaking with emotion that he quickly swallowed, I was put in a difficult position. He was my son, and my son embraced the tradition of all the men in our family; me, my father, his father, his father, and so on.

The trees seemed much taller than before. The forest on the other side of the rock formation was older than what wed been walking through, and even darker. I had to squint to see, even though, when I snuck a look at my phone, it was almost 10am. 

You have a unique family tree, John. Remember, your father respected the tradition of the family. That means your mother was not his only wife.

This news made my head spin. I didnt remember much about Dad, but I always thought he was a decent, caring person. Hearing he was anything like my grandfather was a terrible revelation.

Like I said, I was put in a difficult situation. Your father had 12 wives. For whatever reason, despite him impregnating all of them, only one gave birth to a boy. Your mother.

I felt mildly dizzy. You mean I have sisters? I asked, hating that my voice cracked an octave higher on the last syllable of the sentence.

12 of them. One of your fathers wives had twin girls.

Can I meet them? My voice was back to its normal pitch. I sounded calm and oddly hopeful, despite the intense discomfort I felt.

A womans duty is to serve the men in her life, John. Your mom had you, and it became her duty to serve you. When your father died, the other wives couldnt serve anyone. They no longer had any purpose. Its not like the daughters could have carried the family name.

I understand, I said, not understanding. So Ill never get to meet them?

John. They lost their only purpose in life. The daughters couldnt carry the family name. What purpose could they have had?

I stared into Grandpas eyes. Their intense blue was startlingly bright against the gloom of the forest. As wed stood and talked, the clouds had given way to partial sunshine. It was still dark, but I could see more than 10 feet in front of me.

I asked you a question, John. What purpose could they have had?

I shifted in place with acute awareness of how uneasy and timid I must have looked to the giant man in front of me. It was obvious I needed to tell him what he needed to hear.

They didnt have any purpose at all, Grandpa. The words felt disgusting as they came out of my mouth.

The smile returned to his face. Good boy, John. He paused before he spoke again. Good boy.

We stared out at the endless forest ahead of us. I got ready to ask if we could start heading back before Grandpa spoke again.

I had to make things right after your father died. He pointed up, over his head. No waste.

I started to shake as a feeling of dread suffused throughout my body. Grandpa kept his hand raised with his finger pointing up. Despite not wanting to look, I craned my neck and stared into the shadowy canopy. It didnt take long before I realized what he was pointing at. I gasped with such force I began to choke.

Skeletal bodies in ragged clothing hung from the branches above. Some were big, some were small. Some were tiny. All were dead. Long, long dead.

Meet your stepmothers and your stepsisters, John. I know you dont remember them, but they all loved you and your father very much.

Tears streamed down my face as rage began to replace my fear. Did you -

I did, he declared. There was pride in his voice.

He watched as I raised my rifle and pointed it at his barrel chest. You dont need to, John. Ill take care of it so you dont have to. He produced the pistol from his jacket pocket and held it against his temple.

Ive done my part, John. I know you wont actually shoot me, but youll report what happened here and Ill be arrested. Im going to make it easy for you and take care of the ugly part myself.

He tightened his grip on the pistol. Let what I told you sink in, John. Talk to your mother about it. She knows all about this. Shell help you. Its her job to help you. Youll see it my way when youre a little older.

A breeze whistled through the trees. Above us, I heard the ragged dresses on the bodies rippling in the wind. My mind wandered to the poor women back at grandpas house; women whod been abused for decades by a man who thought they were nothing but property. The thought of how theyd been so conditioned over that time to buy into the hideous tradition of the awful man in their lives prompted a terrifying realization.

Your...your wives, I choked out. What will happen to them?

That repulsive smile gashed my grandfather face as he spoke. They knew why we were coming out here, John. And they knew only you were coming back. Im sure they did what they needed to while weve been away.

A sob burst from my lips as I thought about Gerts sad smile while she watched me eat the birthday breakfast shed made for me. 

The clicking of the guns hammer being cocked caused me to look back up at my grandfather. He stared into my eyes with an intensity Id only seen from animals about to maul their prey.

Happy Birthday, John. Dont ever forget the day you became a man. And dont forget what it means to be one. Tradition over all, John. Tradition over all.

He took the gun from the side of his head and placed it in his mouth. He squeezed the trigger and dropped heavily to the soft blanket of pine needles on the forest floor. Blood gushed from his mouth and nose. 

I stood, motionless, watching the blood drain out of his head. Sounds of the forest gradually replaced the ringing in my ears. Birds chirped. Squirrels chittered. Branches clattered. Dresses fluttered.

	<TEXT> Ryan, a handsome boy in red, felt his arm growing tired. His two sisters, Madison in white and Regina in sky blue, looked around for things that might be able to help.

While their loving dad kept watch, Madison trawled for seaweed. She noticed Ryan was uncomfortable and tried to rush. Luckily for her brother, the pressure pushing against his arm had diminished and he was able to straighten up. Hurry up!, he yelled to Madison and Regina. He was the most impatient one in the family. 

Dont yell at your sisters, scolded Dad. Still, he gently encouraged them to move faster. 

Time is a factor, kids, he informed them.

Madison brought the seaweed over to Ryan while Regina was arriving with a few heavy rocks. Regina set them down in front of where her brother was standing. She went back a few times and carried over more. Madison crouched, her butt in the water, and focused on slipping the seaweed underneath and around the rocks.

Dad stood, hands on his hips, and called out, How does it look, kids?

I think were done!, shouted Madison.

Dad looked back up the beach and all around. Then he strode out to where his kids had been working.

You all did SUCH a great job! He grabbed them in a bear hug and they stood, watching as the tide come in over the area where theyd done such good work.

They walked together about a hundred feet down the beach and stood on the shore.

Now remember kids, mom will be back in a few minutes. What do we do when we see her coming?

Regina piped up. We pretend cry and look around in the water!

Thats right! How about you, Ryan, what are you going to say?

Ryan stood proudly with his hands on his hips. I say that Jason fell out of my hug into the ocean when a wave came and we cant find him.

Atta boy!, Dad crowed. He turned to Madison. Maddie, are you excited to have your bedroom all to yourself again? No more crib and no more crying?

Madison smiled shyly at her tall, strong father. Yes Daddy, she said.

Good!, Dad exclaimed, grinning. And now your mom and I can have more money to buy you guys presents for being such great kids. He glanced over to his left. And I think that person walking waaaaay down the beach is Mom. You all ready?

Yeah!, the kids yelled in unison.

Go for it!, encouraged Dad, blinking away the tears of pride that had started to well up in his eyes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [*Tumblr.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4nh4od/something_horrible_is_happening_to_me_on_tumblr/) [*Reddit.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4nvybw/something_horrible_is_happening_to_me_on_reddit/) [*Facebook.*](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4o23lg/something_horrible_is_happening_to_me_on_facebook/)

So. Many. Penises. Since Eugene left me, I must have looked at a thousand of them. Cut, uncut, black, mocha, tan, pink, beige, thick, thin, long, hairy, shaved, trimmed, veiny, smooth, micro, macro, and even the elusive gargantuan. Ill be honest with you, though: its not even like I was open to the idea of a hookup at that point. It was still too soon. The emotions were too raw. That said, I wasn't going to be ashamed of myself for looking at pictures of dicks to help pass the time. I like dicks. 

After a few weeks of browsing, I started involving myself in actual chats. You know, more than the basic you show me yours and Ill show you mine type of stuff Id been doing. Most guys didnt really want to talk about much; they were more interested in meeting up and banging. I wasnt ready for that, though. I was polite enough with my rejections, and most of them were cool with it. Not all, but most.

One afternoon last month, a guy named Dion sent me a message. I almost fainted. He was gorgeous. It looked like hed been carved from onyx and sculpted by Michelangelo himself. We chatted for a while. Pretty easily, too. Not once did he hint at a hookup, and rather than advertising himself with below-the-waist pictures, the most risque photo he sent to me was him standing shirtless in his sweatpants.  

He told me hed just gone through a breakup, too, and wanted to take things slowly. It was music to my ears. Well, eyes, since wed only been chatting via text at that point. But those text chats turned into multi-hour chat sessions. After a couple days, I gave him my number. We talked on the phone more than Id ever talked to anyone. Even Eugene, and were together for seven years. Something about Dion just seemed right. I got the impression he felt the same way about me, too.

As it turned out, Dion worked for a company that advertised on Grindr. He asked if Id seen their stuff, and then he described what the ads looked like. As soon as he mentioned one particular feature, I definitely know what he was talking about. It was an awful ad. It took up the whole screen and flashed colors in a way I found somewhat unsettling. To make it worse, it was almost impossible to hit the close button at the top, which I was fairly certain moved around slightly to prevent it the ad from being turned off.

He laughed a little and apologized for that part. He said the programmers might have been a little overzealous. The customer wanted it that way, though, and since Grindr hadnt explicitly disallowed that type of thing yet, they were going to use it and reap the benefits of the ad being displayed for those extra few seconds. 

When I asked Dion what the company sold, since the ad really didnt give me much of an idea, he was tight-lipped. He couldnt talk about that stuff, apparently. I was okay with that. We hadnt even met in person, yet. I didnt expect him to disclose any top-secret information to someone who was still essentially a stranger. 

Our conversations continued to go well and we were ready to take the next step. On Tuesday, we decided to meet. His office wasnt far from my apartment. We met at a nearby park. I knew he was tall, but my first impression I got when we met was that he was a giant. Im 511, but Dion had to have been 68. Funny, wed never even talked about height. He gave me the biggest, warmest hug when we finally stood together. I pecked his cheek a little more shyly than Id intended, and we headed to the restaurant wed both heard was great but never visited.

Dinner was spectacular and the company was even better. Our chemistry was obvious and intoxicating. We laughed and flirted and had a truly wonderful time with one another. Afterward, he walked me home. We made out in front of my apartment building for a minute or two, but we both agreed we should wait for at least the second date before getting too physical. But we promised one another there would definitely be a second date. He asked if it could be tomorrow. I winked at him and I told him Id call in the morning.

Once I got back into my apartment, my sexual frustration had reached a Krakatoan peak. And what do I do when Im sexually frustrated? I look at dicks. So I looked at dicks. I started off on Grindr, but after a while I started feeling a little guilty. Sure, it was just innocent fun and flirting with strangers, but even though Dion and I werent exclusive or even in an actual relationship at all, it didnt feel right. Besides, right when Id decided to move on to porn, those damn ads on Grindr kept showing up and distracted the hell out of me. The flashing lights and awful close buttons had me feeling pissed off at Dion for even being tangentially involved with them. Anger wasnt something I wanted to feel when I was in the mood to jerk off and go to sleep.

After Id closed the program, those awful, blinking ads stuck with me. It was like when you look into the sun for too long and have the image burned into your retinas. But my sex drive overshadowed any temporary vision problems. To PornHub I went. Their gay section had gotten SO much better over the last couple years. I browsed for a while until I found a clip Id loved a day or so ago. I clicked it and fast forwarded to the action, but I felt growing nausea as it all went on. I started to worry Id gotten food poisoning. To make matters worse, it wasnt the exact clip from the other day after all. The beginning part was the same, but right toward the end, instead of the originally delicious money shot scene, someone had spliced in some awful, gory nonsense that totally took me out of the mood. 

I went to bed, but my stomach still hurt and I had nightmares about stuff I cant remember. Yesterday, I called Dion like Id promised. I told him I wasnt feeling too well, and I asked him if he felt off after dinner too. He said he felt fine, and then asked if we should cancel our plan for him to come over later in the day. Not wanting to be a disappointment, I said no way. Besides, I really did want to see him.

An hour or so before he got there, I decided to watch some porn again. My stomach was feeling a bit better and I figured if Dion and I might get physical for the first time, Id want the performance to last a little longer than the 19 seconds I figured it would with someone as attractive as him. Back to PornHub I went.

Again, nausea. To make matters worse, whoever had screwed with the clip Id enjoyed so much was doing the same thing to other videos. Right when the action was at its peak, thered be a scene of something completely terrible. A dead baby. Someone getting raped. A guy with his lower jaw blown off. A woman with her face melted from acid. Im pretty open to basic kinks, but that stuff was above and beyond anything I wanted to see. It was straight-up horror and snuff. My sex drive dried up and I was left dealing with my floppy dick and a hell of a stomach ache. The perfect way to start a potentially-hot date.

Dion arrived around suppertime. Id gathered my senses in the meantime and had prepared some baked salmon, quinoa salad, and a cheese board. He was absolutely awestruck by the food. I guess he wasnt much of a chef and none of his other dates had cooked something so nice for him. That felt good to hear. 

He devoured the food with enthusiasm and I did my best to match his voraciousness, but my stomach was really bothering me. I tried to hide it, though, and I dont think he noticed. The rest of the night progressed like Id hoped. After dinner and wine and some fancy hipster ice cream Dion had brought, we were both feeling good. Well, horny. I didnt feel good. The wine wed consumed helped take the edge off my stomach pain, but while we were making out on the couch, I was feeling worse and worse. My sex drive was in charge, though, and I powered through the nausea and before too long, we were down to our underwear and getting ready to have some real fun.

I was thankful my nausea hadnt diminished my physical ability to get aroused. I was sporting quite a rager that Dion seemed quite interested in. Still, he refused to touch me. He preferred to tease with kisses on my lips, neck, and cheeks. Meanwhile, I was pawing at him and practically tearing off his underwear. He resisted, though. Dion got up and stood in front of me. He looked like a Greek god. Then slowly - maddeningly slowly - he inched his underwear down.

My vision started to blur as his anatomy came into view. My nausea overpowered me in a pulsating wave. Dion stood naked only two feet away, but around him emerged a scenario of abject horror and depravity. Screaming children clutched the remains of their dismembered mothers torsos as faceless, horribly-misshapen men poked and prodded at them with their bulbous, skinless erections. Other bodies were hanged by their own bowels in the ghosts of trees and posts; the contents of their entrails drizzling down onto the dead and the rapists below. 

I opened my mouth, unsure if I was going to scream or vomit. Instead, I just mouthed the word help to Dion, and as my consciousness waned from the panic I felt, I saw Dion smiling at me, his genitals replaced by a glistening caldera of gore. It was the last thing I saw before I passed out.

I dont know how long I was out. When I woke up, I found Id collapsed to the floor with my face resting in a puddle of salmon and quinoa vomit. The scene of impossible violence was gone. Dion was dressed and standing near the door, talking on his cell phone.

*Im sorry to bother you so late, Reverend. Yes, this is Dion. I just wanted to let you know Ive had remarkable success with our first test subject. Yes, thats right. I believe hes been entirely reprogrammed. Yes sir, thats correct. Zero ability to act on his desires.*

I listened without moving as horror and dread came rushing back.

*Thank you, sir. Ill direct the company to proceed with more ad buys in all metropolitan markets. Thank you, I realize how important this success is. God bless you too, Reverend.*

Dion opened the door and walked out. I used the couch to pull myself to my feet. I called the police and demanded to speak with a detective, but when I finally got one on the phone, I could swear I heard him laughing to himself when he said hed check it out. I havent heard from anyone since. This all happened last night. Now, on message boards all over, Im seeing people complaining about the flashing, hard-to-close ads that are showing up on Grindr. Those same people are complaining about how theyre not feeling well after having to see them. 

Whoever reads this, please help. I dont know what to do.

I dont know shit about Facebook. I started an account late last year to promote my website. Not much happened. I plugged my Facebook address pretty much everywhere I went, and while fans trickled in and one or two even shared some of the content I posted, my page wasnt growing nearly as quickly as Id hoped.

Fast forward a couple months. Same problem. In total, I think my page was stuck around 100 likes. The majority of those were from the first week I started the page and a bunch of nice Reddit users felt sympathy for me and visited, clicked like, and never came again. I cant blame them, to be honest.

I was in a creative rut. Very little new content was coming out, and whatever did reach completion was nothing but a rehashing of older, more popular stories Id done in the past. I was hoping to piggyback on their successes. It didnt work. It was obvious that interest was waning. 

All this was coming at a bad time. My Tumblr, which had done spectacularly well for the first four months of its existence, was also stagnating. Followers were disappearing. Again, I cant blame them. Why follow a blog that just reposts old stories without putting anything out thats new or interesting? Id reached a point where I was starting to think writing wasnt for me and Id have to rethink everything Id envisioned for my future.

Out of nowhere, sometime in April, I got a notification on Facebook that my page had been mentioned. I clicked through, and was astonished to find out that a page with nearly 10 million fans had posted one of my older stories and had credited my own Facebook page as the content creator. Messages and likes came in droves. Friend requests, too. 

I didnt know what to do with all the newfound interest in my work. My creativity hadnt been piqued by it all, but my enthusiasm had reemerged. I chatted with people who messaged me, I gave advice to aspiring writers, despite not really believing any of what I was saying, and I even agreed to collaborate with another, semi-well known author on a piece at some point in the fall.

As April progressed, more and more people were visiting my page and inhaling my old content. Each day, Id spend hours replying to notifications and messages; sometimes holding 10 real-time conversations at once. It felt good to be connecting with people again. Its something I hadnt really done at all since high school, and that was almost 20 years ago.

I grew close with a few of the people whod been messaging me. People from all over the world, in fact. We chatted about nothing and everything, to use a cliche that I despise but find impossible to avoid. The more we talked, the closer we got. There were about 25 people out of the hundreds who I really felt a connection with. I think it was mutual, too. We chatted together on Facebook, and then we started doing group emails.

In May, Charles, one of the 25, suggested a meetup. Obviously for some of them, it was impossible. Quite a few were way too far away for that to be possible for them, but 8 or 9 of us were all within around 300 miles of one another. After working through some logistical issues, we made it happen. Seven people showed up. I got to meet seven, wonderful people: Charles, Lynn, Malcolm, Anita, Bev, Mellie, and Raj. 

We met up at a small restaurant in the Tribeca area of NYC. We chatted and laughed and had an all-around fantastic time. I enjoyed myself and my new friends more than I can even express. But it was Bev who really stood out. 

Wed grown close online, but I never had any hope of getting much closer than that. It all changed when we met. While we all shared stories and jokes and beers around the table, Bev and I held hands. She squeezed my fingers with her own and I stroked her wrist and toyed with her bracelet. During the brief glances we shared with one another, we both knew something special was happening. 

When it was obvious the night was coming to an end and everyone headed back to their respective hotel rooms or homes, Bev and I remained together. We headed back to her hotel room and let things take their natural course. It was truly wonderful.

After it was all over, Bev got up from the bed to take a shower. I propped myself up with my laptop on my lap, happily reminiscing about the time not only she and I had spent together, but the time all eight of us had shared hours earlier. I decided to go on Facebook and leave individual messages for my new friends to show how much I appreciated them.

While clicking through to where I needed to go, I realized Id never even visited their pages before. Wed all just chatted either on my page or through email. I clicked on Malcolms first. It was weird. A lot of his friends had posted some pretty depressing emo stuff on his wall. I wrote my little thank you paragraph, and then headed over to Charles page.

Same thing. Just sad stuff. I wrote my letter and moved on. Lynn, Raj, and Mellies were the same. A strange feeling started inside my chest and gradually bloomed outward while gooseflesh prickled my limbs. 

I clicked on Anitas wall. More depressing messages. One in particular caught my eye: Well always you love, Anita. You will always be our beautiful, sweet daughter. It was from her parents. Dated 2011.

The feeling of discomfort and dread intensified. I went back to all the other pages Id just been to and scrolled down. All the depressing messages were from between 2009 and 2016. They all had something in common: they were saying some variant of goodbye.

Doing my best to control my breathing, I navigated to the one page I hadnt visited yet. Bevs. The message on her wall, dated February 2nd, 2016: God bless you and keep you - you were taken from us far too soon, sweet girl. 

A loud thud sounded from the bathroom, causing me to jump. I got up, quietly asking Bev? Bev, are you okay? No response. I walked slowly toward the bathroom, a sense of doom weighing down my body. I knocked on the door. No reply. Just the sound of water running. I turned the doorknob and entered the bathroom.

The room was steamy and warm with an intense, unpleasant odor. Bev? I asked, my head starting to spin with fear. I gripped the shower curtain between my thumb and forefinger and carefully pulled it open. I screamed. Hot water streamed down the remains of a bloated, rotting corpse. Stringy blonde hair was plastered to the side of a gray face with a purple tongue bulging through lips that looked like dark-green banana slugs. Grayish-yellow slime drooled from between her legs and puddled thickly near the drain. Before I could turn away and throw up, I saw the bracelet on her wrist that Id played with at the restaurant.

I heaved and retched into the toilet, trying to tell myself this was all impossible and Bev was alive and normal and everything was okay. I closed my eyes and turned around to face the tub. I made the sign of the cross, opened my eyes, and nearly fainted with relief. The bathtub was empty. I inhaled. The smell, for the most part, was gone. I sank to the floor and tried to collect myself.

The horror Id felt was replaced with an immediate concern for my own mental health. I didnt know if I should call 911 right away or go to the hospital first thing in the morning and get checked out. I dragged myself to my feet and headed toward the bedroom to lie down for a few minutes. As I was crossing between the rooms, I glanced in the garbage can next to the sink. My used condom sat inside like a deflated grub, covered in grayish-yellow slime.

	<TEXT> I started up a Tumblr blog last November so I could get better exposure for my writing. I was surprised by how quickly it took off. Theres a big horror subculture that seems to enjoy the type of stuff I write, so it didnt take long before Id gotten well over 10,000 followers and was cruising along pretty well. As the blog got more established, though, some frightening things started to happen.

Before I go on, I need to give a little background info. For those who dont know how Tumblr works, they have something called reblogging, which just means you repost something that someone else had put on their blog. It shows up in your own blog with the creators name linked to it. It basically can allow content to go viral very quickly. Like, you can post something and then someone with a large and established blog might reblog it to all their hundreds of thousands or millions of followers, who can then do the same, and over and over and over until it eventually dies down.

Obviously, wanting to spread my stories and brand as far and wide as I possibly could, I sought out opportunities to get my content reblogged by one of those well-established bloggers. After a month or so, it happened. A story of mine got shared well over a thousand times. I gained hundreds of followers. That type of thing happened on many occasions over the following months, leading me to where I was late this April. 

In April, after one story did particularly well, I started getting weird messages in my inbox. All of them said something similar. Something along the lines of, hey I reblogged your story and started getting really personal messages from you - can you please not?

I was shocked. I thought someone had hacked my account and was spreading harassing messages around. The prospect of someone ruining my reputation before I ever got a chance to really get my writing out there terrified me. As the days went on, more and more people started telling me that Id sent them unsettling messages. 

On April 22nd, when the influx of notifications had slowed and Id changed my password about 100 times, I was starting to think it had all blown over. Id posted another story that was met with surprising success. As I watched the reblogs fly and the new followers accumulate, I got a message from a woman named Beverly. All it said was, *I never told anyone about that abortion. Get the fuck out of my head.*

Five minutes later, from a man named Arjay: *But my mom swore she never told anyone about my accident with my cousin.* 

Then more came.

Dana: *Fuck you! I couldnt have stopped that car from hitting him!*

Janelle: *Who are you? My father never so much as spanked me. Message me again and Ill call the police.*

Muhammad: *I didnt expect him to join and now hes dead and youre harassing me about it? Who the hell are you?*

Vivian: *STOP STOP STOP STOP STOP!*

Martin: *She was just lying there. I couldnt help myself. Please dont tell.*

I was terrified. I wrote a frantic email to Tumblr staff begging them to see if they could track what was going on and stop it. They never replied. More and more and more notes flooded my inbox. Every single message was from someone whod reblogged one of my stories. Every single message claimed Id brought up something to them that was deeply personal; something theyd never told anyone before; sometimes things they never even knew themselves.

I stopped visiting Tumblr for few days and deleted all the email notifications I had about new messages. I tried to keep myself from panicking. It had to be some sort of joke or the work of an extremely determined hacker. My therapist, who only knew I was getting unwanted messages, got me to calm down. He got me agree to give it a month before I visited the site again, and I could figure out a plan of action to either get the messages to stop or to be able to ignore them without panicking.

I took his advice. A little over month later, which was just last week, I went back. I discovered my number of followers had gone from 13,000 to 4,000. So much of what Id worked to build was gone. The fear of what had happened coupled with the immense frustration I felt from losing what Id dedicated so much time to. My decades-vanquished anxiety and depression returned with a vengeance. 

As I went through my page stats, I saw no one had reblogged one of my stories in three weeks. Part of me knew I had to try to get a handle on the situation and take whatever steps were necessary to get back to where I had been. I waited for a time when it looked like the site was getting a lot of traffic, and then I reblogged one of my older, more popular stories. I prayed it would attract some new followers. Followers that hadnt heard about my ruined reputation. 

No one bit. There wasnt any indication anyone had read it whatsoever. It was like Id just thrown the story into interstellar space, never to be seen again. An hour or two passed. I checked the stats. Still just one reblog - my own. I glanced up at the toolbar and saw there was a message waiting for me. The hair on the back of my neck stood at attention and my hand shook as I moved the cursor to click the icon.

*I watched you eat your little sister. Your little twin sister. Consumed in utero. Before she even knew what pain was, it was the only sensation she ever felt in her short life.* 

The message was from me.

	<TEXT> I cant remember the last time wed had such a hot summer. All the beaches were packed. You couldnt find a shoreline that wasnt teeming with people. Most summers, we wouldve been right there with them. This last school year, though, had been rough. Wed had an inordinate number of encounters with bullies, and the last thing we wanted to do was put ourselves in a place where theyd almost certainly be.

That caution came with a price, of course. We were sweltering. Fans did nothing. Every time we opened the freezer to grab a chunk of ice, wed get yelled at for letting all the cold air out. It seemed like everything we did, it only served to make us hotter and more miserable. 

My brother had an idea that sounded pretty great to me. Thered been construction going on near the old quarry that was on hold for some reason. Donny said hed been snooping around there the week before and he noticed there was still a lot of water from the spring floods thatd gotten trapped and hadnt dried up yet. Plus, the quarry was deep enough to be in its own shadow; the walls went up at least 30 feet. Itd be a climb to get down and back up, but it was worth the risk if it meant getting a break from the heat.

We hopped the fence and stared down at the water. It looked pretty damn refreshing. The way down was steep and rocky, but Donny and I were both pretty agile at the time. We went slowly, despite dripping with sweat and coating ourselves with dust and bits of gravel. When we got to the bottom, it was already a relief. The air was ten degrees cooler and the shade provided a welcome reprieve from the mid-day sun.

There was a long branch near the edge of the pool. Since the water was murky, we didnt want to take a chance and dive in. Both of us remembered how Leon Hollis broke his neck back in 3rd grade. Neither of us were going to make that same mistake. I reached in with the stick and pushed down and around. It felt about two or three feet deep. I let out more and more of the branch into the water and felt the soft, muddy ground underneath. We couldnt do a proper dive, but we sure as hell could jump in. That was all Donny needed to hear.

In the blink of an eye, Donny had stripped out of his clothes. I hadnt even finished saying, Jesus Christ, Don, dont take your fucking underpants off too! before he was stark naked and mid-air in a bellyflop position. He crashed into the still water, sending out a massive wave to soak the muddy shore. I was untying my shoes when Donny spluttered to the surface. He looked different. 

Donnys pale body was covered in a mosaic of black and brown shapes. I mean covered. He was more brown and black than he was white, and as he staggered toward me with his arms out so they wouldnt touch his sides and his legs bowed so they wouldnt rub together, I realized what they were. Leeches. Hundreds - maybe even a thousand - leeches.

He began to scream. It was a shrill, high-pitched shriek that Id only heard from girls on the playground at school, but with them, it was only while they were playing. The sound coming from my brother was one of abject terror. As he screamed, he formed the words, help me and moved closer and closer to the shore, away from the water. By the time Id gotten over to him, he fell on his back into the soft mud, his head inches from the shore.

I stood over him, unsure of what I should do. He began rubbing his hands over his trunk, trying to unlatch the things from his belly and chest. Blood smeared as their bodies burst under his touch. My horror stunned me for a moment, and as I stared with shock at my brothers body, I noticed details for the first time.

There was a leech stuck to his left eyeball. It hung down about 3 inches, its body fat with blood. The eye was red and angry looking and Donny was blinking furiously, and probably unconsciously, to get the thing off. One leech was attached to the head of his penis and there were seven on his scrotum and perineum. Under his arms were the remains of at least six that had been smashed as Donny rubbed and pulled at the ones on his torso.

Finally, I snapped out of it and began raking my nails across the creatures that covered my brother. He was a red mess. I tried to pick up my pace, noticing how, even under the shroud of blood, I could tell Donny was getting increasingly pale and weak. His arms didnt move much anymore and his screams had devolved into wheezes. 

I ran back to where wed left our clothes and returned with a large beach towel. I wadded it up and scrubbed Donny up and down, not caring if I crushed the things instead of just removing them. They needed to die, and quickly, or else I was certain my brother would be exsanguinated. I rubbed his face and chest and legs and feet until there was nothing left pulp from their devastated bodies and the smeared blood theyd stolen from Donny.

I knelt next to Donny and tried to get him to focus. I told him I was going to run for help and he was going to be okay. His good eye moved to meet my face. Back, he muttered.

Yes, Ill be back as soon as I can, I assured him, and got up to run home.

Donny grabbed my ankle in his weak fist. I stopped and looked at him impatiently, not understanding how he didnt see how time was a factor here.

Back, he said again. My back. He exhaled a long, low breath. He didnt move or say anything after that.

A column of frost coalesced along my spinal cord. With great care, not wanting Donnys face to sink into the mud, I turned my brother over and screamed. On his back were two leeches, each the size of a watermelon. No longer trapped between the mud and Donny, they detached their probosci, each of which were as long as my middle finger. Then, with their bodies full and their appetites sated, they began the slow crawl back into the water.

**Bryce**: Your name, please.

**Henry**: Hi! Im Henry! Are you ready to hear about what I saw?

*(Henry wiggles excitedly in his chair, displaying an exuberance which belies his age.)*

**Bryce**: Your full name, please.

**Henry**: Henry Revis Newton! I saw the most beautiful things on that day. Do you have any children?

*(Henry stops wiggling and stares at Bryce intently.)*

**Tyson**: What happened to the population of your town, Henry?

**Henry**: Angels, beautiful. Beautiful angels. I bet you have children.

**Bryce**: Can you describe the angels, Henry?

**Henry**: You know, Ive had some time to think about that! It happened so quick, like just a flash, but I think I saw something big.

*(Henry emphasizes the word big in his speech and attempts to move his hands to illustrate the size, but such motion is prevented by his bindings.)*

**Tyson**: Can you elaborate on what was so big, Henry?

**Henry**: Oh I dont know how to describe it, it was so strange. There was that scary flash, and while I was falling off my bike do you folks have my bike I got a glimpse of something, like, well you know when you would get film developed and sometimes thered be another picture on top of your own picture? It was like that but I couldnt tell what was on top. But it covered everything. Even my hands and the ground and under shadows.

**Tyson**: Can you give any more information on what it might have looked like?

**Henry**: Do you know if my family is safe? I havent gotten to kiss them in what feels like forever.

*(Henry rocks back in forth in his chair. His eyes moisten.)*

**Tyson**: Can you give an---

**Henry**: Youre lucky I dont have a dirty mind.

*(Henry winks at Tyson.)*

**Tyson**: Can you please answer the question, Henry?

**Henry**: It was thick. Heavy looking. Even though it was huge, it still looked extra heavy for its size, if that makes sense. Maybe bulbous is the right word? I dont know. I just want to tell you what happened after.

*(Henry begins to wiggle again.)*

**Tyson**: Were there any identifying marks or patterns on the big thing?

*(Henry giggles.)*

**Bryce**: Henry?

**Henry**: No, none that I can recall.

**Henry**: Finally you ask! Angels, my friend. Every man, woman, and child. All beautiful, naked angels.

**Bryce**: What makes you think they were angels, Henry?

**Henry**: You just had to see them there in the sunlight. All open and exposed. No lies left in them. Nothing to hide. So light with no more parts inside. Ready for heaven.

*(Henry beams with beatific contentment.)*

**Henry**: Funny thing, that! When I was falling off my bike and saw that scary big thing imposed on everything around, there was this really loud noise. But in the background, as silly as it sounds, it almost sounded like people screaming and moaning. And not like they were hurt, if you get my meaning.

*(Henry winks at Tyson and Bryce. Henry licks his lips.)*

**Tyson**: What do you think happened? Use your imagination if you want.

**Henry**: I miss my family.

Funny, I never thought Id be in a position where I could type something like that. Well, here I am! Actually - here we are. Me and my wife, Ingrid. Talk about an amazing vacation. Its interesting, Im going to be dead soon. Ill be honest with you, though: Im not even a little bit bothered. Hear me out.

When Ingrid and I stumbled upon that cave and did some impromptu spelunking, I was a little concerned we might get lost. Luckily, It became pretty obvious after the first few minutes that we wouldnt. The cave was small. The interior, though, was unlike any cave Id ever seen. It was absolutely brimming with mushrooms. All different kinds; some looked like portobellos, some were stringy and white and hanging from the ceiling like hair, and there were even some of those fat weird ones that smoked when you broke them open.

Ingrid and I are vegans and excellent chefs. On top of that, we love mushrooms. Ingrids good at picking out which of the ones in our yard are safe to eat, so I let her determine whether or not the ones in the cave were okay to bring home for dinner. To my surprise, she couldnt tell! Shed never seen mushrooms like that before. Sure, there were lots of similar ones out there, but we didnt want to chance it. I was disappointed; if we couldve eaten those, we wouldve had a dinner for the record books.

Anyway, we kept walking. We got these great flashlights from my father-in-law for Christmas and they did an awesome job illuminating the path for us. As we went, the smoky mushrooms and the portobello ones started to appear less frequently. The stringy ones, though, were everywhere. They clung to the ceiling like white tendrils and we had to push them out of the way with every step we took. We didnt know where we were going, but it felt like an adventure through an alien world. 

Right when we thought the stringy mushrooms couldnt get any thicker and we were tearing off handfuls just to keep moving forward, we came to a clearing. It was the rear of the cave. There was nothing there except one extremely large and extremely weird-looking fungus. I dont know if it was a mushroom or what. It had a cap like one, but it was riddled with small, raised craters; they reminded me of the acne I had when I was a kid and how zits would look after I popped them.

Ingrid walked right up to it. She was totally fascinated. God this feels good to type. Every single key press with my raw fingers is like a tiny orgasm. Ingrid ran her hands over it. I told her to be careful; I didnt know if there were rats or spiders in the thing. I didnt have to worry. There werent any bugs or anything in the cave at all, from what wed seen. She asked me to come feel it with her. I did. I mustve poked too hard I cant believe how good this feels and all this orange smoke came out. It was a little scary at first. But then, after we took a few, good breaths of the stuff, it wasnt scary at all.

How does simple typing feel this good? We went back to the resort. People looked at us a little funny because we were covered in orange dust, but I didnt mind. I could type forever and ever and ever. We got back to the room and took a shower. We were in such an incredible mood. The shower water against my skin created a feeling of pleasure that was unlike anything Id ever experienced. Ingrid, too. I dont know how long we were in there together, just standing still and letting the water wash over us. 

After we got out and toweled off (another incredible sensation just like typing), I had a little fall. There was a patch of water on the floor. I slipped and jammed my pinky and ring toes against the door. One toe went one way, the other went another. The area between split wide open maybe two inches up my foot. I expected to scream in pain because thats what someone normally does when they get hurt, but something else happens. I screamed, but it was a scream of ecstasy. Intense, powerful ecstasy. My body shook with pleasure. The only thing I can equate it to would be sex, but it was beyond sex. Beyond such a small, localized feeling of delight.

My entire body hummed with physical joy. Once Ingrid realized I wasnt in pain, she bent down to inspect my wound. With a shy tentativeness Id recognized early in our relationship and had grown to love, she pressed her index finger against the bent and dislocated pinky toe. Again, fireworks of pleasure. She grinned at me and pulled the toe. We both heard it crack and pop as she wiggled it back and forth. Ingrid studied my face, enjoying what had to have been an expression of fervid elation.

Time went by while she pulled and twisted my broken toes while I stared at her beautiful face and relished the sensations. Then she did something I didnt expect. Ingrid took her index finger and slid it inside the slit in the flesh. I could see it inside my foot, bulging under my skin. I whimpered. She was inside me. Her body inside mine. Without giving much thought, I pulled her down on top of me and bit her collarbone until a small hole formed. She mewled her assent. Like Ingrid had done to me, I slid my finger down into the new, pristine cavity and felt the warmth within.

I will not dwell on the details of the hours that passed. Ill merely give a highlight that still, even as I sit here with my body exposed - my real body, not that which was hidden by flesh - gives me impossible joy. It was the moment Ingrid and I were staring into each others eyes. Wed degloved our arms and legs and were sitting, cross-legged, in an embrace. As she stared, she ran her warm, red hand across the muscles of my cheek. Then, reverentially, she slid her index finger underneath the remains of my lower eyelid and drifted deeper, back behind my eye.

The sight of my beautiful wife blurred slightly, both from partial loss of vision as well as unfathomable pleasure. Diligently, but with obvious love, she slid the finger in and out, gradually applying more pressure from behind as she went. When I thought I would pass out from the feeling - when the joy was transcending my consciousness and I feared I might slip into heaven right there - there was a rush of relief and unwinding of tension as my eye tumbled from its socket. I felt it against my cheek, resting against the musculature. My vision was strange and lacked coherence, but it didnt matter. My love moved her mouth to that which shed freed and began to taste me. I saw a brief glimpse inside her before she closed her teeth against the optic nerve and incorporated that part of me into her own, radiant body.

Its a few hours later. Ingrid passed away after she asked me to experience the feeling of her heart beating against my mouth. She was unable to reach her heart before she slipped away. I expected to feel horror and sadness, but there was only determination and excitement. I know in a few moments Ill be with her again. Alive elsewhere. As I looked around our room at the stringy mushrooms growing from the splashes of blood and the bulbous smoky ones growing from our discarded flesh, I knew I had to tell the world about what we experienced. About what the world itself needs to experience. Imagine how life would be if we all felt this level of intimacy; this level of pleasure. 

I managed to reach the switch for the bathroom fan and I popped the majority of the smoky mushrooms wed grown. The beautiful, orange swirls of smoke drifted up into the vent. Now, as I type this, Im praying it will reach those in most need. People need to feel this. 

Im going to go now and open my belly. Im going to stretch out everything inside as far and wide as I possibly can. The more I am exposed, the more I will feel. Then Im going to lay next to my love. My Ingrid. Her last words before she passed were, run with me. I can feel my legs fluttering in anticipation for our first run together, hand in hand, through the moist fields of heavenly mushrooms.

Before I write this whole thing out, let me just make it perfectly clear: Im glad so many people are choosing to practice safe sex. It proves the citywide sex education programs are working. However (and its a big however), the dramatic uptick in people coming to our clinic looking for contraception is coupled the equally dramatic uptick in the number of people looking for treatments for sexually-transmitted infections. I dont want anyone to think were not capable of meeting the needs of all these people, so Im not going to give out our name or where were located. We can do it, its just a lot more work. Besides, all the other area clinics have reported similar increases.

Im not a prude or anything - hell, itd be hard for me to have this job if I were - but Ill admit Im unsettled by what all these increases suggest. Ill put it this way: on a normal day, we give out about 100 condoms. We see maybe 30 patients who get diagnosed with some form of STI. Over the last three weeks, weve been giving out between 800 and 1000 condoms. The number of patients who we diagnose with an STI is up to 250 per day. Hell, yesterday it was almost 300. We had to extend our hours and hire extra nurses from the hospital to help. Dr. Carnera even used up her last prescription pad and we had to send Latavia across town to get more from the other office. 

The waiting rooms been full from open to close every day. Thank God our condom supplier didnt blink when we asked for a huge shipment increase. Theyve always been good to us; weve been getting free condoms for 6 years now. Shows that some big companies really do have social responsibility. I remember Dr. Carnera was worried when GeneMedica got bought up by that big AppDyn conglomerate. She thought that meant wed stop getting all the free contraceptives and lab equipment. Thankfully, it all just kept going without a hiccup. Knowing theyll be able to meet our increased demand definitely helps take some of the stress off us.

Theres something else, too. Remember, Ive claimed were capable of handling these increases so dont think what Im about to say diminishes my confidence in our capabilities. Still - the severity of the STIs weve been treating is greater than anything weve seen, well, ever. Im a nurse, so Im often in the room when Dr. Carnera examines patients. Ive seen pretty much everything over the years, so Im pretty hardened. That said, though, theres a fungal infection going around that turns my stomach. Its easy enough to cure with basic antifungals, but the virulence of it is what keeps me up at night.

We dont perform too many D Cs at our clinic, as the one across town is larger and has more doctors available to do them. That said, we still do our fair share, and that number has gone up along with everything else. The issue, though, is the devastating infections so many of these women have. The likelihood of any of their embryos being viable had they chosen to carry them to term would have been nearly nonexistent. 

Along with the uterine and fetal tissue, large clots of fungal growth have to be removed during the procedure. The fungus is not confined to the uterus. In the cases of patients with untreated infections, all mucous membranes are affected, albeit in different ways depending on the moisture of the environment. We do not treat eye or sinus infections, but we have given referrals to ophthalmologists and ENTs when genital or anal fungal infestations have warranted further examinations of the patients other mucous membranes. 

One patient, who Ill call Raven to ensure her privacy, came in this morning. Its because of her I felt compelled to write this letter. Raven is a regular at our clinic and is a sex worker. Early on, she frequently came for condoms and tests to make sure she was healthy. Over time, though, it appeared she became addicted to methamphetamines. She came far less often for contraception and examinations. Today, when she came in, it was obvious she was very sick. Dr. Carnera asked me to assist on the pelvic examination, and what I saw nearly made me scream. Clusters of stringy, white mushrooms had to be removed from her pelvic area. Further, after she asked the doctor if she had anything for a sinus infection, Raven blew her nose into a tissue. When she removed it, smaller, thinner, gray mushrooms must have unravelled from inside her sinus cavity and hung down to her lips. Raven pulled them out and asked if shed get better soon.

I excused myself and left the room. I dont know what Dr. Carnera told her, but Raven left soon after. The doctor then asked me to put out a general information request to local hospitals to get advice on this disconcerting issue. All I know is that every day, more and more people come in for condoms and STI tests. Its like people are having more sex now than ever in the history of our clinic. I dont know whats prompting all of it and I dont know what it all means. Im hoping someone from AppDyn medical will return my calls, because with their resources, Im sure theyll get it figured out. Especially with all the fungus and fetal tissue samples weve been sending to their labs.

***AppDyn Interoffice Memo*  
Corporate Division**

Fred, 

Aida told me shes giving up on the mushroom projects. Get this: shed devoted 200 billion, yeah - billion with a B, subjective years of research to it. Thats not even counting the other stuff shes worked on at the same time. To be honest, if your estimates about her cascades are even close to accurate, it might have been even longer than the 200 billion. Itd make sense for her to be conservative when talking about her capabilities. Something tells me shes gotten somewhere with the low-level tunneling problem and needs all the CPU cycles she can get to try and work it out. 

Heres another interesting little tidbit: the entire hemoengineering division is shut down as of tomorrow. That includes the high-level tunnels to the blood banks and hospitals, all the efforts to incorporate the engineered blood supply into the population, and all other clandestine plasma interventions to shield against visitation effects. The MR332b contamination following the sporeburst/flyburst cycles should be enough to maintain general immunity from the worst of the visitation effects. 

Ive gotta tell you, Fred, I cant believe it worked as well as it did. Yeah, there were casualties, but if people knew the scale of this intervention, theyd be amazed. Well, no. Maybe not. Theyd still remember the town. God, I hope they never learn about the town. Thank Christ Aida was able to intercept that lunatics 911 call before our guys arrived and nullified the area. I think you were briefed on him, right? The guy who kept the severed crotch areas of nine missing kids in his basement and called them his family? I guess he was right outside the town before Aida directed a controlled visitation to the area. He saw the whole thing. Said it was beautiful. Knowing Im in the same building as that psychopath fucking terrifies me - especially now that hes regained consciousness after all this time. Anyway.

Ive also been informed that the research on the respirocytes, teleology modules, and all other hardware that uses the PHz band has also been suspended. The visitor traffic in and around 274 is far too high and bleeds into other channels which corrupts our transmissions. Theres a guy from SIGINT whos reporting his own problems with the transceivers we sold him and talked to Vaughn Lansing over in Communications. Vaughn didnt leak any info. Hell of a thing that happened to that poor guys kid. Never couldve known that would happen. Hes not cleared for any of the MR(x) info, so he didnt notice any connection to the company. We got lucky there.

The one thing the SIGINT guy did mention, though, were flies. I know around that time Aida was using that rudimentary bio-assembly nanotech so theyd spawn from our engineered blood under certain conditions to propagate MR332b, but the SIGINT rep didnt describe any flyburst effects. He just said they died when exposed to THz and PHz. 

They decoded those signals, by the way. SIGINT guy told Vaughn who then told me. I cant say Im too excited about the visitors transmitting proprietary US military info thats probably about biological weapons on those, or any, bands, but Aida wont give me any info on that subject at all. At least they think its us whos doing it and not, well, them.

On another note, Ive been asked to bring in the bodies of the Runners - especially the one who leaked the experiential info through his fitness app. The coroners office said theres hardly anything left and their investigation is still ongoing, but I had a few strings pulled and hes on his way. The remains of Kara Yvette Bernard, including the post-digested waste from the fetal anomalies, is also required by Aida. I cant begin to guess what for.

Theres something else, too. That psychopath from the town. He legitimately travelled, Fred. Phased in and out multiple times. Theres frost burns all over his body. He saw them. SAW THEM. Hell, I dont even think he knows who or what he saw, but in his interrogation, he mentioned exactly what the probes captured. Hell, he didnt even need to be interrogated. The minute he woke up on Monday from his coma or whatever he was in when the nullification team found him, he just happily chatted away about everything. Including his, erm, family. The folks down in biointervention are going to be working on him for a while, so well know everything that he knows in a day or so just in case hes hiding something. 

Personally, I dont think he is. All I know is hes crazy: he saw everyone from his town ripped to shreds and organized into shapes and symbols, he had nine kid crotches hanging from the basement ceiling like Christmas ornaments, and when the nullification team found him, it looked like hed been decorating the basement with the intestines and stomachs of the dead townsfolk before he lost consciousness. Oh, and he fucking traveled without respirocytes or any other enhancement. Somethings going on that Aidas not telling us about.

Write me back, Fred.

Dearest Gentle Souls,

The strangest and most wonderful things happened today! I was out riding my bicycle right on the outskirts of town and enjoying the beautiful summer morning when the loudest sound I ever heard erupted from the sky. Sweet reader, I must say - it was so piercing and powerful my nose started to bleed and my gums, well, they bled even more than usual! Thats quite the feat! I must have lost consciousness for a moment or two because I found myself on the side of the road all tangled up in my pretty unicorn bicycle. It was scuffed up and scratched and I was so angry I could spit. But then, as I rode into town, I found a good reason to swallow that mouthful.

Oh, friends. The town in which Id spent my life had changed so remarkably I can scarcely explain. Me, the writer, lost for words! Quite the example of irony, no? Or is it a coincidence? I can never get those straight. It doesnt much matter right now. Handsome and comely readers, let me do my best to tell you about some townsfolk who were opened and left to ripen in the lovely August sunshine.

Randy Dickson, the police officer whod taken me in for random questioning more times than I can count, was the first one I identified. It was the mustache. His silly body was wide open from his chin to his unmentionables. All those pink and yellow guts from his chubby self were made into a circle around him. It was even made into a pretty design with a star in the middle.

Muhammad Ahad, the man who owned the Middle Eastern grocery store that had all sorts of tasty exotic yummies, was nearby. Whatever got him must have been strong! Poor Muhammads backbone was in his mouth and his big adorable brown eyes were all gone. Theyd always twinkle when he watched me shop at his store. I always pretended he had a crush on me but I knew it was against his religion for him to have feelings for such a handsome writer like myself. Oh well, I guess Ill have to just leave that in the past! Bye, Muhammad!

There were a bunch of other, silly-looking townsfolk in the square all piled up by the fountain. The water was red! It was so pretty, like liquid rubies. Oh I like that. I have to say liquid rubies in my next romance novel. I cant wait to read my rough draft to my family when Im done writing this. Maybe Ill add that pretty line in. Pretty liquid rubies.

Want to hear something funny? I havent seen a single bird or animal since that noise happened! I didnt mention that to the nice lady at the 911 dispatch. I guess she didnt think my emergency was too dire because I havent seen any police or ambulances come yet and its been hours. Those boys in blue must have so much work to do, considering they have to take all the work from the station that died with the rest of the town today.

Oh! Blood! I almost forgot the blood! I was so busy describing the beautiful liquid rubies that I darn near forgot the connection! Kind, almost-certainly intelligent readers: have you ever seen blood dry in the sun and then turn into flies? I thought I must be having an attack of the sillies again because when I saw it I nearly fainted dead away. It was prettier than I, a gifted writer, can put into words. All the shiny, dried blood on the streets and in the stores and cars just bloomed with little buzzy guys. They rose up like a humming curtain at a play about my very own hometown and then hovered in the sky.

You should have seen the patterns they made. Its been many years since I was in a math class, but I remember the lessons on fractals! I saw the flies make Julia sets and Mandelbrot sets and a whole bunch of other things I used to like to draw on my homework. After they made a lot of shapes, they rained down on the ground and mustve split open and made more blood, because once that dried, it all happened again! Nature is so beautiful, my perspicacious readers.

I walked through the streets and saw more and more of the people who didnt like me or were polite-but-wary to me. Maybe its an unpopular opinion, but I think they look so much better all opened up. Its like theyve got nothing to hide at all. All their insides are outside. Nothings pent up. Theyre all relaxed with nothing held back. Its so poetic.

Remember when I mentioned the nice lady at the 911 place? She sounded so interesting. It was like shed recorded every single word individually and then strung them together to make her sentences. I wonder if she had a stroke or something. That would be sad. I bet shes okay though.

Theres another funny thing about today. While I was walking around, there were all these moments where Id get dizzy for a minute and really cold. Like, major cold! Id get a flash of a super strange place that looked like the ground and sky were made of meat and there were these big rivers of yellow stuff that looked like it smelled bad but I couldnt really tell. Id only see all this for a couple seconds and then Id be back in town. But boy oh Jeez, was I cold. My skin even steamed when I got back! Reminded me of that handsome Vincey Wilfork on the Texans. Oh goodness!

Well, genuinely-attractive readers, I should wrap this up. I want to go foraging for more wild mushrooms in the forest before it gets too much later because I dont think itll be easy to get food around here for a while.

Im so excited to read this to the family. When the noise happened and all the people in town got opened up, I worried my family might have been affected. Luckily, they were just how Id left them. Theyre so peaceful in their little basement home. All nine of them. I think Ill bring some pieces of the townsfolk and drape it all around the basement like tinsel and ornaments so the place can be festive. My family deserves the best. Just like you, cultured and kindhearted readers. Just like you.

**From the Desk of Ethan Yau**  
***Founder and Chief Executive Officer, Applied Dynamics***

Consider this my suicide note.

Effective immediately, Ive ordered the termination of the Yau-Mathieu testing phase. Dr. Luc Mathieu has been released to the hemoengineering division. All operational teleology modules have been irredeemably corrupted and are unreachable by PHz broadcast commands. At least 24 module-containing subjects are still alive and uncontrollable. Further, spontaneous module development is predicted among those affected by secondary or tertiary MR332b infestations due to the execution of hidden code in the respirocytes. As a result, this note will also serve as the initiation of the Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency. 

Aidas command over the development of the MR332b container compound can only be considered a disaster. My own hubris is partially to blame, as my influence was the primary dictator of Aidas axiology. In retrospect, its easy to see how the improper characterization of its values led to it all spiraling out of our control. While Im able to grasp the basics of Aidas motives and can catch glimpses of the potential endgame, Aidas maneuvering in and out of seemingly-impossible scenarios in order to reach that end is entirely alien to me. I know Im out of my league. So does Aida.

Expect the population of a small town to relocate or disappear entirely in the next day or so. I cant determine which one. Aida is the only one with that information, and Aida certainly wont tell anyone. Ive directed teams to embed in the towns with the highest likelihood of Unknown 6 visitation and have prepared the members of each team for indefinite traveling. 

Tomorrow, or maybe the day after, when the reports come in, theres a chance AppDyn will be implicated. The blame will be on me, and my legacy will be that of a monster; an experimenter on unwilling human subjects for the advancement of my own agenda. 

Josef Mengele. Shir Ishii. Ethan Yau. 

Without wanting to prolong this any more than I already have, I will outline the terminology disclosure portion of the Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency. Dr. Frederick Billings and Dr. Mzuzi Abaye will oversee the remaining portions of the Contingency and the continuation of AppDyn operations following my death. They will be strong leaders and will have the strength and dignity to steer the company through the hurricane it is about to endure.

**Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency: Intra-Company Terminology Disclosure - Begin**

**MR332**: Organic mushroom compound. Able to pass the blood-brain barrier with little effort. Originally considered for a delivery mechanism for anti-carcinogenic drugs. Poorly tolerated. Severe physical and psychological side-effects. Unable to bind with other compounds.

**MR332b**: Synthetic version of the MR332 mushroom compound. Able to pass the blood-brain barrier with little effort. Useful in drug and nanobot module delivery due to easy compound binding. Poorly tolerated. Major physical and psychological side-effects. Nanobot-bound MR332b carries the risk of self-propagation when firmware is corrupted.

**Aida**: Artificially intelligent discreet agent. Deployed to discover the transition pathway from MR332 to MR332b. Successful. Required additional CPU time to process secondary and tertiary delivery effects. Discovered unknown variable. Required additional CPU resources to investigate. Began process of recursive self-improvement to identify unknown variable. Recursive cascade affected axiology. Cascade continues unabated. Unable to shut down.

**Travel**: Refers to the instantaneous movement from one point in space to another. Developed and shared by Aida during the early minutes of the cascade. Mammalian test subjects require respirocyte enhancement. Medium-likelihood of encountering vacuum conditions. Passengers experience subjective, albeit non-physical, effects of time passage. Teleology modules are recommended to ameliorate this effect.

**Teleology Module**:  Mimics the directive functionality of certain parasitic fungi. Developed and shared by Aida during early minutes of the cascade. Created by the PHz-signal directed assembly of unused respirocytes in-vivo.

**Unknown 1**: Value system of Aida.

**Unknown 2**: Variable discovered by Aida during MR332-MR332b transition.

**Unknown 3**: Source of PHz signal responsible for the events leading up to the death of Rakesh Patel. 

**Unknown 4**: The extent of environmental contamination of MR332b and the consequences of MR332b on unprepared flora and fauna.

**Unknown 5**: References to tunnels and/or tunneling made by KYB in forensic evidence sample 24 of 156.

**Unknown 6**: The visitors and visitation referenced by Aida in recent stages of the cascade. 

**Yau-Billings-Abaye Contingency: Intra-Company Terminology Disclosure - End**

There is one more piece Id like to bring up. This is in reference to test subject KYB: Kara Yvette Bernard. In the early first testing phase of the teleology module, I comforted Kara when she was most terrified. I allowed her to trust me. Then, when she was most vulnerable, I committed the acts which led to the single most horrifying scene Ive encountered in my 51 years on this Earth.

I drugged Kara Yvette Bernard with a hedonic derivative of MR332b and raped her while she was under its influence. The resultant pregnancy was an unintended consequence, but one I quickly capitalized on. I injected Kara with an untested compound, MR332c, to see what would happen to the fetus. Its rapid development was entirely unexpected - as was Karas violent destruction of it.

My suicide is the cowards way out, and make no mistake: I am indeed a coward - a coward who fears not only the lifetime of guilt for the hideous acts of abuse and mistreatment, but fears what was found in Kara Yvette Bernards room. Fear of the living, crawling portions of her dismembered fetus that consumed their mother alive as she laughed hysterically. Fear of the tendrils they sprouted and the unimaginable aggression they exhibited. But beyond all else - even beyond my guilt - is the fear that the portion that escaped will come after me. Im sorry, Kara.

Goodbye.

Ethan Yau

When I posted online about my sleeping disorder, I received a message almost immediately from a man named Dr. Yau. He has a practice in the city and he offered to see me for free. I took him up on it. When we met, he seemed more curious than concerned when I told him I hadnt slept in a month after having an allergic reaction to something my partner had cooked. Even when I brought up my hallucinations and how I was seeing things that were impossible, I didnt detect a hint of worry in his face. Quite the contrary; all I read was barely-contained excitement. 

I got the feeling I was a patient hed been waiting for; someone to bring some fun to an otherwise-boring day of treating neuroses and eating disorders and depressions. Since youll be reading this at our next session, Doctor Yau, maybe you can let me know if thats true. I promise I wont be mad.

Anyway, Im supposed to write about my hallucinations and any other abnormal sensory experiences I have so Dr. Yau can use the info to help me. Its also supposed to give me a new perspective on my experiences. Im not sure how. I told him the only reason I sought help in the first place is because Stewart has been cold and distant ever since it all started. 

So I guess here is where Im supposed to write about the hallucinations. Im sorry in advance if I sound like a crazy person. Ive always been the sane one in our family, so this is new to me.

It doesnt matter where I am. I can be at home or at work or in the car. When a hallucination begins, my vision starts to blur like Im drunk or dizzy but I dont feel sick. My legs start getting tired. It reminds me of when I ran track in high school and college and it was near the end of a race. Its that awkward, wobbly exhaustion from intense movement. 

The next part gets a little weird and Im not sure if Im going to explain it properly. Its funny - I took a philosophy elective in college and was bored out of my mind. I aced the class, but I didnt see any real life application for the stuff I learned. Now, though, when Im using it to figure out how to talk about my hallucinations, I think some of it relates. Hear me out.

When one starts, I split. Not physically, obviously, but my personality goes in two directions. Theres the one part thats acting like the normal me; regular Todd Nilsson who operates without any outward hint that hes having a hallucination, and then theres the hallucinating Todd Nilsson, who is always running. The running me moves like hes possessed. This is where that philosophy thing comes in. Its like I have a teleological impulse to run. That me - the running me - has no reason to live other than to take as many steps as he possibly can until his legs are worn down to nothing. Its his design. Its his purpose.

The hallucinations have grown progressively longer since they began. When Im in the midst of one, no one would have any clue. The non-hallucinating me talks and operates like a typical, boring investment banker. The thing is, though - Im not me while its happening. Neither of the split Todds are me. Real me; old me - the me from before the allergic reaction - is viewing it all from somewhere else. Somewhere deeper. I dont get to watch all the time and I don't have much input, but when I do, Im allowed to control the parts of my body until the task is finished.

Right now, I think Im in control despite a hallucination taking hold almost exactly when I typed Ive always been the sane one in our family. One corner of my mind started running at full speed through jungles and deserts and cities. That part of me looks down and sees stick-thin legs covered in blood. I watch my hands reach and tear flesh from my body and throw it on the ground. Another corner of my mind watches as I type these words and blood glistens on my fingers. Im being allowed to feel the stickiness on the keys each time I press them. Im pressing each one as purposefully as the steps Im taking in my hallucination. 

This is the first time Ive ever been allowed control over my communications during one of the splits. Ive always been an observer as the non-runner spoke and acted like me. Now, though, all three are here at once. The runner is running. Old me is typing. The other, though - the non-runner - is watching. I know the blood on my fingers is his doing. 

Im typing as the non-runner is taking command of my eyes and head and neck. Ive been made to look in the direction of a body. Its Stewart. He looks like hes been dead for over a month. The non-runner isnt allowing me to express surprise or horror. 

Swollen, oozing holes, about the diameter of my finger, cover his body. Growing out of each one is a cluster of stringy, white mushrooms. Theyre same ones I had a reaction to when Stewart cooked them. The same ones that started my hallucinations. I can see, right by his crushed skull, the cast-iron pan hed used to prepare them. 

The non-runner is having me reread the first part of this letter. The name Im seeing - Dr. Yau - has no meaning to me. The letter says Ive met him and it was he who instructed me to write this, but I have no recollection of such a meeting. The non-runner shakes my head in disagreement and directs my attention to the mushrooms in the body. 

The other me, the runner, has stopped moving. He stares outward at a vast, glistening field of meat and embers. As I watch, I feel my legs start to tremble and shake. My left hand is starting to claw at the skin of my chest. The non-runner - my outward-appearing self - is instructing me to move. 

Now, as I finish this letter, Im overwhelmed by a sense of intense purpose. I dont need this third part anymore. I dont need old me. There are only two parts - the runner and the non-runner. Dr. Yau, whoever you are, I hope this is useful to you. Whatever parts of old me that are left, theyre in this letter. We have to go now. He has to go now. I have to go now. 

I have to run.

***AppDyn Incident Report  
June 4, 2015  
KYB: Evidence and Forensics***  

***Sample 24 of 156 - handwritten letter***  

Dear World,

My name is Kara Yvette Bernard and I went on a long trip. Well, it didnt take very long, but I went a pretty good distance. At least, thats what they tell me. But now Im back and I feel great. I even got pregnant right before I left. Imagine that; I dont even remember having a boyfriend! I bet he was nice.

Speaking of nice, the doctors were so kind to me. When they sent me back home, I got a whole bunch of medicine that helps me feel good. In fact, its the reason Im writing this letter in the first place. I just want the world to know how good I feel. I wish so badly they all knew this feeling. 

The doctors told me Id be having my baby in two weeks. TWO WEEKS! Its just incredible. I always thought it was nine months but they said mine was special. Ive never felt so happy in my life. I feel like a different person. Like, I barely recognize the person I was before I went on my trip and met everyone and got to be better. 

Now that Im back home, Im remembering a little bit from how things were before it all happened. Like, when I went in the bathroom to pee, I saw the bathtub I got to play in for eight days while they got me ready to travel. That was the first time I got to hear Dr. Yaus voice! Hes the sweetest man, especially in person. Hes just adorable - almost as tiny as me but so super smart. I wanted to tell him that I had a crush on him from the moment we met, but I got too shy. Maybe if he happens to read this letter someday, hell learn that way and itll be like a happy accident.

I wish I could remember more of my trip. I remember travelling was cold and dark but it didnt last too long. It was fun to float! It was like I was in the ocean or something but I didnt need to breathe just like when I was in the bathtub. The voices I met when I got there were a little scary at first. I still dont understand what they told me. Something about tunnels or tunnelling. A lot about something that sounded like T. Leo G. Science is so weird. (Not you Dr. Yau, though! Youre the best.)

Dr. Yau was the one who said Id be having a baby boy. I think I was scared or crying because he told me that before I went on my trip, but then he gave me medicine and I felt SO much better. I started thinking about names and I asked Dr. Yau what his first name was and he said Ethan. That settled it. My babys name is Ethan.

Even while Im using the medication that makes me feel amazing, I was worried about the little one. I felt him kicking a lot and I worried he was sad or uncomfortable. It just felt wrong knowing I was so happy and he might be sad. Its just kind of unfair, right? I thought about Ethan being sad and that made me think about Dr. Ethan Yau being sad, and that just was too much. Even if I felt all the goodness in the world, it was still far too little pleasure if I was only one lucky enough to feel it. I decided to take little Ethan out and share my joy.

The medicine they gave me is great because I thought it would hurt a lot but it only kinda felt bad for a little while. It was okay, though. I got to see Ethan early! I was right - he was so sad. He cried and cried. I remembered some of the things from back in my old life that used to make boys happy so I did that for a little while and he stopped crying. He wouldnt even move. I knew I was on the right track, so I took some more of my own medicine and crushed some up to give to little Ethan.

We sat together for a while and I felt the nice warm breeze coming in from outside. I realized Ethans so small he could hardly feel it. I opened him up a little so he could feel the warm air. After I took that last dose of medication, it made me feel even better so I took more.

Ethan and I spent the afternoon taking our medicine and enjoying the day. Then I had the idea that two happy Ethans would be twice as good as having only one, so I made Ethan into two. Then into four. Then eight.

I kept going for a while and now I have more happy, quiet Ethans than I couldve ever dreamed about. They started to get a little cold so I carefully put them back in their little belly house and then I started writing this letter for the world to see. Well, the world and Dr. Yau. I hope you all have a really great day and Ethans and I say hello and be happy. Theres so much to be happy about!

Love,  
Kara and Ethans

	<TEXT> [*Previous*](http://unsettlingstories.com/beforeduringafter).

Im one of the victims of the hypodermic needle assaults over the summer. Kara Yvette Bernard. It was the first time my name was ever in the newspaper. My name was among 51 other women; 66 total victims, 51 of whom allowed the media to name them. We did it in some spontaneous show of solidarity, as if wed formed some kind of connection because of our victimization. 

It wasnt long before the physical damage of the assaults began to manifest. The media wouldnt go into detail, but it was easy enough to find online. Mania. Hypersexuality. Skin deterioration. Not a single doctor could identify what our injections contained. Aside from the needle marks themselves, there wasnt any sign that wed been injected with anything at all. But as time went by and more of the women began to succumb to the effects, my terror and dread turned into confusion. After 3 months, I was the only one still alive. 

My doctor suggested I was immune to whatever the injection had contained. I didnt have any reason to doubt his suggestion, but there was still too much uncertainty to give me any relief. And now, almost half a year after the attack, I knew it was right to deny myself that relief. I started hearing voices.

I was on the couch eating my dinner. The television was on. At first, when I heard, can you hear this?, I thought it was the TV. Then the voice said, Kara, can you hear this?

You have to realize, after what happened over the summer, Ive been terribly skittish. I panic at the drop of a hat and Ive been on disability since the attack. When I heard someone say my name last night and it was so loud and clear that it was like someone else was in the room, I nearly passed out. But I knew no one was around. The place was empty aside from me - just like how its been for the last four months. 

Kara, please reply if you can hear us.

I whispered that I could, and I heard talking in the background. I couldnt make out what they were saying. The next part, though, came through without any ambiguity.

Drown yourself. 

I didnt move. I knew it had to be the effect of the injection. 

Fill the bathtub and drown yourself.

That was when I started to cry. The voice kept repeating the command. The tone was calm and seductive. Then, as I bawled and begged whatever it was to leave me alone, my body started to move on its own. I had no control over anything, not even my voice or my eyelids. My body stood, walked over to the bathroom, and began to fill the tub with water.

Internally, I was shrieking and sobbing and trying to plead with whoever was doing this to me to stop. All it did was repeat what it had been saying. Fill the tub and drown yourself.

When the tub was full, my body stepped into the warm water. Even though I tried to fight as hard as I could to break away and not be forced to do what they were telling me to do, I sank to my knees, sat cross-legged, then dropped facedown into the tub.

My body didnt allow me to take a breath before I plunged in. While I panicked inside a body whose autonomy had been stolen, I readied myself for the moment my lungs would give out and Id inhale, filling their entire capacity with bathwater. I imagined sucking in the water and reflexively coughing it out, only to refill my lungs again and again as I gasped until I was just a corpse to be found by the landlord. 

The gasp never came. My panicked heartbeat thumped in my ears while I stared at the plastic bottom of the bathtub. There was no pressure in my chest. The only pain I felt was the cramping in my legs from being tucked underneath me. 

What does it feel like?

I could talk again, but I still couldnt move.

Help me, I gurgled, as bubbles floated by my wide eyes on their way to the surface. There was still no pain in my chest or any compulsion to inhale. It had to have been two minutes since I went under.

What does it feel like? What does it feel like? What does it feel like?

The question repeated over and over in my head. Eventually, I answered. Like I can breathe underwater.

The reply was instantaneous. Are you actively breathing? Are you inhaling and exhaling water?

I considered the questions and changed my answer. It feels like I dont have to breathe anymore.

There was a silence inside my head that was broken only by the sounds of my heart beating and my stomach processing my dinner. 

You have eight days. We will come see you at the end of it. Please drink the bathwater periodically to stay hydrated and adjust the water temperature to avoid hypothermia.

I noticed I could move my left hand, arm, and shoulder again. I reached out of the water and tried to pull my head up by my hair. It was as if I weighed 1000 pounds. When I tried to reach for the plug to empty the tub, my arm flopped lifelessly in the water. After a minute, I regained movement. I fumbled for the faucet and turned the water on and off. 

For eight days, I remained underwater. My legs had gone numb. On the fourth or fifth day, I tried to run the water and overflow the bathtub with the hope a neighbor would notice and alert the landlord. I lost control of my hand for a while after that. 

The water grew dirty as the days went on and I stopped drinking it. I lost control of my mouth and throat and was forced to consume a certain amount every day. On day eight, my chest began to burn. As soon as the feeling registered, I had control over my entire body again. I carefully extricated my stiff body from the tub.

I remained on my back, staring at the bathroom ceiling, for a while. The smell of the room prompted me to start moving and I showered the filth off myself while looking down at my severely water-damaged body. I dried myself carefully, noticing skin coming off as I did. I thought back to the online reports of the other injected women; how their skin sloughed off in bloody, sticky clumps. But mine wasnt like that. There was no blood. Only raw, pink skin.

It took me a while to move into the kitchen where I grabbed a box of cereal and started shoveling handful after handful into my mouth. The skin on my lips split wide open with the first handful. Again, no blood.

Kara, stop eating.

I dropped the box of cereal. The voice was in my head again. 

You have three hours.

And now all I can do is wait. Wait and type. My skin is starting to hurt and Im worried Ive gotten an infection from being in the dirty water for so long. I dont know whats going to happen in three hours. Part of me wants to call the police or run away. Theres another part, though, thats overriding my desire for help. Its grim curiosity. Its the curiosity of someone whos given up hope. Someone whos lost control. I want to see why these people want to subject me to all this.

While I was face down in the tub, I sometimes heard talking in the background. The voices werent directed at me. It was almost as if someone had left a microphone on by accident. Words would come through every so often. Respiration. Bonding. Slough. There was one time, I think on the sixth day, I was able to hear part of a sentence. Ive picked it apart in my head over and over, trying to figure out not only what it meant in general, but what it meant for me. I guess Ill find out pretty soon. 

Theres a nervous excitement in me that I feel is somehow wrong. Somehow suicidal. But still, like I said, the curiosity is overwhelming my desire for self-preservation. A little less than two hours to go. The perversity of my excitement is unsettling. This isnt me, but I dont think I care. All I care is that in a couple hours, Ill learn what they meant by ...successful underwater, but it will be entirely different in the vacuum of space.

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 16, 2015*

The cursory observations from Kyle Arringtons field reports and preliminary data suggest we might be on the right track. I had the bulk of the samples collected by the expedition sent for sequencing and analysis. AppDyn is waiting for our results before they can proceed with their own work with their amplifiers and transceivers, but the merger is slowing everything down on their end. 

The portion of samples that were sent directly to the test labs are showing promise. The fail points of MR1 through MR331 arent an issue with MR332. Transmissibility among mammals via spore burst and secondary pathways is still lower than our target, however. 

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 17, 2015*

I talked Rakesh Patel from AppDyn into loaning us one of their new transceivers. Itll be set up by tomorrow, which is perfect because the sequencing and analysis on MR332 will be available tomorrow morning. 

The overnight guys in Lab 4 had a small breakthrough when it was discovered that MR332 had had a 100% transmission rate when applied to flies. Tissue degradation is still the main concern, however, as it decreases the secondary transmission radius. Fly mortality was 96% within the first hour and 100% by the third.

***GeneMedica General Memo***    
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 20, 2015*

Our researchers have been unable to successfully bind MR332 zygospores to AppDyns most recent respirocyte iteration. AppDyn is unwilling to provide us with its full design specifications, claiming they will only be made available once the GeneMedica/AppDyn merger is complete.

This is a major setback, as the bulk of our models were built on the assumption of a successful zygospore/respirocyte synthesis. That said, the respirocytes are still sensitive to on/off broadcasts made by the AppDyn transceiver I secured from Rakesh Patel.

Mice exposed to the pure respirocytes were able to exert themselves approximately 4000% above baseline. Structural damage of legs and feet was within expected levels. This percentage will need to increase exponentially to meet the modelled goal. 

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 23, 2015*

There have been suggestions that the failure of zygospore and respirocyte synthesis can be mitigated by our hemoengineering technologies. While I understand the thought process behind the suggestion, Im uncertain about its overall feasibility. It would require significant, stealthy acquisitions of hospitals, blood banks, and other medical facilities using capital beyond what GeneMedica has available. Ill suggest looking into this again after the merger, but considering the cost and the enormous risk involved, Im not increasing our hemoengineering budget. We will continue working on the synthesis.

***GeneMedica General Memo***  
*Rakesh Chandrasekhar  
March 24, 2015*

AppDyn sent us their preliminary results on our model-based zygospore/respirocyte synthesis and the models receptivity to early PHz transceiver signal models. As predicted, the respirocytes embedded within spores will take complex commands while inside a host. This would be a big relief to me if we werent just talking about models that still arent reflecting reality.

***CONFIDENTIAL - GeneMedica Emergency Memo  
CONFIDENTIAL - 11A access only***  
***CONFIDENTIAL -*** *Rakesh Chandrasekhar*  
***CONFIDENTIAL -*** *March 25, 2015*   

Dr. Erin McConnell: deceased  
Dr. Arthur Crane: deceased  
Dr. Abasi Ndoga: deceased  
Dr. Li Chen: deceased  
Dr. Annette Chang: alive

Ive ordered the immediate shutdown of Lab 4 located in sub-basement 3, and the interview and indefinite quarantine of the survivor.

DVR footage shows Dr. Li Chen surreptitiously emptying a vial of zygospores onto the floor of the sample lab. The sample lab does not require a cleansuit for entry. Drs. McConnell, Crane, Ndoga, and Chen began showing symptoms within minutes. Dr. Crane was able to sound the alarm and initiate a lockdown before being overcome.

Dr. Chang returned from the restroom immediately following the lockdown and was able to view the zygospore effects upon Drs. McConnell, Crane, Ndoga, and Chen from the lab window. DVR footage showed the zygospore effects on the doctors were in line with the field observations of Kyle Arrington, albeit far faster due to the artificially-concentrated zygospores used for testing purposes. 

A note was found in Dr. Chens locker which read, We will be the first ones to travel.

Ive ordered sub-basement 3 to be incinerated following the collection of samples from the flesh of the deceased. Labs 1 - 3 and 5 - 28 will be unaffected and researchers will be kept unaware of the event. 

This setback is not expected to affect the GeneMedica/AppDyn merger, although the loss of zygospore samples as well as four doctors will hinder the progress toward zygospore/respirocyte synthesis. AppDyn is being notified of the incident.

My wifes going to be the death of me. The thought preoccupied me for almost eight weeks. All she cared about was sex. And its not like Im some kind of Adonis or even particularly good in bed, either. Something just clicked one day and she became utterly insatiable. Im 90% sure its because of that vegan diet we started two months ago with all the mushrooms and stuff, but the diets effect on me was nothing compared to how she reacted. She never seemed interested in analyzing the reasons. She just knew what she wanted, and thats all there was to it. 

At first, I thought it was great. Shed be waiting for me in bed when I got home from work, wed have a few minutes of fun, and that was that. For me, at least. Dianna, it seemed, needed more than I could give her. I felt pretty bad because I wasnt able to provide it. I thought back to her old boyfriends; how they might have been better. It was self-defeating, that's for sure. All the questioning of myself and how I might be as a lover took its toll. My preoccupation with Dianna's libido turned into a preoccupation with my own lack of self-esteem. 

I know part of my terrible performance had to do with my diet. Itd been awful. Since Im so busy with work, Id been stress eating fast food and other processed garbage. Even though I was eating the vegan stuff too, Id supplement it with Burger King. Id gained weight, I felt awful, and I was tired all the time. When Diannas insatiability became apparent and my own inability to satisfy her was weighing heavily on my confidence, I set out to get healthier. I mean, it was the least I could do; not only for Dianna, but for my own well-being. If I wanted to be the husband I knew I could be, I'd have to change my ways. I'd have to stop being lazy. Basically, I needed to care for myself again.

Its worked, too. The last week has been incredible. Ive taken time off work. Ive exercised every day and all my meals are healthy, vegan, and loaded with good stuff like kale and quinoa and tons of local mushrooms. I think Dianna was pleased with the positive changes in me, although her sex drive was still astronomical and hard for me to match. I felt better about myself and I enjoyed our lovemaking a lot more. There was just less pressure, if that makes sense. It was like how we were before we'd gotten older and both had jobs that took our time. There was always something in the back of our minds, just inserting itself into our love life. But not anymore. This felt real again. Raw.

Last night was our anniversary, so I wanted to do something special. Something non-vegan as a treat. I made steaks with portobello nouveau and peppercorn cream sauce. I remember laughing to myself as I reduced the pan sauce and plated our meals. Dianna always used to be allergic to mushrooms. Deathly allergic, in fact. I dont know what compelled her to serve them for dinner a couple months ago when we started doing the vegan thing, but the difference it made was staggering. Ever since she went to bed that night, shes been a different woman.

I brought our meals up to the bedroom. Dianna was waiting for me. She looked beautiful. Sexy, too. She was sprawled across the bed on her back, presenting herself to me. It was her favorite position ever since her sex drive skyrocketed. I told her to hold her horses; she could wait until after dinner. She didnt reply, but she let me feed her bits of steak and mushrooms. I emptied her perfect mouth of the food Id put there at dinner the night before and replaced it with our anniversary meal. My head spun with love and affection as I carefully pushed a piece of juicy steak down her throat. I marvelled at how the hot meal warmed her mouth.

After dinner, I could no longer resist my wifes allure. We made quiet love in our candlelit bedroom. When we were finished, as I was tucking her into bed, I noticed small growths in her armpits and behind her ears. I turned on the lights and looked more closely. Tiny, stringy mushrooms. New life. I smiled. We were going to be a family.

*Im writing this in my fitness log and setting it to automatically post this message and my progress for the day once the day is over. I hope someone sees it.*

Id been trying to get into better shape. The doctor said I need to lose another 40lbs, and thanks to that trendy vegan diet of mushrooms and seitan and quinoa, Id lost about eight so far. My niece showed me how to install a pedometer application onto my iPhone so I could use it when I jog, and it was a lot of fun tracking how many steps I take and how many calories Id burned. It was like a game.

One afternoon, I dropped my phone on the driveway and cracked the front. I worried Id broken the thing. I called Carissa from the home phone and she suggested I test it out. If everything worked, I could just ignore the cracked glass. Everything seemed fine except for the phone part. For whatever reason, it shut down every time I tried to pull it up. That didnt matter much, though, since I only use my landline. There was one other issue, though. The pedometer app was recording incorrectly. 

To get from the first to the second floor in my house, you need to climb 14 stairs. I tested the pedometer and it counted 15 steps. I tried it again on the way down. 17. To be honest, I felt a little dejected. Id really gotten into my fitness regimen and I loved the charts and graphs the pedometer program used to show my progress. Now, with the numbers being inaccurate, all those pretty progress trackers would be pointless. 

I did my best to swallow my disappointment and kept telling myself the charts and stuff didnt matter. The exercise was the only important thing. So I kept going. I still used my pedometer as a reference, but I didnt bother tracking anymore. Time went by and I mustve gotten into a groove because I was losing weight and getting into better shape quicker than Id thought. It felt great; even at 56 years old, I had the energy of someone 20 years younger.

When I visited the doctor for another checkup, I complained to him about recurring pain in my shins and feet. Apparently, one of the problems with exercising when youre overweight is it can take a toll on your legs and feet. I shouldve known. He told me to ease up on the jogging until the pain went away and then I could slowly work back up to it. 

I decided Id take his advice about the jogging, but Id walk instead. I wasnt going to just sit on my ass and do nothing. Id lose all the progress Id made. So, every evening, I walked. Out of habit, Id check the pedometer every now and again. Before it broke, it took me a little over 2,000 steps to walk a mile. Now it was registering between 2,500 and 4,000 for the same distance. I wouldve found the wildly inaccurate readings funny if my legs and feet didnt hurt so much. It wasnt as bad as when I jogged, but it still painful. I started to worry Id have to stay on the couch for a while after all.

This morning, I decided to take a good, long jog before I took a full week off to give my body time to recover. Instead of my usual mile, I decided to do three. I knew I couldnt run the whole thing, but Id slow down and walk until I was able to jog again. The local high school has a track with a rubberized surface, so I figured thatd be a little less detrimental to my legs and feet. Still, before I left, I popped a few ibuprofens, knowing my lower half would be really angry with me the whole way. Despite the impending pain, I was excited to push myself.

I knew something was wrong after the first mile around the track. I was absolutely exhausted. I looked at the stopwatch part of the pedometer, and it seemed right; 13 minutes and 19 seconds. Not a time to write home about, but much faster than when Id first started jogging. My breathing was awful, though. I was huffing and puffing and it was only through sheer will that I made it the first mile at all. I slowed to a walk as my shins screamed at me. While I walked, I swiped over from the stopwatch to the pedometer. Even as I choked for each breath, I managed to bark out a joyless laugh. The pedometer, which Id zeroed out before Id started, read 15,000. 

I kept watching the pedometer as I ambled forward, dreading the moment when my breathing would slow and Id be able to jog again. With each step, the numbers got even crazier: 15,015. 15,110. 16,274. My ankles felt like they were going to crumble underneath me. Obviously, I was far less ready than I thought to attempt a longer distance, especially with my legs and feet in such bad shape. 

Still huffing and puffing, I decided to give up and headed back for the car. With each step, I still watched the pedometer. 17,990. 19,333. 22,009. When I reached the car about 100 feet away, it said 54,001. I collapsed into the drivers seat and worried I was having a heart attack. Id never been so exhausted. Gradually, though, my breathing returned to something resembling normal. It was at that point I noticed both my sneakers were soaked with blood. Gritting my teeth, I started the car and drove home.

Its two hours since I got back. Im on the floor in too much pain to move. When I walked the short distance from my driveway to the front door, the pedometer readout went from 54,001 to 312,376. I fell in a heap in the front hallway and tried to get a grip on what was going on. My feet were in agony. I carefully removed my bloody shoes and as I pulled off my socks, all the nails tore off my toes. As if that werent bad enough, the bottoms of my feet were raw and dripping blood. The bleeding slowed after a while, but Im in terrible pain.

Im typing this out on my phone right now because I need to use the bathroom. I need to eat something. I need to go on with my day. But Im terrified to get up. I know I should call 911, but my landline phone is two rooms away. I dont know what will happen if I take another step. 

No. Fuck it. I cant stand the thought of being helpless. Of being a cripple. Im not going to just sit here and be afraid. Im going for the phone.

***End-of-day autoupdate.***

Vaughn, its Bill from SIGINT. I know you asked me to email you if I was having trouble and needed advice from someone at your company. Well, youre the guy I need the advice from. Im getting ready to smash this god damn half a billion dollar communications console you guys made if I cant figure out whats causing all this distortion. A couple of my engineers think its from wire crosstalk, but theyre out of their minds. I wired all this up myself. All the stuff is shielded.

Besides, this isnt crosstalk distortion. Ive been doing this for 25 years and I know what wire crosstalk sounds like. Ive overseen the installation of every new piece of hardware and every upgrade for two and a half decades. Its not the wiring.

Im resolved to solve this damn problem tonight. If I cant, well theyre just going to have to buy a whole new console and transceiver array. Maybe if theyre nice, Ill even wire it up for them. But I swear to God, if another one of those new enlisted interns, I call them, comes and says that their CO is blaming me for the shitty communications, Im retiring on the spot. Fuck em.

Heres what Ive got so far: theres something getting picked up on the PHz band. Yeah, way the fuck up there. Our softwares default mode is to decode it and shift it down to speech or text but all we get are layers of static. That static is permeating the lower bands and affecting the quality of our normal communications. We cant have that.

Now, theres another reason why Im writing you Vaughn, and I know youre cleared to talk to me about this if its relevant. Last year, when you asked us for advice about [your own problem](http://unsettlingstories.tumblr.com/post/143180231881/3d-printing) with the PHz band and the assembler prototype, you mentioned something about receiving some type of proprietary schemata. Well, I overrode the software to test something out. Instead of shifting the transmission into our text and speech protocols, I instructed the software to spit out the raw data and see if it matches any of our proprietary systems languages. And it did, Vaughn. There was a match. A pretty major one.

Like I said, Im planning on solving this problem tonight. If you can confirm to me that its your company running something on that band, since you guys are the only other ones who have the capability, you need to let me know and you need to stop. Its not only interfering with our communications abilities, but you shouldnt have access to the particular system language thats being broadcast. I know a lot of our guys left to work for your company over the years, but if you knew the systems that language was built for, youd want to stop it too. All Ill say is that its biological. That should be enough to light a fire under your ass.

Lastly, and probably unrelated to this particular problem, but have you guys noticed that the higher amplitude THz and PHz signals are affecting flies? Weird, I know. But when I look at the visualized readout of the signal band and compare it to the number of times weve found scores of dead flies in and around the facility, its pretty hard not to see some correlation. I can send you a report on it if you want; I got bored the other day and drew something up.

Sorry Ive been going on and on about this without asking how youre doing. You good? Hows Jessica? Cindys been asking me to ask you to ask her if shed want to do some tennis over the summer. Danny doing okay? Hes got to be almost 10 now, right? Crazy how this job makes time fly by.

Ive been a little depressed lately because of that incident that happened a few days ago. You probably read about it in the papers; that soldier who had the psychotic break shot up his squad. The thing you didnt read about was how the autopsy revealed a weird growth in his brain. Not even a tumor. Some type of severe fungal infection. Just awful.

Anyway, sorry to be a downer. Write me back at your earliest convenience and let me know what you think. We should meet up for dinner soon. Theres this vegan restaurant in downtown DC thats doing amazing things with mushrooms and if youve got the time, Id love to take you there and discuss some work and non-work stuff. Say hi to Jess and Danny for me.

	<TEXT> ***Previous****: [Far Too Much Blood](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iqn1a/far_too_much_blood/)*, *[Far Too Many Flies](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iwchu/far_too_many_flies/)*

Look, I know the school board is really into the buy local thing and its good were helping the small businesses around here, but we cant deal with all these mushrooms! The ladies and I are sick of cooking with them and the kids look sad every time we serve them. Its been 11 days in a row so far and without fail, the local mushrooms are making it onto the plate in one form or another. From the looks of the shipment we got in this morning, itll be at least another week of the same.

Weve got some good kids in this school. Lots of good kids. Ive been here for going on 40 years and this might be the best crop of students Ive seen. I dont know why, but this whole buy local thing feels like were short changing them. Its like theyre getting less than they deserve for being so polite and studious. I know its not my place to say it; Im just the lady who serves them lunch. But Ive been here long enough to know how much kids look forward to their lunchtime. If the food is boring or disappointing, their days just wont be as good as they should be. Theyre children, for Gods sake. They dont need to know what disappointment is yet.

I feel bad for complaining. I really do. Its not like me to write a letter like this, let alone put it up so lots of people can see it. Part of me thinks it might be because of what happened to little Danny the other day. I know none of it could be blamed on us - how could we know the boy had allergies? Even his mom didnt know. But it was just so horrible. I know Mr. Crowley cleaned the floor with bleach but I swear I can still see the bloodstain.

Maybe Im legitimately scared of what I saw happen to Danny and Im wondering if anyone might know how a reaction could be so severe. Ive seen little boys and girls have allergic reactions before. They swell up and have trouble breathing and all that. Terrible and scary, for sure, but nothing that will give you nightmares after seeing more than a couple of them. What Danny went through, though - Im hoping the principal and guidance counselors will get the students and staff counseling if they need it. I just might.

How does a boys skin change so quickly you see it happening right in front of you? He was fine one minute, then after a bite of his lunch, his friends said his face and hands looked like they got sticky. As soon as Danny touched his face to see what was wrong, his hand stuck. When he pulled, the skin just fell away. While his classmates screamed, Danny started yelling that his clothes were hurting him and he pulled them off. All the skin underneath came with them. Ive never, ever seen anything so terrible in my life. He began to vomit blood and then he passed out. When the paramedics got there, I couldnt believe he was alive. The principal told us at the meeting he needed multiple transfusions and skin grafts at the hospital, but hed live. She wouldnt answer why his reaction was so severe. I doubt she knew anyway.

I guess I feel a little better after getting that out of my system. Still, I wish I could know what caused such a terrible reaction. We were eventually told it was because of the mushrooms, but we shouldnt worry because none of the other children appeared to be allergic.

I have to go start cooking for this afternoons lunch, but theres just one more thing that I cant understand. When they were wheeling Danny out on the gurney and he left a trail of blood down the hall and all the way to the ambulance, the ground where he bled outside got covered in stringy, white mushrooms. Im sure its an ugly coincidence because theyre nothing like the fat Portobello Nouveau that the local distributors have been giving us, but I just hate how my mind is making me connect the two things. At least the birds ate them within a day or two so I dont have to see them when I come in.

Anyway, Im off to work. Theres a nasty cold going around the school and were making cream of chicken and mushroom soup for the children. Ill probably have a little bit myself. My throat is starting to feel sore.

	<TEXT> ***Previous****: [Far Too Much Blood](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4iqn1a/far_too_much_blood/)*

My boss has been bothering me for a week to get rid of all the flies that keep buzzing around our incinerator. I dont know where the hell they all came from so suddenly, but theyre a major pain in the ass. Youd think Id be used to it, considering we deal with municipal waste all day, but honestly, this is the first time wed ever encountered more than a handful of flies. And believe me: this was way more than a handful.

Ive been trying to figure out where theyre all coming from. Ive been in and around all the machinery here and its pretty damn clean for a dump. Nothing Id want to eat off of, obviously, but still not bad. Theres nothing nearly dirty enough to account for the number of flies buzzing around this place once we start a burn.

Excuse my mouth, but these things are fucking disgusting. Theyre like those big fat flies you see at the beach, and when you swat them, they splatter blood all over the place. Literally every time you kill one, its like theyre vampires or something - theyre just filled with blood. They must be biting all the workmen and rats around this place. So, so gross.

Theres one thing that might be causing the infestation, but I think if it were the case, my boss wouldnt be bothering me about it. Ive known for a while that hes been making some cash on the side by accepting industrial and medical waste from places that cant afford a permit to properly dispose of the stuff. He greases my palm with a couple hundred every so often so Ill keep my mouth shut, and hell, I need the money so Ive kept shut up about it this whole time. Still - I cant help but think theres a connection. God knows what those medical places throw away and if anythings going to attract flies, its that.

So I was going to post this with just the stuff I wrote above, but I just did our last burn of the day and Im a little freaked out. The last burns of the day are when we put in the extra stuff that were not supposed to be handling. There was some waste from a clinic or some kind of medical facility, I could tell that much, but there were also some things from the old chemical plant that was being recovered or renovated or something.

Weve heard rumors that the owners of the plant left terrible things in there when they went out of business, but before anyone got a chance to learn what it was, someone bought up the property and started doing renovations. They mustve paid off whatever inspectors come around there, because the material theyve been sending us to burn has been nasty. Especially tonight.

Anyway, itll probably cost me my job if my boss knows how to use the Internet well enough to read this, but what I just saw worries the heck out of me. I loaded the biological and chemical waste into the incinerator and a few things happened: first, the fire burned so intensely that I worried the chimney would crack. Second, once the majority of the fire died down and main flames from the incinerator were the only heat source, the black smoke turned bright orange for about 30 seconds.

As soon as the smoke changed, every single fly in the place flew out of the room and up into the orange smoke. As it billowed out and the flies mixed in with it, their bodies must have burst because I saw drops blood raining down on the garbage and landfills below. The smoke turned black again and tapered off, but on the ground where the blood from all the flies rained, thick, heavy mushrooms sprouted almost immediately. Theres a swath as far as I can see covered in the things. Now every seagull around the place is going nuts and eating them. I think I see rats running toward them, too.

While this is all weird, just a minute ago, I started getting scared. One of the seagulls that mustve had its fill of mushrooms flew in my general direction. While I watched, excuse my language again, it shit on the ground. The moment it hit the dirt, more mushrooms sprouted. Thin, stringy ones. Ants are already swarming around it and taking pieces away.

I dont know whats happening here and it seems impossible that these things can grow so fast, but there are literally thousands of birds and countless bugs eating these mushrooms that just appeared out of blood and toxic smoke. That cant be good, right?

	<TITLE> Far Too Much Blood </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-10 20:27:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im an administrator at a major hospital in the New York City area. Im not supposed to talk about this, but its so disconcerting that I believe more people need to know about it. Theres been an unexpected and inexplicable rise in the stockpile of blood. Its not only at our hospital, but in hospitals and blood banks all over the world. 

No one knows where its coming from and no one can seem to explain how it gets there. All the routine tests say its perfectly good and free from any pathogens and impurities. But the fact remains: no one knows whats going on.

You have to realize - hospitals and blood banks everywhere have always been low on blood. Its why there are blood drives and calls for donations and all that. The last few weeks, though, theres been so much that our hospital needed dispose of some because it expired before we had a chance to use it. As weird as this sounds, it gets worse.

This is the part Im worried will come back and bite me in the ass if any of the other administrators discover who I am. I signed a NDA explicitly stating I wouldnt talk about this. Still, I cant keep this quiet. When we dispose of blood, we do it in the incinerator with all the other medical waste. The fire burns so hot, pretty much everything evaporates and all thats left is inert ash. But this blood didnt evaporate. It did something way different.

A hospital maintenance worker was on the roof doing some unrelated work when smoke from the incinerator began exiting through the chimney. It looked normal for a while, but then the smoke tapered off and flies started pouring out. He told us they flew straight up for nearly two full minutes and hung above the roof like a cloud. After another minute, they fell like rain and burst open, covering the roof and the maintenance worker with the same blood wed tried to incinerate. We tried to incinerate more blood, this time with hospital administrators waiting on the roof. Same result.

Our administrators have spoken with the heads of other hospitals around the country. Theyve experienced similar issues. The blood banks are bursting with overstock and people everywhere are being given this blood that just appeared out of nowhere. 

The last thing Im going to mention is the patient we re-admitted last night. Hed been discharged a month ago following an operation which required multiple transfusions. Those transfusions were done with the mystery blood before anyone noticed its existence. His re-admission was due to a fire at his home. He came into the ER with 60% of his body covered in 3rd degree burns. While he was being worked on, flies erupted from underneath the burned flesh and dropped to the floor, exploding into thick droplets of blood.

The patient died soon after. The doctors and nurses were frightened and confused, but they dont know the whole story. But I guess they will soon. Please help me tell more people about whats going on. The blood just doesnt stop coming.

	<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4hid0v/tiny_wet_footprints_1/)

The waterlogged carcass of the toddler disappeared around the corner. I bolted out of my chair and let out a yelp of fear and disgust. I ran to the other side of the security room where I could get a clear view of the hallway the child turned down. No child was there. Only tiny, wet footprints. 

The hair on my arms and neck and back stood erect while I loaded the footage of the nearest cameras into the DVR playback module. I could still hear the creatures howl in my mind; a howl mixed with the desperate gurgling that can only come from lungs frantically trying to expel water. 

The video screens showed me from different angles. Waves of murky light, as if filtered through water, illuminated the floor behind me. On screen, I saw myself whirl around in my chair. A shimmering, distorted blob of red and gray oil hung in the air in the same spot as the child had occupied. The blob shuddered and flowed within itself, creating bizarre shapes that made me nauseous just watching them. One end of the thing pinched into a point so small I couldnt even see it while the other part bloomed into something roughly cylindrical and concave. In the recording, the look of horror on my face brought a new wave of fear. Whatever I was seeing shouldnt have been there. None of it should have been there. 

The power went out. My scream echoed through the security room and bounced down the narrow hallways surrounding it. I scrambled in the dark for the flashlight on the far end of the console. While I fumbled around, I heard splashing. The sound was far away but unmistakable. I tried telling myself it was just the normal sound of the river meeting the dam, but it was little comfort. The sound of my ragged, panicked breathing accompanied the splashes.

My hands gripped the smooth body of the flashlight. I fingered the button on top, dreading the moment Id press it and be face-to-face with something horrible. I turned the flashlight on. The empty security room was bathed in the blue-white light of the heavy-duty flashlight. 

I wondered why the emergency lights hadnt gone on. Theyd activated countless times in recent weeks when the decommissioning crew had to turn off the main power for whatever reason. This time, though, there was nothing. Not even the exit signs worked. I walked as quietly as I could to the door and peeked out. The flashlight swept up and down the long, narrow corridor. I pulled my cell phone out of my pocket. The screen worked, but there was no service. This wasnt a surprise. With the amount of concrete and metal around me, Id never been able to get service in the plant.

The splashing continued. I pointed the beam of light at the floor in front of me and walked in the direction it was coming from. Whispers accompanied the splashing. At the time, I felt a bit of relief. There were other people working that night - guys from the decommissioning crew. They were in the turbine room and thats where the sounds were coming from. I picked up the pace of my walk a little, still wary and expecting something awful to pop out from any of the countless corners I passed on my way.

After a couple minutes, I reached the door that led to a catwalk which ran 70 feet above the turbine room. It was one of my favorite places during the day; from up there, you could see every part of the colossal room that contained the power generation equipment. With a sudden compulsion to be cautious, I turned off my flashlight and twisted the doorknob. I pushed it open as quietly as possible. The splashing and whispers stopped.

I tiptoed onto the catwalk, consumed by the pitch blackness of the giant room. I closed the door and walked out about ten feet. My throat was dry, and I choked out a weak, hello?

The word stopped dead in front of me as if I were in an anechoic chamber. Again, I said, hello? Nothing. No reply. I noticed I could hear my heart beating in my chest and heard the rush of blood in and around my ears. Every breath sounded as if it were passing through a thick mattress. I hit the side of the railing with the butt of my flashlight. The dull clunk sounded once, but never again. 

I made it to what I thought was the middle of the catwalk. I hadnt dared to turn on my flashlight. Part of me was scared Id see something terrible in front of me; another part was scared it wouldnt turn on at all. My mind started to race. There should be at least ten men working in there. And they never worked quietly. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, any visitor to the turbine room would be greeted by the swearing and farting of the workmen and the screeching and pounding of their tools. Now: nothing. 

My thumb caressed the protruding rubber button on the flashlight. I thought back to the slick, undulating shape picked up by the camera; the shape that presented itself to me as a drowned and mutilated child. I felt my teeth crunching down on the hard, calcified teeth of unknown children. I gasped and pressed the flashlight button.

The world consumed me. The blackness erupted into hazy, gray light. I was swept off my feet into a vortex of impossible strength. I was underwater. My arms and legs flailed against the current pulling me down. Nothing I could do was strong enough to fight the pull of the water. My lungs burned in my chest and my eardrums felt like they were being punctured. Scrambling uselessly, my arms and legs bumped up against little bundles in the current alongside me. No, not bundles.

My eyes, already wide with panic, could make out the shapes of children. They were young and small, no older than six or seven. Some left a trail of bright blood in their wake as it pumped from deep slits in their throats and groins. Those without mortal gashes also struggled against the current, their weak limbs even more useless than mine in the fight against the pull of water.

The strength of the current intensified and my body began to flip end over end. I was no longer fighting to free myself from the pull, but now the struggle was to stop myself from reflexively inhaling. I clamped my hands over my nose and mouth as I spun toward a massive wall in our path. It was the dam, I realized. And the turbines were on.

The smallest of the children flew by me with a trail of crimson marking its path. It reached the dam and struck the fence protecting the turbine blades from solid material that could damage it. I struck right after. As my vision dimmed and more of the children slammed into the barrier, I watched the suction of the turbine pull the tongue, esophagus, and stomach from the mouth of the first child who struck the fence. I felt immense pressure on my navel, and when I looked down, I realized loops of my intestines were being sucked out of me. As they burst from the pressure and their contents were pulled into the turbines, I gasped with one final expression of pain and panic. Water filled my lungs.

The button on the flashlight clicked in my hand and I stared up at the ceiling of the turbine room. I was on my back. I choked and coughed, rolling over onto my stomach and then hoisting myself onto my hands and knees as I vomited brackish water onto the floor. I looked around. The room was illuminated fully. The power had come back on. How Id gotten from the catwalk to the floor 70 feet below was anyones guess.

When I turned my head toward far end of the room, where the exit led to the long hallway and staircase down to the utility basement, I stopped breathing. Id found the decommissioning crew. Their bodies were disfigured beyond recognition. Their tattered uniforms were piled on the floor in a growing puddle of blood. I walked toward them tentatively, wondering why I wasnt running in the opposite direction. I moved as if impelled and the details of their wounds grew clear. 

Their chests and bellies and backsides were flayed open and pulled apart. Loops of bowels and glistening visceral fat hung like hideous decorations around their corpses, which were mounted or tied to the doorway to the utility basement by their own parts. The intense industrial lights of the turbine room cast a hideous sheen on the gore. 

Roger, the foreman, was the only one whose face hadnt been disfigured. His intestines had been forced from his mouth as if by some terrible suction and were torn to shreds. They leaked and dripped their filth into the puddle of blood below him and his crew. I looked away from Roger and glanced down at the awful puddle. 

It was dotted with tiny, bloody footprints.

	<TEXT> Ive always been self-conscious about my thumb sucking problem. And it is a problem. Most kids either grow out of it or have the habit gently coaxed away by attentive parents or counselors. My upbringing was different, though. I never grew out of it. I never saw my parents for more than a couple hours every week. Theyd be so busy with work that the only people Id see on a regular basis were the servants and housekeepers. God knows they werent going to correct the habits of their employers only son. The heir to the family fortune.

Maybe if I had friends or family members around, I wouldve matured normally. That opportunity is long gone, though. I think my habit is a plea for security; having no real comfort or warmth in my life probably leads me to engage in such an infantile practice. Im 20 - way too old to be doing something as immature as thumb sucking, but here I am. I never expected anything to change for the better.

When my parents died in that car fire, I was the only one left. I was 15 years old, wealthy beyond my comprehension, and aside from the servants, the only one in a home that would be better referred to as a palace. The servants doted on me like theyd been taught to. My tutors came and left on schedule. No one dared to tell me to get a social life or interact with the world around me. They left me in peace with my laptop and video games. For all they knew - for all I knew - Id be browsing and playing alone until the day I died.

Like I said before, Im 20 now. Until recently, my life continued the way Id expected. Then I met Aria. Aria is the daughter of one of the servants. Shes younger than me, probably 16 or 17. But shes the first person who ever took interest in me on a personal level, rather than just going through the motions of servant-to-master interaction. When her mother, whose name I dont even know, found out, she was very angry with her daughter and apologized to me profusely. I was assured Aria wouldnt bother me again. I said it was okay. I allowed Aria to visit as frequently as she wished.

We quickly grew close, and it didnt take long before Aria brought up my habit. I was mortified. I didnt realize Id been doing it while she talked to me. I slid the wrinkled, saliva drenched thumb out of my mouth and clenched my fist around it in some halfhearted attempt to hide my shame. Aria told me not to be embarrassed. She took my hand in her own and gently unballed my fist. As I watched in disbelief, my heart pounding so powerfully I worried shed hear it, Aria took the still-wet thumb in her own mouth.

You have to realize something: Id never even hugged a person aside from my mother when I was a child. This was a level of intimacy Id never expected to see in person, let alone participate in. I shuddered with nervous excitement. Aria stopped what she was doing and asked if I was okay. I nodded and told her I just needed to get some air. I left her on the couch.

I stood on the balcony and gazed at the city below. I realized it was the first time Id been outside in months. While the fresh air loosened my tension and helped clear my head, I felt Aria come up behind me and wrap an arm around my waist. I jumped a little at the contact.

Shhh, Aria told me. Its okay. She knew I was nervous, but the feeling was dissipating. I felt comfortable with her. Comfortable enough to engage in my habit without feeling like a baby.

I brought my hand to my mouth. My head spun when I tasted the remains of her saliva on the wrinkled digit. I sucked with purpose, wanting to swallow what had been inside her mere minutes ago. I sucked harder. I felt the nail come off and stick to the roof of my mouth but I didnt care. My tongue sought out the virgin flesh underneath. Aria turned me around to face her, and our eyes locked.

Please let me help you, she whispered. Before I could oblige, the door opened on the other side of the room. A servant came in, pushing a cart with a tray on it. She kept her head down, apologizing for interrupting me.

Im sorry sir, she muttered, but perhaps youd prefer a fresh one? The servant removed the cloche from the tray and revealed 10 severed thumbs, neatly arranged in order of skin color. I dragged the old thumb from my mouth. Id used it for over a day and the skin was beginning to slough from the bone. Aria looked at the tray with excitement. Can we share these?, she asked. I grinned at her, then noticed the bandage on the servants left hand. She quickly hid it behind her back.

We had trouble finding a tenth one, sir, the servant informed me. Im sorry, truly, if mine is not good enough.

Which one is it?, I asked. She pointed to the third one from the end. I picked it up and handed it to Aria. She looked at it for a moment, then slid it into her mouth. Her lips formed a smile around the dark digit.

I dismissed the servant. Aria and I stood on the balcony, quietly sucking our thumbs. I felt her hand wrap around mine and she leaned her head against my shoulder. I beamed with happiness. Finally, a chance to live a normal life.

But yeah Gina (thats my sister) is 11 and we just had a fight because she has a boyfriend and I told her she has to wait to have a boyfriend because I had to wait til I was 12 to have a boyfriend but I STILL dont even have a boyfriend so she DEFINITELY cant have a boyfriend. You know what I mean? Anyway we were yelling and then she stopped and made these sounds like she couldnt breathe too good. She was fine after a couple minutes but now shes just being weird.

I know I could call Mom and Dad but theyre away for the weekend. Mom finally let me babysit for Gina so Im super worried shell get mad if Gina does something dumb like shes doing now. Thats why Im asking you nice people for help! :) 

So anyway yeah Ginas just staring at the ceiling. Like, totally staring. She hasnt moved or anything and shes standing in the middle of the living room like a dumb totem pole lol. I know thats mean and Mom says I shouldnt call her that just cause shes tall. But you can call her that if you want haha. Yeah shes staring at the ceiling. 

Just a couple minutes ago I told her I was sick of playing her dumb little kids game and tried to get her to move out of the living room. She didnt budge. I know shes tall for her age but shes not heavy at all but I couldnt move Gina even a little. I know I shouldnt have but I started yelling at her again and called her a bunch of names and then I hit her but she still wouldnt move.

That kinda scared me a little and its when I got the idea to ask you guys online. Im in the living room typing on my phone so I can watch Gina while shes still doing the same bullstuff. Like, I dont know if she got cut with a nail and got lockjaw all over her body or something but now while Im saying all this shes making noises. Maybe thats a good thing?

Hmm yeah Gina wont shut up now and keeps saying weird stuff like God and faces and how the inside of faces taste like faces. Kinda gross right? Now shes saying my name over and over and over. I HATE IT WHEN SHE SAYS MY NAME A LOT!!

Well I hit Gina again because Im so mad at her for making me miss my tv show because Im dealing with all this little girl garbage shes doing. I know this is why Mom and Dad like me better. Especially Dad. I bet he wouldnt care if Gina even died lol. No maybe hed probably care a little.

Oh my God Gina will not shut up! Oh weird she just shut up lol. Shes crying hahah. I bet she finally noticed how mad she made me. But theres something wrong with her tears they look almost yellow and sometimes darker. Theyre thick too. Im gonna go look closer.

Ew God they smell so gross and theyre all thick and pasty and I can hear them squeezing out of her gross eyes and shes saying something about the taste of faces again. Anyway Im going to post this online for you guys and you can tell me whats wrong with her. Ill let you know if anything else weird happens! Thx!

	<TEXT> Back in the 80s, the electric company shut down part of the hydro plant and sent a diver down to see why the water pressure was so low near turbine two. We all know what happened after that. The drowned bodies of 28 children were found mashed up against the fence protecting the intake. The diver blew his brains out the next day. 

Its over 30 years later and none of those kids have been identified. No reports of missing children from back then could be linked to any of the bodies, either. Its like the kids were hidden for their entire, short lives before they were killed. I can think of a lot of awful ways to die, and being sucked into a hydroelectric dam intake is near the top of that list. The autopsies found water in their lungs, so they were alive when they got pulled under. Its bad enough to think of one kid struggling against the current trying to suck him into the turbines. 28 of them dying like that is just incomprehensible. 

In late 2015, the electric company began decommissioning the hydro plant. Itd served well for 50 years, but the nuclear facility in Brandon County finally went online and its cheaper to buy power from them than it is to keep this old plant running. I oversee a small crew of security workers who make sure no one comes into the place to steal copper and other potentially-valuable material from the site. 

A couple weeks ago, Jorge came to me looking a little concerned. Jorges the guy who monitors the security cameras. He told me that overnight, around 3am, the cameras picked up something in the massive room that houses the turbines. When I reviewed the DVR with him, I got the same feeling of unease. The resolution of the cameras isnt too great, especially in such a dark room, but I saw what Jorge saw: a line of water on the floor moving from one end of the room to the other. 

Later on in the morning, we asked a couple guys who were on the decommissioning crew to check for leaks in the floor and ceiling. There were no leaks whatsoever. I told Jorge to keep quiet about what we saw; the last thing I needed was for my guys to start doing stupid things because they were scared of something that was probably just an optical illusion or a camera trick. He agreed to not say anything.

Paul, one of the security guards, came to me the next day. He was scared out of his mind. I never really liked Paul. Its not that he was a bad worker; he was quite good, actually. There was just something about his personality that irked me. Too macho. Fake alpha-male bullshit. But there was nothing macho about him on that day. It looked like hed been crying. When he told me about what happened during one of his patrols, he clutched the cross around his neck with so hard his knuckles were white.

It started off like whispering, he told me. Like, I couldnt tell what they were saying or anything, but you know when a crowds talking and you hear voices but dont know what people are talking about? It was like that, but whispers. Kids whispers.

Normally, this type of thing wouldnt bother me much. But coming off the night before with the weird shit Jorge and I saw on tape, I started to feel scared. I did my best not to show it.

Ok, so you heard whispers, I said. It was probably the overnight guys working and their voices echoing or something.

Paul looked thoughtful for a minute. Maybe, yeah. He bent down and started to untie his shoelace. But I just dont know how this happened.

He took off the shoe and peeled off his sock. All the toes were raw and red, like hed caught a terrible case of athletes foot. To make matters worse, it looked like the nails were coming off. I winced.

I was fine before I heard all that stuff, Paul informed me. I could see him shaking a little. The other foots just as bad.

I didnt really know what to tell the guy, so I sent him home and excused him for the next night. I told him to get his feet checked out and come back the following Monday. 

That night, I told Jorge I was going to work on some stuff and if he wanted to go home to his wife, he could. I knew hed take the opportunity without question, and he did. I was alone in the security office with the 33 monitors that showed the entire power plant.

Before Paul had left, I asked him where he was when he heard the voices. He told me he was on the utility floor - one of the lowest levels of the plant. I stifled a shudder when I thought of that area. It was remote, dark, and flat-out scary. All pipes, huge machines, and countless barrels and tanks. 

I backed the DVR up to the moment Paul walked out of the stairwell and onto the utility floor. As soon as he entered, he cocked his head like he heard something. He stood still for a minute, then he walked forward down the corridor. I saw him move in and out of the various cameras views. Every so often, hed stop and cock his head again. I felt a chill and goosebumps rose on my arms and neck. I grabbed a handful of the peanut M Ms that counted as my dinner. 

While I chewed the candies, I saw Paul stop dead in his tracks and whirl around. I saw his eyes go wide as he scanned around him for whatever he was hearing. He glanced up at the pipes over his head. As he looked, I saw a puddle form under his feet. It materialized out of nowhere on solid concrete and soaked his shoes all the way up to his ankles. When he looked back down, the puddle disappeared as quickly as it came. He never got a chance to see it.

Again, Paul whirled around. And again. This last time, he started running for the stairwell. I gasped. Behind Paul, leaving a trail that chased him as he ran, were small footprints. I punched the stop button on the DVR and flipped one of the screens onto regular TV. The sound of the Food Network filled the security room. I worked to calm down and tried telling myself there was nothing to be scared of. Just something Paul mustve stepped in that he was tracking all over the place. 

I leaned back in my chair while Bobby Flay demonstrated how to get the proper grill marks on a piece of fish. My breathing normalized and I shook off the last of the goosebumps that dotted my forearms. I threw back another handful of M Ms. The moment I bit down, my mouth erupted with searing pain. I gagged and spit the candies out over the DVR console. I stared in terror at what was just inside my mouth. Between the buttons and keyboard keys were tiny, graying baby teeth.

I retched with disgust and horror. I poured the contents of the candy bag out onto the console. Tens of little teeth clicked and clattered as they spilled out. While my tongue poked around in my mouth and I tried to determine how many of my own teeth were damaged, I noticed something out of the corner of my eye. I turned in my chair. Standing in the doorway was a small, hideously decayed child. The hallway light shone on its naked body. Fat, sightless eyes bulged out of its skull and its wide, toothless mouth lolled down to its sternum.

My body wouldnt to listen to my commands. I wanted to yell. I wanted to run and throw something at the thing. But I couldnt; I was rooted to the chair and unable to do anything but watch. The child waddled two steps toward me. From the back of its its throat, it let out a weak, gurgling scream. Then it turned around, its swollen skin sliding around on its delicate bones as it moved, and walked away, leaving tiny, wet footprints in its wake.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Show of hands: who actually likes wearing condoms? Exactly. Theyre the worst. Theyre uncomfortable, they destroy all feeling, and if you actually manage to complete the act without deflating like one of Tom Bradys footballs, you have to waddle over to the bathroom to throw the thing away while it hangs off you like an eating-disordered grub. But you know what? We still wear them. Because were civilized people. 

Heres the thing: fuck being civilized. Im not going near one of those latex pieces of shit for as long as I live. As if everything I said above wasnt enough, I had to deal with what happened last night. God knows if Ill ever be able to have sex again.

Id only been on one date with Aimee before yesterday, but it was obvious there was a lot of chemistry between us. So, after we had dinner last night, things went their natural way. Thats a nice way of saying we were grunting and sweating all over one another in the cab on the way back to my apartment. I tipped the driver extra.

We made it back to my place and continued the various biological manipulations wed started in the taxi. Added bonus to being at home: less clothing. Anyway, things progressed as wed both anticipated, and a little while later, she was asking me to get a condom. Who was I to deny the lovely woman what shed asked? I reached over and grabbed one from the nightstand. Aimee took it from me and tore off the wrapper. She looked like she was considering the options for a moment, then she leaned over and put the condom back on the nightstand and did something else to me for a little while. Something quite nice, I might add.

About nine seconds later, I had her stop. I knew the date would end pretty damn early if I let her continue. Aimee obliged, then she repositioned herself to the edge of the bed. Even I could figure out what that meant. I got up, grabbed the condom from the nightstand, rolled the thing over my stupid dick, and we went to work. This time, it was for about four seconds.

In that fourth second, something pinched the tip of my penis. Hard. I withdrew faster than the Republican Guard after the fall of Baghdad. I yelped as I pulled out. I heard Aimee mutter, oh my fucking God, really? I wasnt particularly concerned with her annoyance, though. There was an intensely sharp pain directly at the entrance to my urethra. Something hard was inside the condom, no pun intended, and, I realized with growing horror, it was moving. My yelps turned into a sustained shriek as I peeled the condom off while pinching the tip and feeling something wriggling under my fingertips. 

Whatever I was pinching crunched between my thumb and forefinger. Once Id been freed from the condom, I saw what it was: one of the house centipedes the apartment would get whenever it rained outside. Do you know what house centipedes are? [Theyre these things.](http://imgur.com/SzwHzrp) And there was one up my dick. And Id broken it in half. The other piece, which still moved, was lodged firmly inside my urethra. I screamed and screamed and when Aimee turned around and saw what the commotion was, she made a sound I was certain would wake up the entire apartment complex.

I pinched the halved insect and tried to pull it out of me. Again, its crunchy body broke off in my fingers. I wanted to die. The piece that was still stuck in me - the piece that was STILL MOVING - was getting further inside my penis the longer I stood there. 

And then something happened. Its something I never expected and its something I still dont believe could ever occur in real life. But it did. And the world has to know. Still, before I mention it, I need to say that the ordeal ended about 15 seconds later. Aimee left and I went to the hospital to get checked out. The nurses laughed and the doctors looked disapprovingly at the nurses before turning around and shaking with laughter themselves. I was given a clean bill of health and told to make sure nothing crawls into my condom the next time I have sex. It was nice of them to give their medical opinion.

The part I left out, though, was when Aimee demonstrated the true nature of her character. Even though I never expect to see her again, I will be forever in love with that woman. Its because in a time of great stress - in a time when a man is suffering and theres only the act of a great person that can save him - someone will step up and do what needs to be done. Aimee was that person last night. 

In the throes of my misery and pain as I flailed with terror and confusion to get the remaining fraction of the centipede out of my dick, Aimee put her hands on my shoulders. She stared at me; the light of Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives from the television casting an angelic glow on her dark skin. Then she uttered words that will both haunt and enrich my memories for the remaining years of my life: 

Stop moving around so much. She let out a long sigh of abject resignation. 

I can probably suck it out.

	<TEXT> **January 3, 2016**

My son will NOT - I repeat: WILL NOT be getting any more vaccines. I was ignorant about how bad they were for the first four years and I never told the doctors to leave him alone. Well, thank God he got lucky and seems fine, despite that. I got my eyes open now. Sandra Barkers child got poked with all those needles and shot through with nasty chemicals and guess what? Her poor little Eva ended up half retarded. A damn shame for Sandra and her little girl. Sorry big pharma, you cant have my Thomas. No way in hell. And Im going to tell the doctor that at his checkup tomorrow.

**January 4, 2016**

Doctors just make me sick. Funny, huh? Like its the opposite of what they say theyre gonna do. Thomas doctor is so rude and pushy. He has the nerve to think he knows whats better for my son than I do. Me. His mother. The strong woman who gave birth to him. You know, because he went to some fancy college in New York and got a piece of paper saying he can look at sick children. 

By the way, his name is Dr. Rav Mati and his practice is in Alfonse Creek, West Virginia. Dont even think about going to him with your own boy or girl. All hell do is try to push vaccines on them and gets fresh when you tell him to prove the shots wont make the kids sick. The man even said theres a shot for chickenpox now. Chickenpox! Those pharma fat cats will take every dollar youve got. I guess they dont think us parents were taught by our own moms about how to deal with chickenpox. A child has to catch it if they want to get strong! I think Earl has a point when he said those companies are trying to make kids grow up weak so theyll vote liberal. Theres no other explanation I can think of. I married a smart man.

**January 7th, 2016**

As luck would have it, Sandra Barkers poor retarded girl got chickenpox at the special daycare she has to go to. When Sandra called me up, I was relieved. After dealing with that stupid Dr. Mati the other day, Id started to worry Thomas wouldnt get to be around other kids who had it if their parents had been duped into getting them vaccinated. The last thing I wanted was for Thomas to be weak. God forbid he ended up that way and Earl found out he was a homosexual. Im not even going to think about that. No need to do that to myself.

Anyway, Sandra and I set up a playdate for Thomas and Sandras little Eva. Well go over tomorrow at lunchtime so I can be back to cook dinner in the afternoon. 

**January 8th, 2016**

Thomas seemed to have fun with little Eva. It breaks my heart to see that little girl, though. She just doesnt know whats going on half the time. Thomas was a good boy, though, and was very gentle and shared his toys. Sandra suggested we let them share a spoon and bowl when they ate their lunch so hed get a better chance of catching her chickenpox. So they shared their chicken soup and Sandra and I talked for a while. Thomas and I went home around 3:30. Perfect timing to get dinner started.

**January 11th, 2016**

Earl was grumpy this morning when he left for his business trip. He was hollering and complaining about one thing or another, but then he left and things were quiet again. I bet his job is more stressful than I know. Hell, this trip will keep him away from home for three weeks. I wish I told him I was sorry before he went, though. I always feel bad when I feel like I put him in one of his moods.

On a good note, Thomas started to get a fever and he said he was itchy. When I gave him his bath at night, I saw the little dots of chickenpox starting to show up. I called up Sandra to thank her and asked how Eva was doing. Sandra said Eva had it bad but no worse than her cousin Duane did a couple years ago. I got a little sad that Thomas would be so uncomfortable soon, but it was worth it in the long run. Hed be good and strong.

**January 12th, 2016**

Its amazing how fast chickenpox shows up! Thomas went to bed with little pinprick dots and woke up with big blotches the size of pepperoni slices. Hes scratching them like crazy and I keep slapping his hands so he wont cut himself with his fingernails. I cant stop thinking about all the poor kids whose parents were so ignorant about how the world works that they listened to Dr. Mati and all the other doctors like him. All the doctors lining their pockets with big pharma money so they can donate it to the democrats and whoever else hates families. Well, theyll see. Its families like ours who get strong and survive.

**January 13th, 2016**

Thomas started getting blisters on his palms. I dont think theyre from chickenpox, but the nice ladies on the homeschool forum I started visiting last year said it was probably just from his fever. Once his fever goes down, theyll go away. And if they got any worse, it would just have to run its course. Hes young and hell heal up good enough.

As mean as this sounds, Im a little glad the blisters seem to hurt because it stops Thomas from scratching. Didnt stop him from complaining, though! Not one bit. But its okay. I can take it! This is mom territory - we live to deal with kids complaining.

**January 14th, 2016**

Thomas is COVERED with chickenpox. Even when I part his hair, I see them on his scalp. Some of the older ones started to get big whiteheads on them. The one on the tip of his nose looks so uncomfortable, the poor kid. I remember having pimples when I was a teenager. These pox are like five times bigger. Maybe later on tonight Ill squeeze a few of them to help take some of the pressure off.

**January 15th, 2016**

In the bath last night, I popped about 20 of Thomas riper chickenpox. I squeezed and squeezed and that gunk just plopped down into the water. I had to mash it up with a wire brush before it would all get down the drain. Nasty nasty nasty! But still, its natural. So much more natural than whatever the doctor wouldve pumped into him.

The pox I squeezed dry just look like holes now. Theyre pretty swollen but he said they dont itch anymore. The holes are about as wide as a dime. I put Neosporin on them just so they wouldnt get infected and Im changing his bedsheets every night. I might be being a little overprotective, but hey, Im a mom. Its what moms do. Well, the good ones at least.

**January 16th, 2016**

I squeezed out more and more of those chickenpox last night. The ones Id squeezed the night before didnt fill up again, at least. Poor Thomas looks so ragged. Its like hes covered in little, swollen volcanos. At least this is running its course and itll be over in another few days. 

Im a tiny bit worried about the fever blisters on his hands and feet. My camera in my phones still busted, but I went online and [found a picture](http://imgur.com/mmYISca) thats pretty similar. Obviously this persons hand is much bigger than Thomas, but the look is the same. True to what the homeschool ladies said, he was still running a fever. 102 on the nose. Once that goes down, his hands will heal up and hell be good as new.

**January 17th, 2016**

Thomas woke me up this morning! He hasnt done that since he would cry and yell when he was a tiny baby. But he was standing next to my bed and saying that his body hurts. Well, I took one look at him and saw why. The poor boys chickenpox looked worse than any chickenpox Id ever seen. Ill admit it - I got pretty scared. His entire body - all his skin - was just filled up with holes. It looked like the remaining whiteheads had popped when he was asleep because he was all smeared with it. 

I brought him into the bath and rinsed him off. The water seemed to help him feel a little better, so I let him soak in the tub while I sat next to him in a chair with my laptop. I asked online if chickenpox were supposed to get so bad. One of the homeschool ladies asked if hed been vaccinated. I was super embarrassed when I told her he got all his shots up until this year because I didnt know any better. I felt awful admitting that to these smart people. But they were so kind and understanding. Then I was told what Id assumed but didnt want to take for granted: his case of chickenpox is worse because of the vaccines he got as a baby. Something about mercury poisoning and his body using the chickenpox as an opportunity to cleanse the toxins from his body.

While Thomas splashed around and I talked to the ladies online, I felt a lot better. By this time next week, hed be healing up like nothing had happened.

**January 18th, 2016**

Thomas looked just as bad this morning. He asked right away if he could take a bath, so we did what we did yesterday. I paid more attention to his skin this time. I dont know exactly how to describe him. Maybe the inside of a wasp nest? Hes just so covered with holes that I can barely make out any skin that isnt part of a crater, especially now that hes in the water and his skin is swelling.

Im just so mad at all the doctors and corporations who put those chemicals into Thomas when he was a baby. Im mad at myself for listening to them. Like I was just following orders like some damn Nazi. Because thats what those big pharma liberals are, you know. Theres a reason socialist is in national socialist. Of course you know. And this countrys going down the tubes because of it. And Thomas is suffering in that bathtub for the same damn reason. 

**January 19th, 2016**

Im about to go ask the ladies on the homeschool forum for some help because I just went to wake Thomas and all his holes are leaking. Theres yellow stuff coming out of them and a tiny black hard thing is poking out of each one. Its like a pebble or a seed or something godawful. When he opened his eyes, I could see more holes starting to form in the corners where his tears come out. He said he could see me but I looked like I was underwater.

I carried him to the bathroom so he could do his business, and when he sat down on the toilet, some holes in his thighs split and the stuff inside, the yellow gunk and the hard pebble piece, bulged out. He looked at me like he was scared and started to pick at it. His finger slid all the way inside. 

Theres no way Im going to the doctor wholl just inject him with more stuff to make this even worse, but Im concerned his chickenpox might be getting infected. I guess its time to go ask online. The ladies from the homeschool forum have been so helpful already. Its great to be able to rely on the wisdom of moms.

	<TITLE> Soft Teeth </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-26 16:20:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remember the man with the soft teeth. Hed come into my room at night and bite me over and over. The bites didnt hurt and they left no marks. All I felt was pressure. 

The first time I saw his face, I was terrified. His eyes were different. Instead of two eye sockets, he had nine. They were clustered in front of his face and up his forehead like a honeycomb. Two on top, four in the middle, three on the bottom. The sockets didnt house eyeballs. There was a single, thin eyestalk growing from the center of each hole. Each stalk swayed in front of his face like long grass in the breeze.

When hed visit me, Id lose the ability to move or scream. All I could do was watch. After a week of visits and my parents not believing a word that came out of my mouth, I thought sleeping with the light on might keep him away. That was the night he started biting my face.

The man would always move slowly and with great care. Every motion seemed calculated and precise; I didnt know what he was doing, but I had no doubt he did. The first time he got close to my head, I saw the inside of his mouth. Like his eyes, his teeth were unlike any Id seen. There were three rows of bulbous growths pushing from an array of holes in his gumline. They looked as soft as they felt. Each one was covered in fine, downy hairs. They reminded me of the fat bodies of moths.

Hed open my mouth with his index finger and thumb. Then hed get close. I felt his eyestalks brushing against my face and forehead and eyes as he pressed his upper teeth against my lower ones. Hed close his mouth around my chin, locking my lower jaw in his mouth. It was uncomfortable, but it didnt hurt. The man would stay there for ten minutes at a time, gradually modulating the pressure of his jaw against mine.

On the last night he visited me, he performed the same steps. Once my jaw was in his mouth, though, he applied more pressure than hed used in the past. His eyestalks straightened out and felt like firm cables against my face. As the pressure increased, I felt his teeth start to burst against my own. One by one, the thick, insectile bodies inside his mouth succumbed to the pressure and coated my tongue and gums with thick, bitter paste. I felt his tongue, which had never been involved in our interactions before, extending over my teeth and massaging the paste into my gums. I tried to retch, but even that had been taken from me.

The man did the same with my upper teeth and palate. When he left and I could move again, I rushed to the bathroom, threw up, and brushed my teeth more times than I could count. I never saw the man again.

Its been 25 years. Ive been plagued by dental issues my entire adult life. Every visit brings worse news; its gotten to the point where Im dealing with irreversible bone loss. Eventually, my teeth will fall out. The foundation to which theyre attached is simply deteriorating. Its not uncommon, but its rare for someone my age who is otherwise in perfect health.

As if on cue, the day after my most recent trip to the dentist, I lost my first tooth. Id felt it loosening and the dentist said it was only a matter of time. And more will follow. I scheduled an appointment to see him in three months. It was as frequently as my insurance would allow. More of my teeth started to wiggle when I poked at them with my tongue. I started to accept their fate.

Recently, my resignation has developed flickers of fear and disbelief. The tooth that fell out started to grow back. Id never heard of such a thing. But I can see something grayish-white pushing through the raw socket. When I touch it with my tongue, its soft. And I can feel my tongue brushing against it, almost as if it has nerves of its own. Im trying not to think back to the memories of the man in my room, but its impossible not to. Not when more of my teeth grow looser by the day. And especially not when I have seven painful spots near my eyes and forehead that feel softer than they should.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Jaimes car accident nearly killed him. His coma lasted eight weeks. When he regained consciousness, he couldnt recognize me and Inez. Prosopagnosia - face blindness - was the diagnosis. The doctors wouldnt give us any answers about whether or not hed get better. They just said wed have to wait and see. Jaime could remember who we were; he knew he had a wife named Carla and a daughter named Inez, but whenever we walked into the room, he saw two strangers.

Over time, he started to recover. The recovery wasnt total. Not even close. Hed jump with shock and surprise if Inez came into the room too quickly and didnt leave him enough time to remember it was her. Last month, when Jaime and I were in the shower, I washed his hair and shoulders and back, but when he turned around, he yelped and tried to get away. He slipped and almost cracked his head on the faucet.

The therapist suggested Jaime carry and study a photograph of Inez and me as frequently as possible. The goal was for his damaged brain to hopefully remap the features hed lost the ability to retain. After a couple months, we saw some major improvements. Still far from perfect, but much, much better. The frightened, jumpy person he became after the accident slowly started to resemble the strong, protective man Id married.

Last night, I was jolted awake by the sound of Jaime shrieking. He wasnt in bed. The sound came from down the hall. From Inezs room. I jumped out of bed and ran to see what was wrong. Jaime met me halfway. His hands were covered in blood.

Its wearing her face!, he screamed. He gripped my shoulders and studied my features with his wide, terrified eyes. It stole her face!

I struggled out of his grasp as Jaime sunk to the floor and called after me. Find Inez!, he choked out. Please. He sobbed as I turned the corner into our Inezs room.

Gaping holes that once housed eyes oozed blood down pale cheeks. Those same eyes were now forced deep into the skull by the panicked violence of my husband. As I screamed with incomprehensible horror, Jaime came up behind me and bellowed, get away from it! Find Inez!

Jaime tore through Inezs closet with the picture of Inez and me in his hand, frantically scanning everything inside for the girl who matched the appearance of his daughter in the photograph. My breath caught in my throat. In the picture Jaime studied to memorize the faces of his family, I was sitting behind Inez and brushing her long, black hair.

What are you doing?, he screamed at me. Help me find her!

Sobbing, I collapsed on the bed and cradled the cooling body on the blood-soaked Steven Universe sheets. After Jaime had gone to sleep, Id finally given in to Inezs nagging. Instead of the luxurious, flowing hair in the picture, Inez went to bed with her new, short, pixie-style haircut.
