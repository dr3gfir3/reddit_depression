You'd prefer if you got to keep all the money you earn and not have any of it go to poor people because because fuck them, they should have worked harder. Because you worked hard and built everything you have and fuck other people for needing some of yours. Only that argument doesn't really hold up to scrutiny. And the great myth of the American dream is that not everyone has equal opportunity to succeed. It doesn't work for the wealthy unless most people are poor because there are finite resources. I am ok with a portion of my taxes going to subsidize those with less. I am ok with helping others. And I don't even want to specify what help other's should receive because I want to help others. And I do, both through taxes and personally. I accept the social contract with my government. I accept that I live in a society with other people that are different from me. I welcome new experiences and cultures and look forward to learning about the rest of the world and how each of us is different and how we are all the same. I am a good citizen and a good person.

Not when those costs exceed the programs he's cutting.

	<TEXT> So you're trying to justify your conservative leanings by simply saying that I've declared a monopoly on morality? I've not dismissed you at all for not sharing in American values. I simply don't believe your stance is particularly popular. And the argument can be made that most of the people who share your viewpoint, do so in conflict with their own interests. But the budget is clearly not in keeping with American values. Trumps choices to cut relatively inexpensive programs that help real Americans to pay for his repeated trips to Mara Lago shows a lack of morality. His choice to cut funding to the NYPD, by $190 million, shows a lack of morality. He fully understands the NYPD protects his own family and property. Deciding to cut their funding, thereby reducing the city's ability to provide protection for his family is amoral. Make any argument you want against this. It simply won't follow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> two things to remember:
Bernie is independent.
Bernie is winning hearts and minds in the heartland through his townhall meetings with Chris Hayes on MSNBC. He's visiting deeply red states and talking with people about issues. He's winning them on issues. These are deeply conservative people who are starting to recognize that they aren't so conservative after all, because it's not in their own interest to be conservative. This has always been the conundrum of the conservative base. So many of them vote against their own interests. They tend to only listen to vitriol coming from alt-right conservative media outlets because they are being told bad things about the "evil liberals". It's only when they recognize the party shifted it's values that they understand they don't share those values. The republican party now only advocates for the ultra wealthy. They put in place policies that only benefit the wealthy. And when people start to understand this they understand the reality of their situation. And they start to think more deeply about what they really want. And they start to recognize their party doesn't want what they want. And now those voters are starting to understand that Trump directly lied to them to gain power. And this is the core difference between the parties. Democrats believe the government should follow the will of the people. Republicans believe government should only do what the constitution says and stay out of everything else, especially a "free" market. We have had decades of evidence that proves that a "free" market always gravitates towards monopolies and rule by Robber Barons, which inevitably leads to fascism, where the corporations become the government. And it's not a far leap to see that corporate interests have unduly influenced government for decades. And now that Trump is in power, he is filling the administration with corporate interests. The swamp is filling, and it's the more rain is coming. </TEXT>

Because that more than likely came from outsourced American jobs. I don't blame you or your parents for this. I blame American greed. Our conundrum is one of our own making. India only has a middle class because American companies sent American wealth en masse to reap benefits from cheap labor. It's upwardly mobilized almost an entire Indian generation. But in doing this good thing for India, it has had a negative effect on an entire American generation. I'd imagine this is how your red state sees you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Morality is subjective to those who have loose morals.

American morals have been pretty solid for at least a hundred years.

There are a few morals shared by a majority of the nation. Don't kill, help those less fortunate, heal the sick, protect the weak.  Those are core values shared by most of the world. This budget goes against most of those. The logical takeaway is that Donald Trump doesn't believe in the morality of those values. It's not his priority to protect the weak or heal the sick or help those less fortunate. It's pretty clear that those who have never done without have far less empathy for those without. And this is where morality comes into play. One can argue that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet have better morals than Donald Trump and his ilk. It's been very clear, considering Trumps record, that he does not believe in American values the way the majority of the nation does. Trump has a proven record of lying, cheating, misogyny, faking charitable donations, and racism. It's not a logical leap to make the argument that his budget is not in keeping with the morality of Administrations past. I argue that Donald Trump isn't immoral, but amoral. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The alt-right believe that some degree of separation between peoples is necessary for a culture to be preserved. 

By "culture" he, of course, means racism. The only people that appear to be complaining about this live in rural areas. The 21st century is spreading and they don't like it.

The alt-right are, by all means, the American Taliban. They are opposed to progress and change in any form that doesn't see themselves on top.

I wrote about this just after the election:

I think the core of our ideological differences resides in how we perceive time. I plan for the future which adapts to change to fix today's problems. Conservatives plan for a future which regresses because they think today's problems are caused by change. But that's the nature of time. Why we call it an arrow. You can't go back. Only forward.
So let's look forward. And in every decision you make, think of how you can adapt to the inevitable change of the universe. Evolve. </TEXT>
