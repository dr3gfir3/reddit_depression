	<TEXT> The easiest thing would propably be to simply throw it into a mixer. But i sometimes i do also put them in a bag and pund it with a heavy pot or something. If youre in a bad mood.... go with the second one :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes it absolutely is a regional thing.  Well the best thing is, if available to take a more european style bread. Most of the times it isn't that sweet. Which i prefer. You can use toast for example (maybe thats what you mean with "sandwich bread? ) Sorry stupid german. i dont know all the expresions :-) Make sure the crumbs are reall fine. 

The essential part to make the schnel look like that is to use enough fat! No matter if you are using oil or condensed butter. Ideally the Schnitzel doesn't touch the bottom of the pan. 

The moment you see that the sides of the schnitzel get slightly colored you have to move the pan around so that the fat swashes over to the Schnitzel. Then wait a little and turn the Schnitzel. Then do the same thing with the other side. just repeat that a couple of times. 

Another thing is to be careful when you dip the schnitzel into the breadcrumbs. Really just slightly press the meat into the crumbs. Ideally do not press at all. Just throw it in there and what sticks to it is enough. just so that everything is covered. 

Another trick is to give a little bit of mineral water to the eggs. Just experiment with it. Cant wait for your feedback. You'll see it works. 

Cheers </TEXT>
