Always head to dam to stock up on bud and driven through most countries without any searches(apart from Switzerland, cops were nice enough but did proper search, we was just better at hiding it. Mind you if they had used dogs they probably would've found stash). Never been to Sweden. It's on my list, I've heard Gothenburg is kind of expensive. Beer is expensive so stayed away lol.  </TEXT>

The rest of the world does generally follow Usa on their good points. So hopefully they pick up on this. 

Most skunk is grown in here in the uk. Now there's q big problem with violent criminals robbing grow houses. Creating more work for the police. They already got road side drug test here. 
It's all about education not enforcement. Until they figure out how to tax it government won't want to get involved.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mate. I've tried before. I'll give it another shot. Everything you guys smoke you call weed. But over here when you ask for weed you get either commercial weed, Thai weed or hi-grade weed. That's the 3 types of weed we have over here. Then you have skunk which is the general name given to all high strength cannabis(lemon haze, cheese,amnesia haze the 3 most common types I get). which is what most people smoke and get more easily then weed.  They are completely different  in every way; different look, smell, taste  amp; buzz. 
Most skunk smokers won't touch weed  amp; a lot of weed smokers wouldn't smoke skunk. 

Here's the link.

	<TEXT> I posted this before but basically got down voted because what we(uk) call skunk is what Usa calls weed. They call all cannabis plants weed. We however have 2 types of cannabis "weed"   "skunk". Obviously this is local terminology and USA ents. Will not agree but as you are a Londoner like myself. I can assure you that this is how we class cannabis in London. When you read in papers or articles about skunk. That is the type of cannabis your dealer is supplying. 90% of people I know who smoke all smoke skunk. However a few people smoke only weed because "it don't fry your brain". I smoke both. 
Here's a pic of Thai weed. It's nowhere near as good as skunk but honestly it's a different level/type of buzz. Like comparing beer   vodka. When you just want to chill have a beer. If you wanna get fucked up open bottle of vodka. That's how I like to compare the two. Weed   skunk are very very different. Weed looks like this  http://i.imgur.com/0S0F41B.jpg
