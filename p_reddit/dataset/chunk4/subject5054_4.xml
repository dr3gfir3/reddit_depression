	<TEXT> Study: [Recent acceleration in coastal cliff retreat rates on the south coast of Great Britain](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/02/1613044113)
___


**Significance**:

Cliffed coasts erode when attacked by energetic waves. Cliff retreat threatens coastal assets and livelihoods. Understanding rates of past erosion is vital to quantifying these risks, particularly when confronted with expected increases in storminess and sea level, and given continued human occupation and engineering of coastal regions. Historical observations of cliff retreat span 150 y at most. We derived past cliff retreat rates over millennial time scales for chalk cliffs on the south coast of Great Britain by interpreting measured cosmogenic nuclides with numerical models. Our results provide evidence for accelerated erosion in recent centuries, which we suggest is driven by reduced sediment supply and thinning of beaches in the face of environmental and anthropogenic changes.

**Abstract**:

Rising sea levels and increased storminess are expected to accelerate the erosion of soft-cliff coastlines, threatening coastal infrastructure and livelihoods. To develop predictive models of future coastal change we need fundamentally to know how rapidly coasts have been eroding in the past, and to understand the driving mechanisms of coastal change. Direct observations of cliff retreat rarely extend beyond 150 y, during which humans have significantly modified the coastal system. Cliff retreat rates are unknown in prior centuries and millennia. In this study, we derived retreat rates of chalk cliffs on the south coast of Great Britain over millennial time scales by coupling high-precision cosmogenic radionuclide geochronology and rigorous numerical modeling. Measured ^10 Be concentrations on rocky coastal platforms were compared with simulations of coastal evolution using a Monte Carlo approach to determine the most likely history of cliff retreat. The ^10 Be concentrations are consistent with retreat rates of chalk cliffs that were relatively slow (26 cmy^1 ) until a few hundred years ago. Historical observations reveal that retreat rates have subsequently accelerated by an order of magnitude (2232 cmy^1 ). We suggest that acceleration is the result of thinning of cliff-front beaches, exacerbated by regional storminess and anthropogenic modification of the coast.

	<TEXT> Report: [Unbreakable : Building the Resilience of the Poor in the Face of Natural Disasters](https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/25335)
___

Economic losses from natural disasters totaled $92 billion in 2015. Such statements, all too commonplace, assess the severity of disasters by no other measure than the damage inflicted on buildings, infrastructure, and agricultural production. But $1 in losses does not mean the same thing to a rich person that it does to a poor person; the gravity of a $92 billion loss depends on who experiences it. By focusing on aggregate lossesthe traditional approach to disaster riskwe restrict our consideration to how disasters affect those wealthy enough to have assets to lose in the first place, and largely ignore the plight of poor people. This report moves beyond asset and production losses and shifts its attention to how natural disasters affect peoples well-being. Disasters are far greater threats to well-being than traditional estimates suggest. This approach provides a more nuanced view of natural disasters than usual reporting, and a perspective that takes fuller account of poor peoples vulnerabilities. Poor people suffer only a fraction of economic losses caused by disasters, but they bear the brunt of their consequences. Understanding the disproportionate vulnerability of poor people also makes the case for setting new intervention priorities to lessen the impact of natural disasters on the worlds poor, such as expanding financial inclusion, disaster risk and health insurance, social protection and adaptive safety nets, contingent finance and reserve funds, and universal access to early warning systems. Efforts to reduce disaster risk and poverty go hand in hand. Because disasters impoverish so many, disaster risk management is inseparable from poverty reduction policy, and vice versa. As climate change magnifies natural hazards, and because protection infrastructure alone cannot eliminate risk, a more resilient population has never been more critical to breaking the cycle of disaster-induced poverty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suspect you are actually referring to the study by Zwally et al which was more about growth of ice within Antarctica's interior. The following (from a previous comment of mine) should help explain:
___

About a year go now the Zwally et al. (NASA) paper came out. Polar ice refers to ice within the polar regions, both in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. There is no question regarding the decline of the Greenland Ice Sheet, glaciers, or Arctic Sea Ice. When it comes to the southern hemisphere, glacial mass is in decline, as is the Antarctic Ice Sheet (land ice); however, Antarctic Sea Ice has shown limited growth.

The picture gets somewhat complicated because some regions of Antarctica are gaining mass while others are losing mass. In general, the ice shelves and outlet glaciers in western Antarctica are losing mass while those in eastern Antarctica have been gaining   losing mass (see [map](https://i.imgur.com/hQEU9kS.jpg))^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/327).

When it comes to the interior of Antarctica; however, the NASA study (Zwally et al.) argued for an increase in ice mass within the western interior of Antarctica which is at odds with a plethora of other studies that find the opposite trend (see [figure](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Antarctic_MassBalance_.png)).

While the data Zwally used only extended to 2008 he did have the following to say: 

Were essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica, said Jay Zwally... Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica  there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.

The Zwally et al. study is [heavily disputed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/a-controversial-nasa-study-says-antarctica-is-gaining-ice-heres-why-you-should-stay-skeptical/?utm_term=.acf49c62d653) and one should always be skeptical of a single study that contradicts countless others.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Reservoir Water Surfaces: A New Global Synthesis](http://bioscience.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2016/10/02/biosci.biw117.full)
___

**Abstract**:

Collectively, reservoirs created by dams are thought to be an important source of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to the atmosphere. So far, efforts to quantify, model, and manage these emissions have been limited by data availability and inconsistencies in methodological approach. Here, we synthesize reservoir CH4, CO2, and N2O emission data with three main objectives: (1) to generate a global estimate of GHG emissions from reservoirs, (2) to identify the best predictors of these emissions, and (3) to consider the effect of methodology on emission estimates. We estimate that GHG emissions from reservoir water surfaces account for 0.8 (0.51.2) Pg CO2 equivalents per year, with the majority of this forcing due to CH4. We then discuss the potential for several alternative pathways such as dam degassing and downstream emissions to contribute significantly to overall emissions. Although prior studies have linked reservoir GHG emissions to reservoir age and latitude, we find that factors related to reservoir productivity are better predictors of emission.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Global Carbon Budget 2016](http://www.earth-syst-sci-data.net/8/605/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere  the global carbon budget  is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe data sets and methodology to quantify all major components of the global carbon budget, including their uncertainties, based on the combination of a range of data, algorithms, statistics, and model estimates and their interpretation by a broad scientific community. We discuss changes compared to previous estimates and consistency within and among components, alongside methodology and data limitations. CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry (EFF) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, respectively, while emissions from land-use change (ELUC), mainly deforestation, are based on combined evidence from land-cover change data, fire activity associated with deforestation, and models. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured directly and its rate of growth (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The mean ocean CO2 sink (SOCEAN) is based on observations from the 1990s, while the annual anomalies and trends are estimated with ocean models. The variability in SOCEAN is evaluated with data products based on surveys of ocean CO2 measurements. The global residual terrestrial CO2 sink (SLAND) is estimated by the difference of the other terms of the global carbon budget and compared to results of independent dynamic global vegetation models. We compare the mean land and ocean fluxes and their variability to estimates from three atmospheric inverse methods for three broad latitude bands. All uncertainties are reported as 1, reflecting the current capacity to characterise the annual estimates of each component of the global carbon budget. For the last decade available (20062015), EFF was 9.3  0.5 GtC yr^1 , ELUC 1.0  0.5 GtC yr^1 , GATM 4.5  0.1 GtC yr^1 , SOCEAN 2.6  0.5 GtC yr^1 , and SLAND 3.1  0.9 GtC yr^1 . For year 2015 alone, the growth in EFF was approximately zero and emissions remained at 9.9  0.5 GtC yr^^1 , showing a slowdown in growth of these emissions compared to the average growth of 1.8 % yr^1 that took place during 20062015. Also, for 2015, ELUC was 1.3  0.5 GtC yr^1 , GATM was 6.3  0.2 GtC yr^1 , SOCEAN was 3.0  0.5 GtC yr^1 , and SLAND was 1.9  0.9 GtC yr^1 . GATM was higher in 2015 compared to the past decade (20062015), reflecting a smaller SLAND for that year. The global atmospheric CO2 concentration reached 399.4  0.1 ppm averaged over 2015. For 2016, preliminary data indicate the continuation of low growth in EFF with +0.2 % (range of 1.0 to +1.8 %) based on national emissions projections for China and USA, and projections of gross domestic product corrected for recent changes in the carbon intensity of the economy for the rest of the world. In spite of the low growth of EFF in 2016, the growth rate in atmospheric CO2 concentration is expected to be relatively high because of the persistence of the smaller residual terrestrial sink (SLAND) in response to El Nio conditions of 20152016. From this projection of EFF and assumed constant ELUC for 2016, cumulative emissions of CO2 will reach 565  55 GtC (2075  205 GtCO2) for 18702016, about 75 % from EFF and 25 % from ELUC. This living data update documents changes in the methods and data sets used in this new carbon budget compared with previous publications of this data set (Le Qur et al., 2015b, a, 2014, 2013). All observations presented here can be downloaded from the Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center (doi:10.3334/CDIAC/GCP_2016). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The chemical weathering rates presented here represent an average over the past 150Myr. Mars may currently be experiencing an interglacial period and probably the driest conditions in equatorial regions. But over the last 10Myr this may have been preceded by several glacial intervals and a change from a low mean obliquity to a high mean obliquity period. For the majority of the time there may therefore have been more moisture at the equatorial latitudes of Meridiani than at present.

Are the authors suggesting that interglacial periods are more arid than glacial periods on Mars? On Earth, glacial periods are denoted by an increase in dust flux (loess deposits) as water is locked away in ice sheets / caps / glaciers and conditions become more arid, with interglacial periods indicated by warmer conditions and subsequently wetter conditions.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [An advanced modeling study on the impacts and atmospheric implications of multiphase dimethyl sulfide chemistry](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/42/11776)
___


**Significance**:

Climate models indicate the importance of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) oxidation in new aerosol particle formation and the activation of cloud condensation nuclei over oceans. These effects contribute to strong natural negative radiative forcing and substantially influence the Earths climate. However, the DMS oxidation pathway is not well-represented, because earlier model studies only parameterized gas-phase DMS oxidation and neglected multiphase chemistry. Here, we performed the most comprehensive current mechanistic studies on multiphase DMS oxidation. The studies imply that neglecting multiphase chemistry leads to significant overestimation of SO2 production and subsequent new particle formation. These findings show that an advanced treatment of multiphase DMS chemistry is necessary to improve marine atmospheric chemistry and climate model predictions.

**Abstract**:

Oceans dominate emissions of dimethyl sulfide (DMS), the major natural sulfur source. DMS is important for the formation of non-sea salt sulfate (nss-SO4^2 ) aerosols and secondary particulate matter over oceans and thus, significantly influence global climate. The mechanism of DMS oxidation has accordingly been investigated in several different model studies in the past. However, these studies had restricted oxidation mechanisms that mostly underrepresented important aqueous-phase chemical processes. These neglected but highly effective processes strongly impact direct product yields of DMS oxidation, thereby affecting the climatic influence of aerosols. To address these shortfalls, an extensive multiphase DMS chemistry mechanism, the Chemical Aqueous Phase Radical Mechanism DMS Module 1.0, was developed and used in detailed model investigations of multiphase DMS chemistry in the marine boundary layer. The performed model studies confirmed the importance of aqueous-phase chemistry for the fate of DMS and its oxidation products. Aqueous-phase processes significantly reduce the yield of sulfur dioxide and increase that of methyl sulfonic acid (MSA), which is needed to close the gap between modeled and measured MSA concentrations. Finally, the simulations imply that multiphase DMS oxidation produces equal amounts of MSA and sulfate, a result that has significant implications for nss-SO4^2 aerosol formation, cloud condensation nuclei concentration, and cloud albedo over oceans. Our findings show the deficiencies of parameterizations currently used in higher-scale models, which only treat gas-phase chemistry. Overall, this study shows that treatment of DMS chemistry in both gas and aqueous phases is essential to improve the accuracy of model predictions.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Amazonian chemical weathering rate derived from stony meteorite finds at Meridiani Planum on Mars](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13459)
___

**Abstract**:

Spacecraft exploring Mars such as the Mars Exploration Rovers Spirit and Opportunity, as well as the Mars Science Laboratory or Curiosity rover, have accumulated evidence for wet and habitable conditions on early Mars more than 3 billion years ago. Current conditions, by contrast, are cold, extremely arid and seemingly inhospitable. To evaluate exactly how dry todays environment is, it is important to understand the ongoing current weathering processes. Here we present chemical weathering rates determined for Mars. We use the oxidation of iron in stony meteorites investigated by the Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity at Meridiani Planum. Their maximum exposure age is constrained by the formation of Victoria crater and their minimum age by erosion of the meteorites. The chemical weathering rates thus derived are 1 to 4 orders of magnitude slower than that of similar meteorites found in Antarctica where the slowest rates are observed on Earth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Glacial isostatic uplift of the European Alps](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13382)
___

**Abstract**:

Following the last glacial maximum (LGM), the demise of continental ice sheets induced crustal rebound in tectonically stable regions of North America and Scandinavia that is still ongoing. Unlike the ice sheets, the Alpine ice cap developed in an orogen where the measured uplift is potentially attributed to tectonic shortening, lithospheric delamination and unloading due to deglaciation and erosion. Here we show that 90% of the geodetically measured rock uplift in the Alps can be explained by the Earths viscoelastic response to LGM deglaciation. We modelled rock uplift by reconstructing the Alpine ice cap, while accounting for postglacial erosion, sediment deposition and spatial variations in lithospheric rigidity. Clusters of excessive uplift in the Rhne Valley and in the Eastern Alps delineate regions potentially affected by mantle processes, crustal heterogeneity and active tectonics. Our study shows that even small LGM ice caps can dominate present-day rock uplift in tectonically active regions. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Spinal cord injury disrupts the communication between the brain and the spinal circuits that orchestrate movement. To bypass the lesion, braincomputer interfaces have directly linked cortical activity to electrical stimulation of muscles, and have thus restored grasping abilities after hand paralysis. Theoretically, this strategy could also restore control over leg muscle activity for walking. However, replicating the complex sequence of individual muscle activation patterns underlying natural and adaptive locomotor movements poses formidable conceptual and technological challenges. Recently, it was shown in rats that epidural electrical stimulation of the lumbar spinal cord can reproduce the natural activation of synergistic muscle groups producing locomotion. Here we interface leg motor cortex activity with epidural electrical stimulation protocols to establish a brainspine interface that alleviated gait deficits after a spinal cord injury in non-human primates. Rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were implanted with an intracortical microelectrode array in the leg area of the motor cortex and with a spinal cord stimulation system composed of a spatially selective epidural implant and a pulse generator with real-time triggering capabilities. We designed and implemented wireless control systems that linked online neural decoding of extension and flexion motor states with stimulation protocols promoting these movements. These systems allowed the monkeys to behave freely without any restrictions or constraining tethered electronics. After validation of the brainspine interface in intact (uninjured) monkeys, we performed a unilateral corticospinal tract lesion at the thoracic level. As early as six days post-injury and without prior training of the monkeys, the brainspine interface restored weight-bearing locomotion of the paralysed leg on a treadmill and overground. The implantable components integrated in the brainspine interface have all been approved for investigational applications in similar human research, suggesting a practical translational pathway for proof-of-concept studies in people with spinal cord injury. </TEXT>

**Accumulating impacts**:

Anthropogenic climate change is now in full swing, our global average temperature already having increased by 1C from preindustrial levels. Many studies have documented individual impacts of the changing climate that are particular to species or regions, but individual impacts are accumulating and being amplified more broadly. Scheffers et al. review the set of impacts that have been observed across genes, species, and ecosystems to reveal a world already undergoing substantial change. Understanding the causes, consequences, and potential mitigation of these changes will be essential as we move forward into a warming world.

**Structured Abstract**:

BACKGROUND:

Climate change impacts have now been documented across every ecosystem on Earth, despite an average warming of only ~1C so far. Here, we describe the full range and scale of climate change effects on global biodiversity that have been observed in natural systems. To do this, we identify a set of core ecological processes (32 in terrestrial and 31 each in marine and freshwater ecosystems) that underpin ecosystem functioning and support services to people. Of the 94 processes considered, 82% show evidence of impact from climate change in the peer-reviewed literature. Examples of observed impacts from meta-analyses and case studies go beyond well-established shifts in species ranges and changes to phenology and population dynamics to include disruptions that scale from the gene to the ecosystem.

ADVANCES:

Species are undergoing evolutionary adaptation to temperature extremes, and climate change has substantial impacts on species physiology that include changes in tolerances to high temperatures, shifts in sex ratios in species with temperature-dependent sex determination, and increased metabolic costs of living in a warmer world. These physiological adjustments have observable impacts on morphology, with many species in both aquatic and terrestrial systems shrinking in body size because large surface-to-volume ratios are generally favored under warmer conditions. Other morphological changes include reductions in melanism to improve thermoregulation, and altered wing and bill length in birds.

Broader-scale responses to climate change include changes in the phenology, abundance, and distribution of species. Temperate plants are budding and flowering earlier in spring and later in autumn. Comparable adjustments have been observed in marine and freshwater fish spawning events and in the timing of seasonal migrations of animals worldwide. Changes in the abundance and age structure of populations have also been observed, with widespread evidence of range expansion in warm-adapted species and range contraction in cold-adapted species. As a by-product of species redistributions, novel community interactions have emerged. Tropical and boreal species are increasingly incorporated into temperate and polar communities, respectively, and when possible, lowland species are increasingly assimilating into mountain communities. Multiplicative impacts from gene to community levels scale up to produce ecological regime shifts, in which one ecosystem state shifts to an alternative state.

OUTLOOK:

The many observed impacts of climate change at different levels of biological organization point toward an increasingly unpredictable future for humans. Reduced genetic diversity in crops, inconsistent crop yields, decreased productivity in fisheries from reduced body size, and decreased fruit yields from fewer winter chill events threaten food security. Changes in the distribution of disease vectors alongside the emergence of novel pathogens and pests are a direct threat to human health as well as to crops, timber, and livestock resources. Humanity depends on intact, functioning ecosystems for a range of goods and services. Enhanced understanding of the observed impacts of climate change on core ecological processes is an essential first step to adapting to them and mitigating their influence on biodiversity and ecosystem service provision.

Impacts can be measured on multiple processes at different levels of biological organization within ecosystems. In total, 82% of 94 ecological processes show evidence of being affected by climate change. Within levels of organization, the percentage of processes impacted varies from 60% for genetics to 100% for species distribution. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

In the ongoing debate about the climate benefits of fuel switching from coal to natural gas for power generation, the metrics used to model climate impacts may be important. In this article, we evaluate the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions of coal and natural gas used in new, advanced power plants using a broad set of available climate metrics in order to test for the robustness of results. Climate metrics included in the article are global warming potential, global temperature change potential, technology warming potential, and cumulative radiative forcing. We also used the Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change (MAGICC) climate-change model to validate the results. We find that all climate metrics suggest a natural gas combined cycle plant offers life cycle climate benefits over 100 years compared to a pulverized coal plant, even if the life cycle methane leakage rate for natural gas reaches 5%. Over shorter time frames (i.e., 20 years), plants using natural gas with a 4% leakage rate have similar climate impacts as those using coal, but are no worse than coal. If carbon capture and sequestration becomes available for both types of power plants, natural gas still offers climate benefits over coal as long as the life cycle methane leakage rate remains below 2%. These results are consistent across climate metrics and the MAGICC model over a 100-year time frame. Although it is not clear whether any of these metrics are better than the others, the choice of metric can inform decisions based on different societal values. For example, whereas annual temperature change reported may be a more relevant metric to evaluate the human health effects of increased heat, the cumulative temperature change may be more relevant to evaluate climate impacts, such as sea-level rise, that will result from the cumulative warming. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Global mean surface temperatures are rising in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. The magnitude of this warming at equilibrium for a given radiative forcingreferred to as specific equilibrium climate sensitivity (S)is still subject to uncertainties. We estimate global mean temperature variations and S using a 784,000-year-long field reconstruction of sea surface temperatures and a transient paleoclimate model simulation. Our results reveal that S is strongly dependent on the climate background state, with significantly larger values attained during warm phases. Using the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 for future greenhouse radiative forcing, we find that the range of paleo-based estimates of Earths future warming by 2100 CE overlaps with the upper range of climate simulations conducted as part of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Furthermore, we find that within the 21st century, global mean temperatures will very likely exceed maximum levels reconstructed for the last 784,000 years. On the basis of temperature data from eight glacial cycles, our results provide an independent validation of the magnitude of current CMIP5 warming projections. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Recent pause in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2 due to enhanced terrestrial carbon uptake](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13428)
___

**Abstract**:

Terrestrial ecosystems play a significant role in the global carbon cycle and offset a large fraction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions. The terrestrial carbon sink is increasing, yet the mechanisms responsible for its enhancement, and implications for the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, remain unclear. Here using global carbon budget estimates, ground, atmospheric and satellite observations, and multiple global vegetation models, we report a recent pause in the growth rate of atmospheric CO2, and a decline in the fraction of anthropogenic emissions that remain in the atmosphere, despite increasing anthropogenic emissions. We attribute the observed decline to increases in the terrestrial sink during the past decade, associated with the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on vegetation and the slowdown in the rate of warming on global respiration. The pause in the atmospheric CO2 growth rate provides further evidence of the roles of CO2 fertilization and warming-induced respiration, and highlights the need to protect both existing carbon stocks and regions, where the sink is growing rapidly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Civil conflict sensitivity to growing-season drought](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/44/12391.full)
___

**Significance**:

Understanding the conflict potential of drought is critical for dealing effectively with the societal implications of climate change. Using new georeferenced ethnicity and conflict data for Asia and Africa since 1989, we present an actor-oriented analysis of growing-season drought and conflict involvement among ethnic groups. Results from naive models common in previous research suggest that drought generally has little impact. However, context-sensitive models accounting for the groups level of vulnerability reveal that drought can contribute to sustaining conflict, especially for agriculturally dependent groups and politically excluded groups in very poor countries. These results suggest a reciprocal naturesociety interaction in which violent conflict and environmental shock constitute a vicious circle, each phenomenon increasing the groups vulnerability to the other.
 
**Abstract**:

To date, the research community has failed to reach a consensus on the nature and significance of the relationship between climate variability and armed conflict. We argue that progress has been hampered by insufficient attention paid to the context in which droughts and other climatic extremes may increase the risk of violent mobilization. Addressing this shortcoming, this study presents an actor-oriented analysis of the droughtconflict relationship, focusing specifically on politically relevant ethnic groups and their sensitivity to growing-season drought under various political and socioeconomic contexts. To this end, we draw on new conflict event data that cover Asia and Africa, 19892014, updated spatial ethnic settlement data, and remote sensing data on agricultural land use. Our procedure allows quantifying, for each ethnic group, drought conditions during the growing season of the locally dominant crop. A comprehensive set of multilevel mixed effects models that account for the groups livelihood, economic, and political vulnerabilities reveals that a drought under most conditions has little effect on the short-term risk that a group challenges the state by military means. However, for agriculturally dependent groups as well as politically excluded groups in very poor countries, a local drought is found to increase the likelihood of sustained violence. We interpret this as evidence of the reciprocal relationship between drought and conflict, whereby each phenomenon makes a group more vulnerable to the other.

	<TEXT> Study: [Coastal sea level rise with warming above 2 C](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/11/02/1605312113.abstract)
___

**Significance**

Warming of 2 C will lead to an average global ocean rise of 20 cm, but more than 90% of coastal areas will experience greater rises. If warming continues above 2 C, then, by 2100, sea level will be rising faster than at any time during human civilization, and 80% of the global coastline is expected to exceed the 95th percentile upper limit of 1.8 m for mean global ocean sea level rise. Coastal communities, notably rapidly expanding cities in the developing world; small island states; United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization Cultural World Heritage sites; and vulnerable tropical coastal ecosystems will have a very limited time after midcentury to adapt to these rises.

**Abstract**

Two degrees of global warming above the preindustrial level is widely suggested as an appropriate threshold beyond which climate change risks become unacceptably high. This 2 C threshold is likely to be reached between 2040 and 2050 for both Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 and 4.5. Resulting sea level rises will not be globally uniform, due to ocean dynamical processes and changes in gravity associated with water mass redistribution. Here we provide probabilistic sea level rise projections for the global coastline with warming above the 2 C goal. By 2040, with a 2 C warming under the RCP8.5 scenario, more than 90% of coastal areas will experience sea level rise exceeding the global estimate of 0.2 m, with up to 0.4 m expected along the Atlantic coast of North America and Norway. With a 5 C rise by 2100, sea level will rise rapidly, reaching 0.9 m (median), and 80% of the coastline will exceed the global sea level rise at the 95th percentile upper limit of 1.8 m. Under RCP8.5, by 2100, New York may expect rises of 1.09 m, Guangzhou may expect rises of 0.91 m, and Lagos may expect rises of 0.90 m, with the 95th percentile upper limit of 2.24 m, 1.93 m, and 1.92 m, respectively. The coastal communities of rapidly expanding cities in the developing world, and vulnerable tropical coastal ecosystems, will have a very limited time after midcentury to adapt to sea level rises unprecedented since the dawn of the Bronze Age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Observed Arctic sea-ice loss directly follows anthropogenic CO2 emission](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2016/11/02/science.aag2345.full)
___

**Abstract**:

Arctic sea ice is retreating rapidly, raising prospects of a future ice-free Arctic Ocean during summer. Since climate-model simulations of the sea-ice loss differ substantially, we here use a robust linear relationship between monthly-mean September sea-ice area and cumulative CO2 emissions to infer the future evolution of Arctic summer sea ice directly from the observational record. The observed linear relationship implies a sustained loss of 3  0.3 m^2 of September sea-ice area per metric ton of CO2 emission. Based on this sensitivity, Arctic sea-ice will be lost throughout September for an additional 1000 Gt of CO2 emissions. Most models show a lower sensitivity, which is possibly linked to an underestimation of the modeled increase in incoming longwave radiation and of the modeled Transient Climate Response. </TEXT>

___

**Summary**: 

Issues around fresh water are not particularly high on the U.S. political agenda. They should be. Water problems directly threaten food production, fisheries, energy generation, foreign policy, public health, and international security. Access to safe, sufficient, and affordable water is vital to well-being and to the economy. Yet U.S. water systems, once the envy of the world, are falling into disrepair, and new threats loom. Drinking water disasters in Flint, Michigan, droughts and floods increasingly attributable to anthropogenic climate change (1), and growing violence worldwide over water offer a glimpse of what we face unless new efforts are made to address failing infrastructure, worsening climate conditions, and ineffective policies and regulations (2). Yet, if there is any issue that offers the opportunity for nonpartisan agreement, it is to create and implement a 21st-century national water policy. In that vein, I detail national and international water challenges and recommendations for the next U.S. president, administration, and Congress. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

During the Last Glacial Maximum, continental ice sheets isolated Beringia (northeast Siberia and northwest North America) from unglaciated North America. By around 15 to 14 thousand calibrated radiocarbon years before present (cal. kyr bp), glacial retreat opened an approximately 1,500-km-long corridor between the ice sheets. It remains unclear when plants and animals colonized this corridor and it became biologically viable for human migration. We obtained radiocarbon dates, pollen, macrofossils and metagenomic DNA from lake sediment cores in a bottleneck portion of the corridor. We find evidence of steppe vegetation, bison and mammoth by approximately 12.6 cal. kyr bp, followed by open forest, with evidence of moose and elk at about 11.5 cal. kyr bp, and boreal forest approximately 10cal. kyr bp. Our findings reveal that the first Americans, whether Clovis or earlier groups in unglaciated North America before 12.6cal. kyr bp, are unlikely to have travelled by this route into the Americas. However, later groups may have used this northsouth passageway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Amplified plant turnover in response to climate change forecast by Late Quaternary records](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nclimate3146.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Conservation decisions are informed by twenty-first-century climate impact projections that typically predict high extinction risk. Conversely, the palaeorecord shows strong sensitivity of species abundances and distributions to past climate changes, but few clear instances of extinctions attributable to rising temperatures. However, few studies have incorporated palaeoecological data into projections of future distributions. Here we project changes in abundance and conservation status under a climate warming scenario for 187 European and North American plant taxa using niche-based models calibrated against taxaclimate relationships for the past 21,000 years. We find that incorporating long-term data into niche-based models increases the magnitude of projected future changes for plant abundances and community turnover. The larger projected changes in abundances and community turnover translate into different, and often more threatened, projected IUCN conservation status for declining tree taxa, compared with traditional approaches. An average of 18.4% (North America) and 15.5% (Europe) of taxa switch IUCN categories when compared with single-time model results. When taxa categorized as Least Concern are excluded, the palaeo-calibrated models increase, on average, the conservation threat status of 33.2% and 56.8% of taxa. Notably, however, few models predict total disappearance of taxa, suggesting resilience for these taxa, if climate were the only extinction driver. Long-term studies linking palaeorecords and forecasting techniques have the potential to improve conservation assessments. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Departures from eustasy in Pliocene sea-level records](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v4/n5/full/ngeo1118.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Proxy data suggest that atmospheric CO2 levels during the middle of the Pliocene epoch (about 3Myr ago) were similar to today, leading to the use of this interval as a potential analogue for future climate change. Estimates for mid-Pliocene sea levels range from 10 to 40m above present, and a value of +25m is often adopted in numerical climate model simulations. A eustatic change of such magnitude implies the complete deglaciation of the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets, and significant loss of mass in the East Antarctic ice sheet. However, the effects of glacial isostatic adjustments have not been accounted for in Pliocene sea-level reconstructions. Here we numerically model these effects on Pliocene shoreline features using a gravitationally self-consistent treatment of post-glacial sea-level change. We find that the predicted modern elevation of Pliocene shoreline features can deviate significantly from the eustatic signal, even in the absence of subsequent tectonically-driven movements of the Earths surface. In our simulations, this non-eustatic sea-level change, at individual locations, is caused primarily by residual isostatic adjustments associated with late Pleistocene glaciation. We conclude that a combination of model results and field observations can help to better constrain sea level in the past, and hence lend insight into the stability of ice sheets under varying climate conditions. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Although detailed age models exist for some marine sediment records of the last glacial cycle (0150ka), age models for many cores rely on the stratigraphic correlation of benthic 18O, which measures ice volume and deep ocean temperature change. The large amount of data available for the last glacial cycle offers the opportunity to improve upon previous benthic 18O compilations, such as the LR04 global stack. Not only are the age constraints for the LR04 stack now outdated but a single global alignment target neglects regional differences of several thousand years in the timing of benthic 18O change during glacial terminations. Here we present regional stacks that characterize mean benthic 18O change for 8 ocean regions and a volume-weighted global stack of data from 263 cores. Age models for these stacks are based on radiocarbon data from 0 to 40ka, correlation to a layer-counted Greenland ice core from 40 to 56ka, and correlation to radiometrically dated speleothems from 56 to 150ka. The regional 18O stacks offer better stratigraphic alignment targets than the LR04 global stack and, furthermore, suggest that the LR04 stack is biased 12kyr too young throughout the Pleistocene. Finally, we compare global and regional benthic 18O responses with sea level estimates for the last glacial cycle. </TEXT>

Study: [Deep time evidence for climate sensitivity increase with warming](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL069243/full)
___

**Abstract**:

Future global warming from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions will depend on climate feedbacks, the effect of which is expressed by climate sensitivity, the warming for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 content. It is not clear how feedbacks, sensitivity, and temperature will evolve in our warming world, but past warming events may provide insight. Here we employ paleoreconstructions and new climate-carbon model simulations in a novel framework to explore a wide scenario range for the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM) carbon release and global warming event 55.8 Ma ago, a possible future warming analogue. We obtain constrained estimates of CO2 and climate sensitivity before and during the PETM and of the PETM carbon input amount and nature. Sensitivity increased from 3.35.6 to 3.76.5 K (Kelvin) into the PETM. When taken together with Last Glacial Maximum and modern estimates, this result indicates climate sensitivity increase with global warming.*   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Impact of decadal cloud variations on the Earths energy budget](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2828.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Feedbacks of clouds on climate change strongly influence the magnitude of global warming. Cloud feedbacks, in turn, depend on the spatial patterns of surface warming, which vary on decadal timescales. Therefore, the magnitude of the decadal cloud feedback could deviate from the long-term cloud feedback. Here we present climate model simulations to show that the global mean cloud feedback in response to decadal temperature fluctuations varies dramatically due to time variations in the spatial pattern of sea surface temperature. We find that cloud anomalies associated with these patterns significantly modify the Earths energy budget. Specifically, the decadal cloud feedback between the 1980s and 2000s is substantially more negative than the long-term cloud feedback. This is a result of cooling in tropical regions where air descends, relative to warming in tropical ascent regions, which strengthens low-level atmospheric stability. Under these conditions, low-level cloud cover and its reflection of solar radiation increase, despite an increase in global mean surface temperature. These results suggest that sea surface temperature pattern-induced low cloud anomalies could have contributed to the period of reduced warming between 1998 and 2013, and offer a physical explanation of why climate sensitivities estimated from recently observed trends are probably biased low. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Limited role for methane in the mid-Proterozoic greenhouse](http://www.pnas.org/content/113/41/11447.abstract)
___

**Significance**:

Proterozoic climate dynamics, including both remarkable climate stability during the mid-Proterozoic and extreme low-latitude glaciation in the Neoproterozoic, must be understood in the framework of evolving oxidant reservoirs throughout the Precambrian. We present Earth system model simulations showing that recent constraints on atmospheric oxygen and oceanic sulfate during Proterozoic time have profound implications for marine methane cycling and the accumulation of methane in the atmosphere. Our model results challenge the paradigm of persistently elevated methane during the Precambrian, thus extending the relevance of the faint young Sun paradox throughout the Proterozoic. In light of the possibility of low methane during the mid-Proterozoic, we also suggest a conceptual model for the relationship between oxygenation, methane, and Neoproterozoic Snowball Earth events.

**Abstract**:

Pervasive anoxia in the subsurface ocean during the Proterozoic may have allowed large fluxes of biogenic CH4 to the atmosphere, enhancing the climatic significance of CH4 early in Earths history. Indeed, the assumption of elevated pCH4 during the Proterozoic underlies most models for both anomalous climatic stasis during the mid-Proterozoic and extreme climate perturbation during the Neoproterozoic; however, the geologic record cannot directly constrain atmospheric CH4 levels and attendant radiative forcing. Here, we revisit the role of CH4 in Earths climate system during Proterozoic time. We use an Earth system model to quantify CH4 fluxes from the marine biosphere and to examine the capacity of biogenic CH4 to compensate for the faint young Sun during the boring billion years before the emergence of metazoan life. Our calculations demonstrate that anaerobic oxidation of CH4 coupled to SO42 reduction is a highly effective obstacle to CH4 accumulation in the atmosphere, possibly limiting atmospheric pCH4 to less than 10 ppm by volume for the second half of Earth history regardless of atmospheric pO2. If recent pO2 constraints from Cr isotopes are correct, we predict that reduced UV shielding by O3 should further limit pCH4 to very low levels similar to those seen today. Thus, our model results likely limit the potential climate warming by CH4 for the majority of Earth historypossibly reviving the faint young Sun paradox during Proterozoic time and challenging existing models for the initiation of low-latitude glaciation that depend on the oxidative collapse of a steady-state CH4 greenhouse.

___

**Abstract**:

Fundamental questions remain about the origin of newly formed atmospheric aerosol particles because data from laboratory measurements have been insufficient to build global models. In contrast, gas-phase chemistry models have been based on laboratory kinetics measurements for decades. Here we build a global model of aerosol formation using extensive laboratory-measured nucleation rates involving sulfuric acid, ammonia, ions and organic compounds. The simulations and a comparison with atmospheric observations show that nearly all nucleation throughout the present-day atmosphere involves ammonia or biogenic organic compounds in addition to sulfuric acid. A significant fraction of nucleation involves ions, but the relatively weak dependence on ion concentrations indicates that for the processes studied variations in cosmic ray intensity do not significantly affect climate via nucleation in the present-day atmosphere. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Are continuing changes in the Arctic influencing wind patterns and the occurrence of extreme weather events in northern mid-latitudes? The chaotic nature of atmospheric circulation precludes easy answers. The topic is a major science challenge, as continued Arctic temperature increases are an inevitable aspect of anthropogenic climate change. We propose a perspective that rejects simple cause-and-effect pathways and notes diagnostic challenges in interpreting atmospheric dynamics. We present a way forward based on understanding multiple processes that lead to uncertainties in Arctic and mid-latitude weather and climate linkages. We emphasize community coordination for both scientific progress and communication to a broader public.

	<TEXT> Study: [Nonlinear response of mid-latitude weather to the changing Arctic](http://www.nature.com/nclimate/journal/v6/n11/pdf/nclimate3121.pdf)
___

**Abstract**:

Are continuing changes in the Arctic influencing wind patterns and the occurrence of extreme weather events in northern mid-latitudes? The chaotic nature of atmospheric circulation precludes easy answers. The topic is a major science challenge, as continued Arctic temperature increases are an inevitable aspect of anthropogenic climate change. We propose a perspective that rejects simple cause-and-effect pathways and notes diagnostic challenges in interpreting atmospheric dynamics. We present a way forward based on understanding multiple processes that lead to uncertainties in Arctic and mid-latitude weather and climate linkages. We emphasize community coordination for both scientific progress and communication to a broader public. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Impact of ocean resolution on coupled air-sea fluxes and large-scale climate](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070559/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

Air-sea fluxes are a crucial component in the energetics of the global climate system. The largest air-sea fluxes occur in regions of high sea surface temperature variability, such as ocean boundary, frontal currents and eddies. In this paper we explore the importance of ocean model resolution to resolve air-sea flux relationships in these areas. We examine the sea surface temperature-wind stress relationship in high-pass filtered observations and two versions of the Met Office climate model with eddy-permitting and eddy-resolving ocean resolutions. Eddy-resolving resolution shows marginal improvement in the relationship over eddy-permitting resolution. However, by focussing on the North Atlantic we show that the eddy-resolving model has significant enhancement of latent heat loss over the North Atlantic Current region, a long-standing model bias. While eddy-resolving resolution does not change the air-sea flux relationship at small scale, the impact on the mean state has important implications for the reliability of future climate projections. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

This study compares the simulation of subseasonal tropical variability by a set of six state-of-the-art AGCMs in two experiments in aquaplanet configuration: a zonally symmetric experiment, and an experiment with a warm pool centered on the equator. In all six models, the presence of the warm pool generates zonal asymmetries in the simulated mean states in the form of a Gill-type response, made more complex by feedbacks between moisture, convective heating and circulation. Noticeable differences appear from one model to another. Only half the models simulate mean low-level equatorial westerlies over the warm pool area. The presence of the warm pool can also favor the development of large-scale variability consistent with observed Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) characteristics, but this happens only in half the models. Our results do not support the idea that the presence of the warm pool and/or of mean low-level equatorial westerlies are sufficient conditions for MJO-like variability to arise in the models. Comparing spectral characteristics of the simulated Convectively Coupled Equatorial Waves (CCEWs) in the aquaplanet experiments and the corresponding coupled atmosphere-ocean (i.e., CMIP) and atmosphere-only (i.e., AMIP) simulations, we also show that there is more consistency for a given model across its configurations, than for a given configuration across the six models. Overall, our results confirm that the simulation of subseasonal variability by given model is significantly influenced by the parameterization of subgrid physical processes (most-likely cloud processes), both directly and through modulation of the mean state. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Aerosol optical depth (AOD) has been shown to influence the global carbon sink by increasing the fraction of diffuse light, which increases photosynthesis over a greater fraction of the vegetated canopy. Between 1995 and 2013, U.S. SO2 emissions declined by over 70%, coinciding with observed AOD reductions of 3.00.6% yr^1 over the eastern U.S. In the Community Earth System Model (CESM), these trends cause diffuse light to decrease regionally by almost 0.6% yr^1 , leading to declines in gross primary production (GPP) of 0.07% yr^1 . Integrated over the analysis period and domain, this represents 0.5 PgC of omitted GPP. A separate upscaling calculation that used published relationships between GPP and diffuse light agreed with the CESM model results within 20%. The agreement between simulated and data-constrained upscaling results strongly suggests that anthropogenic sulfate trends have a small impact on carbon uptake in temperate forests due to scattered light. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Optimal bioenergy power generation for climate change mitigation with or without carbon sequestration](http://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13160)
___

**Abstract**:

Restricting global warming below 2 C to avoid catastrophic climate change will require atmospheric carbon dioxide removal (CDR). Current integrated assessment models (IAMs) and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change scenarios assume that CDR within the energy sector would be delivered using bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS). Although bioenergy-biochar systems (BEBCS) can also deliver CDR, they are not included in any IPCC scenario. Here we show that despite BECCS offering twice the carbon sequestration and bioenergy per unit biomass, BEBCS may allow earlier deployment of CDR at lower carbon prices when long-term improvements in soil fertility offset biochar production costs. At carbon prices above $1,000 Mg^1 C, BECCS is most frequently (P0.45, calculated as the fraction of Monte Carlo simulations in which BECCS is the most cost effective) the most economic biomass technology for climate-change mitigation. At carbon prices below $1,000 Mg^1 C, BEBCS is the most cost-effective technology only where biochar significantly improves agricultural yields, with pure bioenergy systems being otherwise preferred. </TEXT>

**A warming limit for the Mediterranean basin**:

Pollen cores from sediments provide rich detail on the history of vegetation and climate in the Mediterranean during the Holocene (the most recent ~10,000 years). Guiot and Cramer used this information as a baseline against which to compare predictions of future climate and vegetation under different climate-change scenarios. Vegetation and land-use systems observed in the Holocene records may persist under a 1.5C warming above preindustrial temperature levels. A 2C warming, however, is likely over the next century to produce ecosystems in the Mediterranean basin that have no analog in the past 10,000 years.

**Abstract**:

The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Paris Agreement of December 2015 aims to maintain the global average warming well below 2C above the preindustrial level. In the Mediterranean basin, recent pollen-based reconstructions of climate and ecosystem variability over the past 10,000 years provide insights regarding the implications of warming thresholds for biodiversity and land-use potential. We compare scenarios of climate-driven future change in land ecosystems with reconstructed ecosystem dynamics during the past 10,000 years. Only a 1.5C warming scenario permits ecosystems to remain within the Holocene variability. At or above 2C of warming, climatic change will generate Mediterranean land ecosystem changes that are unmatched in the Holocene, a period characterized by recurring precipitation deficits rather than temperature anomalies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Sharpening vision by adapting to flicker](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/12/1609330113.abstract)
___

**Significance**:

Distinct anatomical visual pathways can be traced through the human central nervous system. These have been linked to specialized functions, such as encoding information about spatial forms (like the human face and text) and stimulus dynamics (flicker or movement). Our experiments are inconsistent with this strict division. They show that mechanisms responsive to flicker can alter form perception, with vision transiently sharpened by weakening the influence of flicker-sensitive mechanisms by prolonged exposure to flicker. So, next time you are trying to read fine print, you might be well advised to first view a flickering stimulus!

**Abstract**:

Human vision is surprisingly malleable. A static stimulus can seem to move after prolonged exposure to movement (the motion aftereffect), and exposure to tilted lines can make vertical lines seem oppositely tilted (the tilt aftereffect). The paradigm used to induce such distortions (adaptation) can provide powerful insights into the computations underlying human visual experience. Previously spatial form and stimulus dynamics were thought to be encoded independently, but here we show that adaptation to stimulus dynamics can sharpen form perception. We find that fast flicker adaptation (FFAd) shifts the tuning of face perception to higher spatial frequencies, enhances the acuity of spatial visionallowing people to localize inputs with greater precision and to read finer scaled text, and it selectively reduces sensitivity to coarse-scale form signals. These findings are consistent with two interrelated influences: FFAd reduces the responsiveness of magnocellular neurons (which are important for encoding dynamics, but can have poor spatial resolution), and magnocellular responses contribute coarse spatial scale information when the visual system synthesizes form signals. Consequently, when magnocellular responses are mitigated via FFAd, human form perception is transiently sharpened because blur signals are mitigated.

	<TEXT> what forms of life can survive on a planet with 500ppm of CO2

Plenty. More recently, geologically speaking, most of the Oligocene and all of the Eocene were [well above 500ppm CO2](https://d29qn7q9z0j1p6.cloudfront.net/content/roypta/371/2001/20130096/F5.large.jpg?width=800 height=600 carousel=1) (see: [A 40-million-year history of atmospheric CO2](http://rsta.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/371/2001/20130096)) with temperatures [far higher than present values](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/5f/All_palaeotemps.svg). That's not to say life can easily adapt and to our current episode of abrupt climate change, but merely that life is fully capable of existing above 500ppm CO2.

and are we one of them?

	<TEXT> 20,000 years refers to the time span over which the majority of species were lost, however, the series of episodes that build the Permo-Triassic extinction event occurred over a much longer interval:

Many geologists and paleontologists contend that the Permian extinction occurred over the course of 15 million years during the latter part of the Permian Period (299 million to 252 million years ago). However, others claim that the extinction interval was much more rapid, lasting only about 200,000 years, with the bulk of the species loss occurring over a 20,000-year span near the end of the period. - [Permian extinction](https://www.britannica.com/science/Permian-extinction) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is discussed in [The Sea-Level Fingerprint of West Antarctic Collapse](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/323/5915/753.full?rss=1) (open access) amongst others:

The rapid melting of ice sheets and glaciers leads to a sea-level change that departs dramatically from the assumption of a uniform redistribution of meltwater (4). An ice sheet exerts a gravitational attraction on the nearby ocean and thus draws water toward it. If the ice sheet melts, this attraction will be reduced, and water will migrate away from the ice sheet. The net effect, despite the increase in the total volume of the oceans after a melting event, is that sea level will actually fall within 2000 km of the collapsing ice sheet and progressively increase as one moves further from this region. Each ice reservoir will produce a distinct geometry, or fingerprint, of sea-level change.

Here it is illustrated: With [initial conditions](https://i.imgur.com/VhJjMzI.png) and [post melt](https://i.imgur.com/QZwxhVi.png).

	<TEXT> Lithospheric plates are highly variable in their breadth, and their thickness (young oceanic lithosphere ~15km thick, while ancient continental lithosphere can be upwards of ~200km thick). Ice Sheets are massive, and as such they have a noticeable gravitational pull on the immediate surrounding oceans. Hypothetically speaking, should both ice sheets disappear sea level would actually drop around Greenland and Antarctica, while increasing elsewhere. 

With the removal of the ice sheets, the lithosphere, in those regions, will rebound (isostatic rebound). As the lithosphere rises, there is less pressure which induces melting (known as decompression melting) and with increased melt there exists the possibility for increased volcanism as has been documented at the end of the last glacial period^[1](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/increase-in-volcanic-eruptions-at-the-end-of-the-ice-age-caused-by-melting-ice-caps-and-glacial) (aka the Ice Age). Motion of the lithosphere also results in seismic activity. For example, much of the recorded seismic activity within North America's interior (Canadian Shield for example) is a result of ongoing post-glacial rebound since the rapid deglaciation of the Laurentide Ice Sheet ~11,700 years ago.

Volcanic injection of aerosol into the stratosphere does cool the climate in the short run; however, volcanic gases include GHGs such as CO2 which persist far longer in Earth's atmosphere than aerosols. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Sensitivity of Pine Island Glacier to observed ocean forcing](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070500/full)
___

**Abstract**:

We present subannual observations (20092014) of a major West Antarctic glacier (Pine Island Glacier) and the neighboring ocean. Ongoing glacier retreat and accelerated ice flow were likely triggered a few decades ago by increased ocean-induced thinning, which may have initiated marine ice-sheet instability. Following a subsequent 60% drop in ocean heat content from early 2012 to late 2013, ice flow slowed, but by4%, with flow recovering as the ocean warmed to prior temperatures. During this cold-ocean period, the evolving glacier-bed/ice-shelf system was also in a geometry favorable to stabilization. However, despite a minor, temporary decrease in ice discharge, the basin-wide thinning signal did not change. Thus, as predicted by theory, once marine ice-sheet instability is underway, a single transient high-amplitude ocean cooling has only a relatively minor effect on ice flow. The long-term effects of ocean-temperature variability on ice flow, however, are not yet known. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Glacier change and glacial lake outburst flood risk in the Bolivian Andes](http://www.the-cryosphere.net/10/2399/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Glaciers of the Bolivian Andes represent an important water resource for Andean cities and mountain communities, yet relatively little work has assessed changes in their extent over recent decades. In many mountain regions, glacier recession has been accompanied by the development of proglacial lakes, which can pose a glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) hazard. However, no studies have assessed the development of such lakes in Bolivia despite recent GLOF incidents here. Our mapping from satellite imagery reveals an overall areal shrinkage of 228.122.8km^2 (43.1%) across the Bolivian Cordillera Oriental between 1986 and 2014. Shrinkage was greatest in the Tres Cruces region (47.3%), followed by the Cordillera Apolobamba (43.1%) and Cordillera Real (41.9%). A growing number of proglacial lakes have developed as glaciers have receded, in accordance with trends in most other deglaciating mountain ranges, although the number of ice-contact lakes has decreased. The reasons for this are unclear, but the pattern of lake change has varied significantly throughout the study period, suggesting that monitoring of future lake development is required as ice continues to recede. Ultimately, we use our 2014 database of proglacial lakes to assess GLOF risk across the Bolivian Andes. We identify 25 lakes that pose a potential GLOF threat to downstream communities and infrastructure. We suggest that further studies of potential GLOF impacts are urgently required. </TEXT>

We estimate rates of climatic niche change in 236 species and compare these with rates of projected climate change by 2070. Our results show that projected climate change is consistently faster than rates of niche change in grasses, typically by more than 5000-fold for temperature-related variables.

	<TEXT> Study: [A progressively wetter climate in southern East Africa over the past 1.3 million years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v537/n7619/full/nature19065.html)
___

**Abstract**:

African climate is generally considered to have evolved towards progressively drier conditions over the past few million years, with increased variability as glacialinterglacial change intensified worldwide. Palaeoclimate records derived mainly from northern Africa exhibit a 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycle overprinted on a pronounced 20,000-year (precession) beat, driven by orbital forcing of summer insolation, global ice volume and long-lived atmospheric greenhouse gases. Here we present a 1.3-million-year-long climate history from the Lake Malawi basin (1014 S in eastern Africa), which displays strong 100,000-year (eccentricity) cycles of temperature and rainfall following the Mid-Pleistocene Transition around 900,000 years ago. Interglacial periods were relatively warm and moist, while ice ages were cool and dry. The Malawi record shows limited evidence for precessional variability, which we attribute to the opposing effects of austral summer insolation and the temporal/spatial pattern of sea surface temperature in the Indian Ocean. The temperature history of the Malawi basin, at least for the past 500,000 years, strongly resembles past changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and terrigenous dust flux in the tropical Pacific Ocean, but not in global ice volume. Climate in this sector of eastern Africa (unlike northern Africa) evolved from a predominantly arid environment with high-frequency variability to generally wetter conditions with more prolonged wet and dry intervals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In regard to /u/planktic's comment Cullen *et al* state the following, from their paper [Climate change and the collapse of the Akkadian empire: 
Evidence from the deep sea](http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/~peter/site/Papers_files/Cullen.et.al.2000.pdf) (pdf):

All available evidence indicates that this event records a dramatic mid-Holocene change in regional climate and is not a depositional artifact due to sediment disturbance or redeposition.

As for a causal mechanism, Claussen *et al* suggest the following:

... our  results  indicate  that  the  long-term cooling  and  drying  from  mid-Holocene  to  present-day  is
triggered  by  subtle  changes  in  the  Earth's  orbit. However, the abrupt desertication in North Africa during the
mid-Holocene  can  be  explained  only  in  terms  of  internal, mainly regional, vegetation-atmosphere feedbacks in the climate system whereas the timing of this event depends on the state of the global climate system.  Further experiments are necessary to more precisely quantify the contribution of low latitudes versus  high northern latitudes, oceanic feedbacks versus biospheric feedbacks, to the timing. - [Simulation of an abrupt change in Saharan vegetation

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Hemispherically asymmetric volcanic forcing of tropical hydroclimate during the last millennium](http://www.earth-syst-dynam.net/7/681/2016/)
___

**Abstract**:

Volcanic aerosols exert the most important natural radiative forcing of the last millennium. State-of-the-art paleoclimate simulations of this interval are typically forced with diverse spatial patterns of volcanic forcing, leading to different responses in tropical hydroclimate. Recently, theoretical considerations relating the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) position to the demands of global energy balance have emerged in the literature, allowing for a connection to be made between the paleoclimate simulations and recent developments in the understanding of ITCZ dynamics. These energetic considerations aid in explaining the well-known historical, paleoclimatic, and modeling evidence that the ITCZ migrates away from the hemisphere that is energetically deficient in response to asymmetric forcing.

Here we use two separate general circulation model (GCM) suites of experiments for the last millennium to relate the ITCZ position to asymmetries in prescribed volcanic sulfate aerosols in the stratosphere and related asymmetric radiative forcing. We discuss the ITCZ shift in the context of atmospheric energetics and discuss the ramifications of transient ITCZ migrations for other sensitive indicators of changes in the tropical hydrologic cycle, including global streamflow. For the first time, we also offer insight into the large-scale fingerprint of water isotopologues in precipitation (18Op) in response to asymmetries in radiative forcing.

The ITCZ shifts away from the hemisphere with greater volcanic forcing. Since the isotopic composition of precipitation in the ITCZ is relatively depleted compared to areas outside this zone, this meridional precipitation migration results in a large-scale enrichment (depletion) in the isotopic composition of tropical precipitation in regions the ITCZ moves away from (toward). Our results highlight the need for careful consideration of the spatial structure of volcanic forcing for interpreting volcanic signals in proxy records and therefore in evaluating the skill of Common Era climate model output. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Climate change may soon threaten much of global biodiversity, especially if species cannot adapt to changing climatic conditions quickly enough. A critical question is how quickly climatic niches change, and if this speed is sufficient to prevent extinction as climates warm. Here, we address this question in the grass family (Poaceae). Grasses are fundamental to one of Earth's most widespread biomes (grasslands), and provide roughly half of all calories consumed by humans (including wheat, rice, corn and sorghum). We estimate rates of climatic niche change in 236 species and compare these with rates of projected climate change by 2070. Our results show that projected climate change is consistently faster than rates of niche change in grasses, typically by more than 5000-fold for temperature-related variables. Although these results do not show directly what will happen under global warming, they have troubling implications for a major biome and for human food resources. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

The 2012 drought was the most severe and extensive summertime US drought in half a century with substantial economic loss and impacts on food security and commodity prices. A unique aspect of the 2012 drought was its rapid onset and intensification over the Southern Rockies, extending to the Great Plains during late spring and early summer, and the absence of known precursor large-scale patterns. Drought prediction therefore remains a major challenge. This study evaluates relationships among snow, soil moisture, and precipitation to identify sources of potential predictability of the 2012 summer drought using observations and a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model multi-physics ensemble experiment. Although underestimated in intensity, the drought signal is robust to the way atmospheric physical processes are represented in the model. For the Southern Rockies, soil moisture exhibits stronger persistence than precipitation in observations and the ensemble experiment. Correlations between winter/spring snowmelt and concurrent and following season soil moisture, and between soil moisture and concurrent and following season precipitation, in both observations and the model ensemble, suggest potential predictability beyond 1 and 2-month lead-time reside in the land surface conditions for apparent flash droughts such as the 2012 drought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While they may have advanced in some areas^[1](https://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/hurricane-intensity-forecast-models-are-improving) , I don't believe advances in modelling are typically *that* significant when it comes to improving forecast lead times, depending on how you define significant. If I recall correctly, it averages out to about ~1 day per decade, give or take. As computing power advances the models have also become more complex. While I think the scientific community may find such advances to be significant I feel opinions most likely diverge between the general public and the scientific community on how applicable such advances are, and thus how significant they are.

___

**Abstract**:

Every human suffers through life a number of papillomaviruses (PVs) infections, most of them asymptomatic. A notable exception are persistent infections by Human Papillomavirus 16 (HPV16), the most oncogenic infectious agent for humans and responsible for most infection-driven anogenital cancers. Oncogenic potential is not homogeneous among HPV16 lineages, and genetic variation within HPV16 exhibits some geographic structure. However, an in-depth analysis of the HPV16 evolutionary history is still wanting.

We have analysed extant HPV16 diversity and compared the evolutionary and phylogeographical patterns of humans and of HPV16. We show that codivergence with modern humans explains at most 30% of the present viral geographical distribution. The most explanatory scenario suggests that ancestral HPV16 already infected ancestral human populations, and that viral lineages co-diverged with the hosts in parallel with the split between archaic Neanderthal-Denisovans and ancestral modern human populations, generating the ancestral HPV16A and HPV16BCD viral lineages, respectively.

We propose that after out-of-Africa migration of modern human ancestors, sexual transmission between human populations introduced HPV16A into modern human ancestor populations. We hypothesise that differential coevolution of HPV16 lineages with different but closely related ancestral human populations and subsequent host-switch events in parallel with introgression of archaic alleles into the genomes of modern human ancestors may be largely responsible for the present-day differential prevalence and association with cancers for HPV16 variants.  </TEXT>

Extensive release of methane from Arctic **seabed** west of Svalbard during summer 2014 does not influence the **atmosphere**

While CH4 is released from seeps at depth from the sediments, the CH4 does not enter into the atmosphere. The reason? 

...stratification of the water column whereby layers of different density form, much like oil over water. This means there is no or low exchange of water masses between the surface layer and the layers below. A natural barrier occurs, acting as a ceiling, preventing the methane from reaching the surface. - [Eureka Alert](https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2016-05/c-cf-aom052716.php) </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

The winter North Atlantic Oscillation is the primary mode of atmospheric variability in the North Atlantic region and has a profound influence on European and North American winter climate. Until recently, seasonal variability of the North Atlantic Oscillation was thought to be largely driven by chaotic and inherently unpredictable processes. However, latest generation seasonal forecasting systems have demonstrated significant skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation when initialized a month before the onset of winter. Here we extend skilful dynamical model predictions to more than a year ahead. The skill increases greatly with ensemble size due to a spuriously small signal-to-noise ratio in the model, and consequently larger ensembles are projected to further increase the skill in predicting the North Atlantic Oscillation. We identify two sources of skill for second-winter forecasts of the North Atlantic Oscillation: climate variability in the tropical Pacific region and predictable effects of solar forcing on the stratospheric polar vortex strength. We also identify model biases in Arctic sea ice that, if reduced, may further increase skill. Our results open possibilities for a range of new climate services, including for the transport, energy, water management and insurance sectors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I was required to code simple climate models for a number of my courses in my degree, I have little experience with the computer science field itself so hopefully a) other persons with relevant backgrounds can point you in the right direction and b) it's likely worth your while to visit and inquire with other subreddits if you haven't already. That being said an older paper, "[Climate Change: A Grand Software Challenge](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~sme/papers/2010/Easterbrook-FSE2010-wkshp.pdf)," (pdf) concluded the following areas were key areas to focus on:

 software to support the science of understanding climate change; software to support the global collective decision making; and software to reduce the carbon footprint of modern technology.

Hopefully that might help you develop some ideas of your own with regard to which direction you'd like to head in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This particular paper, with obvious implications towards climate contrarian (so called 'skeptics') arguments and therefore public outreach, is essentially a review of satellite adjustments and the accuracy of model ensembles. Satellite data is continually adjusted, for example note the adjustments listed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset#Corrections_made), and a new study published this year ([here](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/full/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0744.1)).  

It's published because it needs to be; if you know something - publish it (it's really that simple). As more and more adjustments are made there is a requirement to asses the quality of those adjustments, which is what this particular paper has done. Obviously then with more adjustments to be made in the future we should expect another paper similar to this one that assesses the quality / reliability of said future adjustments.

Science is also about repeatability, if the results are not repeatable then there's something wrong with the study, and the results should be taken with a good degree of skepticism. The best way to ensure that the science is robust then is to conduct several studies over time, each inquiring about the same question, yet each study using a slightly different methodology. The hope is that each study will be in good agreement with one another. In the end then I hope you see that it has nothing to do with pushing a narrative, but everything to do with developing robust scientific conclusions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's from the abstract which is linked in this thread: https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/57kz6m/counter_to_contrarian_claims_new_research_finds/d8stv75

It sounds like you may be confusing the total number of model runs ([ensemble forecasting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_forecasting) / [climate ensemble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_ensemble)) with the actual number of unique climate models used. I felt it important to incorporate that into the title because it's important to note that while any single model (see [CMIP5 model list](https://i.imgur.com/AGBMliM.jpg) used in IPCC AR5 for example^[1](https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf) ) has its strengths and weaknesses it's the average of the ensemble that is important as is shown from [Figure 1](https://i.imgur.com/Z36zfwl.jpg) of this study. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Typically the further you go back in time the lower the resolution becomes; however, we're talking tens to hundreds of millions of years. Climate data millions of years ago can have a surprisingly high resolution if sufficiently preserved. [18O](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9418O) records (amongst a multitude of other isotopic methods) can yield seasonal variations in speleothems, as can varves - producing records of summer winter couplets, etc. Combining different paleoclimate proxies (such as 18O and [TEX86](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEX86) for example) can further reduce uncertainty to assist in paleoclimate reconstruction efforts (see: [marine isotope stages](http://www.geo.arizona.edu/palynology/geos462/QuaTimeMIS.jpg) - the x-axis is in thousands of years)

Newer analytical methods are constantly being developed and are capable of reproducing even higher resolution data sets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, not really. These issues are already known - hence the adjustments to data sets as in this article, while other climate contrarian claims are often rehashes of already debunked arguments - much like arguments put forth by flat Earthers, Young Earth Creationists, etc. 

Contrarian claims are often made well after the fact and call into question methods that they have little understanding of. For example, they see adjustments made to satellite data and 'cry foul,' meanwhile these adjustments were made because the science community already knew about the problem and made the necessary adjustments to correct for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contrarians is, as far as I'm aware in climate science, the politically correct word rather than 'denier,' 'skeptic,' 'climate denier,' 'denialist,' 'climate skeptic,' etc. For example see the use of the term in [this article](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2016/feb/08/no-climate-conspiracy-noaa-temperature-adjustments-bring-data-closer-to-pristine). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only word I don't know is 'tropospheric'

And here's the best part... you can look it up in a matter of seconds and find out what that 'big word' is. I find it odd that people who want to understand something think they should inherently understand the scientific jargon. During my first and second year of my degree I made extensive use of a dictionary specifically for my major. I would read the article and or text book material with the dictionary at my side.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because they have to in order to be precise. The article itself does a good job of stating why corrections are made to satellite data. 

1) Satellites drift (their orbits decay with time). This means that over time your data will shift. For example, let's sat that I'm orbiting the Earth and I want to measure the temperature of the middle troposphere (TMT) (think y-axis) at a specific location (think x-axis) which occurs at 4:00pm (a relatively warm period of the day). As my orbit slowly decays over time the location that I'm measuring at 4:00pm will no longer be the same location as it was previously and I may no longer be measuring the temperature at the mid. troposphere. In other words I would see a shift in my data for that location and temperatures would appear to be changing. That is to say that my y and x axis have shifted - therefore I have to correct for this. This is simplified but it should serve to highlight one of the reasons satellite data must be corrected for in order to be useful.

2) Not every satellite that gets placed into orbit is the same. Improved technology or different sensors will have different margins and sources of error. In order to splice one data set from one satellite (apple) to the data set of another satellite (orange) corrections must therefore be made to the satellite data in order to account for differences between the two sets (now apples to apples).

Of course there are more kinds of corrections (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset ) but the point I'm making is that data sets *must* be adjusted and there are many methods by which to do this depending on the type of data (for example: [homogenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(climate)). </TEXT>
