	<TEXT> On an episode of Married with Children from the 90's two men (Al and the black guy that works with him) in the shoe store that Al works in keep calling a lady (Al's annoying neighbor) Bruce Jenner. When she corrects them that she's a lady they say No, I think you're Bruce Jenner. People knew way back that dude wanted to be a woman. You can watch the whole scene on youtube.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if it has or hasn't gotten the credit it deserved but I'd have to say Alan Wake for 360. I grew up with Resident Evil and Silent Hill and that being said Alan Wake was the best horror game I have ever played. That's not to say the story line or game play was better then RE or SH but the horror aspect really had me on edge while playing.  </TEXT>

Is it worth checking out via emulation? We literally never had a Sega in the house. I played Genesis at a friends house and I played DreamCast at a friends house. I fucking loved Sonic (Genesis) and Crazy Taxi (DreamCast) and bout shit my 14 year old self when I found out DreamCast had an internet browser. </TEXT>
