	<TEXT> To be very honesst, that really was the BANG in this whole meal. That chutney is something we never let finish in our household.

Made with mint, raw mangoes, lots of green chillies, salt and lime juice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And in this case, none of that was done. What you see is orange is nothing but fine shreds of carrots. I like to grate a carrot fine and mix it up in the rice. This is just to get more veggies in our diet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Turmeric will give you yellow color. You get this color by using loads of tomatos and then balancing it with cream :)

Fr the rice, not all basamati will do that. We've had some shitty types too and they all said basmati. 

I am gonna let you on a secret. When you buy basmati, look for a number 1121. This is the long grain and will give fluffy and long grain once cooked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I use thighs or leg pieces.

This is a two part recipe -

Part 1 -
Marinate in turkish cream yogurt with kashmiri red chillies, rock salt, ginger garlic paste, garam masala, turmeric, dhaniya powder and jeera powder.
I usually put a cut in the chicken pieces for marination to go deep in. Marinate it for 2-3 hours in fridge.

Once they are ready, I get them in the high heat oven and cook till done. I usually broil the to get some charred edges.


Part 2 - Gravy

Ghee or butter in a pan. put in the paste of onions. don't brown them but still cook them till translucent. Add tomato puree. I usuallly put about 5000 grams of puree if I am making 1 kg chicken. Now cook this through.
Add salt, white peppar, paste of cashew nuts, heavy cream till you get the color to your liking.

Mix them on very gentle heat otherwise cream may turn into small lumps. Once its mixed, get a fine sifter and push the gravy through it. You should now end up with the seeds and peels of tomato and some other bigger chunks for some cashews. Don't throw them away. I use this paste to make a couple of stuffed parantha (indian bread).

Mix the chicken in the gravy, let is heat through on gentle heat and servce with a little swirl of cream and coriander.
