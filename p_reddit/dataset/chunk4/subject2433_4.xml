	<TEXT> I'm always trying to get support, comfort, and attention from other people and my friends, and even here on reddit. I'll constantly be asking for advice or answers to problems, and even when I get the advice, its likey mind just doesn't register it

I realized its harmful and I want to stop, but not getting those feelings from other people gets me depressed.

what's causing me to think and feel like this? I can't figure it out. the only thing I can think of is maybe I don't like myself, but even if I didn't I wouldn't know what to do about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess its weird, but I wanted to lose weight and shit before I left college so that people would notice and people would like me and I would have a good college experience. But because it takes so long to fix this shit by the time everything is fixed and I've lost weight and stuff, I will be out of college

Because of that there's no point. </TEXT>
