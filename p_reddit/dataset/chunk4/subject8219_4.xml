	<TEXT> My teeth are fucked due to amphetamine addiction in my younger life. Pretty much all of the ones I have left are root canal filled or crowned. The worst i had was one breaking horizontally. The dentist said it was very rare they break horizontally. The moment the nerve was exposed was like being skull fucked with a red hot poker  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to a tapas restaurant with an anorexic girl. I didnt know she was anorexic as it was like the second date. Ordered 40 of tapas. She ate some lettuce leaves. I did my best to eat  40 of tapas. 

Then. 

She had like two drinks and was absolutely shit faced. Completely ruined the day.

Needless to say....it didn't last long ! I fucking love food. </TEXT>
