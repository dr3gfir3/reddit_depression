	<TEXT> Even though anime Chiaki was more of a Mary Sue, and her living for so long after being literally speared in multiple places, I think her dying words are more realistic. She still wanted to help people (reminiscent of game Chiaki) but it's more real and relatable with the "I don't want to die" line. But that's my opinion on it. Regardless, I think anime Chiaki's Mary Sue personality also made her confident (like still wanting to see her friends even after Chisa said she could turn back, plus her whole arc with being introverted and then being the class rep who played games with everyone and organized events). Sure it's not as similar for the game Chiaki we know, but it's still confidence. </TEXT>
