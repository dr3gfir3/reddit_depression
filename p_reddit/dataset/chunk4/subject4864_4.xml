	<TEXT> I am not sure what people new to networking think the CCNA is all about. The CCNA is an entry level certification. The basics of routing, switching, and the Cisco product line. When you are starting out you really have no idea what you don't know. That comes with time. At the CCNP level is when you start to get a solid networking foundation  (in addition to experience ). Do not mistake certifications for actual skill or experience. Asking what your certifications did or did not teach you is like asking what the SAT or ACT did or did not teach you. I wish when I was starting out that I wasn't so arrogant and walking around thinking that I knew everything because I was certified. Now, 22 years later as an IT manager, I want to give young people the chance, but so many of them think their hot stuff because they have a couple of certifications and it's a challenge to teach them anything because they think they already know it all. My advice, certifications are for your career and experience is for your job. Be humble and let someone with experience take you under their wing. </TEXT>

He came right up to us and licked our hands and interacted with us while the other bunnies moved as far away as they could get. Over the past 10 years we have had 5 bunnies and none of them were even remotely this friendly. Our last one just passed just before she turned 10 and was just plain ornery. I'm glad he will get bigger,  we have a poodle/rat terrier mix who is energetic, but not violent.  We're going to wait until Ozzy fills out a bit and see if they will get along.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stay humble and people will want to help you. I just found out an intern we had awhile back got fired from his job for his attitude. I talked with him about the same thing while he was here. But, when you're 21 years old and graduate at the top of your class, you think you know everything about everything. I've been in IT for 22 years - started out as a bench tech and been in networking for 16 and management for 8 (still work on the network if you're doing the math). There are still days that I feel like I have so much to learn, but I love that challenge. Got an Extreme 10gb switch for our Datacenter and it was nothing like the Enterasys and Cisco devices that I've worked with for so long, still, it felt like Christmas  (or Chanukah, Kwanzaa, Ramadan, Dwali, Tet, Festivus, or whatever you happily celebrate when you get a new piece of networking equipment.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The theory will help you immensely with troubleshooting. Understanding how all the different parts of a network from layers to how network services work will give you a complete picture. A friend of mind went to an interview and said that he never worked with a SonicWall. I let him know that it shouldn't have ended with that statement. I told him you understand ports and protocols and how a firewall works. He may have never worked with the syntax and configuration of the Sonicwall, but in the end, he knew how it worked. That's like being hired by a garage and saying that you never worked on a Toyota.  It's still a car and fundamentally works the same way of cars that you have worked on. </TEXT>
