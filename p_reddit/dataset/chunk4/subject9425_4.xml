	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I started playing nearly 8 years ago, and if you do the math, that was in 2007, but the problem is, I forgot what I'd done. I began training slayer, and I'm hitting nothing on monkeys. So I need help, I'm willing to train any combat skill but preferably range (I prefer it over melee and Mage)
 The reason I'm training slayer is to make money, it's what I done on rs3 and i was able to buy 92 herb and 95 prayer. Will this work on 07 because I know it's a lot harder to make money
 I don't want to get into questing yet as I'm too low level, but if there is any that are a necessity, I'll do it
Thanks for your help </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay then, so what are we left with? Bossing? QBD for instance. ~200k per kill. Without t70 armour, super antifire, you'll be averaging about 4 minutes a kill. and you might be able to squeeze two kills in/trip. that'll cut down your profits by ~30-40k/invent. Assuming constant 165k/kill, about 5 minutes with banking youll be getting 1,980,000gp/hr. Then add in the deaths. W/o all that youll be getting maybe 700k, because unless you're a pro, you're going to die a lot.
Now lets assume that you had done slayer, you'd be able to afford t70 armour, and 85 herb. You'd be averaging 2:10 maybe 2:20/kill off task. thats ~23-26 kills per hour w/o banking. put banking in there, youd be able to get about 5/6 kills per trip, thats about 4 banks per hour. assuming banking takes a minute. 4/6=1/3, 20 seconds per kill per bank. That is still a maximum of 24 kills per hour. and because of longer trips, you'd be using less supplies so each kill you'll profit about ~190k. Assuming 22 kills/hour that's 4,180,000gp/hr.
So just by training slayer you are able to afford T70 armour and 85 herb, which made it possible for you to earn 2 more million per hour just at QBD. Thats a 1:2 nonslayer:slayer ratio. So yeah you could say that slayer is useless, but you'd just be wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Additional healing, incase you get damaged a bit more than usual, plus the 32 hybrid stats, or 44? Range stat. It's not needed but it's nice to have, as once you have it you can't get rid of it, unless you drop it and leave it. It's just a nice addition :) </TEXT>
