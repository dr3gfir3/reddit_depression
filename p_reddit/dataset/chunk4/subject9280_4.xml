	<TITLE> Anyone experience anhedonic depression and get better from TRT? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-20 13:50:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have anhedonic depression which my doc thinks is centered in dopamine deficiency or disregulation. I've gotten one low T test done and came back 288 and I'm 23 years old and was told it should be much higher. I'm doing a second test tomorrow morning and want to know if anyone here experienced lack of pleasure, appetite, sex drive, etc. and after TRT got better

Some added info, I've been on 12 different antidepressants, TMS therapy, six ketamine infusions, done diet change, exercise, meditation, years of talk therapy, and no change. Mentally my outlook is great, but in my body I feel like hell and can't experience pleasure, so every day is an emotional hell.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I believe i also have a dopamine issue. the thing is ive tried stimulants for years and the sides effects fuck me up hardcore. i dont eat, i get dizzy and paranoid, i get severe stomach and gas issues, and the positive effects only last a bit each time. i have to find something else, if not im fucked. i cant live in this state of anhedonia much longer, its too unbearable </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have an everdrive 2.5 but I don't have Pokemon Stadium 2 on it because I don't play it and like the original game better. Interestingly enough the only physical game I have besides the everdrive is that exact game Pokemon stadium 2. 

I'm currently selling it though because honestly if I can use the original game on the everdrive do I really need to keep a game I won't play? I would say get version 2.5 and just use Pokemon Stadium 1 because from what I remember Pokemon stadium 2 does in fact have confirmed issues with this everdrive version. Not worth the upgrade  </TEXT>

On another note, the first time I went to Five Guys id had it hyped up in my mind for years by others before going there myself. I went with two friends and was blown away completely even with my already very high expectations. Some things just deliver, and five years later and hundreds of burgers probably I still love five guys just like the first time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> :) Awesome to hear! Also, pay attention when he's opening packages to the one he doesn't open with the butterfly wings on it.  That package is symbolic of his hope. 

Since he worked for FedEx before he gets stranded he feels that if saves that package and doesn't open it its a reminder to him that he will one day ultimately deliver that package and get off the island.  That's why he doesn't open it, because keeping that package closed is literally keeping his hope alive that he will one day leave the island </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right yeah I've heard that in the end of the movie they actually break up.  Tbh that's awesome for the movie. It's just like Castaway (btw one of my favorite films) in which he comes back and doesn't win his fiance back but has hope and the movie ends on the most hopeful note possible </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My depression's dark beliefs are rooted in fantasy's of what I think my life should be, and watching movies like those are made to enforce society's dreams and beliefs of living perfect lives.  

In Romcoms they almost always leave off with fairytale endings and then you look back on yourself when the TV turns off and your just like the fuck man.  That's personally why I'd rather the gun then watch something like that </TEXT>
