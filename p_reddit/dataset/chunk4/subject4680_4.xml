I'll let you in on a little secret: psychopaths are as emotional as anyone else. We're people. We feel love and hate and sorrow and everything else. Just not quilt and empathy. And we feel sympathy anyway, so it's not really that big of a deal for a lot of people. 
TL;DR: Psychopaths aren't always bad people, and it's quite hurtful to assume they are. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Eberron Campaign I Just Started </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-26 01:19:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just started a D D 4e Campaign in Eberron, and I'm really excited about the story of it. It's my first long-term campaign, and I'd love to tell you the story and hear your feedback. Note that there are several differences between my Eberron world, and the traditional one, but the it's mostly steadfast. 

The characters survived the mourning. In fact, they are the only mortal to have survived. Every soldier. Every spy. Every civilian of Cyre. Every captain. All slaughtered by the mourning. The characters find their way out of the place, protected by a dragonmark branded onto their skin in an explosion moments before the mourning. 

The were on a rescue mission to save two people: a spy named ir'Gadden, and a noble named Blackwood. They succeeded, but just barely, after wading their way through a sea of emerald claw agents.

Four years later, old wounds reopen. The characters are invited to live in Sharn by ir'Gadden, now an extremely wealthy government official in Breland. On their first day in Sharn, they attend a remembrance ceremony, where they are attacked once again by the emerald claw, led by Blackwood.

After this, they come onto the radar of House Jorasco. A representative tells them the House is on a hunt to cure to mournland, and they think finding the cause of it is the first step. They tell the players there is were several emerald claw agents on the day of the mourning, and that this might have some correlation. 

Naturally, the next stop for the players is Karrnath. On the way there, their train is attacked by goblins, whom they liberate from their cruel necromancer masters. The goblins swear their allegiance and join the players on their quest.

When they arrive in Karrnath, the players find themselves under attack by the emerald claw. The mysterious leader of this organization has ordered the players' deaths. After several adventures involving this, the characters enter the paragon tier. 

In which everything gets serious! The characters are invited to a ball in the castle of the king of Karrnath, who is actually a vampire! After a run-in with a medusa at the party, and a human lich in the dungeon, the players find out the king's secret, and kill him.

In his dying word, they learn the mourning DID have a lot to do with Karrnath, but not as much as it to do with a secret coalition made of members of house Cannith and the leaders of the Emerald Claw. A good place to start might be the religion called The Blood Of Vol. 

Among these people, the characters find and kill Lady Vol, learning the mourning was an event caused by The Bronze Lich, and her god, Venca. They did it to gain enough souls to use necromancy to make an army capable of destroying the world. And for all intensive purposes, they are on track to succeed unhindered.

In their final adventures, the characters hunt the Bronze Lich through the planes, eventually killing her, and in a rare event, killing Venca himself.

Tell me what you think! </TEXT>
