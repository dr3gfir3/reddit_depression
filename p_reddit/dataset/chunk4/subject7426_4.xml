	<TEXT> Poor Heboric! I feel like I'm one of the few who really enjoy the Heboric plots. For me, his entire storyline echoes the prologue of GotM when Whiskeyjack tells Paran it's best to avoid the attention of the gods. Heboric was a priest of Fener who, through his studies and research, drew too much attention from maybe not gods, but his contemporaries. When we pick up with him in DG, I see him very much living WJ's "it's best to be avoided" philo. Which, obviously, does not happen. I really pity Heboric because his intense desire to be left alone coupled with his researcher's desire to understand everything plus god knows how many different forces vying for control over him....it's no wonder his mind is so rattled once we get to BH. This is a man driven, nay, forced towards an enlightenment he didn't seek out after losing his hands to the priests of Fener and it is reflected in how broken he eventually becomes.

Not trying to convince you to *love* Heboric...but he's far from the worst offender in the series in terms of being vague and rambling and coo coo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a surprising amount of non-metal albums in this thread! I'm pretty caught off guard by how many people posted rap albums, and there seems to be a lot of classic rock love too. This is dispelling a lot of the stereotypes for me that all us Malafans are huge metalheads...so I'm pretty sure no matter what you like, you'll be right at home! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. It'll sit a little better knowing that whatever is coming up will tie directly into the future plot. Not that I had huge concerns...but Janath's rapes in RG have been largely unrevisited so far (aside from a mention in passing) and I don't want that to happen again. SE did a really good job of exploring Seren's rape so it could ha e gone either way! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not worried about the series paying off! The rest of the plot lines have my full attention. I'm just getting a little frustrated with the extreme usage of rape and torture. I was beginning to get uncomfortable in RG with Janath's imprisonment(s) and rape(s) and the Barghast plot seems to have jumped in right where that left off in terms of intensity and is building to something much more violent.

So I guess, to recap, I'm not worried about the series as a whole paying off - I'm worried that the Barghast plot line exists only to portray the brutality of tribal rape culture and won't be elevated beyond that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright guys...I've whipped through the first eight books and have finally hit my first roadblock with the Barghast plotline in DoD. I'm on Chapter 11 right now and thank the stars the Letharii/Malazan plot is a break from the Barghast rape-this, rape-that narrative.

I can stomach a lot of stuff, but this snippet:  
Hed take the front half of her feet, a single merciful chop of his cutlass, once, twice. And then hed rape her. And then hed throw her out and all his friends would take their turn. Theyd fill her. Her mouth, the places between her thighs and cheeks. Three could take her all at once. 

and then this snippet:
His wife raped and the toes clipped from her feet, so making her a Hobbler, lower than a camp cur, forced to lift her backside to any man at any time and in any place.

are really testing my patience.  So I need some encouragement. No spoilers, but does this pay off? I'm echoing a lot of Amanda's thoughts from the Tor reread at this point and just want a gentle assurance that this isn't Erikson reminding us of tribal brutality just for the hell of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From my understanding (which is limited and based on speculation), force healing leaves the body in shock because it intertwines both Denul and the body's own energy to stitch things back up. To put it in perspective, imagine you broke your arm and I used magic to make things better. Rather than casting a good ol' Final Fantasy cure on you and making it all better, I would use magic to stitch the flesh and bone back together, put it in place, seal up the wound, cauterize it, set it, and wrap it all up in a nice little bow. Not necessarily in that order, but you get the idea. Meanwhile, if you are conscious, you are probably feeling both incredible amounts of pain as well as the physical sensation of me performing magical surgery on you.

Additionally, as with non-magical surgery, some users of Denul are better and can sew people up more proficiently. If your mage does a slapdash job on your arm, odds are it's been put back together okay...but not perfect. Your mind is now trying to reconcile having an arm that's healed...but maybe immobile, or twisted.  A better mage will do a better job, but from my understanding its very difficult (neigh impossible) for a mage to heal an injury so that it is in just as good of condition as if you had not been injured.

TL;DR: Imagine being awake during surgery. Without pain meds. While in shock from your injury. At least, I think that's what would happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Howdy! Glad you are enjoying your read of HoC, even if it isn't your favorite. A lot of what happens in this book is set up for a lot of things to come in the following books, but I will try to alleviate some of your confusion as best as I can. It's been a while since I've read HoC so I am going to err on giving you less information lest I spoil something for you.

What the Nascent is/where the Nascent came from is RAFO. As are the backstories for Trull and Onrack. I remember being confused as well (I actually didn't put it together that Trull was in the HoC prologue until the Tor reread) but you'll get lots of details further down the road.

My memories are hazy regarding the Tiste Liosan and the pursuing T'lan Imass so I'm afraid I won't be much help there. As such, I am also only on DoD, so if they get more clarification down the road, I am not aware of it yet. I do know that you'll get some more semi-related details later in the book, so RAFO! With regards to the T'lan ritual in the Nascent, I would check out the Tor reread. They usually do a pretty good job summarizing those sections and Amanda has voiced a lot of the confusions I had as a first-time reader and they clear them up.

I barely remember Kalam's plot in this book...sorry!

EDIT: Remembered what you were talking about with the enkaral (but super vaguely) and I would definitely hop over to the Tor reread. I don't remember this getting a lot of clarification (and frankly I don't think it was super important in the long view) but they will at least touch on it and provide a summary over at the reread.

So...I guess this is a whole lot of RAFO and not a whole lot of clarity. I guess the moral of this story would be to trust SE and continue to plunge head-first into HoC and the books to come! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Destril slowly spun around on crouched haunches as he closed himself in a thick black circle of charcoal.  He drew slowly, to make sure the band was unbroken, though he wasn't sure if this mattered. The charcoal crumbled easily in his unsteady hand as he pressed it into the compact dirt of the road beneath him. The circle was small - wedged between the ancient depressions of wagon ruts, but it was large enough for him to stand in.

*A simple circle will have to do. I don't know any runes anyhow, and I've run out of charcoal. Gods help me, I have no idea what I'm doing..but I have got to move this boulder off the road so I can deliver my fresh baked pies to Lingonvalle!*

The intrepid baker stood erect, fumbling with his hands. After debating whether to keep them at his side or fold them together in prayer, he opted for a happy median and laced his finger together, letting them fall below his waist and rest on his belt buckle. Closing his eyes, he attempted to center his mind and focus. Destril was unsure of what to do next as he had never summoned before. Nor had he ever seen someone summon. A cool breeze kissed the back of his neck, slick with recent perspiration.

*Spirits? Hello?* Destril felt foolish. His thumbs twiddled restlessly above his belt buckle, betraying his attempts to find a calm and focused center. *Damn it...this is insane! How is a stupid circle supposed to help me reach out to an earth spirit? This isn't as easy as Thessy tells about in her stories. I though spirits were supposed to just be floating around and stuff!*

     Actually, we are.

Destril started but remained upright. The hair on his arms rose in a ghostly shiver that traveled down his spine and anchored him in a frightened paralysis. Keeping both eyes closed, the baker reached out with his mind towards the disembodied voice.

*Are you a spirit? I need your help...I need to get to Lingonvalle to deliver my pies but a boulder has fallen onto the road and blocked the entrance to the pass. Without my pies, the whole village -*

     I see. Well then. Very interesting. So be it. Are you ready?

Destril barely nodded his head before his body was filled with a dense, rumbling energy. He saw in his mind's eye a haggard giant   with crystalline lodestone eyes looking down at him, into him. The energy inside him was condensing and he felt as if he was going to be crushed beneath the weight and pressure of an ancient mountain. *Gods help me! I was unprepared!* Destril cried out in his mind as the spirits power flowed through him, unaware of all else but a quickly fleeing sense of control. He attempted to scream but his body was not his. The spirit closed in on his mind and then suddenly all was calm. The raging storm of energy and immense pressure i his body were lifted and Destril floated in a sea of calm.

     What kind of pie?

The sudden and specific nature of the question startled the baker. *Cherry, and blackberry. And maybe a few rhubarb, I believe.*

    Good. I like rhubarb.

The spirit let loose a slow, relieved sigh and suddenly Destril was looking through his own eyes again, connected with his own body, anchored to the road below by his own feet. The spirits power still flowed through him, but now it was his to command. *I have control. I can harness its power!* Unlacing his fingers, the baker raised one hand toward the problematic boulder and gave a flick of the wrist. The spirits power lashed out and the obstacle was flung to the side as one might bat away a fly.

With the road clear, Destril took a breath and stepped out of the circle. His mind was still buzzing with the spirit's power as he staggered to his delivery cart. Resting one arm on his trusty mule, his knees buckled then gave out as the spirit reasserted its dominance over Destril's mind and body.

     Pie. It is time.

His hands were not his own and his mouth was not his own. Destril's eyes were his own, however, as he watched the spirit use his body to ransack his precious pies stacked in neat, assorted rows in search of one that would sate his hunger. Cherry pies were flung in the air, landing in emphatic splats on the dirt road. Blackberry pies crumbled beneath his possessed hands as they clawed in search of a singular desire. When it seemed like all Destril's pies were to meet an untimely and wasteful demise, he spotted one lone rhubarb dessert resting atop his travel bag. His body lurched forward and tore open the flimsy wrapping. Destril ravenously ate but did not taste and before long the pie was but a messy memory and an empty baking tin.

     Very well. It has been so long but it was worth the wait. I will not trick you into summoning me again. Deliver your pies, but if you think of me, leave a rhubarb by the roadside.

No sooner had the spirit issued its request, Destril gasped as it left his body and fled to wherever spirits live when they are not possessing bakers or blocking mountain passes with boulders. The poor man, who concluded, in hindsight, that he had gotten himself in way over his head, lay spread eagle in the carriage of his cart. Seemingly discontent with waiting, the mule clipped into motion and carried the exhausted baker into the mountain pass toward Lingonvalle to deliver his pies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of my races (the Dworu), augment their magic casting (a system based on summoning, dominating, and channeling the will of an otherworldly being to perform arcane acts) with blood rituals. In order to strengthen their control over the summon circles to bind the spirit within them, they perform self-mutilation and inscribe the circles and runes in their own blood. The Dworu believe that the more of one's own blood they can pour onto the ritual, the stronger and more powerful the arcane act they are committing will be. This rides a fine line, however, because too much blood loss can lead a mage to pass out or become too weak to exert the dominance of will necessary to summon. This has a myriad of side effects, all of which range from bad to catastrophic.

Additionally, the women among the Dworu are considered superior mages, especially during their period of menstruation. During their cycle, female mages will freely flow onto the summoning circle, believing this blood to be more strongly connected to their soul.

Like all summoning, there is a high amount of risk involved. While the use of blood does allow the Dworu mages to summon greater spirits, the blood link provides a direct link to the caster's soul and will. This would make it easier for a stronger spirit to dominate a mage, rather than having to fight through mental barriers created by mages who forgo blood rites.

Lots *and lots* of Dworu mages die (from blood loss or loss of control) but the use of blood ritual has made them superior casters compared to the other races. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There has been a long standing cold war between the Ageis Empire and Manous Commonwealth. The Manous (in earlier history) had been ruled by a highly militaristic theocracy that had pushed the Ageis first into slavery, then to the brink of extinction. After enlisting the aid of other nations to quell the Manous threat and dissolve the theocracy, the Ageis hardened into a rigid military state ready to pounce on the Manous should they pose a threat once more. (Side note: the terms and limits of what this *threat* would constitute has always been vague...)

The Manous did a complete 180 during their reformation and became a polytheistic commonwealth. While they are generally aware of the watchful eye of the Ageis, they have made reparations with the other races (even fostering a race out of their stone age and into a sort of pre-modernity). The Ageis recognize that if they were to declare war on the Manous, they would be invoking war against myriad other nations. This has kept them at bay, despite long-standing animosity that has fermented into a black and bitter hatred unable to acknowledge the changes made by the Manous race. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Magic users in my world are generally feared and avoided (and usually for a good reason). Magic users perform their arcane acts by summoning demons, ghosts, elementals, and other otherworldly beings into their world and channel their power. The spell caster becomes a conduit for the summoned beings power and the caster must exercise total dominance of will over the being it has summoned.  Failing to do so may result in possession, insanity, or death. In the worst case scenario, the summoned being may actually be able to enter the world through the eviscerated carcass of the careless mage.  For this reason, most people tend to fear those who can perform arcane acts and are quick to start literal witch hunts.

On the flip side, some spell casters are so renown for their indomitable will and mastery over summoned beings that they are feared as though one might fear a vengeful god. Their power ensures that they will not be turned on by the masses but also makes them wild cards during times of global conflict.

Various world powers secretly employ mage sects who, through group channeling, are able to *slightly* more safely cast larger and more complex magic that would require the use of a more powerful summoned spirit. There is still a large element of risk, but if one mage were to falter in will, the others can still attempt to contain the spirit.

Lastly, there are few "home brew" mages because the process of summoning and channeling spirits involves a certain amount of preparation and ritual. It is difficult to perform these acts in secret, especially as one attempts to invoke the power of stronger summons. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would think about *who* is naming/originally named the deities. What practices do those cultures employ when naming themselves? Are there special suffixes or permutations they add to names to denote rank or status? How was the diety discovers or how did it rise to power? Was the god always a god or was it once mortal?

If the god's name predates the cultures who worship it, does it have a true name that is not used by its worshipers but may instead be used by other deities in the pantheon? If the god gave itself a name, why did it choose it? What does the name reflect about the god, both if the name is chosen or given to it?

Do multiple cultural groups worship the same deity (either known or unbeknownst to them)? If so, do they use the same name, or does each culture have a unique name for the god?

This could easily (and has probably) started to snowball, but you get the idea. I realize this is less of a "how to" and more of a "things to think about," but I hope it's helpful nonetheless! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Artist needed - Designing the raw landscape of Ul Uren </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-22 22:52:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello! Longtime lurker, first time poster and all that jazz. Regardless, thank you first and foremost to all those who post here for making this a fantastic sub.

TL;DR: I want someone to illustrate the world I have envisioned, preferably for free (but I would always acknowledge the artist if used in an official capacity and if this made me money, I would discuss payment).

I am looking for an artist (or at least someone with more artistic skills than myself) to put the pen to paper and sketch out the oceans, continents, and major geographic features of the world of Ul Uren. I'll include a description below, but the reason I am seeking a separate set of eyes and hands is for a few reasons. A) I have a vision of the sweeping vistas, but I can never translate those into hard and fast continents and oceans, etc without going crazy. B) I am not looking for someone to dot my world with cities and country borders and other man-made artifices. I am looking for an artistic representation of the raw, untouched world. I plan on dropping all the man-made stuff in later, but I want those to reflect the world in which they were made, rather than the other way around. C) This world (while in a fantasy setting) is a little alien and though I have a lot of visions, I want to feel the sense of alienation as I build the rest of the world. I feel that building my world off of someone else's artistic rendering of my raw vision (cue Inception music) will aid in this.

Without further ado, here is what I have cooked up thus far. Again, this is just info on the raw landscape and terrain. Races, cultures, and other man-made artifices are not important right now. Yes, I have them in the back of my mind, but no, they are not important.

In the world of Ul Uren, the laws of nature and physics act similarly to our own. One key difference is the existence of two moons, one a similar distance away like the Earths moon, while the second, smaller moon hangs equidistant between Ul Uren and the larger moon. Both appear to be about the same size in the sky. The existence of two moons causes the tides on Ul Uren to vary vastly in size between high and low tide as well as make the coastlines virtually uninhabitable. Large tidal waves ravage the coasts worldwide and make sea travel very risky. Ul Uren also has no axial tilt, eliminating the potential of seasonal periods.
While land-dwelling animals are generally comparable to their mundane counterparts on earth, there is less diversity due to the loss of seasonality. Additionally, no species exhibits migratory patterns and plant life does not revolve around strict annual cycles. The oceans, which comprise of roughly 90% of the planets surface, are inhabited by primordial beasts referred to as titans. These titans range in size and shape but are among the most dangerous and diverse creatures on the planet. They have evolved into highly competitive predators and pose a great threat to those who choose to brave the oceans.
Ul Uren is an entirely different planet, despite having many similarities to our world. Three main continents make up the land mass of Ul Uren and they are clustered closely together on one side of the planet. The rest of the planet is a restless, unexplored ocean. The northern and southern poles of the planet are capped in thick ice that does not melt. The two larger continents support most of the life on Ul Uren and arc around one another to form a large, semi-inland sea that connects to the larger ocean via rocky straights between each continent. The third continent is much smaller than the other two and is the result of a large comet colliding with the planet. It rests between the two larger landmasses in the northwestern region of the inland sea. 
The inland sea experiences less destructive tides, though the difference between high and low tide can still be between a quarter to half a mile. On the outer edge of the continents, the tide can consume between a mile to a mile and a half of shoreline. The coastal geography varies between flat expanses that support little to no life due to the tidal impact and large, sheer cliff faces that rise above the ocean and provide a buffer between the land and rising water. The northern and southern continents are dotted with smaller lakes and seas, many of which feed back into the ocean. Civilization has built up around these inland water features and only the brave or foolish attempt to settle near either the greater or lesser ocean.
Desertification has corroded the coastline and inland regions along the equator. The loose, arid soil and dry crusts of mountainous rock formation in this region maintain a delicate balance that prevents these regions from being swept away by the tide. The hot temperatures make it very difficult to live in this region and only the hardiest of wildlife claims this as a habitat. The deserts give way to grasslands both further north and south of the equator, though areas where tides lay claim to the land are reduced to swampy beaches. 
Large stretches of mountains separate dense forests from both the tide and desert. Mountains near the coastlines are shaped by the tide, their once craggy surfaces smoothed into a smooth, resilient wall providing a barrier against the tidal waves. Inland mountains bear more jagged features and are weathered more naturally. They are home to more life and provide the most stability and security against the threat of flooding. The inland and coastal mountains shelter forests from both erosion and flooding, as well as trapping rain. Closer to the equator, the forests are much more tropical, though the trees grow thinner and more resilient to the cold as they progress towards the poles. 
Like the desert, the forests give way to grasslands, though they are textured will rolling hills. In the northern continent, lakes dot the vast stretches of plains and feed rivers that flow out to the ocean. Some rivers, if born from a high enough altitude, empty into the ocean from magnificent waterfalls hundreds of feet tall at low tide, only to be reduced to shadows of their former glory at high tide. Other rivers simply wind their way down towards the swampy beaches of the lowland and empty into the murky swill. The southern continent has a few lakes, but since the continent is much thinner and consists of more lowland areas than the northern continent, many areas cannot sustain lakes against the encroaching tide. 
The regions of the continents closest to the poles grows much colder than at the equator. There is less daylight in these regions and the land devolves into a treeless expanse of permafrost and glacier formation. In these regions the tide pushes large sheets of ice against the coast and glacial mountains may be temporarily formed as ice is thrown around. Ice-locked poles exist at the northern- and southern-most reaches of Ul Uren, but they are too far away to safely travel to.
Stretching out from all outward-facing sides of the two main continents are mountainous islands. Some larger islands contain more geographic variety such as forests and small, hilly plains but most are barren formations of jutting stone. A few larger islands off the coast of the two continents are capable of supporting life, but travel to them is very dangerous and unpredictable.
In the sea between the two continents lies the remains of a comet. The continent is actually a very large island that is not grounded to the seabed. Instead, the mass floats atop the ocean as a result of large pockets of air trapped in the comet during impact. Because of this, the land mass drifts around the sea and rises with the tide, allowing those who live on it to live closer to the coastline. The land is mostly a barren, rocky expanse, but some small vegetative life has taken hold. Small creatures such as rodents and insects have also found a home on the comet, but the island cannot support larger forms of life on its own. </TEXT>
