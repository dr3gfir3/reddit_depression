	<TEXT> I'm wondering if anyone (studies, reports, researched articles or videos) has gone into detail and examined this very much, also do politicians being involved have anything to do with the media (recent artciles about the way movie and tv production companies are coming to light from people like Elijah Wood) and the churches as well? Are they working together?

	<TEXT> Link to product: http://www.fusionfirearms.com/parts/frame-parts/mainspring-housings/magwells/mag-well-msh-gov-plain-black  
  
I purchased this magwell, took my 1911 apart, put the spring and pin into the housing and the pin at the bottom of the grip wouldn't go in. The Fusion's main spring housing pin hole was machined a few millimeters off and I couldn't get the pin in.  
  
I asked about exchanging it, they said no problem and I mailed it back. Instead they refunded my money so now I'm probably going to buy a Smith and Alexander one from a recommendation on another post I made. </TEXT>
