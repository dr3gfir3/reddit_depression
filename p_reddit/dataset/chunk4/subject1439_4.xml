	<TEXT> This is a very interesting thing because not only are this the oldest plant root stem cells, but this is also the first time an actively growing fossilised root has been discovered. The scientists of Oxford put it very nicely: "an ancient plant frozen in time".

This could show how roots developed millions of years ago and how it differed from the plants of today. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course it goes down because at the moment it is being traded by day traders and those flock to the fastest ROI... ETH goes down, traders sell lisk to short it. DAO goes down, traders sell lisk to short it... It is what, the third week of Lisk? Development will sky rocket the price, not day trading and I think that we are at least 2-3 months away before the heavy development is done and we start seeing the first bapps and stuff like that. </TEXT>
