	<TEXT> So I've heard similar. But some people I know say that while they seem to get a lot done. The quality and meaningfulness of the work goes down. Is this true? 

Reminds me of Brian Griffin in that episode where he goes bonkers on it and writes that complete turd of a 1000 fantasy world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not playing in the 4th doesn't lessen the fact that he shot 4/12 and was -20 in +/-. I agree dude is balling past 2 months and is insane in the 4th qtr. But to say no one can guard him is a huge overstatement.

That being said, I'm looking forward to march when they have a rematch. </TEXT>
