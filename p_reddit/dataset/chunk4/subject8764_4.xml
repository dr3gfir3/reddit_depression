And FWIW, I 100 percent agree with him on gay marriage. Just think he's hurting the cause by making it about him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think he would have played until 1997 or 1998. He was still at the top of his game, averaging 20 and 11 his final season. I think Jerry West would have been able to find some pieces to put around Magic to make a few more runs in the mid-1990's. 

I really wish he would have come back one more year after his official comeback. Seeing him on the court with a young Shaq and 18-year-old Kobe would have been awesome when it comes to two eras meeting up.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Obviously fans of those teams who lost out on the LeBron, Carmelo and Bosh sweepstakes will be upset that their teams couldn't land them. 

But what about moves across the league that you wish would have happened just as a basketball fan?

To me, I wish Carmelo Anthony would have signed with Chicago. Melo has never been on a team that was considered a favorite to win the championship. Chicago with Melo-Noah-Rose, along with a nice supporting cast, was going to be the favorites in the East IMO. It would have been interesting to watch Melo respond to that pressure. He played on some nice Nuggets team, but Denver was never considered a strong favorite to win a title. Neither have any of the Knicks teams he played on. Kobe, LeBron, Wade, Bosh, Duncan (and his teammates) have all been on teams that were favored to win titles. Not Carmelo.

Plus, having LeBron, Carmelo and Paul George in the same division could have set up some great rivalries between Chicago, Cleveland and Indiana. I hope Carmelo does well with the Knicks because the league is more fun when the Knicks are good, but I wish he would have signed with the Bulls.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading that Woj column makes me wonder if LeBron had a master plan from the beginning. He leaves Cleveland, knowing that they'll be pretty bad for four years and that they'll have four lottery picks. During this four year run, he wins championships with Miami while Cleveland builds a team with a lot of young talent and future draft picks. 

I don't buy the whole "Dan Gilbert and LeBron planned this" conspiracy, but if the Heatles first talked about playing together at the 2008 Olympics, LeBron seeing the writing on the wall for Cleveland rebuilding is not too crazy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My gut feeling is his source was at Nike. He increased his odds immediately after the Nike meeting. My guess is LeBron told the Nike folks at that time to preview a potential marketing campaign. Someone from the Nike meeting or Lebron's agent tipped him off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. If you look at his tweets, he was hammering home the whole local legacy angle. It's clear he had a really good source, whether it be with Nike or LeBron's camp. He probably knew there was going to be a letter from LeBron, but he assumed it would be on his Website and not in a magazine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Broussard. As someone who was in journalism, the whole "smiley face" tweet was very unprofessional. On top of that, the whole Gilbert letter storyline from this morning was brutal. ESPN actually edited the story and took a piece of it out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In some part, leverage. Bosh would have been a perfect fit in Houston. He stretches the floor and he would have been awesome next to Dwight Howard. For Miami, they need pieces and giving Bosh the max is a great start to that.  </TEXT>

But Wade, Bosh and Deng are a solid group. Definitely not the apocalypse that many think is happening in South Beach.  </TEXT>
