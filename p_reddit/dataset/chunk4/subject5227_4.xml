	<TEXT> In 2014, the Justice Department released a secret 2011 memo that explained the legal justification for killing American terror suspects living overseas without trial. But you're right in that other Americans killed by US drone strikes were self-reported as accidents. However, they're still dead and the administration maintains the right to report dead Americans as official targets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You nailed the fundamental concern right on the head. Combining expediency with machine learning to escalate people on kill lists [isn't reassuring.](http://arstechnica.co.uk/security/2016/02/the-nsas-skynet-program-may-be-killing-thousands-of-innocent-people/)

Other countries' use of drones might risk further obscuring attribution, like one [almost-killed journalist complained.](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/30/american-journalist-in-rebel-held-syria-reports-barely-dodging-a-missile-strike/). 

Interestingly, this article also says:

While the Obama administration characterizes drones as a surgically precise weapon, the facts dont always support that conclusion. In 2013, [for example,](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/02/us-drone-strikes-afghan-civilians) research by Larry Lewis, a former  research scientist at the Center for Naval Analysis, found that drone strikes in Afghanistan were 10 times more likely to kill civilians than piloted airstrikes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The extremes of the blame the victim paradigm seems a bit odd. I remember when the Intercept interviewed an NSA hacker who talked in a similar way (which isn't unusual) and blamed people for not using Tor for having no privacy. I use Tor, but I know it doesn't afford perfect anonymity - and if I became a victim, surely someone could point out that if I ever enable javascript on a website - I deserved to be a victim.

I think there are so many ways to make a mistake nowadays that there will always be something you can blame victims for not doing. I wonder if we'll eventually blame whistleblowers for getting killed when they don't have their own personal "encrypted insurance" like Wikileaks does. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their claim is that they were concerned that the company would either ignore the claim (based on what they said of evidence of noteworthy lazy   poor security that persisted for years, and the MedSec CEO also [claims](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=curdJoTysF8) that St Jude's has a history for ignoring vulnerability disclosures) or sue MedSec (I'd think for breaking DRM) - which might silence them and keep the information underwraps. Unfortunately, internet of things products are infamous for not investing into security - I think even Dick Cheny may have had his pacemaker's wifi disabled as a safe measure.

By putting financial pressure on the large company while releasing the report, St Jude will have a stronger incentive to address what MedSec considered as serious vulnerabilities   protect many patients who depend on those products. 

**That is their claim anyways.** I might look into the CEO's claim of historical negligence as she provided the years they may have ignored security disclosures. If they are correct, it sounds like they did the right thing. Bruce Schneier has long complained that there are insufficient profit motives for good security in the system as it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard that the usual failngs of revolving doors can happen at hospitals too. I heard from someone working in a hospital about an individual responsible for supplies, set the hospital up in an very long unpopular contract with a large medical device company - that included replacing all their devices with that particular brand (which made doctors very angry). What made the story shady, and the source nervous to tell me, was that the person later was hired by that company. I think the source said the reason they even knew that was circumstantial, so what's scary is we likely will not know of these dealings.

Since I'm just a pseudonymous redditor who is relating a story from others, take it with a grain of salt. But the revolving door aspect is not a new phenomenon, and I think a ton of people are forced to be dependent on devices that are insecure and 'protected' only by obscurity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bruce Schneier and others in the security field have complained about this issue for years. That's what makes MedSec so awesome.

[Here's a story of how they pressured a huge medical device company to patch the security holes in pacemakers](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160829/07564835381/security-startup-medsec-shorts-st-jude-medical-stock-to-punish-it-flimsy-pacemaker-security.shtml).

I should add that patients often do not have a choice on the pacemaker (Karen Sandler experienced this firsthand and it politicized her), so this is a serious problem.

	<TEXT> [This article](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/government-censorship-21st-century-internet/385528/) talks about many ways globally, information is being suppressed. It doesn't even get onto the topic of astroturfing - which I have no idea what the solution for that is.

Distorting   surpressing information through astroturfing has gotten so big that people normally detached from that type of drama have recently acknowledged it like [Bruce Schneier](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/09/internet_disinf.html), [Dan Carlin](http://www.dancarlin.com/common-sense-home-landing-page/) (latest podcast), and [Glenn Greenwald](https://theintercept.com/2016/09/06/the-unrelenting-pundit-led-effort-to-delegitimize-all-negative-reporting-about-hillary-clinton/). Dan Carlin is so detached from this stuff that you can see his AMA where he asked redditors about "best-of"/"top" sorting and someone on twitter introduced him to the word "sockpuppet" - and even he sees this issue. </TEXT>

I know the intercept's main point was that the stories the WaPo criticized as not important or in the public interest, were mostly ones they had published themselves - one of which they won a Pulitzer for. The hypocrisy is that Snowden openly relied on journalists to filter what is in the public interest (not decide for himself), and the WaPo (one of the receivers of leaked documents) published stories that they criticize Snowden for.

	<TEXT> I think the Hillay saga has been, for many, their first introduction to real American politik. As someone who has seen both major US parties as elitists not working in the public interest for years, it's been amazing seeing people seeing through the usual political games   openly talking about it. I think many people who have been outraged by Hillary will see other problems in the institutions, like corporate   foreign influence in US poltics and lacking transparency   accountability etc.

Of course most will not stay informed and before we know it, things will calm down   it will seem like few care at all, but we both know that is normal. People make snide comments about reddit but I think it's historically been a great platform for raising awareness of issues that entrenched interests have no desire to address or honestly discuss. Astroturfing may change that though.

Tl;Dr, don't be surprised people are uninformed on important issues but be excited for when more people start to care about them   inform themselves (I think many have thanks to this rare   unusual election) </TEXT>

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evo_Morales_grounding_incident

I think the Espionage Act was only chosen to make it so he'll only be tried in a secret military court where he will not be allowed to make a whistleblower defense.

Also, I do not think all the documents are public because recently the Intercept used undisclosed documents to verify a recent NSA leak.

	<TEXT> [This article](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160915/17000035532/house-intel-committee-says-snowdens-not-whistleblower-cause-he-once-emailed-his-bosss-boss.shtml) offers pretty good counterarguments to each main point. 

Here's just a couple points to hint at what the report entailed (read the article for more complete version with sources):

[1] James Clapper himself admits that Snowden did not download all 1.5 million files he had access to, a number cited frequently in their report.

[2] They cite mass downloading (this is where the 1.5 million files number comes from) as happening before Clapper lied to Congress, but Snowden maintains that the "mass downloading" was what he did as part of his job working under Heartbleed.

[3] The report cherry picks a statement from a Russian politician as admittance of giving secrets to Russia, leaving out the "speculation" portion

[4] To quote the article's response to Snowden not being a whistleblower:

First of all, hiding behind the very technical, narrow legal definition of whistleblower is pretty ridiculous compared to the actual definition that most people use. Snowden revealed a program that involved mass surveillance on nearly all Americans, a program that the intelligence community had directly and officially denied existed. It was, in fact, a program that, from a plain reading of the law, should not exist, and the only way in which it did and could exist was if the government reinterpreted the law, in secret, to mean something completely different. That's pretty clearly whistleblowing. And the fact that the public has spoken out in support of him so much suggests that many people believe this as well.

And that doesn't even mention the fact that after this Congress changed the law to further clarify what the NSA could actually do. In other words, Congress seems to agree that what Snowden did was in the public interest. Even former Attorney General Eric Holder has admitted as much.

And, of course, the claims about "the proper channels" is ridiculous as well. We've written many, many times on what happens to individuals who go through the "proper channels." It often ends with them being put in jail on trumped up charges. Oh, and Snowden, as a contractor rather than gov't employee, had no whistleblower protections under the law anyway. Going through the "proper channels" gets you marked as a troublemaker, and that often leads to more scrutiny and questionable raids... and jail time. And, as if to confirm all this, the guy that Snowden could have reached out to as the "proper channel" had already mocked Snowden and attacked him, so it's not as if that would have been a useful route.

	<TEXT> Don't have time to give a full critique of your criticisms, but your first point is an ironic one. They actually addressed this. They said that work disputes are not rare or unusual:

I mean, people have email disputes with co-workers all the time. Is that really a sign that you're not a whistleblower, or that you're just "disgruntled?" If that's really the "dirt" that they dug up on Snowden after two years of research, they really must have nothing that actually sticks.

Right after this, they address the implication that this work dispute led to mass downloads.

HEARTBEAT, which seems to be the source of their 1.5m number, was explicited authorized by two levels of my management. I built it.
  Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 15, 2016

In other words, yes, he touched 1.5 million documents. Because he was told to as a part of his job. It's been more than two years since **James Clapper himself admitted that Snowden didn't actually take all of those.**

The fact you skipped over most of the article either is to capitalize on people who do not read the source, or a demonstration of it. I do not understand how you could otherwise miss this.  </TEXT>

Apparently, the US gov't (which had supported ISDS strongly) freaked completely the fuck out:

    Soon, top officials in the Justice Department, State Department, and Office of the US Trade Representative were on red alert.

Edit: here's Schneier's piece: https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2014/03/an_open_letter_.html </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The chipset is usually the problem, and a very serious one. Still, the reasons you mention is why Chromebooks are even on my radar.

E.g. of chipset creepiness:

	<TEXT> Something unsettling to me are similarities made between 'terror groups' and civil rights movements. [This article](https://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2016/08/scott_atran_on_.html) mentions it briefly.

It makes me wonder how much is being imported to domestics? Will military tactics   technology be used effectively against acts of civil disobedience and nonviolent resistance? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New precedents like https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160818/18363835281/woman-sues-after-police-destroy-her-home-during-10-hour-standoff-with-family-dog.shtml ? Or are we already way past that?

There's a reason a line was carefully drawn between the military and domestics by the US founding fathers, who both lived through the abuses of power   looked into a past where the military often held a political role. I don't see this escalation getting any better for democracy.

Additionally, I highly doubt that all options were actually exercised - especially considering how well armed police are today. E.g., LRADs   tear gas are already used against protesters, why resort to blowing up a suspect? LRADs aren't anything to scoff at as they can cause [permanent hearing damage](https://theintercept.com/2016/06/22/cleveland-gears-up-for-republican-convention-with-restrictions-on-speech-but-not-on-guns/) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a lot of people simply don't know much about this issue. There are a lot of forces pushing in that direction unfortunately (e.g., market forces, feasibility of astroturfing, and cultural shift).

However, I still continue to see people IRL and online who are concerned and seem to only need more information to bring them to a threshold where they are willing to take action (e.g., using FDroid for FOSS android apps, or any small act of resisting the trend).

Following that observation, I fear astroturfing and other forms of commercial filters on information exchange are the biggest obstacle to greater education on the issue.  </TEXT>
