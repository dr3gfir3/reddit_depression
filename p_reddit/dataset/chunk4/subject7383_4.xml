	<TEXT> Whoops, I meant triple 4K, I think that's an issue of drivers and power supply though, IIRC some people got it to work for a racing game.

That's what those fancy supercomputers that do my work wish they ran on. I actually have an old server board with some impressive stuff for its time (2 dual-core xeons and 32GB of RAM, even if it is all DDR2); hang around loading docks of your local university and you might find some people throwing that out in 10 years or so!

Anyway looks like I'm all set then, I'll go with the X99 build. Thanks again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think workstation GPUs are for professional photo editing or SolidWorks for engineers; the closest I get to really intensive GPU related calculations in my work would be pre-optimizing things showing some spheres move around while the CPU finds coordinates so I can send them to a supercomputer. I can do that with my laptop now, but trying to do data analysis in Excel makes it freeze up (plotting ~10^4 ordered pairs). I'm not looking to have future-proof components initially (so I won't be starting out with quad SLI 980s), but lay a solid foundation for what would evolve into a hardcore computer in a few years (e.g. by the time the Pascal GPUs come out and cost around what a 980 does now I'd be willing/able to drop the cash to SLI *those*).

It's really approaching 2 rigs at once I guess. Initially it would be a moderately good machine; as a reach scenario, an ideal starting rig would be capable of running a 1440p ultra-wide center monitor with 2 flanking 1080p monitors, able to combine them in eyefinity and play Tomb Raider on max settings with 30 fps. Plotting data sets as large as those that crash Excel for me, but with 3 dimensions and then being able to adjust it with no stutter, maybe while I have a couple tabs open in Chrome. 

Down the line something powerful that currently just can't be done without bleeding edge hardware (which is why I brought up GPUs and CPUs still in development). I'd also like a CPU capable of handling compiling code, plotting data, and making a lecture in powerpoint all at the same time across all those high resolution screens. More logical cores would probably be useful than clock speed. The "reach" scenario for the end system would something crazy like triple monitor 1440p for gaming while game stats/internet browser display on the portrait 1080p **and** a movie plays on the 4K TV. Though all that is a combination of CPU, GPU, and RAM. Although that would probably still melt a hole in my desk within a minute.

I figured when you said the X99 chipset could handle more bandwidth that'd be good for doing more things at once down the line, and having enough PCI ports to throw fancy GPUs at it would certainly help the unrealistic goals. Though that might require an entirely new mobo by that point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I found a (base) setup with an X99 mobo since you seemed adamant about it; I'm taking a hit on the CPU on both power consumption and clock speed, with the idea that I can upgrade it to something better once broadwells come out and the price for haswell drops. Half the RAM (but it's DDR4) and SSD space (not a big deal, since I'll just be putting an OS on it). GPUs are cutback for both, but I've been gaming on integrated laptop graphics and the focus isn't games anyway.

Both fall nicely enough below my starting price range that I could build them as early as January and either path would be a huge upgrade; which setup would go best with my end-goal? I'm willing to spend an additional $5,000 on *upgrades* beyond the initial rig.

Also thanks for all the help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, see that's where the "very little knowledge" part comes in; I know next to nothing about mobos. That was just referencing the CPU, which I intend to upgrade to something broadwell based for the final build (so I'm vaguely aware I need a Z97 chipset, and I need to be able to stuff in minimum 2 GPUs to SLI until Pascal saves us all(?)). I may also go with 1 wide center monitor and flank it with portraits so it'd be 4 monitors in the endgame.

What little I'm aware of is just a result of working with stuff related to semiconductors. AFAIK my laptop with an i5-337U can handle my undergrad homework so higher numbers will do graduate level work. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Multi-Year Build Plan for Computational Work   Play </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-20 17:13:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

Some computational chemistry work (i.e. black box calculations, light programming, using terminal to tell supercomputers what to do), some gaming, presentations, documents and a little image editing.

* CPU centered programs: LaTeX (will utilize live document preview, possibly via EMACS), Python, GnuPlot and/or Origin, Avogadro (molecular modeling program, fairly lightweight), Mathematica, MATLAB.
* GPU: GIMP, Tomb Raider, Portal, Skyrim, 5 monitors for multi-tasking (triple monitor NVIDIA Surround for gaming).

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* ~$1,500-$2,000 for initial build; capable
* Add ~$5,000 for upgrades to reach final form; no-holds-barred, hit me with all the sexy future tech coming in the next couple years

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* Initial, functional build: Mid-summer/fall 2015; OK to use current stuff if you have anything in mind.
* End-date: ~Winter 2016 

This means NVIDIA's new Maxwell microarchitecture will be settled and Pascal will be coming out; I'm willing to skimp on the initial setup to splurge for Pascal based components when they become available since it seems like that's going to be a huge improvement.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

* Tower
* Monitors (included sketch at bottom).
* Initial build GPU.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* US; A few possible places, most pertinent to computer parts: Chicago, IL; Berkeley/Pasadena, CA

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* None, fresh build.

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* Down the line, *maybe*; may entertain possibility of 2 CPU slots on the mobo, but likely won't need since I'm aiming for an i7 4000 series. I'll have access to supercomputers for all the really heavy stuff.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* SSD for OS, possibly 2, one for Windows and one for a Linux distro (not necessary unless cheap or dual-booting is made difficult by Windows 8+). OK with a hard drive for everything else.
* Mobo capable of SLI.
* May require a workstation GPU or one that can be "unlocked." But none of the programs are as intense as those engineers use.

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* Relatively minimalist, large tower would be nice; aesthetics fairly unimportant, just want airflow.
* Water cooling seems more aesthetic, but I'll be running computations, not just gaming.

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

* No, but would like opinions on dual-booting Windows and Linux from one drive (I hear this has been made somewhat difficult due to BIOS changes).

**Extra info or particulars:**

I'd like to start off with two monitors (one for portrait), but end with 5; [I drew a sketch with arrangement, sizes, and resolution.] (http://i.imgur.com/BWFg84c.jpg?1) Idea is to use the main triple monitor for gaming (Not willing to use one super-ultrawide-curved screen, need to stay triple for easy windows snapping when doing work; willing to debezel), portrait for easier interaction with documents/talking to terminal, big TV for movies and for putting up plots or reference documents (hence the 4K).

If anyone has any input on how easy workflow would be please chime in!

Since I'm looking far into the future for the end-product and I've obviously outlined a lot of stuff with very little knowledge, I'm kinda just looking for a general direction to look in. Feel free to cherry-pick what to answer.

Thanks for any advice you can give! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-10 06:54:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I took the GRE today and did fairly poorly [159 V (81%), 157 Q (68%)], likely because I studied for all of 2 days and loathe basic statistics.

While the verbal is past the point of mattering, the quantitative is only in the 60th percentile for chem majors and I'm applying to highly regarded PChem programs. However, I have a minor in math and a 3.9 GPA for that coursework; will being able to do real math offset the GRE score to adcoms or is there a sieve in place that I won't get through?

I know the GRE is often insulted as a metric for graduate ability, but is it an auto-cutoff like GPA?

Update for people from the future: I didn't retake it and had no issues getting accepted! </TEXT>
