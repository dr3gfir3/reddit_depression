	<TEXT> I suppose its really hit the fan when I have to go to anonymous internet strangers for help. But I have no choice. For reasons that will be pretty fucking apparent, I cant turn to anyone I know or tell you my name. 

I can say that Im a thirty six-year-old single mom with a five-year-old daughter. Her name is Eliza May. Its about her.

Shes always been my shining star. Youve heard all of the same crap  my child is amazing, beautiful, talented, blah, blah, blah, youll understand when youre a parent. 

Then you become a parent. And you do understand.

There is nothing in life to compare with the feeling of fearing for your child. When I stop to consider what I would actually do to keep her safe, my own answers horrify me.

All of those were hypotheticals until last week.

I noticed something odd when I walked by Eliza May sitting in front of the TV. Something was just slightly off. The way that she was kneeling, and her proximity to the screen, did not seem right. 

The news anchor brought me out of my reverie. 

Carlton Maston is a twenty four-year-old white male. He was last seen at the Chong Industries Warehouse two nights ago. A severed hand was recovered at the scene; investigators have confirmed that the hand belongs to Maston. Authorities suspect foul play. Anyone with information is encouraged to contact [city] police immediately.

I looked back at Eliza May to find her smiling. It was not just a grin; she was positively beaming. I could see every single one of her teeth. She held that position for a moment, seemingly enraptured by the TV. When she rotated her head and fixed her gaze on me  still unblinking, still so toothy  my daughter made me shudder for just the second time in my life. I left the room.

Things continued to be mostly normal. I debated with her about why we could not have a pony come live with us, why she had to go to kindergarten (every single day with this one), and why princess costumes did not count as normal clothing. 

The debate about dinner three nights ago was weird. 

I brought home some steaks to cook on the stove. I suppose Eliza May is as picky as any other five-year-old when it comes to food. But she got upset about something that I never expected.

Were having steaky, Mom?

Steak. Yes, honey. It will be ready in a few minutes, as soon as I cook it.
She got her Im-about-to-cry face.

Mooom, no, she whined. Dont.

Dont what, sweetie? I asked, distracted by the salt I had just knocked over.

Dont cook it. I want it bloody. She looked up at me with those angelic eyes and smiled.

I  what? I stopped what I was doing and turned toward her.

I want it bloody, she explained simply, her normal dimpled cherub grin in place.

I, uh  no, we have to cook it.

Her face held the glowing smile for just a second before a shadow crept over it.

But I want it BLOODY! She shrieked the last word in that pitch that only small children can reach.

I stared at her as she began to cry. 

I wont, I wont, you cant make me, EEEEEE! She stamped her foot down hard on the ground, tearing her yellow Belle dress in the process. 

She went to bed without any dinner that night. 

I tried to shake it off. Kids say the damnedest things, right? Their brains are brand-new and still warming up. 

Nothing of further note happened until two nights ago.

Now I explained that I am a single mom, which affects everything about how I see safety. Every door to the outside has three locks. Eliza May and I have a safe word. I sleep with a baseball bat by my bed. 

And I always worry. 

So when I heard something distinctly moving around in my living room, I nearly shit the bed.

I have a kid to protect. So in a situation where I would have otherwise jumped out the window and started running, I did just the opposite.

I went into the dark. 

With only my baseball bat in hand, I crept silently through the hall. I didnt turn on a single light; I wanted to get the drop on whoever or whatever was roaming around the living room. I had to find it before it found my daughter. 

I got to the edge of the living room and felt the light switch with my fingertips, but held back on flicking it.

Whatever was in the room had not reacted to my presence. I waited with my breath held.

It continued to walk  to march, almost. It was pacing in circles, I realized. It did two full circuits of the living room as I stood there silently.

When it traveled to the far end of the room for a third time, I decided to flip the switch. 

There was Eliza May, parading boisterously around the edge of the rug, swinging her arms and lifting her knees high. She trailed a dog leash behind her. It was not tied to any thing, and slithered along behind her in an empty sort of way.

The fucking weirdest thing, though, was her eyes. When I flipped the switch, she was ALREADY looking at me, as though she could see me in the dark. She maintained eye contact with each swinging step as she marched around the room, never saying a word. That open-mouthed, toothy grin sat plastered on her face the whole time.

I was sure she had been following me with her eyes before I ever arrived in the room. 

I stumbled over my words for about ten seconds before I was finally able to blurt out, what the fuck are you doing?

It just came. I never swear in front of my daughter. But seriously. What the fuck?

She gave three more silent swinging steps. At first I thought she wasnt going to answer. 

Im giving Penelope a walk! she explained in a saccharine sort of way.

Penelope was the golden retriever that I had years ago. She died before Eliza May was born; I had never told my daughter about her, or shown her any pictures. Penelope had been run over by a truck and not died for ten minutes. It was so traumatic that I never wanted to have or speak of another pet ever again. 

There is absolutely no way that she could have known that name. 

I was holding back tears as I ushered her back to her bedroom. I could feel her staring and grinning at me the whole time we walked, but I refused to return her gaze. I simply grabbed her left hand with mine, placed my right hand on her back, and looked forward as we walked.

When I had put her to bed I picked up the pink leash that she dropped on the floor. There was no nametag. But Im sure it was Penelopes.

I had thrown in in the trash after she died.

Im quite certain that Eliza May was staring at me through the walls after I climbed back into my own bed. 

Even that was bearable.

Last night I woke up in what had to be the middle of the night. I dont actually remember awakening. But I knew that something wasnt right. 

Someone was with me. 

I scrambled to find the pull chain to my bedside lamp. Light flooded the room, casting more shadows than illumination. 

I shrieked when I saw a face on the pillow next to mine. 

Eliza May was standing by the side of the bed, leaning forward and resting her chin on the pillow. For some reason, she was fully dressed. 

I lurched back in fright. 

Eliza, w- what are you doing here? 

She was smiling, but it was her normal, dimpled cherub grin. I was relieved to see that, at least. 

She leaned close and put a finger over her lips in an exaggerated kind of way.

Sssshhhhh  its in the freezer! Dont tell anybody! she pulled her head back and clapped her hands twice, still grinning. Then she turned and started skipping away. Not running, not walking, but skipping. 

She stopped when she was halfway to my bedroom door. Her face was much more sinister in the elongated shadows.

Remember, she stated very matter-of-factly, no hint of a grin this time, dont tell. Anybody.

She smiled again, and then skipped out the door.

I must have lay in a cold sweat for an hour. What do I do? How do I protect my daughter from  my daughter? I was afraid for her, afraid of her, afraid to stay in place, afraid to move. 

The mind can play amazing tricks on itself. I eventually convinced myself that this was unusual, sure, but nothing to be really worried about. Kids say the damnedest things, after all. 

I decided to check the freezer so that I could prove to myself that everything was in my head. I was simultaneously nervous, embarrassed, and ashamed of myself for needing proof that my daughter was not doing something sinister. How could I need reassurance?

And how could I gather the strength to open the freezer door by myself, in the dark?

I walked to the kitchen and positioned myself in front of it. I stood for a minute in the dark, deciding that the freezer light would be best in a dark kitchen, allowing it to illuminate every crevice and put my fears to rest. 

I rested my hand on the door, took a deep breath, and opened it.

Nothing but frozen peas. 

I actually laughed at myself, and rested my head in the open cavity as I chuckled. How could I have ever been nervous about this? I was a rare specimen.

Something hit my head and drizzled down my neck. I instinctively reached back and pulled it in front of my eyes. 

Just ice. 

I chuckled, rolled my eyes, and shut the door. 

I was slightly delirious with relief. How could I have been so worked up? I laughed. Eliza May isnt even tall enough to reach the freezer door! Thats why I keep her popsicles in there. Anything I expect her to reach

Is in the top-opening chest freezer we keep in the garage. 

I was halfway up the stairs when I decided that I had to check it. Not because I thought that there was something inside, but just so I could sleep. It was a mental trick that I would play on myself to put this all behind me. 

Besides, the first freezer had been easy enough. This one would be, too. 

I put on my slippers and quickly trotted into the brisk night air. I wanted to get this over with as soon as possible so that I could get back into my warm bed. 

I did turn on the light this time, because theres no illumination in the chest freezer. I regretted it, however; the garage light was a single bulb that hung from a twelve-foot ceiling. The only effect that it really had was to point out how many different hiding places existed in my chilly and underused garage. 

I shook it off an approached the freezer. It had a small knob that attached to a door, which could lift off the top entirely. 

I grabbed it and pulled. 

The frozen face inside was locked in terror. It was clear that he must have died in the throes of agony, carrying immense pain up until the very moment of death. 

His legs were contorted around him like an insect, a necessary adjustment to make him fit into the freezer. 

I stood motionless. I simply could not force myself to move. This predicament put me in the unfortunate position of absorbing every detail. 

Down to the oozing stump where his right hand should have been.

I rocked back and forth in the corner of the garage for an unknown time. I was mortified by the body, but to be perfectly honest, I was even more terrified of what was waiting for me back in the house. 

Ive gone over this issue in my head more times than I can count. The simple reality, Ive concluded, is that I have to leave the body there for now. Trying to move it will inevitably attract attention, and contacting the authorities will either get my precious daughter justifiably accused (less likely), or me unjustifiably in a world of trouble (much more probable).

So here I am, internet. Its daylight now, my daughter is humming to herself and coloring in the next room  acting completely normal - and I dont know what to do. 

Short of cannibalism, that is, which is rapidly seeming like the least crazy option.
