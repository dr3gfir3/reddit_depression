So the "better economic managers" in the LNP were conned by a "ragtag band of hippies, treehuggers and Marxists" into paying $100 million so they could keep about $15 million more than the Labor plan.

Of course he does have a bit of a Cassius lean and hungry look to him, but that's kind of fitting, all things considered.

In a stunning admission more than 12 months after Fairfax Media revealed concerns that the petroleum resource rent tax was being gamed by the biggest fossil fuel multinationals, Mr Morrison conceded on Wednesday: "We think it is a problem."


At a time when Australia's treasurer was forced to admit that the multinational companies he wants to cut tax for have been stealing billions of dollars from the Australian people, parliament and most of the media are bickering over backpacker taxes.

Recovering tax from multinationals will allow better services and infrastructure for all Australians. 

Recovering tax from backpackers will barely cover the cost of collecting it.

Of course Turnbull, Morrison, Cormann etc would rather have the crossbenchers and media chasing that fruit-picking red herring. That's what it's for, so they don't have to do anything.

Malcolm Turnbull has ducked a question from Bill Shorten about whether Attorney-General George Brandis could be offered a diplomatic or judicial post before the next election.

It's been rumoured the embattled attorney-general is in line to replace Alexander Downer as high commissioner to London.

	<TEXT> It's even more tragicomedic than you think. Hinch switched his vote because ScoMo pissed him off at Turnbull's weekend barbecue by admitting the LNP wouldn't compromise. 


I kid you not, that's what happened.


Mr Hinch switched his vote after a discussion with Treasurer Scott Morrison at the Prime Ministers Christmas BBQ on Sunday.

Mr Morrison had indicated the government would not agree to a 15 per cent compromise to break the stalemate before announcing it the next morning, leaving Mr Hinch furious.


The issue must be resolved by tomorrow, before parliament rises for the year, otherwise backpackers will be hit with a 32.5 per cent tax.

As a result, Hinch said the government should pass Labors 10.5 per cent proposal.

Hockey may be involved and potentially culpable, but chasing him is a distraction from the real problem.

As MaevaM says below, "It doesnt really matter what Hockey did", what matters is what Brandis et al are still doing.

Funnily enough, I expected Dutton to chime in with a red herring for the press to chase, and wasn't expecting Hockey to be the fall guy. For the LNP, it makes sense though. Hockey's already been exposed as a buffoon and shipped out of the local political battlefield. Adding another screw-up to his career list won't change anything for him or for the LNP. </TEXT>

CoastAdapt provides estimates of future sea-level rise out to 2050 and 2100 for four greenhouse gas concentration scenarios.

Predictions estimate by 2030 the sea level could have risen by 10cm, by 2050 it would have risen between 20 to 25cm and will continue to trend upward to 2100 and beyond.

In all of the scenarios, parts of Cullen Bay, Parap, Fannie Bay, Rapid Creek, Coconut Grove and Bayview go underwater.

The scenarios do not take into account wave height, storm surges or flooding.

WA Treasurer Mike Nahan had received personal and written assurances early last year from then Federal counterpart Joe Hockey that the Commonwealth would not oppose the State Governments move.

On the weekend of April 2-3, just two days before the High Court hearing, Mr Mischin repeatedly called Senator Brandis and Assistant Treasurer Kelly ODwyer to seek an agreement that would avert Commonwealth involvement in the case

Given the calls to Treasury and the AG, it seems highly unlikely that Abbott/Turnbull, as well as Cormann and Morrison were not also made aware of it. In fact, if they weren't, there should be an inquiry into why MPs are withholding vital information from the PM.

There's variants of the story in every country in the world, beginning in the 1870s, so not really Australian, but definitely a classic.

The fact that these stories are so universal tells us there's something about them that's close to the heart of humanity, some deep ties to melancholy and grief.

	<TEXT> I started out as a medical photographer, saw the writing on the wall with electronics making that field less populated. Worked for several years in mine surveying, until EDMs and data recorders started hitting the market. Caught the handheld computer wave when the original Palm Pilot came out, and made good money for a while developing and doing field data collection. Moved on when it was clear that field was saturated, and transitioned to developing videos and training, and sometimes consulting. 

Each change took a different mindset, but was not more difficult than the previous career. Some were very lucrative - at one stage I was measuring my income by seeing how early in the year I could earn the average Australian wage.

TLDR: Changing careers isn't something to be scared of.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, and Xiaomi grew to be the biggest-selling phone maker in China with around 2% margins, or as low as $3 per phone. 

By managing supply chain, long tails on their model ranges and keeping minimal inventory, they were able to sell hundreds of millions of very good phones at very low prices. 

They made it very clear that they were making money off the whole ecosystem they were building, and in fact call themselves a software company, not a phone maker.

Of course, Apple does a similar thing, charging fees for everything their users interact with, from the App Store to the headphones and dongles you'll need to use their products.

Having access to phones from both companies, I can categorically state that the Xiaomi phones are as or more capable than the far more costly iPhones. </TEXT>

Lower tax rates do not boost growth and jobs

Conservatives claim reducing the corporate tax rate will substantially grow the economy. But a cut in the statutory rate from 35% to 25% would increase economic output by less than two-tenths of one percent, according to CRS. Economic growth over the past 60 years has actually been stronger when corporate tax rates were higher, according to the Economic Policy Institute. U.S. corporate tax rates also are not hurting profits  before-tax and after-tax corporate profits as a percentage of national income are at postWorld War II highs.

There is no relationship between cutting corporate tax rates and job growth, according to a recent study by the Center for Effective Government. Twenty-two of the 30 profitable Fortune 500 companies that paid the highest tax rates (30% or more) from 2008 to 2010 created almost 200,000 jobs between 2008 and 2012. The 30 profitable corporations that paid little or no taxes over the three years collectively shed 51,289 jobs between 2008 and 2012.

Low corporate tax rates dont create jobs. According to The Corporate Tax Rate Debate, a new report by the Center for Effective Government, among the 30 firms with the lowest corporate tax rates between 2008 and 2010, half the firms created jobs and half shed jobs over the last five years.

Only two of the 30 firms paid taxes over the threeyear period, despite the fact that each of the firms was profitable in each of the three years and collectively reported $159 billion in U.S. profits. As a group, the lowtax corporations shed more than 51,000 since 2008.


Our results suggest that increases in corporate tax rates uniformly reduce employment and income while corporate tax cuts are ineffectual in boosting economic activity except when they are implemented during recessions, the study concludes. Tax cuts, on the other hand, are only effective in recessions, when they raise employment by around 0.6% and income from employment by around 1% for every percentage point cut in the tax rate.


According to a new study by the Congressional Research Service (non-partisan), there's no evidence that tax cuts spur growth.

In fact, although correlation is not causation, when you compare economic growth in periods with declining tax rates versus periods with high tax rates, there seems to be evidence that tax cuts might hurt growth.

Right now you can buy an ESP 8266 dev board for less than $5, write a Basic script in a web browser, and with a bit of breadboard wiring, have a kit that'll let you read sensors, switch lights, relays etc, 20 minutes after first powering the thing up.

That's the kind of wild west environment that lets innovation run rampant. Sure, it's ridiculously insecure, and products made with it shouldn't be used in anyplace where it matters, but security has to be iterative anyway.

Capitalism's supposed to work this way. Thousands of small disruptive startups propagate in a new field, but are gradually thinned down to a few high-quality survivors by the heat of free market selection.

Infrastructure opportunity knocked  Canberra wasn't home. Still isn't

The commonwealth government started this financial year able to borrow money for 10 years at about 1.8 per cent.


You could say a wonderful opportunity was missed to borrow very cheaply to invest in infrastructure that would pay for itself several times over.

That sort of borrowing is what financial advisors explain to retail-level customers as "good debt". It's the sort of debt our central bankers have tried to explain to the government as sound economic policy to help Australia realise its potential by improving productivity and our quality of life, paying fat economic dividends for years to come.

	<TEXT> This is in the media today:

An asylum seeker named Amin Afravi had been bashed by two guards on Manus Island on Friday night, she reported, after they found him trying to hang himself. "The bashing was accompanied by racial abuse," she added. "He now has broken ribs and has difficulty breathing."


Mr Afravi, 28, is a case in point. His throat was cut the day before Mr Barati was slain and he says he still suffers nerve damage from the injury that makes it hard to breathe, and a host of other physical conditions.

Mr Afravi suffered minor burns to his face after he tried to self-immolate about five weeks ago.

His trauma is greater because he says the Australian security guard who witnessed his throat being slashed, and would have been prepared to identify the culprit, was transferred from the centre after the attack, beaten by local guards and returned to Australia.

Broadspectrum said any questions should be directed to the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. A department spokesman said a "minor incident" was being investigated and no injuries had been reported.

	<TEXT> Australian workplace Health and Safety has always been based a tripartite system of workers, employers and government holding each other accountable. The ABCC weakens the ability of the workers HSRs (union Health and Safety Reps) to influence the other two parties.

Under the Howard-era ABCC, workplace fatalities in the construction sector rose from just over three per 100,000 workers to nearly five per 100,000 workers before falling again to around four. After the neutering of the ABCC, the fatality rate fell to just over two. Getting rid of the ABCC coincided with a significant fall in the number of workers being killed on building sites."

In essence, without a strong third party to stand up to bad governments and bad employers, people get killed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, they believe in supply-side economics, Reaganomics, Thatcherism, etc instead. 

Money flows up faster than it does down. Each dollar of corporate tax cuts returns 50 cents to revenue, so, over the long-term, the revenue lost by tax cuts will be only partially regained. Without a decrease in spending, tax cuts lead to an increase in the budget deficit. That harms the economy over time, and leads to flat wages and job losses.
