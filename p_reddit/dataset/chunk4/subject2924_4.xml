	<TEXT> Martin Luther King Jr because he fought for fundamental equality using the most powerful weapon immaginable - words.

John F. Kennedy because he made great achievements for the US and he stood for honesty and integrity.

Abraham Lincoln because he freed the slaves and tried his best to bring unity. He also claimed to never tell a lie, and I would like to assume this is true.

My grandfather because even though he had countless disabilities and setbacks in life, he never once complained and he loved living.

And Martin Scorsese because I too aspire to be a filmmaker, and he's one of the best ones out there. </TEXT>
