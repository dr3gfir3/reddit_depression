Check with [coveragemapper](http://coveragemapper.com/map.php?mccmnc=302490). They claim unlimited but throttle you sharply when you hit 5GB. Still much better than the others.

2) Yes, traffic shaping is a harsh reality. Go with [Novus](http://novusnow.ca) if you can, otherwise a Shaw reseller like [Teksavvy](http://teksavvy.com) or [Lightspeed](http://www.lightspeed.ca), although they both seem to be affected by Shaw's upstream shaping. If the latter, save yourself some money by picking up a second-hand cable modem from [FreeGeek](http://freegeekvancouver.org) for about $15 rather than renting (rip-off) or buying new.

3). I'm self-employed in the tech sector and there still seems to be no shortage of work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep hearing that $10k is the amount that triggers closer scrutiny of your actions. That said you don't want to be seen splitting large amounts into smaller transactions as a way of avoiding hitting $10k either as that is illegal.

The upshot is to stay small and keep in mind that moving completely out of fiat and into crypto is the endgame here. </TEXT>

If I'm not happy with that one I will increase it one more stop. The only other factor is holding the phone very steady while it takes all the shots that will be used for your final image. If you're shooting people ask them to hold still too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fairly disappointing first visit. [This is what the BC listings page looks like](http://imgur.com/lRvHU5q) for me. Then of the only two links I followed one gave me a DNS error (Sam's Bullion) and the other (Yuhko Sports) instilled no confidence whatsoever.

I suggest 2 things: one get a designer involved in your site to prevent it from looking like it was cobbled together from clip-art icons barfed onto a generic web template. The second is to check and curate the links and services in your directory. It just makes you look really lame when the first link I follow is dead.

I know this is a bit harsh but you really need to up your game! </TEXT>

That combined with today's announcement of interest being paid on deposits I HIGHLY recommend that you reconsider using vircurex.com.

This behaviour is highly consistent with the final grab before wrapping up and absconding with the funds.

It's too bad because it has been an upstanding service up until this point.
