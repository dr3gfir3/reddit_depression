	<TEXT> Right there with you, about the same amount of time Ive been sober. Never taken meth, but I smoked pot, taken some shrooms and 25i for a while, drank, even smoked that legal shit. I know exactly what the paranoia feeling is like and having psychosis. I had a thing and still do to a degree where I see pictures and have these delusions they are communicating specifically to me in a strange way. Eating raw vegetables not only helps a lot of health problems but its also cheaper, that, plus some motivation from Jesus Christ helped me. Getting in a good mind frame and just refusing to go out without giving this life we have been given some kind of real effort. 
I know people can have their opinions on Pot and all, but even that caused me problems, I had been a long time smoker on and off, even when I didn't do other stuff it was always a battle and a lifestyle that led to negative behavior. 

If you want to get better and be better, you MUST stay away from intoxication of any kind. Maybe get a gym membership, read the daily bible verses the bible app posts everyday, pray....and just show up and work somewhere. Gotta keep the mind busy. 
It is also really important you look into Christ and believe that he died selflessly for man, as an example of our sin, as an example to men. 
All other philosophies give insight, but the biblical one gives REAL results.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats a rich persons way of saying don't tax our end, lets tax it on the end closer to the consumer. We work, our checks get taxes taken out, we buy a product, taxes get taken out, we drive on the road we have to buy a tag, we use a cellphone and have to pay FCC charges. Hell you cant even buy something used and not have to pay tax again on that same item thats been bought and taxed already. 
If companies are making all these massive profits, and consumers are living paycheck to paycheck, does it not make sense that taxes are coming from the wrong end?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I was curious about these leaks, not because I thought they were nudes, but wondering what was so crazy other than the fact they got stolen. So in my search to see what the big deal was, there was a pic that shows what appears to be Emma taking a bath, taking a selfie that shows her nipples. Her face is cut off above the mouth and she is sticking her tongue  out. Looks a lot like her, if it is her, to answer your question, her nipples are of perfect proportion.  </TEXT>
