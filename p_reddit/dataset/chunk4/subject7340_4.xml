	<TEXT> Actual good acting, 

real comic relief, 

3 dimensional characters, 

the mystery element as in the characters could be 
hanging out with a killer the whole movie and no one would be any the wiser, which is scary,

Smarter premise and dialogue

Likeable characters

Comical Self awareness

Stylisation of the characters and situation

It's well written and has an actual good story  </TEXT>
