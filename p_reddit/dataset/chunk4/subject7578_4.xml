	<TEXT> His book, [The Rocks Don't lie](http://www.amazon.ca/The-Rocks-Dont-Lie-Investigates/dp/0393346242) was a very enjoyable read. During my time in Min-Ex, I've also come across a number of flood mythologies that are linked to rather localized geological events. When working around Pemberton / Lillooet Lake I was told of the Lil'wat First Nation's flood that resembled the biblical deluge; whereby, a canoe rests atop one of the mountains (much like in the story of Noah, the epic of Gilgamesh, and earlier editions). Notably nearby; however, lies a volcanic [Mount Meager volcanic massif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Meager) and the infamous [Keyhole Falls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Falls), the formation of which coincides with the Lil'wat flood mythology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Climate change explains more than you're permitting. Certainly the spread of humans didn't help; however, there are large holes in the theory that humans were the primary driver behind megafaunal extinctions in North America. As Gary Haynes states in his lecture (which I recommend to you, titled, "Late Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions" and can be found on youtube), of the clovis sites that date to the same age ~13ka there exists 28 out of the known 180 that contain Mammoth, Mastadon and spear points. Everything else, it is extremely rare and difficult to find any evidence that humans had anything to do with killing the animal. As he further notes, the evidence in some of the 28 sites isn't that strong and the more widely accepted figure is 14 sites out of the 180 known Clovis sites. Keep in mind that 35 genera went extinct... a major problem for the human theory to explain. And while Mammoths and Mastadons were killed, it was far more likely that climate change was the primary causal agent - this is well established and supported by a change in their food supply (yes, thanks to climate change), as was released in the following Nature study, "Fifty thousand years of Arctic vegetation and megafaunal diet" but is nicely summarized [here](http://www.cbc.ca/news/technology/woolly-mammoth-diet-mystery-solved-by-dna-analysis-1.2524015). Note the following: 

"Most of the evidence we've been able to see is these large mammals disappear almost at the same time these vegetation changes were taking place," Froese said.

Also note that if there were persons in North America prior to Clovis then they were living next to those animals and *not* wiping them out.

I'm honestly somewhat shocked that you would state the following:
There have been many cycles of glaciation and none had extinctions nearly as severe as the most recent.

Knowing full well that not every glaciation was the same, nor were the conditions surrounding each one identical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm unaware of how animal behavior responds to geomagnetic reversals; however, I may be able provide at least some insight into the reversals themselves. Firstly though, keep in mind that Earth's magnetic field, its polarity, is not stationary and [moves all the time](http://maps.ngdc.noaa.gov/viewers/historical_declination/) (you can see this in motion if you search for "Magnetic Poles   Declination 1790 - 2020 Mercator Projection - Historical"). Currently, the pole is migrating northward about 64 kilometers (40 miles) per year (does this effect animal behavior?). Most importantly, however, is the wide acceptance that geomagnetic reversals don't occur instantaneously but typically on time scales upwards of several hundred years to thousands of years and are not 'clean' reversals. There have also been [numerous reversals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Geomagnetic_polarity_0-169_Ma.svg) throughout Earth's geologic past. 

Given the rate at which reversals occur it seems unlikely that they would have any detrimental effects on animal behavior. I would find it interesting to pair species distributions in the fossil record with times of geomagnetic reversals to see if any perturbations could be discerned. I haven't read the paper yet, but it would also be interesting to see what effects magnetic storms, and other magnetic anomalies (magnetite rich soils, etc.) may have had on the worms.

EDIT: To further clarify the point regarding the rate of reversals and the effects on animal migration (those most likely to rely on Earth's magnetic fields) it seems highly improbable that there should be any observable difference for a number of reasons. Firstly, magnetic reversals occur on the time scales over many thousands of years, whereby the field reverses and begins to strengthen again. Secondly, animal life spans must be considered and compared to the rate of magnetic field reversals. Given that animal life spans are typically quite short in comparison, (the Arctic Tern is a long lived bird with an average lifespan of approx. 30 years) this implies that magnetic reversals would have no effect as the location is passed from generation to generation, given ample time to adapt to miniscule changes over their life time. Thirdly, while animals use magnetoception to assist them, this is by no means their only use for navigation as they will also incorporate other senses, such as visual cues and other magnetic anomalies (not to be confused with a weakening magnetic field).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The block belongs to numerous others positioned along the breakwater at Ogden Point in Victoria, BC. The vast majority of blocks are granodiorite in composition; however, a small number (~5?) are granite, with [abundant k-spar megacrysts](http://i.imgur.com/rLlkuml.jpg). Being that this granite clearly isn't in situ it makes it somewhat difficult to pin point its origin; however, I was able to locate some information that may provides at least some further insight:

___
Site Description: Victoria Breakwater (1916) Ogden Point off Dallas Road

___
*History*: The contract for the building of the Victoria breakwater called for 1.25 million cubic feet of dimension stone, consisting of large, roughly squared blocks of up to 20 tons in weight. This estimate actually fell short of the amount of stone needed, for by the end of May 1916, 1.5 million cubic feet had been delivered and the wall was not completed until the end of that year. 

*Building Stone*: The breakwaters constructed in both Victoria and Vancouver contain granite [granodiorite] from quarries on the southwest shore of [Hardy Island](http://i.imgur.com/Pmsfx3r.png). This stone contains a fair number of black knots which range up to 30 centimetres in diameter. This precluded its use as a decorative facing stone or as monumental stone but it has proven suitable for less ornamental uses as it is easily quarried in large blocks. The Victoria breakwater also incorporates basalt, quarried as rough rock and crushed stone, from Albert Head on lower Vancouver Island.

From [Dimension Stone in Victoria, BC](http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/Mining/Geoscience/EducationalResources/Documents/IC1994_15.pdf) (pdf)

Note: Some of the blocks have been replaced since the initial construction and may be from other quarries.

	<TEXT> it has to do with exposure time, and it's why there are no stars in [lunar photographs as well](http://markhumphrys.com/Bitmaps/apollo.3.jpg). Because light is reflecting off of the surface of Ceres, you need a relatively short timed exposure - otherwise it would be over exposed and you wouldn't see anything but a lot of white. Such short exposure times; however, aren't long enough to capture the light from the distant stars, so they remain under exposed.

This example also shows you why, in order to capture those great shots of [the Milky Way](https://deepuniversetruth.files.wordpress.com/2014/09/wpid-milky-way-26711-1920x1080.jpg), you need, or prefer, no light pollution (ie. pitch black). Again, as before, this allows you to take longer timed exposures - collecting all that faint light from distant stars and having it picked up by the camera's sensor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that seems to be the best option with so many different takes on anything tighter than a full choke. 

Do you know if there is any concern for the potential to reduce the lifespan / condition of the barrel? I've read that on a number of posts elsewhere and mentioned, for example:

ANACONDA CS is able to reduce the pressure build that may be detrimental to the life of a shotgun. - [Patternmaster](https://www.patternmaster.com/about/)

Though this is the first I've read it from a manufactures website. Others, make [quite tight](http://www.shop.gameacc.net/Mossberg-835-935-696-Buckshot-Choke-MOSSH12696.htm) chokes with no mention of it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Deer Hunting with 00 Buck   choke sizing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-04 22:30:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, 

I'll be hunting deer once the season starts and have chosen to use 00 Buck (I have a Mossberg 835 Ulti Mag so it doesn't take slugs)... regulations state a min. of no.1 or greater. 

I'd like to increase the effective distance of the shot and tighten up the pattern. I've seen numerous turkey chokes, Primos Jellyhead, Pure Gold, TruGlo Bone Collector Smackdown... but I'm conflicted. I've seen many people saying that turkey chokes, or anything beyond full choke is too tight for 00 but on the other hand I've also seen what look to be amazing results using 00 in the [Bone Collector Smackdown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlP1km2XHfc).

Does anyone have any experience / suggestions for selecting an appropriate choke tube? 

Cheers

EDIT: While I appreciate the recommendations to use slugs, it is not permitted in the area in which I will be hunting. Because of this I would also appreciate if suggestions were made based on the information and question in which I had initially asked (deer - 00 buckshot - choke tubes) rather than ignoring it almost entirely (slugs). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Much of geology has its roots in religion. It was typical of clergy men to address how the world could fit alongside the teachings of the bible; however, modern Young Earth Creationism didn't truly come unto its own until the major discovery that lead to the formation of two distinct groups. Prior to this the church and geology walked hand-in-hand per say. For example, Neptunism (late 18th century), was a theory that all rocks had precipitated out of a single enormous flood - thus explaining the rocks while holding to the account of Noah's flood. However, with [James Hutton](http://www.amnh.org/education/resources/rfl/web/essaybooks/earth/p_hutton.html)'s discovery at Siccar Point, came the birth of two distinct camps - one, a group of men who held to what the rocks were telling them about the age of the Earth (modern geologists) and the other, a group of men who refused to accept that the Earth was older than what the church would have them believe - this was the birth of Young Earth Creationism as its own distinct camp. This event was so important, the distinction so clear, that it would eventually lead to one the greatest debates in the history of geology, a debate that would last ~40 years until finally it was accepted by the masses in 1970 (see [Channeled Scablands](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Channeled_Scablands)).

Hutton's 1788 paper concludes; "The result, therefore, of our present enquiry is, that we find no vestige of a beginning,no prospect of an end."

	<TEXT> It should be noted that there are multiple mechanisms behind the formation of glacial ice caves. While a warming climate is certainly one of those mechanisms, others exist such as geothermal heating from volcanic vents and hotsprings. Under a stable climate regime, melting will typically occur on the surface under changing seasonal conditions whereby moulins can carry the water to englacial or subglacial regions - here the transfer of heat to the glacier from the meltwater can expand the cave, further airflow and instabilities can expand the cave(s). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends on the object, and the degree of diagenesis. Widely / generally speaking, diagenetic modification is more likely to play a role in organic matter compared to lithic material (depending, again on the original composition and the degree of diagenesis). If the *[blocking temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_temperature)* was achieved at some point then the dates will be off - though the data may still prove useful for other applications. In the case of organics the following is from 'Isotopes in Paleoenvironmental Research Vol.10' to serve as an example (Isotopes in Bones and Teeth):

Tooth behaves more or less similarly to bone, but enamel, as already mentioned, is a much more stable and less porous form of bioapatite, and is the material of choice for phosphate and carbonate studies (as well as for trace elements, including, for example, Sr isotopes). Nevertheless, even enamel cannot be entirely relied upon (Lee Thorpe and Sponheimer 2003). ... In the end any particular sample set has to be considered and tested on its own merits, and it is necessary to justify that diagenetic alteration has not corrupted the isotope ratios. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As others have mentioned, you can date the stratigraphic units in which the object is buried within (with fossils - relative dating, or with ash beds or other units - absolute dating). However, you can also date the object itself. Using typical radiometric dating techniques would not prove useful as you would be dating the age the minerals within the rock and not the age of the tool. You could, however, use optical dating techniques such as [thermoluminescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermoluminescence_dating) (TL) and [optically stimulated luminescence](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optically_stimulated_luminescence) (OSL). These techniques basically date the last time in which the object was exposed to the sun, or to put it another way - the date when the object was buried. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it could easily be the result of some kind of impact or stress.

This is most certainly a structural feature, so it has little to do with properties derived from the rock formation itself (and certainly nothing to do with mineral properties) but far more to do with the local stress regime. Though somewhat uncommon (symmetrical) it could be a stylolite infilled with hydrous calcium sulphate (gypsum). Here is one from [Banff](http://i.imgur.com/K20DjFF.jpg), and one in [Namibia](http://imgur.com/WPiohqA). Though some even question if those are actually stylolites.

Canada was covered by vast ~~subglacial~~ **proglacial** lakes.

For [example](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v464/n7289/images/nature08954-f1.2.jpg)

Those parts are ~~thousands~~ **hundreds of** meters thick *at most* with ~~clay~~ **glacial drift, and till**. 

An excerpt (Manitoba):

The bedrock surface throughout most of Manitoba is covered by overburden of varying thickness consisting mainly of glacial tills, proglacial lacustrine sediments and shallow marine deposits. The thickest overburden is found in the Manitoba Upland where bedrock is typically covered by 20 to 40 m of glacial till, outwash, and lacustrine deposits; however thicknesses in this area range from less than 10 m northeast of Turtle Mountain to more than 120 m in some bedrock channels and 250 m in the Duck Mountain area.

	<TEXT> It's a theory, but a good theory based on some simple physics. I'll try to re-hash some old notes to help explain it:

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles. However, the MF is not due to permanent magnetism since the Earth's interior is far too hot (600C) to retain magnetization, therefore, it must be induced by electric current flow.

######Source of MF:

The MF is believed to be generated by thermally-driven convection currents in the fluid outer-core (electrically conductive molten iron) producing [a self-exciting dynamo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamo_theory), with axial symmetry imposed by Earth's rotation. The study of which is called [Magnetohydrodynamics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetohydrodynamics#Geophysics) (combining electricity, magnetism, fluid dynamics, and heat flow). Mechanical models of self-exciting magnetic dynamos can be built as an analogy of Earth's MF.

######Faraday Disc:

(1) Consider a conducting disc rotating in an external MF. Negative charges accumulate at the rim, and positive charges accumulate at the axis due to the [Lorenz Force](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_force). ([see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/7aRrhO6.png))

(2) The disc is connected to the axis with a conductive wire that allows current to flow (direction is that of positive charges by convention). The current flow in the loop induces a MF given by the right-hand-rule (RHR - point your thumb of your right hand along the current flow, when you curl your fingers it will be in the direction of induced MF). The current flow induced by the external MF induces a secondary MF in the same direction as the external MF, reinforcing the MF, inducing more current (positive feedback - [see illustration](http://i.imgur.com/K3oElCE.jpg)). A small transient MF can be amplified and lead to a self-sustaining MF, with the energy coming from rotation.

	<TEXT> The 'jets' on Enceladus were recently shown to be explained away as an optical illusion, however, they are now thought to be eruptions that have a more continues shape [like a curtain](http://www.nasa.gov/jpl/cassini/saturn-moons-activity-could-be-curtain-eruptions), rather than discrete jets. 

 the ocean's high pH is caused by a "metamorphic, underwater geochemical process called serpentinization."

A bit picky here but the rocks are 'altered' during the process of serpentinization rather than metamorphosed, ie. alteration vs. metamorphism. 

A oceanic location that demonstrates the process above is the [Lost City Hydrothermal Field](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_City_Hydrothermal_Field). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the lay person it may be confusing, but for persons who actually study and care to understand the underlying physical parameters it is night and day. The processes that govern the morphology of these structures will be different if their morphology is different. Therefore, noting that these phantom jets (as NASA states) are an optical illusion of the curtain eruptions is a critical distinction to make. What you propose is akin to calling all (or most) volcanic eruption styles the same thing, which certainly would lead to erroneous interpretations of what is actually driving the eruptions.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title is fine, and is why "Jets" is emphasized. While the curtain eruptions remain, the individual jets are likely an optical illusion. It's an important distinction that needs to be recognized as the underlying conditions will differ from between jets and curtains. In that sense, the jets are completely absent because they don't really exist, and are a result of an optical illusion from the curtain eruptions. Moreover, one should never come to a conclusion based on the title alone - always read the article, and if questions remain, read the actual study to help clear up any misconceptions or misunderstandings.   </TEXT>

In Nature Comments, Geodynamics: Double dip, Magali Billen notes that "*There are other known mechanisms that can lead to rapid changes in plate motion. For example, an upwelling plume head can accelerate mantle flow and an increase in slab density during initial subduction of a plate through the mantle transition zone can accelerate slab descent. However, these mechanisms lead to short-lived, one- to two-million-year pulses of accelerated plate motion. In contrast, the mechanism of double subduction can generate sustained, 20-million-year-long intervals of rapid plate motion, similar to that recorded for the Indian Plate during the late Cretaceous*". 

It's interesting work and will be interesting to see how it applies to modern double subduction zones, if at all, as well as its implications for paleo double subduction zones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Meaning, a 6 is 10 times more intense than a 5...

Intensity is measured using [The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale) where as the  Richter Scale (used when applicable, on smaller earthquakes and the [moment magnitude scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) (Mw) on larger earthquakes) is base 10 logarithmic scale and measures how much seismic energy is released. Each magnitude releases ~33 times more energy than the last. That is a M2.0 is 33 times more 'powerful' than a M1.0, a M3.0 is 1089 times more 'powerful' than a M1.0, a M4.0 is 35,937 times more 'powerful' than a M1.0, and so on up the scale.

The degree of damage depends on the moment magnitude, depth to hypocenter (focus), distance to epicenter, the local geology (which may dampen or amplify seismic waves), and the structural stability of buildings in the region.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not *my* lava creek ash, it's simply the lava creek ash. I never said it made it anywhere except to demonstrate deposits West of the Yellowstone caldera. The wiki image, though certainly credible, is problematic as it doesn't show deposit thickness. The one I shared appears to be a simplified version released by the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](http://www.news.wisc.edu/newsphotos/quartzvolcano.html) and may be showing trace amounts, or could be entirely incorrect as well.  For example, this image released by the USGS states the following: *Map of the known ash-fall boundaries for major eruptions from Long Valley Caldera, [Mount St. Helens](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/vsc/images/image_mngr/300-399/img316.jpg) and Yellowstone* but we know Mt. St. Helens ash deposits were far more wide spread than depicted, easily reaching into [Canada](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7c/1980_Mount_st_helens_ash_distribution.svg). The problem is that they did not include bed thicknesses. Note that many figures often tend to have discrepancies and it's best to resort to actual papers. Under that premise, I suggest you read the paper I shared. It quite clearly demonstrates how incorrect your statement is.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> QUESTION: Can you release some of the pressure at Yellowstone by drilling into the volcano? 

ANSWER: No. Scientists agree that drilling into a volcano would be of questionable usefulness. Notwithstanding the enormous expense and technological difficulties in drilling through hot, mushy rock, drilling is unlikely to have much effect. At near magmatic temperatures and pressures, any hole would rapidly become sealed by minerals crystallizing from the natural fluids that are present at those depths.

	<TEXT> It's a complex question but broadly speaking no (that is the difference between great EQs and moderate EQs can easily be said to be no). The differences between the overall [moment magnitude](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) is so large that smaller EQs essentially have a negligible effect on the strain that much larger EQs undergo. Typically stated, the difference between magnitudes is by a factor of ~33x. So Mw2.0 is ~33x more powerful than Mw1.0, and a Mw3.0 is 1089 times as powerful as a Mw1.0 and so on, up the scale. For clarity, the greater the difference between Mw the less likely it is that smaller EQs will have any effect in reducing the chances of a larger EQ occurring.

	<TEXT> Geochemical differences aren't as problematic to the Giant Impactor models as one may be lead to believe. Certainly, there are a number of geochemical similarities, and expected differences (the depletion of [zinc relative to earth](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v490/n7420/full/nature11507.html) for example); however, the proportion of LILEs and in this case Ti, [a HFSE](http://i.imgur.com/ECoQGPQ.png) need not lead to the demise of the hypothesis but rather a reinterpretation favouring a specific percentage of material derived from Theia within an acceptable range. This isn't to say that the Giant Impact hypothesis isn't without some areas of difficulty; however, it is by far the most widely accepted theory because it can explain the *majority* of differences and similarities, as well as the angle of inclination, angular momentum, etc. In other words, though each model has areas which are problematic, the Giant Impact hypothesis has the fewest number of problems which require resolving.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ######Lunar Fission Models:

Fission models involve the separation of the Moon from the Earth during an early stage of rapid spinning when tidal forces overcame gravitational forces. One version of the fission hypothesis (Wise, 1963) suggests that the formation of the Earths core reduced the amount of inertia, increasing the rotational rate and spinning off material to form the Moon. Such a model is attractive in that it accounts for the similarity in density between the Earths mantle and the Moon and for the absence of a large metallic lunar core. The hypothesis is also consistent with the Moons revolution in the same direction as the Earth rotates, the circular shape of the lunar orbit, the existence of a lunar bulge facing the Earth, and the similar oxygen isotopic ratios of the two bodies. The model also explains the iron-poor character of the Moon if fission occurred after core formation in the Earth, because the Moon would be formed largely from the Earths mantle. 

Fission models, however, face several major obstacles. For instance, they do not explain the inclination of the lunar orbit, and they require more than four times the total angular momentum available in the present EarthMoon system. If the EarthMoon system ever had this excess angular momentum, no acceptable mechanism has been pro-posed to lose it (Wood, 1986). Also, lunar igneous rocks are more depleted in siderophile
and volatile elements than terrestrial igneous rocks, indicating that the lunar interior is not similar in composition to the Earths mantle. Although some investigators favor a fission model (Binden, 1986), the preceding problems seem to render the model highly implausible.

The Giant Impactor models, on the other hand, are capable of accommodating more of the constraints related to lunar origin than any of the
competing models. What exactly is it about the Lunar soils that you *believe* are capable "killing" the Giant Impact Theory, keeping the aforementioned with regard to Lunar Fission models in mind? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Glaciomarine clays](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quick_clay) are a real concern, and remain beneath overburden due to the characteristics of their formation. This means you typically won't see them in surface exposures and would have to do core sampling to know where they are... a major concern for any proposed oil pipeline such as Enbridge's Northern Gateway Pipeline (and something to which I am unaware as to the extent to which Enbridge has drilled along their proposed corridor - though they have done aerial surveys - which I pointed out already, are essentially useless for detecting glaciomarine clays).

These landslides serve to illustrate the terrain instability along the pipeline corridor

from 
mountaintop to valley bottom. Landslides have damaged pipelines in west central B.C. Long 
runout landslides have traveled many kilometres from the initiation zone; therefore, the 
potential for damage to pipelines extends to unstable terrain and landslides that start well 
outside the construction corridor. Flow slides in glaciomarine muds have consumed pipelines 
located in depletion zones; therefore, pipeline locations must avoid potential depletion zones. 
Periods of increasing precipitation and temperature are associated with recent large landslides 
in west central B.C. Climate change scenarios project a warmer and wetter climate; therefore, 
the likelihood of landslide-mass erosion events affecting a pipeline or other linear structures 
will increase with a probable increase in landslide occurrence.  - ([PDF](https://www.ceaa-acee.gc.ca/050/documents/55592/55592E.pdf))   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To clear some misinformation up:
since the reaction would be so far underground - and the ore no where near weapons grade - it would be self limiting and go largely unnoticed by observers on the surface.

Natural reactors need not be deep within the Earth's crust, and could have existed at the surface as was demonstrated by Coogan   Cullen:

The rise of free oxygen in Earths atmosphere resulted from the proliferation of the photosynthetic cyanobacteria. 
Fossil and molecular biomarker data from the geologic record date the origin of the cyanobacteria to 2.7 Gyr if not earlier. Evidence suggests the transition from an initial, virtually anoxic atmosphere to one with persistent free oxygen occurred as late as 2.4 Gyr ago leaving a significant lag between the emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis and the irreversible oxidation of the Earths surface. Explanations for this delay commonly suggest secular changes in the balance between the fluxes of oxygen and reducing equivalents to the atmosphere coincident with the ~2.4 Gyr transition. Models include timely increases in the burial of organic matter, a decline in the content of reducing equivalents in volcanic and metamorphic source gases and progressive methane mediated hydrogen escape. Here we present calculations supporting the idea that due to its redox sensitivity, uranium deposits should have 
formed in the isolated marine or freshwater environments where oxygenic photosynthetic organisms first took hold and established strong local reduction-oxidation gradients. **[These are predicted to have formed near-surface critical natural fission reactors](http://i.imgur.com/KNveHej.jpg)**... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not entirely. The Giant Impact hypothesis suggests that while the Earth was forming, another body was forming (known as Theia) in a [Lagrangian point](http://i.imgur.com/e9h5bsl.png). It grew to roughly the size of Mars before being perturbed and eventually colliding with the Earth. The moon was subsequently formed from the debris of the impact, which has been estimated to be upwards of 70% of the mantle of Theia, while the Earth took on the iron rich core of Theia, leaving the moon depleted, relative to Earth, in iron (and explains other geochemical features).

It's important to make the distinction because there are other lunar formation models that would claim that the moon was in fact, initially part of the Earth... as in, 100% derived [from the Earth](http://i.imgur.com/9pL2up3.jpg). </TEXT>

A better analogy may be in a comparison to sea-ice, rather than relating the processes to glacial ice. Perhaps, yet, it may provide better clarity if we attempt to understand the ice on Enceladus in a similar manner as to how plate tectonics work on Earth (for [example](http://www.astrobio.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/14-241-0.jpg)) rather than sea-ice or glacial ice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stagnant / stagnated ice is a term that denotes that the ice isn't moving. In glaciology, for example, there are many types of landforms and geomorphological features that are generated by the stagnantion of ice, or more specifically, glacial ice. If, for example, the temperature were to rise quickly enough and by a large enough degree the glacial ice would stop accumulating and flowing, in other words it would stagnate. When this occurs, everything melts out of the ice as it just sits there, stagnated, and melts. Typical terrains (landscapes) associated with such a process are known as kame-and-kettle terrain / topography.   

Edit: For clarity, 'stagnate ice' is *not* a term (as far as I am aware of), and the useage by /u/SMlTH I believe is ... incorrectly applied as I don't believe the ice in the crater is melting *in situ*.

The end Permian event has been attributed to the out pouring of flood basalts known as [the Siberian Traps](http://academic.emporia.edu/aberjame/student/kaczor1/rk_files/image006.jpg) reaching a combined total thickness of ~6.5km. This volcanism persisted for roughly 1 million years (and would have looked similar to Iceland's [Holuhraun eruption](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o_kfZhZxpxA). Io's eruptions, this one in particular, only persisted for less than 1 year and the reason it appears so large is due to the quick quenching of volcanic material into tiny particulate that can be dispersed over large regions thanks to Io's low mass, and therefore relatively low gravity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> humans can detect with orders of magnitude more precision...

Though I remain skeptical of their interpretation, in order to have a data set you have to have instruments that are not only sensitive enough to detect w/e it is you're looking for, but you also need to have instruments looking. In this particular case the mechanism appears to be similar to that which has been studied for earthquake lights. Under deformation, rocks will essentially act as batteries (see: [Pre-earthquake signals  Part I: Deviatoric stresses turn rocks into a
source of electric currents](http://www.nat-hazards-earth-syst-sci.net/7/535/2007/nhess-7-535-2007.pdf) (pdf)). These charges accumulate on the surface and when dissipated they react with the atmosphere (in the case of earthquake lights). 

The most important conclusion to be draw from this series of experiments is that, when rocks such as granite or gabbro are subjected to deviatoric stress, they behave as if they were batteries. When stresses are applied, electronic charge carri-rs are activated, both electrons and pholes. In other words, the application of stress charges the battery.

I'm not saying that these are what the animals are sensing, but I am saying it may be analogous, and if so, there is no way yet to detect this in the field prior to the event.    </TEXT>

No, that's not *really* the case. 

Jupiter and the other Outer Planets might attract some of the asteroids and comets that would otherwise threaten the Inner Planets, which provides a bit of stability for Earth to allow life to develop.

Again, its akin to an old wives tale that refuses to die. Ever hear of the [Late Heavy Bombardment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UIKmSQqp8wY)? The best suggestion to it's cause was due to [the migration of the giant planets](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v435/n7041/abs/nature03676.html) during the early solar system. Furthermore, Jupiter sends more material towards Earth than it shields us from:

	<TEXT> is theorised by some to have created the Deccan traps in India thanks to the shockwaves produced by the impact coming together on the other side of the planet and breaking the crust apart.

Terminology for such a point is known as the *antipode* or the antipodal location. There has been no supportive evidence for the hypothesis. Also note that the Deccan Traps occurred in 3 phases, beginning [well before](http://massextinction.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/deccan_0205_science.png) the impact event.

Obviously without knowing the age of these impacts it's hard to say, but I'm curious.

The age of the impact is suspected to to be older than ~300Ma (million years ago):
Its a mystery  we cant find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300m years. - [source](http://www.theguardian.com/science/2015/mar/24/evidence-of-largest-asteroid-impact-zone-on-earth-found-in-australian-outback) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going to leave your analysis of the analogy alone (even though I don't consider it a correct assessment), because I sense a deeper misunderstanding, at least that's what I've interpreted. 

...why I don't understand your reluctance. 

My reluctance comes from the following. It would be inccorect for me to fully accept your claim, because your claim was based on false pretenses. My point was not that plate tectonics is not a form of tectonism, but rather that the processes that drive plate tectonics are not the processes that drive tectonism. What I said, is that they are entirely different processes, a factually true statement. You said that was incorrect (which is false). You then stated that "plate tectonics is a type of tectonics." The problem is that I never disputed that point. I'll try another analogy:

Electricity is a type of energy. Coal fired plants are entirely different than nuclear plants. While both plants produce electricity (energy) they are entirely different processes. 

...but I don't think from my reading that this is true either. Aren't tectonics concerned with geological activity?

This is the area in which I wish to focus, because it implies that you either don't have a good grasp of geological terminology (which may be leading to the confusion above, and I don't blame you) or that you simply aren't aware of how geologically active our solar system is. I'll leave you to show yourself most of the research, but I'll give you a few examples. For one, our [Moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68LOZvQTjB0) is likely still geologically active, and is tectonically active. Jupiters' moon, [Io](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAejrPirGxI), is the most volcanic body in the solar system, has no plate tectonics (because there's no water) and has mountains generated from tectonic activity. The many moons of Saturn, are too a large degree, geologically and tectonically active. Typically stated, tectonics need not rely on a geologically active interior though there is a fine line in this statement and is why I opted to say 'typically stated.' I apologize if this isn't entirely clear, it's early in the morning now and I'm quite tired. If you have more questions, perhaps I can clear them, and my own statements, up later. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suspect both are concretions, though I am certain the lower one is certainly a concretion. Port Hardy region?

*Nodules (also called concretions) are localized
patches that show differential cementation
from that of the host sediment. They may
form at any time after deposition during
burial, but are mainly early diagenetic in
origin. The formation of pre- and postcompaction
nodules is illustrated in [Fig.3.25.](http://i.imgur.com/he38cAC.jpg)
They may be randomly dispersed, concentrated
along particular horizons (especially
bedding planes), or nucleated around local
inhomogeneities (e.g. fossils, roots, burrows,
and so on). Their size varies from a few mm to
several metres in diameter, and shape from
spherical to elongate to highly irregular.*

*Many fossils are
replaced by minerals other than the original
during diagenesis  calcite, dolomite, silica,
pyrite, and hematite are common occurrences.
Many more dissolve and disappear
completely, in some cases giving rise to concretion
formation and pervasive cementation.*

*The main types include:*

* Calcite nodules: one of the most
common types, especially in mudstones,
sandstones, and soils; all sizes up to
several metres (known as doggers); in
soils they are also known as calcrete or
cornstone nodules, and as rhizocretions
where they develop around roots.*

* Dolomite nodules: less common but
similar occurrence to calcite nodules.*

* Siderite nodules: typical of organic-rich,
non-marine or brackish-water mudstones.*

* Pyrite nodules: typical of organic-rich,
marine mudstones.*

* Phosphate (collophane) nodules: also
typical of organic-rich, marine mudstones.*

* Gypsumanhydrite nodules: typical of
mudstones and soils in evaporite successions.
Can be replaced by quartz/
celestite.*

* Quartz (chert/flint) nodules: one of the
most common types, especially in carbonate
rocks. Many of the flint nodules
in chalks are nucleated in burrow networks
of Thalassinoides.*

 * Septarian nodules: these have radial and
concentic cracks, formed by nodule contraction
and peripheral growth, and filled
with calcite or siderite crystals.*

* Geodes: these have hollow centres with
crystals of (mainly) quartz, calcite or
dolomite growing towards the centre.*

* Cone-in-cone nodules: these have fibrous
calcite crystals arranged in a zig-zag conelike
pattern at right-angles to bedding,
typical of some organic-rich mudrocks.*

	<TEXT> Plate tectonics *is* an entirely different *process* from other tectonics. For one, water is required for plate tectonics, but not for other forms of tectonism, you need key mineral assemblages to undergo phase changes in order to drive plate tectonics (see slab pull), etc. - You don't need any of these for 'tectonics.' Currently, Earth is the only known body in our solar system to have plate tectonics, while Europa may have [a different type](http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=4285) of plate tectonics, nearly every other body in our solar system has tectonics. To highlight this further, think of extensional tectonics, think of their mechanisms... now compare and contrast that to compressional tectonics... sure they are both a class of tectonism but they are entirely different, requiring entirely different mechanism, and underlying processes. It's important to make distinctions.     

I'll reluctantly grant you that plate tectonics, based on technicalities, is a type of tectonism but note that they are far from being similar processes. You are equating a class or type with a process or mechanism, which is incorrect. Analogously, it's like the difference between microbial mats and complex, highly intelligent life. Sure they're both organisms, but that really undermines the key differences between them that make them unique.
