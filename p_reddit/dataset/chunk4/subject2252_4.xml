	<TEXT> They should sound good when played just with the acoustic, and singing the song should not be too difficult. Which songs do you think I should choose? And don't just say Wonderwall, that's a cliche and you know it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are Warren Zevon songs suitable for picking up chicks? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I recently learned a couple of Zevon songs on my acoustic guitar, including "Dirty Life and Times", "Poor poor pitiful me" and "For my next trick I'll need a volunteer". If given the chance should I play these at a party in hope of picking up chicks that way?

If your answer is no, which songs should I learn and play instead. </TEXT>
