	<TEXT> Indeed. From my personal experience, an incredibly large number of people are totally unaware that political positions left of liberalism even exist in any meaningful way. They see politics as a spectrum from "liberalism" as one extreme and "conservatism" as another. Which is frustrating because American liberalism is centrist at best, while all left wing ideologies are shunned as evil extremist commies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, enough with the "lol hashtags" jokes, they've already been overused. No one actually thought hashtags alone would solve the problem. The point of those was to spread awareness, because no problem ever gets solved if most people don't know it exists. Sadly, it's still unresolved, but stop acting like people who tweeted about this are somehow to blame for something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we were all expecting this. It will be a long time before SCOTUS is presented with an opportunity to overrule the right to abortion, so Trump is just going to circumvent the constitution and do as much to hinder that right as he can without the courts. This is going to suck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can confirm. Am shill. /s
You've confused poll numbers with approval ratings. What I said was that Mlenchon had the highest approval ratings. That means most people view him positively, even if they have some other first choice. The only people who like Le Pen are the ones voting for her in the first round. From these facts, one can infer that Mlenchon would win in the second round if he made it vs Le Pen. 

http://elabe.fr/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/11042017_bfmtv_lexpress_intentions-de-vote-presidentielles-vague-8.pdf
You can also see here on page 17 that Mlenchon polls ahead of Le Pen in round 2 by a 61% to 39% lead.

So who has no clue what they're talking about? </TEXT>
