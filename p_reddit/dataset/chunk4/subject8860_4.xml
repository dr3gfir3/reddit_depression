	<TEXT> I'm testing it now, card's pretty good so far. casting cost is a little restrictive, but gets cast when i need to cast it, so meh. 

Definitely fills the hole i need to fill, which is a plan that doesn't rely on the graveyard. Been testing against miracles and bug delver, and is much better than the stoneforge mystic plan in concert with smugglers copter, while taking less slots.

It does have less synergy with the sideboard plan i'm currently using. so that's a real downside.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The strategy needs a fallback plan, and the investment is super low.

a common game one scenario is that you can't combo for some reason, and this gives your opponent another thing to be terrified of.

Whatever, I'll test it for a couple of weeks, if its not good, I'm totally prepared to drop it. 

Real experience beats theory every time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This seems fine, three bears a turn is powerful. Each individual card is fine, rando bears have synergy with the rest of the deck. Sylvan is good anyways, especially in junk fit.

Miracles would have a fit dealing with this btw, it's like build your own planeswalker. Good to grind, breaking it up leaves it partially functional.

Three bears always reminds me of Great Bears of Gallowswood for some reason. Warmachine thing, for those who get it. </TEXT>

I wish i could do that. Just stamp out my empathy for my opponent on a whim like that. Would make me a more effective player for sure.  (not sure how sarcastic i am, too much truth to this statement)

In your defence, I know from experience that it is much easier to do this to your opponent if they have a history of doing this to you.

That is why i want to know how important it is to be consistent about this sort of thing.

	<TEXT> $400 buys you ps4 + game, xbox1 + game, but not switch + game.

If I have money and no console, and I want a console, my options are those. if 400+ tax is my budget, I cannot afford to buy a switch, but can afford the other consoles. 

How is that not competition? The only caveat that i can see is if the person who wants a console wants a switch and nothing else will do,
and if that is the target market for nintendo, then fine.

And at first glance that seems like what happened.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it was more that i wanted to see what a storm deck with 4 main deck decay would look like, and certain design decisions led to others. Past in flames was played as a 2 of in the main, once you do that, taiga or grove. Grove implies pfire, and the deck slows way down to make that card more relevant.

The deck was a weird grinding station variant, with the focus to defeat miracles.

I test everything I can consider to be remotely playable, on the off chance that there is a meta in which the deck is good. I can run this deck on that day in that meta,  and then not play it when the meta looks more normal. usaually that is 1-2 weeks later.

This is how i find what success i have in this format. If i played the same deck week in week out, I would get good with it, but never as good as the players who already do so.   

I've gotten pretty good at predicting what people will play at a given store in my area, up to a tournament attendance of 35-40 players.

I wouldn't dream of recommending this kind of thing to people who garner enjoyment from choosing one very good deck and mastering it, or someone going into any kind of open meta. You'd get slaugtered pulling this crap on mtgo for example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For legacy D T, Knowing how the deck works and meta-gaming are the EXACT same thing. otherwise you will only sequence correctly by accident.

taxes in legacy must immediately identify the strategy that the oppenent is attempting to employ, and now with the addition of prelate, must also identify the answers to your stategy as well. 

Sometimes you must do this turn one. the diference  between thalia and stoneforge, between mother and vial, beteween prelate on one and prelate on two is often the difference between victory and defeat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You know, you would be far better off by keeping the deathrite untapped to prevent ANT from going off with past in flames sigh. And you complain to me about looking at things in a vaccuum? -_-"

This was just to counter the lack of nuance involved in saying this is
going to happen turn 3. I get that you want to shoot down my argument, but stuff gets lost when you do this. This is better than casting shardless agent in either spot.
  
"no card is going to lock out storm, "just buying time" is all you want."
-Not as a 3 CMC card in BUG shells, no!
 I  view this as wrong. You take anything you can get as a 3CMC card in bug shells. 

And the reason you don't understand what i'm talking about is that I never argued against "not strong", I argued against " negligible difference." Which, lets be clear, is a separate issue from you saying
shardless bug did not exist prior to this card's printing.

You look like you forgot that our conversation was happening in the context of a previous one. 

my whole thing was Leovold is better than the garbage that was usually in that slot against ANT.

whatever here's the rephrase of everything I said so far, because you took me apart before realising that you had no idea what i was even trying to say.

I mostly agree with you, with the caveat that having a slot that does something instead of nothing and that synergizes with sideboard options in a minor fashion makes bug midrange strategies better against storm by a minor amount, which is compounded by the surge in this type of deck to make a not insignificant change in the meta.

	<TEXT> you're looking at the card in a vacuum, which is the wrong way to do it. the card is getting played in bug, which has deathrite. so turn 2 sometimes. 

no card is going to lock out storm, "just buying time" is all you want. 

This card is just another thing that compliments discard and countermagic to create an advantage that previously did not exist. It's not "win-more", the decks that are playing this weren't winning against storm, so its nice that both halves are relevant in the matchup, so you have better things to board out. 

I think one of storm's good matchups got slightly worse, which is a notewothy if minor contributor to storm's performance when combined with the increase in bug decks.

If The Rift is arguing this is a major contributor to "the fall of storm," i defenitlely disagree.  </TEXT>
