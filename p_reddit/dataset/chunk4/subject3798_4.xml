	<TEXT> This ski season (16/17), a small company named Revision Skis released their new line of skis for preorder at the usual date in August, 2016. The expected delivery date for all shipments was to be no later than November. Sometime around December, the company sent out an email that the first batch of skis they received was defective, and that they would send out an update shortly. Here we are in early April and not a single customer has received their skis nor any kind of reimbursement on their order, which is super shitty, given that their skis range from $500-$700. Revision has since lost any shred of respect they once had in the ski community and I can only hope they get slapped with whatever crippling lawsuits come their way. </TEXT>
