I also think if they're stupid enough to attach racist comments to their real name online they're probably fucking racist despite protestations to the contrary.

...

The amount of royalty paid is reduced by producers being permitted to claim significant deductions in areas such as operating costs and the depreciation of capital assets. There has been limited scrutiny of the claimed deductions. Some errors in the claiming of deductions have been identified, but the available evidence indicates that the problems are much greater than has yet been quantified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She's sane and capable of recognising cause and effect for a start.  That's quite a good start actually.

Syria's a mess I agree and one with few good solutions.  On the one hand a tough approach risks escalating the situation.  On the other hand the US pulling back gives Assad free reign to conduct a genocide and I *fully* expect that to occur at this point.

As for the European situation, the Russian objective is to shatter the EU and the concept of a united Europe more broadly.  It will continue regardless of Trumps victory and the Kremlin backing over there is right out in the open now when it comes to groups like AfD.

You don't de-escalate the European far-east situation by destroying NATO.  You just concede ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Between Aldi, Lidl and Amazon, the traditional Australian retailers are going to get slaughtered in the next few years.

Woolworth, Coles, Target, Big W, Kmart, Officeworks, Myer, David Jones, Bunnings etc. are all going to feel the pinch and they employ around 350,000 people at the moment.  And that's not taking into account smaller stores.

The potential job losses are staggering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm thinking international but likely not on the scale of the TPP and NAFTA.  More just exclusions from excises etc..  A special economic zone type model.

I'm working on the assumption here that President Trump on trade and immigration reflects Candidate Trump, I don't entirely have faith in that assumption at this point.  If he does though, things like the the major US start-up reactors, much of the tech industry and *particularly* small tech manufacturers do not exist in a Trumpian economy.

If they can pull it off, it should go quite nicely for the blue states.  I wouldn't say the same for the union though.  It would turn existing socioeconomic divides into gaping chasms. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blue States' Rights.

As bulwark, not dogwhistle.

Take the progressive issues the electorate have made pretty clear *don't* matter to much of Middle America and consolidate and protect them at a state level wherever possible.

I can see this stretching to trade and *possibly* even making inroads into the immigration debate.  There'll certainly be a huge push from some industries for the latter.

It would be a foil against a conservative SCOTUS that you'll likely be stuck with for a decade or three.  It would be a way of limiting the damage to, if unfortunately not protecting outright, the information and service heavy economies of CA, NY, MA etc.  And it would be a way of attracting the young and the educated from across the nation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It'll be their own observations that will sway it if it happens.

When the economy gets worse, when cost of living rises, when the jobs don't materialise but the insert epithet they hate is still there and still has their's.

If the blue states turn inward to protect their own rights and economies and let the red states dangle in the wind that will amplify it even more.  And if I were a progressive or moderate in the US facing a generation long blockade in the SCOTUS and the trade and foreign policies of a Trump presidency, I'd be scrambling to reclaim states' rights from the dogwhistlers and using it as a bulwark against a regressive federal regime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been using it in anger since about beta 3.  Found it mostly fantastic since the proper releases.

The automatic purging of local copies has been fairly unintrusive and if you need to grab a whole folder you can.

Git, Eclipse, XCode projects and other things involving folders of files seem to work fine though if you're really banging into the limits of your local disk you may find yourself in Finder pulling full copies manually at times.

Main gripes:

* Performance in some places *sucks* and definitely fluctuates quite noticeably between country and provider.  Never had a major issue in the EU or US but at home in Australia it can be bad at times on some ISPs.  Think ~100kB/s max download speeds on much, much faster lines.

* You'll find some older/legacy applications that shove things in Documents by unconfigurable default can sometimes have issues, particularly if it's config related.  Check if there's anything you rely on that still does this and politely poke their developers to stop.

* Something keeps creating $RECYCLE.BIN folders on my Desktop and in the root of Documents.  I thought it was Parallels but I'm now not convinced.  Only an annoyance but an annoyance none the less.

* My biggest problem, iOS just can not deal with big libraries properly at the moment.  It can take most of a day for the iCloud Drive app to reflect a large initial sync (mine was nearly 100GB) and the Add to iCloud Drive share panel's exploded tree view is a joke that will timeout or crash before you can add to the top level folder, let alone expect to find anything within it.  Completely unusable.  I've sent feedback to Apple about this many times during beta and release, never had a satisfactory response and it's as broken as ever. </TEXT>

Much of what was promised is either pie in the sky fantasy or implementable magical thinking that the GOP will probably recognise as extraordinarily damaging.

Much of what's needed to actually operate the country is completely unbroached.
