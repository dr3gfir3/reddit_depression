	<TEXT> I feel like it could be hard given the wide range of physics knowledge across this subreddit. But most third year undergrads should be able to give these a go: http://www.physics.harvard.edu/academics/undergrad/problems.html

Enjoy :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's great that you do this. Over the summer where I worked, homeless folks would always ask for money for food right near a Subway, so I'd just ask them what kind of $5 footlong they wanted. It makes for a great litmus test to see whether or not they actually want money for food or other stuff--if they're craving anything else they usually refuse the offer for food. I guess I eat a lot so I just buy them another footlong (but what the hell, it's only five dollars). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Look man, I don't like the stupid names any more than you do. But the more you talk about them, the bigger it becomes. Can't we just stop fussing over them and ignore TWC names outright? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclosure   edit: I do not profess to know very well the physics majors in our department.

Your username suggests that you might work in the Medium Energy Physics group (or that you just felt like picking something particle physics related).

You were in Intermediate E M with me, which (as far as I know) was entirely comprised of juniors, so you're a senior now. 

You probably know that I reddit, and I probably know that you reddit. 

A brief look at your post history suggests that you enjoy metalcore and My Little Pony.

	<TEXT> Which Primanti's did you go to? If you want subs I'd recommend Uncle Sam's (the one in Oakland). The O isn't too great for food in my opinion, but they have monstrously large fries and a decent selection of beer for a hot dog shop. 

I'm in my last year of school so I'll be heading to a more hospitable land for Raven's fans... but I've enjoyed my stay here. Most people haven't given me too much trouble. </TEXT>
