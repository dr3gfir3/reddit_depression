	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just watched the 3rd episode of Top Gear and felt that it was a mixed bag. Chris Evans is less shouty now but still not very likeable. Chris Harris' film was excellent as usual. I hated the Ken Block feature. So repetitive and annoying. Everyone who cares about cars have seen the Gymkhana videos. He's just a one trick pony who can't win at WRC.

Edit: They still haven't gotten rid of that cringe-worthy celebrity section with that silly voting for their best and first cars. What an absolute waste of time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Usually short trips are terrible for fuel economy as I spend 10 minutes or so in the condo carpark waiting to exit into heavy traffic. Then there's this 2-minute long wait at a red light. A usual 4km trip I do every Sunday gives me a grand total of 14L/100km! 

That 3.9L/100km record was driving at around 70-80km/h for the first half then at around 110km/h for the second half and then 30-40km/h (ruins fuel economy) for the last 2kms or so. Can't use Cruise Control because there's too many idiots hogging the road. 

I should try 80km/h all the way where the car displays around 2.4L/100km. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought short distances were harder to get a good fuel economy run? Longer distances on highways will easily bring fuel consumption down. Normal driving (60 Highway - 40 Urban) I get around 5.7L/100km. Still very good for such a large car. Long term average (1 year) is now at 5.6L/100km. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a 2008 T5 and the power's good, but because of its age the plastics and everything else is starting to creak. It's also quite a noisy and an unrefined car for city driving. Maybe cruising on highways and country roads suit it better but there are no country roads where I live. Styling is quite fantastic and unique, especially with the face-lifted model and the right rims. But I think you'll be better off with a Golf GTI. </TEXT>

Usually piano lessons don't really teach you to play pieces that you like, but rather just focusing on the three exam pieces. It's very repetitive and you'll get tired of it quickly. Why not just continue learning on your own? Maybe buying those books for scales will help with developing your technique.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for that recommendation. My concern is less about heat but about rigidity and stability. I plan to mount it on the windscreen but I'm worried about it shaking about from the bumps in the road. I can't really see from the pictures if the smartphone holder portion is held by a ball joint or a simple lateral/longitudinal pivot. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best smartphone dashcam mount? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi I'm using a Xiaomi Redmi 2 as a dashcam and have been having troubles with finding a good mount for it. I've used a suction type (suction cups on the phone) but the phone keeps falling off. I've got a new one with the clip/claw type and that's very good except that the ball mount causes a lot of vibrations. I've tightened the 'lock' as tight as possible but it becomes loose after a while. Can any of you recommend a good smartphone mount that can be locked tightly so that vibrations are kept to a minimum? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really have no clue about questioning a minor so if it is indeed what you say, then the police have done wrong in questioning him. But I don't think this is the current point of contention in the investigation.

I think I may not have conveyed my second point clearly. What I'm trying to say is more of why blame the system at all for his personal decision? So what if he was affected by the questioning? Plenty of people are questioned by the police everyday and they don't commit suicide. Isn't this more of a case of him being too fragile and impulsive? Is this more of a concern of 'police investigations should not lead to people committing suicide'? Because to me, suicide or not, so be it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is it legally not allowed for a minor to be questioned by the police? He's 14, not 7, for goodness' sake. And him committing suicide has nothing to do with SOP. I don't think that it is reasonably foreseeable by any one in that situation that he will jump. Why blame SOPs for his own mental susceptibilities? 

Well of course it's not justified for someone to die because he molested somebody. It's not the case here anyway since that statement suggests that it was not in his own free will that he decided to commit suicide, when in fact it was so. The boy chose to end his life, perhaps of guilt, but no one forced him to. It's more of a tragedy that he wasn't brought up correctly to prevent everything that led to his end from happening in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're overanalyzing the situation. Put yourself in the principal's shoes. Police shows up, obviously something serious has happened. If they want to take that kid away, I don't think you will be telling the police, "Hey wait, I need to ask for his parents' permission first". That's just silly.

I would believe that this is what a logical person would do to not interfere with the police and their investigation (not justice as you mentioned). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like you're overstating the 'trust' families place in schools when sending their children there. I don't think it's that common to think about entrusting a school about priorities and whatnot, but rather just sending a child to school for the sake of learning. In any case, what did the principal do wrong? Isn't it obstruction of justice if he prevented the police from taking the boy away?

I believe too that being trusting of authority is a good sign that our system works. We don't need any of that American MUH FREEDOM nonsense here.  </TEXT>
