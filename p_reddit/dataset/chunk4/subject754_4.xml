	<TEXT> This is the question that everybody has to answer at some point in their lives. It's the worst, most despicable question that could ever be answered, and yet, with a creeping dread, the answer slowly solidifies in the mind like semen under a hot shower. Nothing can purge this thought from the mind, and its owner must live with it for the rest of their lives. 

We have just witnessed the birth of a terrible burden today. May it be a reminder of the abhorrent places the mind can go to when in search of sexual fulfillment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well unless you've owned them continuously since June 1st, you're going to be in trouble. But of course it'll be really hard for a prosecutor to prove that the magazines are postban, which is why several sheriffs have said that they won't be enforcing this law. 

Overall I predict it's going to be a clusterfuck. I don't look forward to explaining that yes, I've had my magazines since the ban, and no I don't feel like being prosecuted. I also don't look forward to making absolutely sure I haven't lost any of my magazines because getting more will involve a 2 hour drive to Wyoming or Kansas or Utah or New Mexico and no online ordering. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An erection occurs when two tubular structures, called the corpora cavernosa, that run the length of the penis, become engorged with venous blood. This may result from any of various physiological stimuli, also known as sexual stimulation and sexual arousal. The corpus spongiosum is a single tubular structure located just below the corpora cavernosa, which contains the urethra, through which urine and semen pass during urination and ejaculation respectively. This may also become slightly engorged with blood, but less so than the corpora cavernosa.

To learn more, I suggest reading the [Wikipedia page on Erections](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erection) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not a cop but my friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa once told me that one time this German panzer squad was rolling in heavy and that it was up to my friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa to stop them all. My friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa said that he took the uniform off a German man he'd killed with a shovel, smeared a bit of mud and horse dung on his upper lip to emulate wise old Adolf, then he tromped his way down into the German camp under cover of darkness. 

My friend's father's cousin's mother's best friend's great grandpa said that then he took out his trusty bazooka and located the nearest fuel, ammunition, and beer supply dump. He took steady aim and fired right into the unprotected exhaust port while not even using the targeting computer. He used the force to guide the missile straight in. When the charge hit, the entire German army exploded and fresh cold beer rained down to the American army, thus ending the first cold world anglo-saxon war.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was never illegal to carry on campuses, the campuses just had it in their bylaws that weapons were disallowed and that they would expel you if you brought any. A few people got together and said that since the college campuses were public institutions they weren't allowed to bar legal concealed carriers. The state supreme court upheld this, and as of now we're allowed to carry concealed on college campuses as log as you have a permit. 

This is a different group of people who want to ban concealed carry. The colleges banned it first, the Democrats want to re-ban it now.

	<TEXT> **Colorado** 

HB 1224 - 15 round magazine cap   
HB 1226 - no concealed carry on college campuses  
HB 1229 - mandatory background checks for any transfer  
HB 1228 - customers paying for their own background checks  

All 4 bills passed the house, and we're waiting for them to reach the senate. Gov. Hickenlooper has been flipflopping, but he's finally announced that he's planning on signing off on these measures if they reach his desk. He's only unsure about the concealed carry on campuses.

Magpul has announced that if you're a Colorado resident, you can buy up to 10 PMAGs at factory cost with $5 shipping, bypassing all queues they already have. If you're a CO resident, sign up now and buy your mags!

http://www.magpul.com/colorado

Also, be sure to contact state senators and let them know how you feel! We only need to turn 3 of the Democrats over to kill these bills. Call and email them!

	<TEXT> I had fractured my right wrist when taking thermo, so I was writing lefthanded all semester. I scraped by that class with a C without any legible notes taken the entire semester. 

I thought the subject matter was fascinating, but I couldn't learn it nearly as well as I had hoped because I was always struggling to write lefthanded. By the end of the semester I could write the greek letters better than I could english letters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'd just have to find the inputs for the speaker and splice in either the right or left audio output from the boom box. Then play journey in mono so the left and right sides of the output are the same. That's the general concept, but I'm not familiar with your particular speaker system. 

Overall it's not too hard to do, but it would most likely be destructive to the speaker's input system and since this is a prank I'm assuming you don't own the speaker. I wouldn't do it unless you're willing to potentially break an expensive speaker system that isn't yours.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With little brown and black bears you can easily scare them off. Just yell at the top of your lungs and throw some rocks if they're not cooperating.  They primarily eat small animals, bugs, grubs, and plant life. They're scavengers, they don't want to mess around with a big yelling animal that seems ready for a fight. They will, however, eat you if you look like a nicely prepared meal that's completely defenseless. 

Source: I've scared off more than 20 bears. It's pretty fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wash it with warm water and scrub it out with a clean scrubbie (no soap ever added to it). You can also use salt and a paper towel for more abrasive power if things are caked on there. Then once you're done just wipe some oil or butter or whatever you want to season it with onto the metal (you don't need to do this every time, but I like to). After awhile the oil gets absorbed into the pores of the metal and makes it effectively non-stick, and it imparts a nice rich flavor to whatever you're cooking. 

To season a new pan just add enough oil, butter, etc. to cover the bottom of the pan, or just fry up some bacon. Then set the pan on the heat for 15 minutes or so and let the oil bubble around in the hot cast iron. It will impregnate the pores of the pan and you'll have an awesome pan that cooks fantastically and requires little cleaning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> God yes. I was preparing a big thanksgiving party and we were going to have 2 turkeys, 2 hams and 40+ people over. Since I live in a college rental house with 4 other people our knives are all utter shit. I decided to splurge on 1 nice knife so I could properly cut the meat without destroying it. 6 months later and with a little care (AKA no roommates using it to cut chicken on teflon pans), it's still fantastically sharp. It's still able to cut through a 12" pork shoulder in less than 10 seconds without leaving a mangled mess that /r/gore would appreciate </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had it about 3 months. Haven't had to refill it yet, but I like it quite a bit. It's got good capacity and a nice strong flame. If you get the one without the refill it's only approx $2, and it's definitely worth that if you have to replace it. Honestly, the main reason why I like it is that it's great for jewelry soldering because you can aim it anywhere you want flame applied </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This Burnzomatic lighter is awesome. It's a jet-style refillable butane lighter that has a flexible hose so you can light anything. It comes with a free butane refill which will last a very long time. It also has an LED to light up what you're looking at (kind of hokey, but whatever), and a bottle opener at the back end.

It also works fairly well for soldering smaller parts, I used it on a fairly long project and I'm just now at 1/4 tank. And the butane refill is huge. 

$6 at home depot, you can't go wrong.

	<TEXT> Honestly, I'll judge the shit out of you for not wearing a helmet. Especially since most of the people here are park rats and like jumping high in the air or sliding on big metal poles which greatly increases the chances of falling. But it's your choice and I won't force you to wear a helmet. There are serious risks involved, but if you choose to try and beat the odds it's your call.  </TEXT>
