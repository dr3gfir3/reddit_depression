Abstract:

 Graphene oxide membranes show exceptional molecular permeation properties, with promise for many applications1, 2, 3, 4, 5. However, their use in ion sieving and desalination technologies is limited by a permeation cutoff of 9 (ref. 4), which is larger than the diameters of hydrated ions of common salts4, 6. The cutoff is determined by the interlayer spacing (d) of 13.5, typical for graphene oxide laminates that swell in water2, 4. Achieving smaller d for the laminates immersed in water has proved to be a challenge. Here, we describe how to control d by physical confinement and achieve accurate and tunable ion sieving. Membranes with d from 9.8 to 6.4 are demonstrated, providing a sieve size smaller than the diameters of hydrated ions. In this regime, ion permeation is found to be thermally activated with energy barriers of 10100kJmol1 depending on d. Importantly, permeation rates decrease exponentially with decreasing sieve size but water transport is weakly affected (by a factor of 2). The latter is attributed to a low barrier for the entry of water molecules and large slip lengths inside graphene capillaries. Building on these findings, we demonstrate a simple scalable method to obtain graphene-based membranes with limited swelling, which exhibit 97% rejection for NaCl. </TEXT>

Bioinspired fractal electrodes for solar energy storages

Abstract:

 Solar energy storage is an emerging technology which can promote the solar energy as the primary source of electricity. Recent development of laser scribed graphene electrodes exhibiting a high electrical conductivity have enabled a green technology platform for supercapacitor-based energy storage, resulting in cost-effective, environment-friendly features, and consequent readiness for on-chip integration. Due to the limitation of the ion-accessible active porous surface area, the energy densities of these supercapacitors are restricted below ~3103Whcm3. In this paper, we demonstrate a new design of biomimetic laser scribed graphene electrodes for solar energy storage, which embraces the structure of Fern leaves characterized by the geometric family of space filling curves of fractals. This new conceptual design removes the limit of the conventional planar supercapacitors by significantly increasing the ratio of active surface area to volume of the new electrodes and reducing the electrolyte ionic path. The attained energy density is thus significantly increased to ~101Whcm3- more than 30 times higher than that achievable by the planar electrodes with ~95% coulombic efficiency of the solar energy storage. The energy storages with these novel electrodes open the prospects of efficient self-powered and solar-powered wearable, flexible and portable applications. </TEXT>

Chained Iron Microparticles for Directionally Controlled Actuation of Soft Robots

Marissa M. Schmauch, Sumeet R. Mishra, Benjamin A. Evans||, Orlin D. Velev and Joseph B. Tracy*

ACS Applied Materials   Interfaces

Publication Date (Web): March 28, 2017

DOI: 10.1021/acsami.7b01209

Link:
http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acsami.7b01209

Abstract:

 Magnetic field-directed self-assembly of magnetic particles in chains is useful for developing directionally responsive materials for applications in soft robotics. Using materials with greater complexity allows advanced functions, while still using simple device architectures. Elastomer films containing chained magnetic microparticles were prepared through solvent casting and formed into magnetically actuated lifters, accordions, valves, and pumps. Chaining both enhances actuation and imparts a directional response. Cantilevers used as lifters were able to lift up to 50 times the mass of the polymer film. We introduce the specific torque, the torque per field per mass of magnetic particles, as a figure of merit for assessing and comparing the performance of lifters and related devices. Devices in this work generated specific torques of 68 Nm/kgT, which is significantly higher than in previously reported actuators. Applying magnetic fields to folded accordion structures caused extension and compression, depending on the accordions orientation. In peristaltic pumps comprised of composite tubes containing embedded chains, magnetic fields caused a section of the tube to pinch closed where the field was applied. These results will facilitate both the further development of soft robots based on chained magnetic particles and efforts to engineer materials with higher specific torque. </TEXT>

Exposure to dairy manure leads to greater antibiotic resistance and increased mass-specific respiration in soil microbial communities

Carl Wepking, Bethany Avera, Brian Badgley, John E. Barrett, Josh Franklin, Katharine F. Knowlton, Partha P. Ray, Crystal Smitherman, Michael S. Strickland

Published 29 March 2017.

Abstract

 Intensifying livestock production to meet the demands of a growing global population coincides with increases in both the administration of veterinary antibiotics and manure inputs to soils. These trends have the potential to increase antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities. The effect of maintaining increased antibiotic resistance on soil microbial communities and the ecosystem processes they regulate is unknown. We compare soil microbial communities from paired reference and dairy manure-exposed sites across the USA. Given that manure exposure has been shown to elicit increased antibiotic resistance in soil microbial communities, we expect that manure-exposed sites will exhibit (i) compositionally different soil microbial communities, with shifts toward taxa known to exhibit resistance; (ii) greater abundance of antibiotic resistance genes; and (iii) corresponding maintenance of antibiotic resistance would lead to decreased microbial efficiency. We found that bacterial and fungal communities differed between reference and manure-exposed sites. Additionally, the -lactam resistance gene ampC was 5.2-fold greater under manure exposure, potentially due to the use of cephalosporin antibiotics in dairy herds. Finally, ampC abundance was positively correlated with indicators of microbial stress, and microbial mass-specific respiration, which increased 2.1-fold under manure exposure. These findings demonstrate that the maintenance of antibiotic resistance associated with manure inputs alters soil microbial communities and ecosystem function. </TEXT>

Recent retreat of Columbia Glacier, Alaska: Millennial context

Geology 

First published online March 2017

Abstract

 Columbia Glacier in Prince William Sound, Alaska, has retreated 20 km in the past three decades. We use marine sediment records to document the Columbia Glacier advance and retreat history over the past 1.6 k.y. in an effort to place its recent retreat in the context of the Common Era (C.E.). A change in magnetic mineralogy coincided with a shift in sediment geochemistry ca. 0.9 ka. This provenance change documents the advance of Columbia Glacier across a fault, resulting in glacial erosion of mafic rocks near the coast; this agrees with the timing of ice advance reconstructed using dendrochronology. Our marine provenance records show that Columbia Glacier remained advanced south of this fault into the 21st century. Columbia Glacier has now retreated north of this fault, making its recent retreat unprecedented since before ca. 0.9 ka. Southern Alaska temperatures have now warmed to pre0.9 ka levels, based on tree-ring and reanalysis data. We show with glacier model simulations that the warming between C.E. 1910 and 1980, that includes anthropogenic forcing, was sufficient to trigger the recent retreat of Columbia Glacier from its extended position of the past 0.9 k.y., consistent with our data-driven assessment of the relationship between regional climate change and glacier extent. We conclude that the recent retreat of Columbia Glacier is a response to climate change rather than part of a natural internal tidewater-glacier oscillation.

Breathing control center neurons that promote arousal in mice

Abstract

 Slow, controlled breathing has been used for centuries to promote mental calming, and it is used clinically to suppress excessive arousal such as panic attacks. However, the physiological and neural basis of the relationship between breathing and higher-order brain activity is unknown. We found a neuronal subpopulation in the mouse preBtzinger complex (preBtC), the primary breathing rhythm generator, which regulates the balance between calm and arousal behaviors. Conditional, bilateral genetic ablation of the ~175 Cdh9/Dbx1 double-positive preBtC neurons in adult mice left breathing intact but increased calm behaviors and decreased time in aroused states. These neurons project to, synapse on, and positively regulate noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, a brain center implicated in attention, arousal, and panic that projects throughout the brain. </TEXT>
