	<TEXT> In corn and soy growing as feed inputs to CAFOs value chain - which represent the largest value chain by dollar amount and total acreage - alternative, non-industrial food systems are at least as productive per unit land, no question, and in themselves are a biodiverse ecosystem.

In addition, they don't require massive amounts of antibiotics and horrible treatment of animals.  I really encourage you to visit a feedlot or chicken warehouse sometime in your life.

They can be, at surface level, marginally more expensive, but there is a massive hidden cost with subsidies ad overproduction therefrom, and other negative externalities.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do think they are a major cause, but they will not go away because big ag has the USDA bought, which promotes monoculture and inefficient production in any capacity they can.  Examples:  USDA labeling of beef depends entirely on marbling, which comes from none other than corn.  Ds and Rs all know ethanol is bad from all perspectives - EROEI, environmental factors, yet mandates haven't gone away.
 
But I don't know why you are taking it that way.  The article touts industrial agriculture as environmentally friendly, which is simply bullshit in the case I presented, which represents the largest agricultural value chain in the US.

You said that industrial agriculture promotes biodiversity, which I am also saying is bullshit in the specific value chain I identified, which is again the largest agricultural value chain in the US. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Earlier:

We should take up every bit of earth that we can? Not worry about biodiversity?

I'm arguing that the industrial meat supply chain starts with one giant, sterile monoculture (corn), and moves into another giant monoculture (CAFOs), which, due to the "efficiencies" of industrial agriculture are disease ridden, baron landscapes in which sickly animals live knee deep in their own shit, and are pumped full of antibiotics because of their living conditions and consuming food they did not evolve to eat.  I'm also arguing that you can get equal and often higher production returns from non-industrial, innovative food systems *which actually have biodiversity*.

You said that industrial agriculture promotes biodiversity.

The demand is there for ethanol because of laws, mandates,

On a similar note, price floor subsidies encourage massively inefficient of monoculture production below variable costs, when the market signal should be the exact opposite. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well considering corn accounts for [more than 90% of grain feed](http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/crops/corn/background.aspx) production, which leads directly into other giant [monoculture facilities](http://www.pokyfeeders.com/) which take a valuable nutrient, manure, and turn it into toxic waste requiring tailing ponds for disposal... it's probably something you should look into?

And then there's ethanol, which I'm sure you're incredibly fond of...

	<TEXT> I guess you are right in the sense of correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation, but there is a pretty strong correlation with increase of monoculture and consolidation of farming and processing facilities. 

I work very closely with the ABCDs of ags and have witnessed the massive consolidation and the USDA policies which have come with it, so I'm going to go ahead and make that jump that correlation equals causation.

And don't even get me started with the disastrous monoculture of feedlots and egg laying facilities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How does big agriculture prevent diversity of crop? Both big and small will grow the same crop if there is a demand for it.

It doesn't *necessarily* prevent it, but has has absolutely, undoubtedly proven to. Big ag has led to a giant monoculture supply chain. And the demand you speak of is artificially created by market manipulation, created by none other than big ag lobbying the USDA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  1) While the law today requires hospitals to not deny life-saving emergency room treatment, even in a free market a lot of hospitals would likely continue that policy on a more limited basis, save the persons life and send them the bill. Maybe it would force them into bankruptcy, but at least they would be alive.

Or they could be alive *and* not be in bankruptcy?

 2) Statists always look at one side of the equation, so lets look at the other side. Medicare has projected futures costs of 50 trillion, as in 150K for every man, woman, and child in the USA. As in over 300K for every family, and that's just medicare, not all regulatory and tax costs. Are people really serious in thinking that health care charity wouldn't be enough if people got their money back.

Do you think the average person will have less than 150k in medical expenses from Medicare eligible age on?

 3) In the unregulated computer sector, price performance doubles every few years, and we know that removing regulations would drastically drive down prices because that's why many of the regulations were put in to begin with. In the early 1900's, medical professionals were bitterly complaining that health care was too inexpensive, and that the government needed to do something about it. It did. The insurance industry is also heavily regulated, and that drives up costs.

Do you have a source for the part about regulations intentionally increasing prices? 

 4) Government patent cartels drastically increases the cost of medicine. That's why the recent hep-c cure costs 30K or so in the USA, and 1-2K in India.

I completely agree here not to mention laws disallowing Medicaid and Medicare to negotiate on prices, but playing devil's advocate, how are companies going to recoup R D costs?  Wouldn't advances in medicine decrease?

 5) Government spending on health care distorts the health care market. If the state willing to pay 20K for a procedure, then you had better believe that's what everybody is going to charge for it.

Isn't an argument I've seen quite often that providers aren't accepting Medicaid patients because the state pays too little? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That argument is based on empirically unsupported premises: that prohibition decreases use and abuse rates, and that repealing prohibition laws increases use and abuse rates.

All that prohibition does is turn casual users of drugs into criminals, and it turns addicts - people who should be treated as though they have a medical condition - into hardened criminals. If we were to instead take all that wasted money from the criminal justice system into education and health programs, there would likely be much better results. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This was posted a little bit back, and it did come from Bernie Sanders' site](http://www.sanders.senate.gov/koch-brothers), so with little explanation about how these policies would work and private sector alternatives, but I personally believe that 99% of voting population (see medicare and SS) would disagree with a large amount of the policies, and what they do agree with is personified within the other two main parties.  

We urge the repeal of federal campaign finance laws, and the immediate abolition of the despotic Federal Election Commission.

We favor the abolition of Medicare and Medicaid programs.

We oppose any compulsory insurance or tax-supported plan to provide health services, including those which finance abortion services.

We favor the repeal of the fraudulent, virtually bankrupt, and increasingly oppressive Social Security system. Pending that repeal, participation in Social Security should be made voluntary.

We oppose all personal and corporate income taxation, including capital gains taxes.

We support the eventual repeal of all taxation.

As an interim measure, all criminal and civil sanctions against tax evasion should be terminated immediately.

We support repeal of all law which impede the ability of any person to find employment, such as minimum wage laws.

We advocate the complete separation of education and State.  Government schools lead to the indoctrination of children and interfere with the free choice of individuals. Government ownership, operation, regulation, and subsidy of schools and colleges should be ended.

We condemn compulsory education laws  and we call for the immediate repeal of such laws.

We support the repeal of all taxes on the income or property of private schools, whether profit or non-profit.

We support the abolition of the Environmental Protection Agency.

We support abolition of the Department of Energy.

We call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation, including the Department of Transportation.

We specifically oppose laws requiring an individual to buy or use so-called "self-protection" equipment such as safety belts, air bags, or crash helmets.

We advocate the abolition of the Federal Aviation Administration.

We advocate the abolition of the Food and Drug Administration.

We support an end to all subsidies for child-bearing built into our present laws, including all welfare plans and the provision of tax-supported services for children.

We oppose all government welfare, relief projects, and aid to the poor programs. All these government programs are privacy-invading, paternalistic, demeaning, and inefficient. The proper source of help for such persons is the voluntary efforts of private groups and individuals.

We call for the privatization of the inland waterways, and of the distribution system that brings water to industry, agriculture and households.

We call for the repeal of the Occupational Safety and Health Act.

Please tell me if these are fringe libertarian policies, but from what I understand this is pretty standard.  You hear quite a bit about how libertarianism is "socially liberal, fiscally conservative," and "smaller, less intrusive government," which sound nice, but I think to be incredibly misleading until you see it in policy framework.   </TEXT>

It's like a stock market but with people.

um....

Nobody would voluntarily pay taxes if they could get the same stuff without taxes (Eric Garner knows all about this).

That's why CO marijuana with high taxes is failing so badly.

Our system is one that will adapt to the most efficient use of resources, whatever that may be, and this can happen overnight.

Nope.

Yours is one that requires legislators and bills to change, and can take months (notice how congress got literally nothing done for like two years).

I don't know *that* much about socialist ideology, but I'm going with Nope.

An anarchist society would not allow rampant immigration such as this, and if all governments were gone then noone would need to immigrate anywhere because it would be a waste of time because they have all the awesome things that they could ever want right there

You should probably understand how insurance companies make money before you post this kind of stuff.

 The revenue to pay for all this comes almost exclusively from the payment of insurance premiums. This means that the typical policyholder, in a typical year, must pay MORE in premiums than he or she gets back in insurance benefits.

Seriously, go do a tiny bit of research on how insurance companies run before posting this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [The most recent (as of writing this) Planet Money](http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2015/03/27/395815221/episode-613-trash) is about trash and recycling.  It's a shame, but in the US landfills are actually quite cheap, they are allocating more space, and using less of it.  The key to recycling is that the product streams have to be profitable for it to work as an unsubsidized business, and because oil is so cheap right now the lower quality plastics - like grocery bags - are unprofitable and often go to the landfill even when the recycling facility has the ability to recycle them. They are also interesting methods like injecting water and air into landfills to decompose the organic material, but the semi-anaerobic decomposition is much higher in methane emissions.

There is the same thing all over Tibet.  Plastic is a recent introduction so the previous landfills areas that would decompose are huge plastic bag depositories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The ignorance throughout.

"Fact is, that we should stop those things we can stop," Christie said. "And as long as I'm governor of New Jersey, there won't be legalized marijuana in this state. And I think other states that have gone down the path of that experiment  mostly in pursuit of tax riches  have shown unless the federal government changes their mind on this, that it becomes a cash business. And not impugning cash businesses, but they tend  at times  to maybe not be the most compliant taxpayers in the world."

Except CO exceeded tax intake projections, and wasn't in search of tax riches to begin with.

"Ocean County Prosecutor Joseph D. Coronato, who was appointed by Christie two years ago, said the governor is correct: Marijuana is in fact a gateway drug. "

Ugh...

As if there weren't enough reasons that this guy is a joke. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess in restaurants, they cook large amounts, then shock with the ice bath (or just colder water) to stop the cooking just before it's done.  When an order comes up, they add the noodles, broth, and garnish, and it cooks it to the right done-ness.  Not really necessary for home cooking.  

I'd never done this before, and saw it on The Mind of a Chef so copied them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, the searing is about texture and locking in flavor and moisture.

If you throw a non-seared cut into the slow cooker, it often will turn to mush.  The sear gives some texture to the meat and separates it from the dish, while still adding the fat and savory flavors.  It will also keep some moisture within the cut, similar reasoning to why you heat oil in a frying pan before throwing stuff in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cross post from /r/slowcooking.  Saw ramen on The Mind of a Chef and really wanted to try it. Found a few recipes and combined all the stuff that sounded good.  I welcome any critique as it was really good, but was't perfect.  Also, I was called a *barbarian* for ice bathing my noodles.  Thoughts?

**Ingredients**:

	3 lbs. pork loin or similar

	Package of ramen  we went with some nicer ramen, but any will work

	6 oz shitake mushrooms

	 yellow onion

	5 green onions

	2 inches of ginger

	3 cloves garlic

	Juice of lime

	Tbsp black bean paste

	2 Tbsp sriracha

	 cup brown sugar

	 cup rice wine

	64 fl oz stock, I used chicken

	A few cups of extra water

	Soup bones (optional)

	Garnish with green onion, lime, soft boiled egg, carrot, whatever else you need

Brown the pork, dice the mushrooms to garlic, juice the lime, throw it all in the slow cooker.  I boiled the ramen and put it in an ice bath to stop the cooking.  This keeps the nice texture when you add the broth back on.  Garnish with what you like and enjoy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Of course if these factors do work to suppress prices in the near term by keeping production high, it'll only make the inevitable crash that much nastier. Nobody is making any money at the moment, which is what the whole thing is supposed to be about.

I would say keeping market share is what it's all about these days.

It's also worth noting that many bearish-on-production analysis I see either straight out or inadvertently compares boom-time full cycle costs with bust-time completion costs.  Every services company is getting the squeeze.  I'm not sure what your time line is for the inevitable crash, but every /CL bounce gives producers a chance to hedge a little higher, and a ton of the to be completed wells hedged on this forward curve are profitable.  [Again, market share is #1 at this point.](http://www.ogj.com/articles/2014/03/chevron-to-increase-production-maintain-capex-level-through-2017.html)

	<TEXT> Some interesting research. Your article?

One thing I would point out which I didn't see addressed (correct me if I'm wrong).  The data is using average past well production.  E P are not drilling and completing marginal wells which are included in the average. They are completing the highest producing at lowest cost wells with the most efficient rigs, while retiring older, more costly ones.

[Also, interesting article from Platts last week.](http://blogs.platts.com/2015/03/20/tax-time-bakken-oil-summer/)

"Bakken production could suddenly skyrocket, by nearly 10%, or an additional 75,000 b/d, to 100,000 b/d in June, Helms said." This means that despite low prices and production curtailments throughout much of North America, oil production in North Dakota could actually shatter a new record this summer!

This is mainly due to a backlog of between 800 to 1,000 uncompleted wells statewide, about 125 of which need to be completed by the end of June in order to comply with state requirements to complete drilling within a year.

At the same time, operators may wait until June, when a major oil tax incentive known as the large trigger is expected to go into effect. The large trigger, which is aimed at boosting Bakken production at times of low crude prices, enters into force when the WTI crude price averages below $55.09/b for five consecutive months.

If that incentive is triggered, which Ryan Rauschenberger, North Dakotas tax commissioner, said he expects will happen, the majority of wells will be exempt from a 6.5% oil extraction tax for as long as two years.

With that tax break in effect and hundreds more wells running up against one-year state deadlines, production in North Dakota could continue to surge even beyond the summer." </TEXT>

And the scientific body agrees that the abnormal warming is due to human's CO2 emissions. [Yet even when the deniers are called out for being scientifically dishonest, they keep repeating it.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TRCyctTvuCo list=PL82yk73N8eoX-Xobr_TfHsWPfAIyI7VAP index=21)  (This guy will debunk every argument you make, and sources it all).

	<TEXT>  Barring any significant breakthroughs in substitutes for the energy services that oil and gas provides (e.g. transportation), or significant drops in total demand, most scenarios of the energy/climate system assume strong oil and gas consumption well into mid-century.

To add, if there were suddenly some amazing, unearthly breakthrough, it would be neither economical nor environmentally friendly to suddenly scrap hundreds of millions of cars.  Even with such a breakthrough, it would still take decades for vehicles currently being produced and in near term production to fully depreciate, as well as changing the incredibly complex gasoline and diesel infrastructure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contango is when the price for future delivery is higher than spot.  Since prices have to converge on contract expiry, either the spot price has to increase or the future month contracts have to decrease. Since USO isn't leveraged, either of these can happen so buying USO won't necessarily be bad long term, although there's a lot of literature on why you should never hold commodity ETFs long term.

Since UWTI is leveraged 3x, volatility or leverage decay can hurt you no matter which way you go, although there are some strategies using volatility decay.  Essentially a loss of 10% followed by a gain of 10% will leave the leveraged ETF down, while the underlying stays unchanged. There are some charts out there that show UWTI and Nymex WTI over the past few weeks where the futures contract is flat, and UWTI is down. </TEXT>

 The ghost town of Guangzhou has 12 million people.[2] 

You are equating the population of the entire city with incredibly speculative, insanely government subsidized subdivisions based upon speculation, rather than actual demand - simply based upon the notion of *mass urbanization.*  

I've been to [Huizou](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2528425/Inside-one-Chinas-largest-ghost-towns-Development-nuclear-power-plant-left-deserted-locals-fear-radiation-poisoning.html) and if that's not a ghost town (when I was there around 2012) I'm not sure what is.  Also, I had a friend with a (second) home in Thames Town, and if you think that speculative investment and second home buying are healthy for local economic development, you really need to reanalyze.

And 
Who wants to believe that China will overtake America economically in our lifetime?

Is just funny.  The issues China faces in the next few decades are serious.  The second the government lifts capital flight controls, the amount of money leaving will absolutely decimate the economy, which means that they can't, not to mention the environmental disaster that country is facing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I think a good solution for America would be to let the individual states decide if they want to mandate vaccination or not.

One huge issue with this is that non-vaccinated people would congregate to these areas, giving the viruses a larger host population to transmit between and mutate, which is a large part of how herd immunity suppresses these diseases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Cost benefit analysis is in favor of not getting vaccinated. The serious side effects have a higher probability of hurting you than contracting one of the diseases and being disabled or dying from them.

Please please please talk to a doctor about this rather than looking up side effects on the CDC website and suddenly deciding you have both a PhD and MD.  

"Staring and jerking" can be one random twitch.  The aches can be 5 minutes of minor pain cured by 2 ibuprofen.  

Also

These are so rare it is hard to tell if they are caused by the vaccine.

I posted only the most dramatic and potentially life altering side-effects that are currently known.

	<TEXT>  If there was a complete free market, the private schools, businesses, and health insurance companies would be the ones who require us to do so.

Wouldn't this just be insanely inefficient?  It makes more sense with the private schools and health insurance, but would people be required to carry proof of vaccination to enter private businesses?  To walk down the street? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So lets assume that the state gives up back 50% of what it takes (which I think is being generous, to put it mildly).

What an amazing analysis. </TEXT>
