	<TEXT> PART 1: https://redd.it/68omuu

Hi everyone, thanks for all the comments and supports. Youve made me feel a lot safer than before. Theres a link to part 1 if anyone wants to read that first.

Id like to address some comments first;

-	My dad doesnt have a gun, and jeez I wish he did. Fuck gun laws, I have no protection against creepy ass Tom.
-	The Hughes have NO pets; apart from some fish. No cats, no dogs etc. Milo could be a stray cat, but I live in a rather isolated area so we dont get many.

I feel like I should give you all some background of the Hughes too. Nancy leaves the house at around 6am to go to work. She works as some HR woman I think. Shes nice enough; just hardly around. Ella, their daughter, has epilepsy and is very very sweet with gorgeous, silky ginger hair. She always makes me handmade birthday cards. Never my sister though, we always joke she certainly has a favourite. Tom works as a freelance accountant and works from home most days. 

After reading your comments, I decided to have a look into the shed. It appears to look the same as before; old furniture, broken board games, unused garden tools and lots and lots of pictures. My grandpa is very proud of his camera, and he is a fantastic photographer. He takes too many family pictures, prints them and frames them. You cant fit many pictures in a small house, so we put them up there. Yeah, I guess its kinda weird to walk in there and be stared at by frozen images of your family, but its more thoughtful than the bin.

Ive had a look, but honestly nothing looks out of place. A few of the lower pictures have been gnawed at, but that is definitely the rats. Everything seems normal; the only thing that moves around in there is my dads bike which he takes out on weekends.

I should add too that this shed is locked. My dad locks it to ensure his bike is safe and no creepy guys get in there. Nice try dad. I dont know where hes got the key from. The shed was unlocked the first time I watched him, but every time since then hes been bringing a key. We only have one key for the shed, and my dad keeps it on his key chain. Fuck. Just remembered right now my dad lost his car keys for a few days around the same time THE HUGHES MOVED IN. Did he steal my dads fucking key and get it cut?! Is that possible?

Something happened tonight and I honestly thought at this point Id somehow get hold of a rifle and shoot him. It is getting too much. I need to get evidence to go to my parents; or the police. 

See, I had problems with sleep walking and sleep talking when I was younger. I would have very lucid nightmares, and became terrified of everything around me as I was unsure whether it was my dream world speaking or whether it was real. It was triggered by the death of my grandma, a woman I loved dearly who was a pillar in my life. I actually went to my parents after the first incident with Tom, and they told me theyd talk to him. They actually booked me an appointment with my old therapist. Thanks. That is why I am reluctant to go to my parents without proof. I need to catch him in the act, but hes a tall man in his mid-forties and Im a barely 20-year-old girl who is literally just over five feet tall.. He definitely has the upper hand here.

Anyway, I ordered some dresses last night for a party Im going to on Saturday (theyre all cute btw, I know you dont care though). My order came whilst my family were all out and so was left in my shed. 

When I arrived home, I headed straight upstairs. I stuck my headphones in and got on with work, before getting distracted by 307 messages from my friends about Saturday. I then saw an email pop up; Your parcel has been delivered!

I opened the email, and noted that the parcel had been placed in my shed at 15:44. I looked at the time, which was 15:51. Damn, I mustve just missed them.

I headed downstairs to the shed. I needed to have a look through it anyway, as suggested by you all. Two in one. When I entered, I found no parcel. I had a look round the shed for it and for signs of movement.

Later, when my mum got home, she told me that the package had probably been given to the neighbour. I showed her the email, clearly stating it was put in the shed. My mum said maybe that was just the lazy response of a website who couldnt be bothered to explain the circumstances. She practically shoved me out the door to go knock.

I prayed and wished and hoped with all of my being that Nancy was home. 

She wasnt. Tom opened the door, with his easy, friendly smile. I asked for my parcel, and he asked me to step inside. I took out my phone as he stepped into another room and began to scroll through instagram. I realised a few minutes into my scrolling that he was taking a weirdly long time. 

I was too scared to follow him into the room. I was in his own home! He could do anything. I peered through the crack in the door and saw him furiously trying to pack my clothes away. He was sealing the bags with tape, trying to make it look like theyd never been opened. Ella sat on the sofa across from me. She looked frightened by her fathers chaotic movements. 

Toms head jerked upwards when Ella let out a whimper. I lurched backwards to where I was, and he soon came out the room holding the parcel out to me. I took it back and we exchanged an awkward smile before he let me go.
What the fuck was he doing going through my stuff?! That shit is illegal. Well, all the shit hes doing is illegal, and plain weird. Jesus Christ.

I unpackaged the clothes, and the packaging was practically mauled, but luckily the dresses were fine. I noticed something though. On some of the dresses, usually stuck to the black tape used to repackage the bags, ginger strands of hair were attached. Ellas ginger hair. 

I dont know what to do. Im going to see if I can rig my dads GoPro to work as a live stream-esque thing; pretty sure you can do that. I just need to catch him; get proof that creepy Tom isnt just my childhood memories coming back.

Part of me wants it to go on. Sounds weird but Im so intrigued to find out what that fucker finds so interesting in my shed. Ill definitely put all stops on this if he comes into the damn house. Jesus.

But what does he want? Does he wanna murder me? Steal my clothes? Be me? At this point I have no idea, and Im open to any ideas. Ill update you all if anything else happens.
