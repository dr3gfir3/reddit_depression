The officer said he hoped to stop the car but instead shot and killed the driver."

So instead of sending a strong, actionable message against that sort of behavior, police are getting a further signal that they should shoot first and ask questions later, if ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm aware that the union is just doing its job. I'm suggesting that the job is the problem. It leads to many bad officers -- but perhaps not criminally bad ones, at least according to the laws that favor them -- keeping their jobs. He was "fired," though that firing is now being challenged, which is why many officers in these cases are instead forced to resign.

You're also right that unions are not literally magic -- they can't force departments to continue employing a cop who is in jail for murder, for example. But I still think they do far more harm by protecting bad officers than they do by defending good ones who have legitimate gripes. In an ideal world, they could to the latter without doing the former. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This story demonstrates that even in the rare case a police department wants to fire an officer for messing up badly, they can't because of police unions. That's an old story. But the news here is that it holds true even when it's a high-profile case in which an officer has seemingly killed someone unnecessarily -- though whether it was illegal or not is yet to be determined. In my opinion, if a department believes an officer is no longer fit for their department, they shouldn't be forced to continue employing them due to a fucked up bureaucratic system that shelters cops who aren't good at their jobs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stop blaming everyone but yourself/ourselves (I'm white) for this lack of coverage. The white people that don't give a shit about police brutality don't because they're complacent. They don't see this ever happening to them and they're convinced it's a problem for other people, or not a problem at all. In many ways the former is true, which is why it's a BLACK Lives Matter movement, not an ALL lives matter movement. For white people this isn't a basic issue of self-preservation and injustice that affects you and all of your family members at some point or another -- though that doesn't mean those issues can't.

Seriously though, you're gonna point fingers at black people for not giving a shit when a white person is killed? Black people have enough activism to do for their own causes and you act like it's somehow on them to get white people's shit together? Fuck man, I dunno what to tell you. I think if white people showed black people unconditional support -- and came to terms with what BLM is actually about -- and then followed that up by showing that we even cared about white people killed by police, they would join in any protest that was mounted. Good luck getting white people to do anything on this issue though. And until we get our shit together, I blame nobody but ourselves. </TEXT>
