	<TEXT> Pokemon, Animal Crossing, Fire Emblem, Ace Attorney (maybe Layton, but I played PLvsAA before returning back to the first Layton games and am very impatient because Curious Village is so slow). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I keep my Switch at home because it's still new (my precious.. ahem) and bring my 3DS to play when I'm free on the go. I've also accumulated a bunch of DS/3DS games which I've yet to play (THE SHAME) so I'll definitely be juggling the 2. Also it helps that if my boyfriend wants to play BoTW, I can just play Ace Attorney/whatever game I'm playing atm on the 3DS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have a choice since I'm living abroad for two years and won't get a TV (licensing etc). It's currently ok but tabletop mode isn't ideal and my neck hurts after a bit. I do wish I have a screen to play on/that the switch is able to connect to a Macbook for multiplayer games such as Snipperclips. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Amazon's (UK) page now reads this: 

Amazon has sold out of our week 1 allocation of Nintendo Switch.

We are expecting to receive more stock in March. Customer orders will be fulfilled in the order they are placed. You will receive email confirmation once we have visibility of when youll receive your order. Stock may be available to purchase via 3rd party sellers.

You can now purchase it at a whopping 350 (encouraged by Amazon on my webpage). 

Anyone in Central London knows where to get a switch? All my local Argos are sold out and Toys R Us apparently "doesn't sell them". I'm pretty much out of luck until end Mar/April. </TEXT>
