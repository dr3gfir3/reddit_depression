	<TEXT> For whatever reasons, my mother used to beat the fuck out of my older sister. Also of course verbally abused her constantly. My sister is 1.5 years older than me so I never understood it. I don't trust my mothers intentions to this day because I know and will always believe my mother is insane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've stated this before on situations like this as a worst-case-scenario kind of thing when all the money is gone with no directions. Go to coolworks.com and often you can get a basic job such as a bellman or housekeeper if you don't have any skills whatsoever but often if you can pay to get to the job which are scattered throughout the country, they will support you with food and housing until you start making money and then rent is usually dirt cheap as well as the food being just as cheap. It's a great option to get a savings going and get back on your feet, even temporarily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can buy these little white ball things that look like the beads from a bean-bag chair at nearly any department store. Generally they will be in the closet supplies(hangers, shoe racks, clothes baskets etc). Super cheap and all you have to do is put them in a bucket of some sort and leave them in the car. They pull all the moisture out of wherever you put them. My car was recently moldy on the inside and needed this as part of the solution.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also, I believe another island in Michigan that not many think of, Isle Royale National Park, is the same way. They consider it a natural biosphere. </TEXT>
