	<TEXT> I was also stuck on 11 where I constructed a second ray. Once I added a segment on top of the existing ray and a second segment rather than a ray, I was able to level up... You might consider allowing rays for angles.

	<TEXT> Mathematics exists as a third, abstract, "thing" that is distinct from both the physical universe and the human intellect (c.f. Plato, Roger Penrose, and numerous practicing mathematicians including Frenkel for supporting arguments). Were there no universe and no humans to discover theorems regarding counting, 3 would still be prime, just as falling trees always move air molecules in the forest...

Math as used by humans is an abstraction created by our collective history, a useful tool for science, and a thing of beauty, but none of these constructions actually capture the full essence of math in its raw state. Can the existence of such a distinct entity be proven? Nope. So just go ahead and label me a quack mystic and move on.

	<TEXT> I just finished it, and I'd say that it is worthwhile, but it could be better. He spends a lot of time on his own life, and less time on the really interesting stuff (the philosophy and especially the math). But it is still worth the read, and it may very well give you a glimpse into higher-level math; it has clearly been written with that as one of its goals. He makes a lot of great points as brief asides that are unfortunately often overshadowed by the narrative of events. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also Beutelspacher and Rosenbaum.

Coxeter's "Projective Geometry" is a really good small book and a quick read, but since it is a purely synthetic approach, it will probably only be useful to you if you are interested in origins. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hah, well done!

Jeff gave me great advice on line weight, and he also pointed out that dashed lines rarely look good, while dots can look great. The dotted line includes the four points of the harmonic set, so you might think of it as the punchline for this construction. I thought that a dotted line would set it off well for that purpose.
