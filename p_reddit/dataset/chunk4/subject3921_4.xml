	<TEXT> (final part of this story)

---

Our makeshift fort had been burnt and melted into permanence. It didn't fall over even after people let go. I slowly unclenched my hand, at first hopeful that it was working at all and then I looked at it, and felt a dark pit grow in my stomach.

Eyes full of concern, Cristina tore some of the nice shirt Ethan had given her and wrapped up my hand.

I could only stare in shock. It reminded me of hot dogs my father had once left on the grill too long at a Fourth of July cookout when I'd been young

*Come on*, she mouthed, and I followed after her, mentally numb.

The room we'd taken shelter in had been charred blacker than my hand.

The housing project had gone from ten stories to one - the first floor, where we'd hidden, was the only one left.

Jumbled devastation ran in every direction - piles of shattered lumber, broken bricks, and burning refuse. A few unlucky people lay in the streets, seared into the pavement and still smoking. Nearby, the doors to the heavy building we'd initially tried to seek refuge in had been sealed shut by piles of debris. Cristina directed some of our soldiers to hurry over and unbury them.

I just stared around at the destruction, before coming nearly full circle and looking up.

A second sun burned in the sky, brighter than the first.

It hovered in place, exuding eerie waves of distortion, sending the sky running away from it in every direction. All this I saw in a split-second, because I dared not look directly for fear of being blinded.

What I *did* see woke me from my state of shock as my soldier training kicked in.

Shapes moved on the horizon, and among distant rubble.

Many of the well-designed skyscrapers at the core of the city had survived mostly intact, if charred and ugly beyond recognition, but the sight just beyond them chilled my soul right where the explosion had previously burned it.

A gigantic ruby cube, perhaps two miles across on each side, floated up into sight.

I grabbed Cristina, and she turned to me.

*Teskoy,* I tried to pronounce without being able to hear myself. She narrowed her eyes, and I spun her around and pointed.

If we were going to make a run for the military base back in the center of the city, it was going to be a hell of a mission - the white hole's eruption, and the inner Shield's failure, had just dumped a thousand years of agitated threats right into a city filled with devastated and defenseless people. We'd have to cross all of that if we just wanted to save ourselves, and the thought of saving any more than that an insurmountable task, in the face of the nightmare that had descended upon the city.

*What do we do?* I asked her as she turned to me with pained eyes.

She just shook her head.

I gripped her arm tighter with my working hand. *What do we do?*

For the first time in all the years that I'd known her, she truly had no answer. </TEXT>

Our gazes followed hers to the sky. The gold was still there, but the white was harsh, bright, and searing. The sirens kicked into full gear, their eerie call drifting loudly over the city. The partiers filling the street slowed stopped and looked up.

We all understood at the same time.

There was no time to prepare. There were no plans, no last-minute heroics, and no options.

The end of the world was *now.*

Vas was the first to ask the obvious question. "What do we do?"

His answer came in the form of a great tide of terrified screaming. The party was over. Men, women, and children swarmed in various directions in mindless terror, desperately seeking boltholes in which to hide from some great unknown but approaching destruction.

Heart pounding, I waited, and looked to Cristina - as did the rest of our makeshift squad.

She grabbed the radio and raised it close. "What's your name, soldier?"

"Parker, sir," he replied, nervous. "Ryan Parker."

"Ryan, I'm going to need you to focus, and make every single second of the next hour count. You hear me?"

His voice quavered. "Yes"

"Now, you've got everything you need at your station. There are country-wide systems in place to prepare against a nuclear attack - hardened communications, bunkers, warning systems, and the like. Now all you have to do is turn them on, okay? And pester anyone you can reach to do the same. Yell at them. Lie to them. Promise them beers. It doesn't matter. Wake them up and get them active."

"Okay," he replied, reassured by her calm tone. "Sir."

"One more thing - do you have a location for those EM bursts?"

"Um, yes, one second." We waited, breathless. "About two or three miles northeast of the city."

Cristina looked up at the sky, judging. "Alright. Send out that location data through all the emergency channels. Tell people to get as far away from there as they can." She looked around at the streaming panicked crowds. "And ask them to do it in an orderly fashion, if that'll make a difference."

Even as we looked around in fear, a giant television screen on the side of one of the nearby buildings went black, pre-empted by the emergency channels - and then basic green text appeared, recounting what she'd just said.

"Alright. Let's go."

Ethan moved closer. "Where to? I do have a safehouse, but it's on the other side of the city."

"What about using the vortex machine to portal back out?" Sort-of Noah asked. "Let's get the hell out of here."

She shook her head. "We'd never make it there in time. We have to find somewhere and hole up. It may blast out exotic radiation initially, so we have to avoid exposure."

Adrenaline pushing at my senses, I grabbed her hand and started moving, trusting the others to follow. "I know this city. Follow me."

Navigating the rushing torrents of panicked people was the hardest part. Huge groups swarmed this way and that, desperately running after any suspected inkling of safety. Many of them saw our six accompanying soldiers and figured we had a good destination, so they started following us.

I felt on the edge of panic myself. It was hard not to broach that line, and I danced with the idea of losing it and freaking out every step of the way. My brain kept wanting to guess at potential explosion scenarios - but I had to keep telling myself that I had no idea what it would actually look like. I had to lead everyone to the safest spot I knew.

As the tall buildings of the downtown area began receding on the skyline, I knew we were nearing our destination. My panic lessened even as the sirens echoed louder in the open air. 

The thick foundations of several very large but cancelled skyscraper projects had survived many earthquakes without damage, and we turned the last corner as Cristina's radio crackled to life with a familiar voice.

"What's going on in there?" a friendly but worried male voice asked.

"Heath?" Cristina shouted, using one arm to speak into the radio and the other to push screaming people out of the way. "How're you reaching us?"

"Noah Two set up a connection, and I've been working on getting into systems over there ever since," Heath responded. "Everything just went crazy!"

"The First World's about to be destroyed," she replied loudly - and several of our accompanying soldiers looked surprised. She looked to them for a moment. "We might survive the initial blast, but after that, the white hole won't just go away. We'll try to live through the eruption, and then make a run for the base and portal out of here."

"*What about all these people?*" a soldier shouted, looking around in horror.

Mothers and fathers ran past carrying their children. Cars honked loudly at one another, but none moved. Larger men pushed their way through the crowd in a state of panic. A seemingly-abandoned young girl stood on the corner and cried, but I had no way of knowing if her parents were around. Over it all, a blanket of eerie unhearing descended - the sirens, seeming to deepen their mortified whine as the last grains of sand in our hourglass drained away.

Cristina took all this in, like I did, and forced herself to look away. "There's nothing we can do"

"Can your Black-eyed Army help?" Vasiliev yelled, his face temporarily conflicted with the instinctual resentment and anger he held toward her for all her long-ago tortures.

She shook her head, and then spoke at the top of her lungs just to be heard. "Their possessed halves were always difficult to control, but the Sword hasn't been with them for quite some time. They're running on their own agenda now."

Slowing our dogged advance through the crowds, I caught sight of the heavy metal doors to the bunker-like building foundations.

People were spilling out as quickly as they were entering - the building was full to the brim.

*No good,* I motioned to my squad.

Cristina put her radio right up to her mouth. "Heath, do you have maps of the area we're in?"

"Already on it," he responded. "You're a half-block away from -" His words cut off as crackling interference rose to a crescendo.

*Shit!* Cristina mouthed, before pointing at the nearest building - a dilapidated housing project.

We ran.

I broke the door in with a charging shoulder impact, and we forced our way inside even as I felt an incredibly strange sensation surging *through me* like an ocean tide on its way out - it was as if space itself was stretching.

And it was. I misjudged a step and almost fell. The walls pulled away from us in a surreal semi-optical-illusion, and the ground shook with a vast kick. Wordlessly, using military hand gestures, we directed each other - and our swarm of terrified following citizens - to pull up mattresses and anything else they could find to form a makeshift fort near the building's core wall.

I crouched down behind, crushed in with dozens of other people. Cristina held my hand with a fierce white-knuckle grip, and we squeezed down as hard as we could. The makeshift wall of debris wasn't much, but I'd seen documentaries, and even just a single layer could protect from the initial lethal radiation.

The tide inside me shifted the other way suddenly, and I felt thrown against the wall by the sheer change in the elasticity of space itself.

She and I looked each other in the eyes for a moment. Was that it? Were we going to -

The ceiling and walls above suddenly grew alive with eddies of fire, and I instinctively pulled the top edge of the mattress down hard to make a seal with the wall.

A swift punch to the lungs followed, in the form of torrential winds blasting through our huddled mass. The roar was preceded only by the sound of countless windows shattering, and then a screeching note blanked out my hearing. I could see huddled families screaming, but by what light I was seeing our shadowed enclosure, I had no clear idea. I couldn't tell if the earth was shaking or whether it was the insane winds against the building, but it didn't matter - there was nothing to do but pray.

Pray - and hold on to the mattress above me. The heat in my slightly exposed hand became unbearable, and I thought I could feel my skin melting but to let go would have been unthinkable. With my free arm, I only gripped Cristina's hand harder. She seemed to instinctively understand what was happening to me, and she tried to take whatever part of my pain she could.

A slow ebb in the maelstrom crept up on us, until a moment of true calm and silence fell.

Cristina yelled something, but I could only hear that screeching ring in my ears.

Fortunately, the huddled soldiers and families were too deep in shock to get up. The devastation was not over - it was merely changing direction.

The hurricane winds picked back up, surging back the other way to fill in the air pressure void left behind by the initial eruption. The air was still searing, but my exposed hand had gone quietly numb. I didn't dare do anything but hold on until the ghastly winds finally slowed for a second time.

This time, people knew the explosion was over, and they began peeking out. Talking didn't work at all, as everyone had been temporarily deafened, and we began using hand signals to direct those at our edges to slowly exit.

Bailiffs moved to intervene - our cue to leap up and get rough. Despite our lawyers' protests, Vasiliev, the Sword, and I leapt up and began grappling with them.

"With the whole world watching, and more, let me tell you. The pressure outside is *crushing whole realities* despite the outer Shield still being maintained by a skeleton crew of lonely guardians who have been abandoned by the heartless First World military. All that pressure is translating down *right to us, here.* That heat you feel?"

The camera crews surrounded her, looking up with reverence and awe.

"That heat you feel is the strain of ancient machines trying to keep our reality from imploding. They're going to fail, and they're going to fail hard. Do you know what a black hole is? It's when space is pulled down to an infinite degree, and nothing can escape. Everything is pulled in and destroyed."

The courtroom went silent. All motion stopped as humanity waited for her zealous words.

"Well that's not gonna happen here," she yelled, eyes afire. "Quite the opposite. When that built-up force finally penetrates the golden Shield - through a small hole, the tiniest of breaches - it's not going to pull space *down.* It's going to push it *up*, and in. It's going to lance through with tremendous force, and a white hole is going to erupt right into our front yard."

She looked around, as if gazing through the walls. "And probably near here, considering the number of military bases that have drilled through the Shield for so long."

"A white hole?" a reporter asked quietly, eyes trembling. She held up her microphone.

Cristina glared down. "Where a black hole pulls everything in, a white hole pushes everything away. A black hole's singularity center can't be escaped - a white hole's can't ever be reached, and space will stretch right under us, pushing everything away with forces even light can't overcome. Once it forms, it's too late. Game over."

The courtroom remained silent.

Daniels looked at each of us, his expression haunted. After a moment, he opened the book. "Tell me what she was really thinking just now." His eyes scanned the page.

The camera crews turned and focused on him.

"Oh my God," he breathed. "She's not lying."

As if punctuating his words, the ground gave a little tremble - a minor earthquake, brought on by the very crisis that 'scientists' seemed to be conflicted over.

He walked over absently, handed us the book, and paused a few more steps down the path between the onlookers behind us. They waited, stunned, for his words.

He looked at everyone in the room in a sweeping arc, an obvious question in his eyes. After a full circle, he let it free. "Well who fucking cares about *this*, then?"

Everyone in the courtroom looked in askance at the people around them.

Daniels ran for the door, tearing off his tie as he went.

The camera crews raced after him.

A great commotion erupted in the room, and a crashing wave of confused and angry shouting rolled in from the crowds gathered outside the justice building.

The judge stood and hurried out a back door.

The bailiffs, confused, went after him.

The watchers behind us began getting up and talking loudly over one another. Ethan's hand gripped my shoulder. "A fine show, friend. I suggest we all leave while we can."

Realizing that I was free on account of the justice system dissolving before us, I jumped up and ran over to my ex-wife.

She sat in the witness chair once more, her gaze distant, and her expression sorrowful. "Do you think Thomas will forgive me?"

I put the pieces together. "You met him because you were looking for him!"

She nodded, her eyes slightly misty. It was the most I'd ever personally seen her tear up. "That's the thing the legends do say how the brownshirts helped build the Shield. They're energy beings, really, and quite benevolent. They gave of themselves to imbue the Shield with permanence."

"What do you mean?" I asked, helping her stand.

"They gave their lives," she said quietly, barely audible over the growing commotion. "That's why I had my men searching for them. We had to do whatever it took. Great, if the brownshirts were willing, but if they weren't"

I stopped halfway to Vas and the Sword. "You were gonna kill them."

"And *they* still plan to," she said, choking on her words. "They were gonna take Thomas, and I put all that in motion. I was behind that *I* was going to kill him if necessary, until I met him." She turned her pained brown eyes to me. "I was so angry when Laura died. I I was brutal, and violent, and filled with rage. You heard me, heard my thoughts, back then. You know what I did."

I looked over at the friends urging us forward. "Come on, let's get out of here."

"You don't think less of me?" she asked, truly vulnerable for the third time I'd ever seen in my life. The first had been at our daughter's birth the second had been at her funeral.

I actually laughed. "I don't care what you did. You and I could become Queen and King of Evil, and I don't give a shit. My place is by your side."

She gripped my arm. "You're the best man I've ever met."

"Nah," I teased as we ran forward. "I'm not smart or rich. Loyalty's the only thing I got goin' for me."

Ethan, Sort-of Noah, Vasiliev, the Sword, Cristina, and I pushed through the confused crowd as a group. We weren't dressed as convicts thanks to Ethan's fine clothes, and even our lawyers lost us in the milling riot. We slipped between those vast wooden doors and across the chaotic cathedral-like space beyond, finally reaching freedom proper.

A monstrous ocean of people waited outside - a stormy sea, worse than the one in the courtroom. Some people recognized us as we pushed through, but there was no directing the chaos. Once surrounded, we realized what was happening.

The people were partying.

Music had erupted in multiple locations, and beers and drugs were being passed around. I saw Important People from the courthouse among them, drinking and smoking with the poor.

"What's happening?" Vas demanded of one suited socialite. 

The richie looked at him with surprise. "It's the end of the world, kid."

Cristina leapt forward, furious. "We have to *fight!* Not get drunk and high!"

A poorly dressed homeless man nearby laughed. "For what?"

"For the world!" she exclaimed. "To save everyone!"

"Why?" a poor woman asked. "What's the point?"

I jumped into the argument. "To live? To have families?"

"I'm divorced," the homeless man shot back. "Like everybody is."

The poor woman nodded. "Single mom here. I don't know anybody whose family lasts anymore. And besides, raising kids in poverty is pointless. They'll just suffer."

The richie laughed. "And even if they had money my life is pointless, too. I hate every minute of it. Let it end, I say. It's like being released from prison."

Watching that same mentality throughout the huge crowd, we all stood in abject horror.

Cristina gripped my arm tighter, her cheeks screwing up as actual tears ran down her face at such a monstrous and apathetic betrayal. "The government's fallen apart. The military gave up. The people themselves are celebrating oncoming death. Has the human race gone insane?"

I held her close for a moment, shaking my head. Until I'd found Higgins and trailed my way back to the woman I'd always loved, I'd been in that exact same mindset. I'd hated *the system itself*, which had become far too large for any individual life to matter, and I'd wanted it all to fall apart. I would have been drinking and smoking with everyone else here they weren't insane. They were just existentially exhausted.

Our mission here had been doomed from the start. Humanity had fragmented, in this latest era, into a million little shards of ideology that all hated each other and they'd been kept together only by an exploitative system that ensured none of those shards could ever matter or change things. They hadn't even been able to agree that the world was warming *while the sky was turning whiter.* The concept of humanity *banding together* was now as impossible and alien as the things I'd seen in Teskoy.

But I couldn't tell her that. I just sighed.

We had no choice but to keep moving. We thought we were home free until six men in military uniforms found us right beyond the other side of the ocean of people.

The six men approached, stopped short and saluted. "Sir, what are your orders?"

We looked among ourselves, confused.

"Ma'am," the lead soldier said. "Excuse my frank talk. You seem to be the only one 'round here that gives a shit. And knows what's goin' down besides. Far as we're concerned, you're in charge now."

Surprised back from the depths of despair, Cristina stepped slightly forward. "How many men do we have who feel the same?"

He looked to his comrades. "Um, us six, and a couple more scattered around the city."

It wasn't much. That made ten of us, and some change. We began moving deeper into the city, passing by rivers of mad party-goers.

"That'll do," she said, recharged by finding out that not *all* of humanity had lost hope. "Get on the radio. Tell someone to get to the nuclear warning systems. We're going to treat the initial white hole eruption like a potential nuclear attack - and we've got systems to prepare for that, right? Have them turn on the sirens once they detect anomalous EM bursts in the Shield's upper band. That'll be our only warning it's about to fail. Maybe half an hour."

He nodded, and then barked some orders into his radio. He looked up a moment later. "Parker's at one right now. He said he'll -"

The rising whine of sirens cut through the noise of the parties all around, echoing from high buildings and filling my heart with dread.

"Not already," Cristina told our new allies. "Tell him to wait until -"

"I'm detecting EM bursts *now*," the radio responded. "Have been for three or four minutes."

"No" Cristina breathed, looking up at the sky. "*No!*"

The officer to his left lifted his firearm and -

The shot rang out, startling our entire crowd of exhausted soldiers.

The brigadier general spoke again. "Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives. You have *no idea* what's at stake here."

"Because you haven't told us!" a woman to my right yelled. "You have us out here on some revenge quest -"

"Hughes, shoot that woman."

Another shot rang out, and she fell to the sand, bleeding.

"I will not hesitate," the Sword continued, his eyes fierce. "Go disarm the explosives."

None of us wanted to speak up after that. Slowly, our resolve failed, and - followed closely by officers with guns - we headed back into the Ink, found the Sphere, and disarmed the fireworks.

Many were sobbing uncontrollably as we did so, and many more were trying not to look at the nightmarish worlds within that ungodly Sphere.

He didn't even have us set up an ambush - he wanted the Preacher to come out, thinking it was safe to stalk us once more. It would never come back if we had the Sphere surrounded

I lay in my tent that night running plans in my head. There was no way to walk to safety - the desert was filled with rebels that would shoot us on sight. And why wouldn't they? We'd taken their way of life, and all of their economic resources. It was what we had always done out here, more or less, at least until this nightmare had begun.

There was nowhere to go, and there was no escape.

I remember staring up at the empty bunks in my tent, realizing it nearly aloud.

The Sword had to die.

I felt like a ghost. I floated up from my bunk, and I drifted between the tents, whispering the words that would most certainly get *somebody* killed. Us, if we were found out - him, if we were not.

Perhaps *I* was insane by that point. I'd been hit by a giant mirrored tentacle, subjected to weeks of mental torture, thrown in a hotbox as physical torture, and cornered like an animal in every way possible. By then, I didn't even care if I survived.

The Sword had to die.

She was going around asking details about the Sphere when she heard what I was planning. I liked her, I did, and she seemed like a fine person, but we would all die if the Sword found out. She was already on her way to tell him, I was sure.

I came at her from behind with a knife, trying to stay quiet, but she somehow heard my approach, and swung out of the way of the first strike. She was a hell of a fighter, and I was caught off guard. She knocked the knife from my hand, and I barely managed to leap toward it in the sand and prevent her from getting it. We struggled there, until one of my fellow mutineers came at her and knocked her away.

She shot right back up, got the knife, and slashed his arm deeply. He fell back, biting his lip to keep from screaming and giving us away.

A woman - one of ours - leapt in from around the edge of a tent, but Thompson straight up stabbed her in the shoulder despite my grip on her other arm.

Two more men came to assist, even as Thompson came around and viciously bit me in the neck. She took out a chunk, barely missing a vital artery or my throat, and I was forced to let her go. While I was gripping my neck, she ducked under one man's kick, responded with a punch between his legs, and came back up to stab the other man in the chest.

The knife got stuck, and she spent one second too long trying to get it out.

I shot her in the back.

The shot rang out, and shouts responded from nearby, even as my furious comrades surrounded her, kicking and stabbing her repeatedly out of animalistic revenge. She didn't make a sound, and I was glad: it meant she'd died from the initial shot, and hadn't felt the brutal beating that followed. She wasn't a bad person, she'd just been in the wrong place at the wrong time.

There was no more time to delay, really. I pulled them off of her, and we ran as a group for the brigadier general's tent but it was too late.

They gunned most of the others down, and I fled.

I ran off into the desert, still bleeding from my neck, weak from everything else that had happened and rebels found me. For some reason, they let me live, and they even helped me get better. I -

---

I looked up from the book.

Vasiliev Blaku stood at the other end of his cell, watching me back. A large scar on his neck still indicated the place Cristina had bit him.

The place she'd bit him just before he'd shot her. Just before they'd beaten her lifeless body to a pulp.

But she'd certainly taken to heart the personal defense training I'd given her. Was there some other sequence of events in which she might have survived? Just a second's difference

But I wasn't angry. The cold fury that had burned all through me to get me to this point was simply gone. I'd come here to kill this man but now I just felt drained.

Cristina's story was over.

I'd found out all the last details of her life, all the mysteries, and that was it. Vasiliev had been a wounded animal, and he'd been cornered by the brigadier general. He'd suffered in a way no man should have had to suffer.

Who was to blame? Who could be brought to justice for any of this, except the Sword himself?

Blaku could see the emotions in my eyes change rapidly. He trembled and sighed with relief as he saw my murderous intent fade. "You're not gonna kill me, are you?"

I shook my head. "No. I think that would cost me more than I'm willing to give." I sighed with relief myself. "But I do think we're honor-bound to be soldiers one last time together."

He knew my meaning already. "The Sword is one of these hallways, one of these cells."

"Yes." I stepped back, letting him out. "Yes, he is." I hefted the book. "And this this finds out the truth. Will you come with me and find out the truth of all this? And, if he is indeed the terrible man you knew if he brought the Crushing Fist upon us"

"Yes. I'm going to finish what I started back then, in the desert." He stepped forward. "No trial for that monster. I'm gonna kill him myself."

I walked with him, feeling much like the ghost he'd described himself as before doing something terrible. The First World had given up, the outer Shield was failing, nobody gave a shit about anything anymore, a half-trillion people were going to start starving in two months, and everyone was going to die.

It seemed the only thing left to do was tie up loose ends - mete out justice for those who deserved a fate worse than simply dying with the rest of humanity at whatever random moment the Shield failed. The book would get the truth, and we would finally know

The man trembled, but spoke for us. "Sir, I've been locked up at gunpoint, given endless scans, sent into supernatural darkness, seen my squadmates torn apart and then delivered back to me, put up with endless evil sermons, even shot a friend because a mosquito got in his brain. I'm *tired* and I know if I go back in the Ink, I'm gonna die."

The brigadier general nodded, his gaze scanning the tired faces around him. "You all feel this way?"

Nods followed.

He stepped back, and his already deep voice lowered an octave with grim anger. "If we don't deal with this situation, we are all going to die. That means that you will probably die whether you go back into the Ink or not."

Unhappy murmurs circled the crowd.

As he walked away, his order cut right into our hopes. "Have them build hotboxes, and put them all through in a rotation until they comply. Two hours each."

A great unhappy noise swelled among us, but we were soldiers, and we weren't going back into the Ink for the moment so we followed the officers' orders, and began building our own torture devices under the hot Sun.

I was already sweaty and tired when they threw me in the one I'd built.

It was simple, really - six metal plates bolted together. It hadn't even taken very long to make.

But my two hours would feel like forever.

I sat in there, sweating, frying, melting for an eternity. All I wanted was to go home. This was a nightmare in every sense. Down one path, there was darkness and hellish threats that continually tore at us, at our sanity down the other, slowly dying in a hotbox.

The Sword wasn't going to let us leave.

It occurred to me, in a flash of feverish inspiration, that nobody had taken brain scans of the brigadier general himself. How did we know *he* wasn't under some evil influence?

What if a neural mosquito had gotten to *him*, and this was its way of slowly killing all of us?

I cried, but no tears came out. I was too dehydrated.

I remember being very certain that I was going to die in that box before I ever got a chance to grab for that one slim hope

But the top did eventually open, and they pulled me out and dumped the next guy in.

I stumbled to the nearest water and guzzled it down alongside a long line of other red-skinned soldiers doing the same.

As soon as I could, I slipped away, and found Thompson. She was in the techie tent, drawing plans to kill the Preacher. Her face was absolutely filled with hate for that thing and I couldn't blame her but she quickly threw on a neutral expression when she saw me.

It was all I could do just to talk through my heat exhaustion. "I have a theory that the brigadier general's been compromised."

She regarded me with a skeptical but open look. "Oh?"

I nodded, and tried to breathe normally. "This is crazy it's unlike any campaign I've ever been on. That man is driving us forward with torture, and he doesn't care if we die. Do you have any recent brain scans of him? Like you took on us?"

Her gaze went distant for a moment. "No I don't, actually."

"Will you get one?" I asked, desperate.

She nodded. "You're thinking neural mosquito?"

"Yeah."

"I'll manage it," she promised quietly. "Now get out of here before someone sees you. Nobody can know about this conversation."

I made it to my bunk and fell before my body completely gave out and they came for me a few minutes later, dragging me back to the hotbox for my next turn.

There were a great many people in those boxes, in the sand, in the heat crying.

We couldn't last. It simply wasn't possible.

Groans and shouts gave way, and we were all spared the hotboxes for agreeing to go back into the Ink the next day.

I lay in my empty tent, awake the entire night, hoping against hope that your ex-wife would come through before we had to go back into that dark and silent Hell.

She snuck in some time just before dawn, a brain scan document in hand.

"What'd you get?" I asked, exuberant, even trying to sit up.

She shook her head and showed me. "He's clean."

"*What?*"

"Nothing wrong with his brain. No mosquitoes. Whatever's out in the Ink, it really must be worth all this suffering."

I remember sobbing uncontrollably. "No."

"I'm sorry," she said, pouring some water across my reddened forehead. "But we're all here for a reason. Everything he's done is technically legal." She paused. "But if he gets worse, come to me. I'll make some calls."

I could only screw up my face and nod.

And, then, a few hours later, it was time to gear up and go back out.

There was no chatter, no murmurs no talk of any kind. Silent, broken, despairing, we went through the motions of setting up lights and guarding ourselves against unknown threats, but I was sure each of us simply expected to die in some new and horrible way.

It was on that day that we finally reached our objective.

I think we were six miles deep into the Ink at that point, and four miles straight down thanks to the impossible slope. I envisioned it as an immense unseen crater that existed only inside that valley of darkness

And it was just sitting there at the center of the enormous crater, the slope stretching up and away on all sides.

"Any contact with the Preacher yet?" the brigadier general asked over the static-filled radio relays.

Nobody responded in the affirmative. They wouldn't, because I knew where the Preacher had gone. It had continually retreated whenever we'd tried to attack it and it had vacuumed up more than one of our dead colleagues to add to its bulk. Standing with five other men and staring at the source of the Ink, I knew where it had gone each night.

The ten-foot-high sphere sat casually in the sand, like it had simply chosen to fall and rest there. Each edge held an asymptotic darkness, but, within, we saw another place.

As we watched, it shifted.

Another place and another seconds later, another

This was some sort of hellish egg, or black hole, or shadow portal, or *something* and it went to places beyond any of our worst fears.

We reported our discovery, and the next order did not surprise us at all.

"All units, gather at the Sphere. We'll deploy each time the blood-lakes and corpse-mountains world appears."

This time, I knew who spoke. It was me. I picked up my radio, and signed what felt like my own death warrant: "No, sir."

"Do it."

Another man raised his radio, his gaze aghast as he witnessed what looked like, in all actuality, Hell itself. His words were as tear-filled as his eyes. "No, sir. We refuse."

"*The Preacher must die!*" the Sword roared over the radio, his high shout causing a burst of static.

Forty men and women now stood outside the Sphere, lit by a weird shadow-light that ignored the ten foot limit, and we looked at each other in confusion. The Preacher? Was that the true objective of our operations? Judging from the anger and hate in that shout, was this some sort of revenge mission? Or had he simply lost it completely?

"Set your charges," I remember breathing, and, somehow, everyone heard me. I wasn't in charge, but they listened.

We piled up all the C4 and other explosives we had. We took all our mortar shells and rigged them up. We surrounded that fucking thing with enough firepower to blow a hole in reality itself. Fitting, judging by what I guessed that it was.

We trekked back through the Ink, unafraid now. Everything that had been in here had been coldly and carefully murdered by thousands of armed men and women, and there was nothing left but us. We'd never figured out who had been leaving our friends' limbs for us to find, but we guessed that, since they hadn't attacked us yet, they never would.

Long lines of soldiers trekked out of the Ink together, and we headed back to camp, soul-weary.

The Sword was standing there, waiting for us, all of the officers lined up to his left and right. His monolithic stance and grim expression indicated immediately that we were in trouble.

Somebody explained what we'd done, and that we'd set a timer on the explosives.

He took a breath, and somehow grew even taller. "Go back into the Ink and disarm those explosives."

"There's hardly time," someone said.

"Reed," the Sword ordered, not so much as moving his head. "Shoot that man in the leg."

 Which other major parts do I need to read to catch up with the worldbuilding aspect?

	<TEXT> You should stick around. I have been hanging around in the valley of online horror since it started, and it never stops evolving. Today is just one step in a long journey.

The Internet is a fickle mistress. We can't control what becomes popular and what goes ignored. All we can do is write because we want to write.

That's what I do - I don't worry about upvotes, I don't read anything else on /r/nosleep unless someone specifically suggests a story, and I don't play politics at all. If there are cliques, I have no idea who they are, or where they even happen. I just write because I want to.

All I do know is that /r/nosleep has almost 3 million subscribers, and that makes it the first horror forum of its kind. That size is unprecedented. We had like a hundred people on the original creepypasta blog   forum that really started all this. Now there are 30,000 times as many readers. Who knows what might happen next?

If you are a quality author, the best thing you can do to help improve average quality is write :) </TEXT>

Vast pillars of wood raced by on either side as I kept putting one foot in front of the other. I kept my eyes narrowed as the bare branches overhead orchestrated a maddening pattern of glinting sunlights. Cyan beams crossed crimson glows, and a deep purple glowered over my shoulder from behind. Sickly yellow roiled somewhere distant, lurking, watching

I moved through the kaleidoscopic forest with determination, ignoring the visual chaos.

How far did I have left to go? And how far behind was I? I'd come later than the other two. Somewhere out there, at that very moment, my doppelganger was torturing Roger to death - and my past self was desperately hunting him.

He wouldn't find Roger in time, because he didn't find Roger in time.

And, out in the mountains as I was, I would also be too late. I pushed a little harder, and began moving a little faster. The slope steepened, and I used the extra kineticism to take longer strides, more ambitious leaps, and more direct shortcuts down the rocky and mossy terrain. Even in the midst of my determination, even with a core of fire burning beneath my heart, my peculiar brain was still calculating.

It was rather astounding how *real* everything was. The trees had bark. The moss had texture. My pounding shoes found purchase on rough stone and soft loam. I had to conclude that this was the realm of the mind - *my* mind - and I would never be able to convince myself that it was not real through evidence. As deep as I tried to stare at any passing object, I would see exactly what I expected to see, and believe that I was seeing what I expected to see.

Was that the nature of madness? Was this what other insane people experienced? Realness made real purely by mistaken and unshakeable belief

But I knew. I *knew.* How was it possible to have such a schizoid duality of state? To know it's not real, but to be unable to shake that imagined realness? Somewhere distant, somewhere unreal, I was suffocating under a whelming tide of madness, and I could not lift my head to breathe.

Thanks to my strange dichotomic state, I had control of *me* my own awareness and experience but nothing more but, in a way, that was everything, wasn't it?

Somewhere in my body, I had a kinesthetic sense of the slope beneath my feet as I ran. It felt like a tilted plane, like gravity gone awry and I gripped that plane within myself.

I put a slight testing strength into that grip.

The downhill slope didn't change, but it *felt* steeper, and I began charging forward with greater energy.

I tilted that inner plane further.

Pushed right to the limits of balance and control, I ran almost without effort, my stride becoming more leaping than running. Finding the perfect tilt, I refined my gait until my travel felt like a mad downhill dash. Despite everything else on the line, the feeling was an incredible rush. I'd always enjoyed running - the physical, visceral, *alive* feel of it all - and this was that beloved feeling pushed to the utmost limit. Hands out, arms up, I reached the crest of a large boulder and leapt in a high, directed arc.

For an unknowable span, I felt like I was flying.

As with all jumps, it didn't last. I dug my feet into moss and multicolored dirt - and then tilted my inner plane forcefully back until I could physically grip the earth with my hands and come to a stop.

I'd reached the edge of the road proper - and a shadow stood waiting for me.

At first, it was a shapeless sphere in space, hovering just above the pavement. As I studied it, trying to make sense of what I was seeing, it coalesced into the shape of a man.

It didn't seem to like that. It lifted its arms and gazed down at them, its slowly forming shadowed face indignant. Had I done that to it? Had I given it form simply by observing it? It clenched two fists, became a bit more solid - an act of purposeful will? - and then regarded me with two empty sockets in a dark mask that represented the only variation on an otherwise impenetrable silhouette.

I let go of the ground and stood, wary. In my haste, I'd forgotten about the threats the broken sky might bring. Could they still hurt me here?

The shadow leapt forward, its mask expanding into a giant maw filled with rows of jagged voids barring infinite blackness. It went for my right arm, which I flung back in abject surprise - barely saving it from clamping infinite chill. Acting on sheer instinct, I flipped my inner plane hard.

The sickening motion sent me into a flying lurch, during which I gained a quick twenty feet from the thing. Quickly fighting dizziness and shock, I grabbed the ground again, righted my inner senses, and stumbled to my feet among clutching vegetation.

In my painful aerial tumble, I'd crossed over the road entirely.

The shadow remained where it stood, masked face human-like again. Those dark eyes looked down at the stark line of pavement between us, then up at me. It spoke in a sibilant whisper that actually seemed to betray a hint of surprised admiration. *Fair enough.*

I stared down at the road, then up at my assailant. The road it was a metaphor. I'd done something automatically instinctively and closed myself off from being consumed.

Of course! I was insane. Everything was a metaphor here. I felt the urge to laugh but then, under the hungry glare of those empty eyes, I absolutely did not. Instead, I carefully stepped onto the road, making sure to regard it as a path to where I wanted to go rather than the barrier I'd made against the shadow entity. I didn't want to accidentally undo what I'd somehow done.

The shadow stepped onto the road as well, but kept an appreciable distance.

I wasn't sure what else to do about it I stood for a moment, watching the bright conflicting sunbeams dapple the shadow without effect. Alright then I carefully turned and began running again, this time heading down the road.

A look over my shoulder confirmed that the shadow was following. I usually felt emotions from everything around me, like the singing strings of a thousand muted harps, but from this entity I felt nothing at all. That unnerved me more than anything else about it, but it didn't seem to be threatening anymore, and I had to keep going.

The road was much easier to run down. I tilted my inner plane again, reaching an even greater speed on a slope that felt very close to straight falling. I remembered what my two previous iterations had felt traveling down this road - one saw nothing and no one; one saw absent-minded blank-eyed people without will. The two phantom realities mixed and merged in my awareness, even as I surged straight through them both at breakneck speeds.

*Quite the conflicted point of view here,* the shadow whispered, its words audible in my head despite the roaring wind in my ears.

"Metaphorical memories," I shouted, arms pumping, feet pushing off of pavement to move even faster. In one eye, cars around me appeared to slow as I approached their speed. In the other, the entirely empty road gave me no barriers. "But everyone really was gone."

The shadow continued to follow, saying nothing.

As I began passing nearby cars and their blank-eyed drivers in my scarily steep downhill dash, and as the roar in my ears reached an overwhelming blast, it occurred to me that I was going at least seventy miles an hour. And why shouldn't I? I was practically leaping down a precipitous infinite slope that shot down into a vat of bright pooling paints. How strong were my feet? How rough of a leap could I take without injury?

Could I even really injure myself here?

I tilted my inner plane a little further and began spending increasingly longer moments simply arcing intently nearly straight down. From the outside, I'm sure I would have looked rather impossible, basically flying inches above the ground at a hundred miles an hour but there was no outside, was there? It was only me in here, and I'd experienced this exhilarating and frustrating almost-flight countless times in dreams.

A surge of experiences and feelings flooded back to me as I recalled my dreams.

I'd dreamt about flying so many times - I'd worked at it my entire life, each and every time it occurred to me while sleeping. I'd never managed to actually do it, thanks to that frustrating limit based on real experiences dreams often give, but I *had* managed a kind of stressed straight-line hovering that I'd often foolishly tried to show off to other people in my dreams. They'd never been impressed. How could they have been? They hadn't even been real

But this - this was very close to that dream-like hovering. All I needed was that feeling of stressed effort in my chest, a kind of held-breath clenched-fist exertion of will, and -

The ground didn't fall away but I didn't come back to meet it, either. Holding my fists tight and my heart revved up, I kept myself up with sheer will. All I needed were a few inches to keep from touching the pavement - and the tilted slope did the rest. The forested edges of the road became a blur, and then the lines became seamless, the pavement a surging river. A hundred miles an hour? Two hundred? Three? The mechanics didn't matter. I had somewhere to be.

A surge of anger and conviction brought my speed to blurring heights, and I kept my eyes unwavering on my destination.

The shadow continued to follow, a subtle blank spot in the feel of the world just behind me.

We shot through the world like a violent and energetic spear, arcing with fury straight to our target, and then I was there.

The stop was an imagined web of force, reaching out to everything and anything to cushion my sudden deceleration, and a hurricane erupted forward, flattening chain-link fences, shattering high school windows, and knocking several surprised men to flattened campus grass.

Among them was my doppelganger.

I stomped angrily forward, pulled him up by the scruff of his weathered collar, and looked him in the eyes. He stared back at me, terrified - he'd had no idea who was hunting him, but he immediately knew the truth as soon as he saw me.

Struggling for breath in the still-churning winds of my arrival, Jay clambered up. "What - what the hell -"

"This man is lying to you," I shouted, furious. "He's already tortured Roger to death in a basement near here, and he's drawn attention to your presence here."

"But he's you" Jay said, confounded, even as the other men started recovering and standing.

My terrified doppelganger shook his head. "He's lying. He's some sort of trick! There are horrible things coming in from other realities now -"

Jay stared between us. "He *did* help us avoid a few dangers on the way here. Why would he harm Roger?"

I glared at all of them. "He's trying to figure out where everyone went."

The men all froze in place, eyes on me.

"He's going to use the coming attacks as leverage to try to get at least one of you to talk and he *thinks* he's doing it for himself, for the right reasons," I continued. "But he's not. He got caught by something, and then edited changed, in subtle ways used for years, being edited over and over, updated with new memories and new gear and, then, it sent him here to find out where the human race has gone."

My doppelganger pushed my clutching fist away, and then stared down at his own hands, aghast. "Is that true?"

I knew what he knew, because I remembered. His mind was a web of links that didn't make sense. "Do you remember GLORWOC?"

He shook his head.

"Do you remember Mike?"

He stared at the ground, eyes narrow and distant. After several heartbeats, an expression of confusion and horror crossed his - my - features. "I remember a Mike and he and I encountered it but I didn't know what GLORWOC was when *he* asked me" He looked up at an older Chinese man among the encircled group, and that man took a step back in fear. My doppelganger took a step toward him, begging the answer. "How is that possible?"

"I told you," I said quietly, growing less angry and more dismayed. "It edited you. You're an incredible resource for it to use."

"That's not true. It can't be true!" 

"What's in the backpack?" I asked him, expression hard.

He wavered. "Something important. I spent a month in the woods looking for it."

"Did you?"

Vaguely following what was happening, some of the men insisted he open it. Their shouts grew in intensity and tone until he finally relented.

Shaking, he slung his pack down and placed it carefully at his feet, and then dropped down next to it. Slowly, he opened it, and carefully pulled out a laptop, assorted gear, and a few papers. After the last extraneous object was removed, he stared down into the pack. His head shot up, and he gazed at me in pained askance.

"It's a radio"

I nodded. "Everywhere you've gone since you left the woods , everything you've done, and everything you've said or heard *someone was listening.*"

A stirring echoed from between the houses across the street from the high school, and I saw our last guest slowly joining us.

"This can't be true," my second version - the real me, the hunter - said loudly, walking up with a surreal expression of horror and confusion. He hadn't heard everything, but he was really just me, so he already knew what had been said.

All my fractured selves had finally met up.

"And who the hell is *he?*" Jay asked, subtly indicating to all his men that they should back away with a few movements of his hand.

"Oh, that's me," I replied, audibly sad. "He's how I experienced this when it really happened. Before the gigantic abomination attacked and the sky ruptured even further before you all died."

Jay stopped in place. The word came out very quiet. "What?"

"I would never do what *he's done*," my hunter-self said angrily, indicating our doppelganger. "I would never give in. I don't care what torture or mind control or anything else some evil thing tried on me. I would *never* do what he did to Roger." He gave a single sob just thinking about the gory scene he'd found. "And I would never threaten the lives of all these men."

"But he did," I replied, looking back and forth between them. "He was *us*, and he succumbed. We are capable of doing what he did. And that's what we feel so guilty about. We're connected. We feel it - every bit."

"I don't believe it," our doppelganger said, eyes red from brimming sorrow.

"It can't be real," the hunter said, clenching a fist with righteous sobbing fury.

"But it is," I told them, heart heavy. "Why do you think we're here? We're insane, and we could be imagining *anything*, but we're just running through these events over and over again. We have to forgive ourselves."

"But how?" the hunter asked, falling to one knee in pain. "We screwed up so badly. I got what we were looking for in the forest - I had it in my cellphone - but I didn't handle it properly, and the sky shattered"

"The sky was going to shatter anyway," I told him. "You just thought it was your fault at the time. The Key program is dangerous, but not *that* dangerous. It can't crack a wall of reality all by itself. The Crushing Fist is coming for us, remember?"

Our doppelganger turned and stared. "*What did you just say?*"

I frowned. He should know because I knew or he couldn't have information I didn't have, could he? "Insanity's the worst," I breathed, confusing myself.

"Yeah," the hunter version of me replied, still staring at each of his duplicates.

A deep rumble ran through the ground beneath our feet. I looked west, at an approaching triangle of dark orange in the cloudy patchwork sky. "We're out of time"

Jay ran forward and grabbed my wrist forcefully as another impact shook the earth. "Look, I don't pretend to understand what you're arguing about with yourself, but I've got daughters. They're the whole reason I'm still here, doing all this. Are you telling me this world isn't real?"

A sibilant whisper echoed in my ear. *Curious.*

"No," I said, after a gulp. "I'm sorry. I'm insane, and this is all in my head."

"Is it, though?" he asked, his fiery gaze locked on my eyes for any sign of doubt. "I don't feel imagined. I don't *feel* like a dream!"

I shook my head, unable to tell him another no.

His gaze intensified. "You're tellin' me, in all this crazy bullshit, skies shattering, living flames floating around, silver nooses from the sky strangling people, a giant spider made of corpses preaching the unholy Word, icy green fire, three of you arguing with yourselves - in all that nonsense, there's no chance we're here and alive and real?"

Another incredible impact sounded, closer than the last two. The doppelganger's work had backfired, and he'd attracted something far worse than he'd anticipated. Everyone here was about to expire in manners most horrible.

My face screwed up as I kept shaking my head. I was only able to choke out four words. "*I saw you die.*"

He gripped my wrist to the point of pain and shoved his face in mine. "*But you're insane, how would you know?!*"

Behind me, the shadow gave a hissing little laugh.

That thought did stun me. He was right what the hell did I know? I was mad as a hatter - whatever that meant.

"Give us a shot," Jay insisted. "Get us outta here."

I nodded, suddenly feeling odd. Numb neutral hopeful? Traumatized "But there's so much coming."

Jay released my wrist. "You know what's gonna happen. Steer us away from it."

"Okay," I breathed, trying to recalculate and reframe everything I thought I'd known. "Okay" I looked at my hunter-self. "You wanna do what you came here to do?" I stepped forward, towering over our doppelganger. "You wanna fucking redeem yourself?"

They both paused, and then, at the exact same time, said, quite forcefully: "Yes."

"Then, real or not, we're going to save these people. We're going to avoid the titan that's coming our way, we're going to avoid looking at the raving in-betweens when the sky completely ruptures, and we're going to get these men to -" I froze.

There was only one place to take them that might truly be safe. We had to get them to wherever the rest of humanity had gone.

Right the point of all of this. That was the question, wasn't it?

"Come on!" Jay shouted, trying to be heard over a sudden surging gale forced upon us by the nearby impact of a tremendous beast rolling and writhing its way toward us.

I knew where everyone had gone, because Jay had told me just before he'd died - and I'd had it locked away in my mind all this time, somewhere I wouldn't think about it. But the story had led us here, hadn't it?

"We're going to get these men to the bunkers," I finished, telling my other selves. "There are giant bunkers in the northern and southern icecaps. There wasn't time to drill them, so they did the next best thing - they melted the tunnels out. The ice hides their energy and heat signatures, too, so if something out there is looking for them - perhaps scouring the globe - they'll never find them. Not ever."

The wind stopped.

Jay relaxed, and even smiled. "Thanks."

The men behind him vanished.

The high school vanished.

My hunter-self flickered into me, and I suddenly felt strangely more complete.

My doppelganger looked up at me in confusion, and then slumped.

The world became a mess of floating colors.

I waited for several heartbeats, stunned, but not at all surprised.

*Alright then,* the shadow whispered in my ear. *Now that the undue influence is gone, I can go about completing the deal.*

"The deal?" I asked, fighting nausea at the technicolor sea invading my senses.

*Specific biological organisms asked me to find you in exchange for certain things. That's none of your concern at this time. I couldn't clear your perceptions until the* **ukvwaa** *was over.*

"Heath sent you?"

*Yes, that was the verbal designation of one of the specific biological organisms. I find it quite sadistic that none of you have told it of its true state.* There, again, was that hint of admiration in its tone. *Quite sadistic indeed.*

I swallowed down bitterness. I'd tried to tell him, alright, but it had only hurt and scared him. "If Heath sent you, then why did you try to eat me?"

The shadow laughed, and its mocking face appeared in my vision, blocking out the colors. *Like you,* **gwellion,** *certain things are just in my nature. Do the others know what you are?*

I narrowed my eyes. Heath had said this creature delighted in sadistic confusion

*Do* **you** *know what you are?* It grew serious for a moment. *No matter. You will awaken shortly, next to a variety of biological organisms, including a near exact copy of you. A semi-biological entity is somewhere nearby in physical space. I'm supposed to inform you that it will help you escape.*

"Thanks," I said, feeling sicker the more it spoke.

*Are you sure you don't want to be consumed? Last chance.*

"Really, no..."

*So be it.*

It leapt at me, thrusting me down into darkness - and then I found myself in a raging river. Torrents of madness pulled at me with force beyond comprehension. I couldn't breathe - I couldn't lift my head - I was suffocating all over again!

And then chilly shadows were tugging at my shoulders, dragging me up and onto the single thing I'd been holding onto - the single point of sanity that had kept me from coming apart completely, the single point that helped me weather the storm.

I could care about people.

That was it: I could care about people. I'd had the secret - the hidden path humanity had taken to safety - and I'd protected it even at the cost of myself. Caitlin had been wrong. I wasn't a terrible person or, at least, I wasn't irredeemable.

I opened my eyes.

White walls.

A table a round wooden table sat before me, covered in papers. The papers covered in writings my writings. I picked up one of them.

*There's something beautiful about raw nature. It existed before you did, and it'll exist after you're gone. It's wide open space, with all the vastness of galactic clusters and long-dead stars that still shine, and it's tangled closeness, rife with fractally expansive life of every sort that grows into and upon itself with ravenous earnest.*

I'd been writing it all out. I was a writer - writing was what I did. That's what they'd been counting on, to find out humanity's secret. The universe, as my fractured selves had perceived it, had been entirely textual. I still had the smudges on my fingers.

Others sat around the table with me, also writing their eyes blank, their faces expressionless. God - I'd been trying to tell myself

I could feel the effect of the drugs in my system dissipating as the shadow entity's efforts restored my senses.

Holy shit -

"Jay!" I whispered.

He kept writing, his eyes blank.

Next to him sat a kid I'd run into at a McDonald's in my mind. 

Past him sat Roger.

I held my breath to keep from shouting happily. It occurred to me that someone might be around carefully keeping my head still, I glanced around the room. There were no security guards or threatening figures in the immediate vicinity but, I supposed, why would there be? We were all metaphorical zombies, busy building written realities together that would slowly expose all our innermost secrets.

And I'd just given our captors a big one, too. Were they off to the polar ice caps even as I looked around the room?

Idiots.

I reached out and touched Jay lightly - and that touch seemed to spark a little bit of shadow between us. His eyes cleared.

Was the shadow purposely helping more than I'd expected? Or was it difficult for it to tell us apart? With whispered instructions, I had each of the men at the table briefly hold hands until all of us began waking up

all of us, including one man who looked just like me.

He looked at me with dismay. His torture and betrayal hadn't been real but he hadn't known that. He also hadn't known what he really was not until I'd told him.

We walked out of that room in a dazed cloud of confused stares and pained exclamations. The building was empty. Had they simply gotten what they'd needed and left us all to starve?

There was no clue who they'd been. The maze-like and empty building was almost immediately recognizable - they'd trapped and drugged us in the very high school Jay and his men had been using as a base of operations. 

I kept all of the papers, intent on writing them up on the computer and posting them for Heath to read. I also spared a moment to consider what might have done this all to us. Had it been people? Other sentient beings? Or a creature? An entity of some sort? It was impossible to know.

Outside, the sky remained a shattered patchwork filled with roiling multicolor clouds. My doppelganger sat down on a curb and stared at the parking lot, his thoughts likely in turmoil.

"What now?" Jay asked, studying himself for injuries. He found none, and looked around at his colleagues happily. "Can we go home?"

I shook my head. "No."

"What? Why not?"

"Isn't it obvious?" I asked. "We can never be sure we're out. If I was whoever did this to us, I would try at least one trick escape. This could all be a ruse. We think it's over, so we give them what they want, like fools."

That brought wide eyes and horrified expressions from the entire group.

"We can never talk about it," I said, sitting down on a curb and staring absently at the parking lot. "We can never think about them, never go find them."

"He's right," my doppelganger called out. "I hate being us sometimes."

"Isn't there any hope?" a thin older man from the group asked.

I shrugged. "If someone or something comes along and takes us there, then we'll know we're really out, because whoever had us captive can't fake what they dont know. So there's a chance it just can't come from us."

"What about us?" an unfamiliar voice asked.

We all looked over in unison.

A teenage boy of about eighteen or nineteen stood by the chain-link fence. Behind him, a jagged oval in space wavered, its edges ethereal cyan. Inside that oval, and beyond it, lay the exact same suburban street but under a clear blue sky. The boy peered at us. "Y'all wanna go? This place looks rough. One thing though - we're going to need your help."

"What with?" Jay asked, stepping forward.

It didn't surprise me. He'd already volunteered once - volunteered to stay behind and man an empty world on the off chance humanity might return. This was the kind of man that did what was needed.

Was he the kind of man I should try to be? Since I could make choices that weren't lonely and selfish.

I could actually care about people!

A strange shadow that had been following me my whole life had somehow, during my trial of insanity, been lifted. It had left with that other shadow, the grinning and hungry one, and not a trace of either remained. I was a human being, just like everyone else, and I could *care.* The thought brought inexplicable tears to my eyes.

The boy grinned with excitement. "It'll be tough, but it'll also be awesome. We found her - and we're gonna do the mother of all prison breaks."

Jay went to reply, but I beat him to it. I stood up abruptly, leaving the curb - and the sidelines - behind.

"Yes. We'll help."

My fingers, ice.

My hand, clenched and numb.

My arm, burning

A torrential force continually assaults every sense and nerve. Am I gripping a branch a razor's breadth from the edge of a massive waterfall? It threatens to tear me down and destroy me at every surge. Between constant bouts of near-suffocation, I writhe, fight, and struggle to catch a single breath. The roar drowns out all sensible sensations, leaving nothing but random violent swells smashing against my face over and over and over each lungful of air, at the end of all endurance and hope, I manage to find a single free gasp.

I stumble forward, suddenly free - for a split second, a moment, a heartbeat.

A phone? A phone! My good old subconscious is still on my side. I was already heading for it. It knew, somehow.

I grasped it, but hesitated. What did I have? What senses, what mental objects? Sight a phone, blank white, smudged fingers were those my hands? Memories were beyond reach a fog, a storm what could I do to reach him?

Nothing. I couldn't do anything at all.

But he could reach *me.*

I took a deep breath - real air this time, and useless against that far more horrible kind of suffocation - and lifted the phone immediately to my ear. Time would be short. I felt imminently pursued. That, in itself, was another mental object. I filed it with the few others in my possession.

"The only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice," I forced out, choking on thickness in my throat, my voice unused for some unknown time. "The Crushing Fist GLORWOC"

The click came even as I spoke. He'd heard my random keywords. So filled with concern and desperation, his voice shot adrenaline through me. "Christ, where are you?"

"Heath," I gasped out. "I **looked.**"

"God, I'm sorry - I need your location, maybe I can -"

I shook my head. "I'm broken."

"Stop repeating yourself," he responded.

I wavered in place. "Am I repeating myself?"

"Tell me something - *anything!*"

Come on, brain I kept the phone pressed against my pounding head, my strobing sight blinking erratically around the room as I felt the impending drumbeats quicken.  What did I have? My split-second was ending, and the waters were roaring back across my face as I sank once more.

"White white walls" I lifted my free hand. "Smudges on my fingers" That was it for my sight. I put my crumbling focus on my hearing. "Pounding footsteps, heading my way." On to touch warmth leaking from my nose, cold bubbling at my feet and, for smell, the tang of metal.

The clicking-together of a few separate mental objects - the fact that I was bleeding from my nose - spurred a swirl of other memories. "I got them killed, Heath. Jay, Roger, just normal guys with jobs and lives"

"Just hold on," he told me, compassionate and firm. "We're going to find you."

I needed connecting pieces. I needed to build structure. "When is this?"

His response sounded almost guilty, like he knew he was disappointing me. "Yesterday. Or the day before. Less than a week, for sure."

A heavy bitterness fell across me. "I'm not really talking to you, am I?"

"No but you *did,* recently. These bits and pieces didn't come from nowhere." He added one last message as I began falling back into the flood: "*Don't tell them anything!*"

I wanted to promise that I wouldn't, but I had no idea what he meant. Instead, I clenched my hand harder about the sole unmoving solid point in my existence. I didn't know what it was that I held onto, only that I must, for as long as I could.

The crushing torrent took me once more and I awoke in three places at once.

---

As I descended from the crest of a rough high hill, I regarded the path ahead with hard eyes.

Ongoing patter dripped slowly around me; not rain, but a long-awaited melting above, below, and all around. Endemic white trails still clung to every bole and shadow, awaiting higher angles from the Sun.

A phone conversation several incomprehensible facts and feelings had I acquired this fever-dream from my month of activities in the Appalachian Mountains, or had it been real?

No. This was real. This had all happened

just not necessarily in the order I was experiencing.

And, so, the true enemy had been revealed. I reached a rocky escarpment and looked out at the vast verdant landscape before me. I could feel it in me; all around me. My heart beat with expectant sharpness, and every breath brought fierce energy. This, I could handle. This, I knew how to fight. Despite the limitless danger I was in, I had to grin.

I'd been railing against demons of this particular kind my entire life. I lived this enemy.

Somewhere out there, in a not-too-distant-city, two other versions of me ran free, following the paths that had been lain out for them by time and memory. They were living what I had recently lived. I couldn't change what had happened, but I could warn them stop them... save them from the greatest mistake of our life.

Were my intentions foolish? Maybe but that probably went with the territory. I clenched my fists with excitement and began running down into the world. This was my chance.

I'd **looked.**

I was insane.

I was insane, and suffocating in a tumultuous river of madness that would inevitably drown me but I finally understood.

---

I jumped up, full of adrenaline, and scanned the dark basement. Eerie flickering emerald light danced in through small ground-level windows, illuminating the dusty space with spectral patterns.

I saw no threat.

Immediately, I checked my backpack but nothing, human or otherwise, had disturbed the precious contents within.

A wave of pulsing pain in my forehead briefly brought me low. My whole body ached with exhaustion and bruises. I could still *feel* every sensation of hitting a roof and then arcing to the ground alongside a falling gutter yesterday's terrible mishap. I said a momentary prayer for never having to endure that again.

Fighting through the pain, I sat up, ready to fight in whatever way needed. Pulling out of the fog of sleep, I'd suddenly remembered the chaos of the previous night. Climbing up against the wall, I peered out the small high window.

A curtain of chill touched my face as the light from burning houses reached me. The emerald flames pulsed cold rather than heat, and they towered toward the sky, ever-burning, un-consuming. Half the suburb here was on fire coldfire and, yet, the houses weren't being charred or destroyed. Instead, continual layers of ice seemed to be building upon them.

I could guess at the dangers of icy flames that never went out. Something like that could be a threat to an entire city or worse.

They hadn't spread far during the night, though, despite the incredible rains that had provided fuel for their ice. Floating balls of orange flame - far more natural, yet frighteningly autonomous - circled the outer edge, tapping it with darting fingers of fire. Were they *containing it?* Even slowly extinguishing the coldfire more sentient flames patrolled the streets.

Something massive moved somewhere distant, caught only in glimpses between the houses - a massive hulking thing that seemed to be struggling against a swarm of weird black spheres.

Far closer, my heart skipped a beat as I saw thin silver filaments lying on lawns, sidewalks, and the street. They glittered in the spectral emerald, shining all the way up toward *Christ!*

Beyond the dangers, as I got low and close to the window to peer up, I saw the sky rippling with a vivid patchwork of disparate colors. Effulgent red conflicted with pockmarked yellow, both struggling against a spectral blue as I watched, other patchwork hues stormed past. Each sky was inherently different in cloud composition and angle of light. All seemed to be in stormy chaos.

Reality had come apart while I'd slept.

But I'd gone into the forest, and into the mountains, to help stop this feeling strangely sick, I hunched over my backpack. Nobody had interfered with it. How had this happened? I couldn't seem to recall the exact details of what had gone on in the mountains, now that I was actively trying to remember

*Find out where everyone went.*

Right, that was what I had to do. Burning with determination, I grabbed my things, slung on my backpack, and crept toward the stairs to the first floor.

I miraculously managed to step up each ancient step without making a sound.

Slowly turning the handle, I tried not to breathe too loudly. I had absolutely no way of knowing what was out there -

The sentient ball of flame sort of matched the height of a man. It hovered near the fridge, lightly touching pictures on the fridge - or, actually, the magnets that held them there - and it turned in surprise as it saw me. Or, at least, the motion it made reminded me of a surprised turn.

I bolted for the front door, and burst out into blasting hail and snow coming down from the towering iceflames. The cold was as bad as a physical punch to the face, but I forced myself through, because, as I darted a glance behind me - the flames were following.

Two came out from beyond the corner of a house ahead. I veered sharply on the frozen street and fell roughly on my hands and knees, sliding forward at an alarming pace. Looking left and right quickly, I sighted six sentient flames closing in from different directions. How far could they reach? What did they want? I had to assume they were hostile, from the systematic manner in which they were surrounding me and cutting off routes of escape.

I felt its presence nearby without the need to look. Instead, I calmly reached over with one hand, and down with the other.

The silver noose flicked along my hand, up my arm, and straight to my neck, even as I gripped it to brace against the coming jerk. It still shot jagged red through my awareness, but I didn't die instantly - instead, I brought the wooden knife I'd prepared around and slashed the cord just as I shot up at an angle into a pine tree.

I knew what was coming. I'd endured it once before. That didn't make the gut-wrenching fall any easier.

Smashing down through a tree, I struggled to catch a major branch before I fell too far. The knife had gone, but I was glad for both hands - and the relative softness of evergreen branches. Tumbling and sliding down at a breakneck pace, I hit the ground with both feet and a groan twenty feet outside the circle of flames.

*Get up.*

I am! I'm not going to sit here and die. Crawling forward for a moment, I managed to get to my feet, and then bolted away along ground that was increasingly free of ice. The further I got from the towering green flames, the warmer the air grew, and the more energy I found coursing in through my lungs.

Four blocks away, and satisfied that the flames had ceased to follow, I finally slowed. There didn't seem to be a single part of me left that didn't hurt. I'd been smashed against a roof, thrown to the ground, slapped down along a pine tree and I'd been sleeping poorly, eating almost nothing, and running about an empty world for days. I fell to my knees.

*Get up.*

I nodded. Clambering back up with a gasp, I pushed forward.

I'd seen the base of operations of the men who still maintained the city. It had been a high school, before - but, now the fences and complex brick building served as adequate defenses against the elements and wandering threats.

Watching from afar, I studied the place under the chaotic sky. It wasn't being guarded like a military organization might have guarded such a place, but there *were* still a few men keeping watch on the fences. I could see how uneasy they were with their new sky and randomly terrifying neighbors. The only saving grace of their position - like mine had been, in the basement of that house - was that none of these threats knew of or cared about their presence.

I hadn't been watching for too long when I saw their leader, Jay, pacing the inside of the fence and talking on his cellphone. Moving closer, I began to hear some his conversation.

"The advice you gave us?" he shouted angrily. "I tied up the purple slice, and the thing expanded and busted it right open. We almost got killed out there - two guys didn't make it back."

He paused as someone on the other end responded.

"Oh. We were supposed to tie *ourselves* up when purple slices of sky come overhead? I must have misunderstood I'm sorry."

He nodded his head sadly as the other spoke.

"I don't know if we can do this," he finally said. "It's gone insane here."

He moved away, still talking, but out of hearing range.

I sat in my hiding spot, jaw set. So these people had been warned even *instructed* I'd thought something of the kind when they'd handed out boxes of curiously chosen survival gear but now I knew for certain.

They'd expected this.

But who could have warned them? Who was on the phone?

Would would Heath be talking to *them* on the phone, and ignoring *me?*

The flames had been trying to contain the iceflames, as if they were actually trying to help out or at least protect themselves but they'd chased after me like I was a threat.

Was I a threat?

What was I doing here?

I held my hand to my forehead and clenched my jaw against a random jab of pain.

*Find out where they went.*

Right. If I could just find out where they went everything would work out. I'd fall into the embrace of humanity again, taken care of by what? All my friends?

I'd long ago pushed away everyone I cared about. I'd often told myself it was for their own protection. At some point, I think I just started enjoying being alone. It was easy if things got too bad, I could just run. I was always dodging devastation by refusing to care about anything.

Why did I even *want* to find out where everyone had gone?

When was the last time I'd even talked to Chris or Caitlin? Why were the only two people I really cared about so distant in my memories? People I'd known growing up - people I'd had no choice but to include in my sense of self.

What had Caitlin said to me the last time we'd talked?

*"You only see people you can use"*

I swallowed a lump in my throat. Was she right? It'd taken me this long to understand what she'd meant and now, there was nobody left to see *except* those I could use.

Running a mental hand over the hills and valleys of my mind, I began to understand that something was very wrong with my -

*Find out where they went.*

Right. I winced against the pain, stood up slowly, and began creeping toward an unguarded portion of the high school grounds.

As I drew closer, I saw Roger standing by himself just behind a corner, a lit cigarette in his hand

---

Rolling awake, I looked around in confusion. Right home. In bed. I clambered up and moved to my computer. When was this? Which me was I?

Okay laptop's here it hasn't been taken yet or was it duplicated?

I wrote out an email, even if he wasn't responding. *I'm losing my story structure here* My thoughts, my brain, my life, my grammar

I sat in place, reflecting on why I even wanted to find other aware people. Chris, Caitlin all the people who might have ever been my friends I'd left them all. I could handle anything on my own, right?

Typing the words made the admission harder, somehow. *I bit off more than I can handle alone*

I could feel my grip tiring, the exhaustion burning in my arm. The waters of madness had reached a force seemingly beyond enduring.

*Let's retrace,* I told myself.

I saw the other me where? I saw him out there in the suburbs, I took my car back, I lost him but then I found that trap in the bell tower, and, by the time I'd reached home, he was gone and he'd taken my laptop. Right.

I swore. The laptop - and the email I thought I'd typed - were gone.

What *did* I have? I brought my cellphone out to check on it. It hadn't been tampered with, but, judging by the nightmares roving around outside and the shattered sky, the other me's cellphone *had* been a copy and somebody had interacted with it.

Had they noticed the sky rending apart moments after messing with it? I doubted they'd have made the connection.

Now who was with the aware survivors? Who had claimed to know me? Oh wait no, I didn't know that yet. That had been the other me

I was convinced I could work through insanity if I just linked enough chains of logic. Was that how madness trapped people? By giving them false hope?

I shook my head. I had to assume there was a way through this.

Slinging on my backpack, I went downstairs and out the front door. A few blank-eyed neighbors were around. One was mowing his lawn, one was washing his car, and one was walking his dog.

Wagging his tail happily, the long-haired brown dog pulled his absent master toward me. I held out my hand, and he licked it in greeting.

"You," I told him, laughing. "You're real. And making the best of it, I see."

He barked once, and then moved on, sniffing his way down the sidewalk.

It hadn't occurred to me to wonder where I *really* was, despite the experiences and memories blurring in my awareness. A lighthearted dog had wandered between the worlds with ease. I couldn't be somewhere entirely horrible, could I? Not if there was a dog here

unless I'd imagined him, of course. I'd been totally convinced he was real, too, without any reason for such a conviction. Was I getting worse? Would I lose all self-analytical ability soon?

And why should I fight for sanity, anyway? What was I trying to accomplish with my life? I'd never once softened my grip on my own solitary and bitter behavior. Reality was full of nightmares in the shadows, and I'd sought out those shadows my entire life. I had a one track mind, and I was my own self-fulfilling prophecy.

This wasn't about the *events* that had happened. This was about *me* - my actions, and how I felt about what I'd done.

I suddenly knew where I needed to be.

Running along the sidewalk under that eerie multi-colored sky, I chose my destination with fury. I would never make it in time and I hadn't made it in time so I fast-forwarded a bit.

It was this house. One unassuming suburban house among all the others - I'd only known the first time by that strange sense of narrative importance. It had simply *popped out.*

I pushed through the unlocked back door and headed for the basement, even as I heard the screams ringing out. I wasn't too late this time.

Heading down the stairs, I covered my mouth and forced down revulsion. The dirt-floored and cinder-block-lined room stank of vileness and blood.

The other me - the first me - stood over a brutally wounded older man who had been tied to a chair.

"Can you not see yourself?" I asked, horrified and disgusted. 

The other me turned slowly, his eyes wide, his features surprised. "It's you - you're the one that's been hunting me"

I balled my fists in rage. "Can you not stand apart from your own emotions and see what you're doing objectively?"

"Roger knows where they went," he responded, desperate. "I *have to know.* I have to find out where they went."

The older man spat blood. "I will *never* tell you, you son of a bitch. You'll have to kill me."

"And he will," I stated flatly. "Don't tell this bastard a thing."

The other me dropped the fork he'd been holding. "Wait it didn't happen this way. This is not how things went."

"We're insane," I countered. "How do *you* know?"

"Because I feel guilty," he breathed, staring at his bloodied hands. "And your mind is just like mine. You feel guilty, too."

"But we didn't do it yet," I said, rushing over and untying Roger. "Get outta here!"

"You two are fucking crazy," he gasped, running up the stairs in pursuit of freedom.

My doppelganger stared after him, stunned. "He sees two of us"

I nodded. "I left you in a cave, years ago, to be eaten by some sort of spider-creature."

"God," he breathed, blinking as he tried to piece together his fragmented reality. "That was *me?* I thought -" He lifted his gaze. "Rule one of off-screen deaths if you don't witness it yourself, they're always coming back."

It was a basic rule of writing, and I was an author I should have known. "How did you survive? Where have you been all this time? Why are you here?" I asked him. "What's driving you to" My eyes brimmed as I regarded the blood on the floor and chair. "this? This isn't us."

"I *think* I'm you," he replied, leaning weakly against a wall. "I mean, I *am you*, now, since we're remembering this later. But I'm missing so many memories and there's a voice in my head urging me on with such strength I just can't resist it"

The realization hit me with an almost tangible force. "Something sent you."

He realized it at the same time. "Something used me *edited me* and sent me off into the world to find out where everyone went"

"What do you mean?" I asked, moving toward the stairs to escape the gore. "Everyone's still here, they're just passive, and unaware like a disease took their willpower."

"Is that what you see?" he asked. "Because I think we only see people we can use. I don't see anybody at all - I see an empty world, except for Roger and his colleagues."

I frowned, and moved while I thought. He followed me upstairs, and then out onto the street, where we sat under the patchwork sky. "I was just thinking about that," I told him, despondent. "This world is painfully lonely but this is how we remember it. This is, more or less, how our life was anyway."

He nodded slowly, his gaze distant. "Insanity's the worst."

"Yeah." I kicked the pavement idly - even in the throes of madness, I was amazed at how detailed the street was. I could see every little swirl in black, shot through by cracks because that was how madness worked: you saw what you wanted to see, and believed it utterly. As deep as you wanted your examination of something to go, that was how deep you would see, like a fractal dream.

"So what now?" he asked.

I sat in silence for a time, until something occurred to me. "Heath said not to tell *them* anything. Do you think it's not over? Do you think the same unknown force that sent you out with an agenda still has us? It wants to know where everyone went"

He stood in shock. "The smudges on our fingers!"

I stood in shock, about to speak.

He cut me off. "That's the truth of all this now, isn't it? But keep it to yourself, or they'll know."

I laughed, marveling at our own breakthrough. "In that case I think I know how to get us out of this. We *are* going to find out where everyone went. That's the only way. We'll see this thing through to the end. We'll play it out the way it really happened because we already know where everyone went. We just have to get to that point in the story."

His cheek trembled. "If we do that, Roger dies. Because he *did* die. Is that something you can live with?"

I didn't say anything.

The stormy technicolor sky roiled overhead, rumbling ominously. I knew that what was about to happen would be very, very bad for the people I hadn't cared enough about that my solitary and bitter choices had brought them untold pain but *their* reality wasn't a malleable mess like mine. I could never make up for what had been taken from them.

I didn't say anything, because I couldn't.

All I could do was nod.

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31p7e6/i_think_i_may_have_somehow_missed_the_end_of_the/)

I've always found something innately beautiful about raw nature. It's existed for time beyond measure, and it'll outlast us all. There are vast galactic clusters and long-dead stars so far away that we still see them shine, and there are organisms of every size that feast upon one another in a chaos of life, death, and survival.

As I descended from the crest of a rough high hill, where one half of that spirit was evident, and then pushed my way through the brush and tangle below, where the other half ruled, I wondered at the ability of nature to still exist the way it did out in the wilds. With all the cities humanity has carved into the earth, with all the billions of us walking and driving and flying about, how could whole mountain ranges still sit out here so free of our contamination?

Ongoing patter dripped slowly around me; not rain, but a long-awaited melting above, below, and all around. Endemic white trails still clung to every bole and shadow, awaiting higher angles from the Sun. I paused where I stood, taking several moments to catch my breath and feel the wind.

I frowned.

I had the strangest feeling

I turned my head, as if trying to listen to some distant note.

Something was wrong.

I hurried on.

It took the better part of the day to reach a road. By then, the sky was a blazing sea of drifting orange, and I was vitally tired. I sat on the curb for a time, idly watching the traffic it was rather busy for some backwoods road in northwestern West Virginia, or wherever I was, but no way in Hell was I going to hitch a ride with a stranger. It was too risky - nobody could even be allowed to guess at what I'd been doing.

The oncoming night brought a returning chill that refroze the wet ground. I despised the cold, but it did make the walking easier. Rather than slogging through squelching mud, I moved quickly across frozen earth, following the road. All I needed to do was find a building - any building, really - and charge my laptop.

After that, a single power-button press would hook me back into civilization.

Gloom set in, replacing fiery orange with fuzzy blue, which itself faded ever so slowly into impenetrable black. Still, I walked.

I dwelled on the high tension that had strung itself along the skies of my mind. Distant, barely visible, but most definitely there and very disconcerting. What was wrong? I ran through the possibilities for hours, but lacked the data to draw any strong conclusions.

The ground changed underneath my shoes, and the wind began slicing perpendicular to me - I'd come to a larger road. A few scattered cars rolled past, interspersed among heavy trucks bound for some distant city. I knew which direction I needed to go, and headed on without slowing. Eventually, I stopped to rest.

After four weeks in rugged forest, the road's edge felt like a luxurious hotel. I sat deep among thick bushes, hopefully far enough in to avoid being seen. The cloudy sky hid the stars and kept me blind, but the darkness didn't bother me. There were terrible things out in the night sometimes, sure, but the open sky and quiet forest felt empty and calm. This was not one of those places where horrible fates lurked. This was simply nowhere important.

I awoke to burgeoning grey light. The passing vehicles had kept me half-awake, so I was less rested than I might have been otherwise, but I felt safer for not having gone completely out of it.

Walking along the road in a drifting ocean of swirling dawn light, I kept my thoughts simmering, not wanting to obsess too much over the strange feeling that something was terribly wrong.

Warm relief welled up around my heart as I sighted - at long last - a gas station. It sat at a gravelly corner in the country road, quietly soaking up near-noon spring rays. Worries dispelled, I marched right up to the decrepit once-white building, eager to get back to civilization. The door opened easily, and a bell chirruped above me as I swept in.

The clerk ignored me, opting instead to stare blankly at a small television set on the counter.

It was dingy and quiet deeper within, but I shrugged off my inexplicable discomfort and grabbed a few snacks and supplies from the shelves.

I found an outlet, and got my laptop out of my backpack. It lit up without issue, and I sighed happily. A flood of messages and emails would inform me of the situation at large.

I frowned.

No signal. No wireless at all - password-protected or otherwise.

*Of course.* It would have been too easy to simply have it all *work*, right? No, we're going to put me through the gauntlet, here

A curious screeching noise echoed outside, like a car engine straining against waking cold, and I froze. It was already happening had our projected timeline changed? Were events moving forward at a faster rate than we'd predicted?

I had to contact somebody. I couldn't wait.

"Can I make a call?" I asked, heading up to the clerk.

He turned, watched me without reaction for a moment and then narrowed his eyes, as if he'd only just now understood my question. A feeble wave of his hand indicated the positive, and I picked up the phone by the register as he went back to watching his show.

I frowned, and tried to recall phone numbers for anyone I knew.

God I didn't know any phone numbers by heart. There simply hadn't been a need to remember.

Momentarily unsure about what to do, I stood in place, thinking.

In my pocket, my cellphone vibrated - and I grabbed it, cancelling the call. Who would even be calling me right now? Who would even know that I was back in range of civilization? I couldn't let anyone interact with the contents of my cellphone I didn't recognize the number.

There was no time to delay. I dropped some cash on the counter for the things I'd taken, even though the clerk didn't look or seem to care.

Back in the noon light and warming breezes, I began walking and thinking. I was never one to miss telltale signs. Had the clerk simply been bored, or had something else been wrong with him? The odd delays in his behavior made me wonder if he was alright

I came to a crossroads and stopped. The crossing road seemed wider and more traveled than the one I'd been walking down. I waited for a tick for the cars to clear, and then started forward.

I jumped back.

The cars weren't stopping or slowing for me. They didn't even seem to know I was there. As I'd stepped out, a guy in a truck had turned onto my part of the road - and blown right past me.

I waved at a few passing cars, noticing that none of the drivers so much as looked over. They just kept driving, their eyes held straight ahead. That, combined with my growing sense that something was off, made me very cautious. Was something happening to people out here? Had a disease spread that made people less aware or something?

Or was it me? Was something wrong with *me?* The clerk had reacted to me somewhat, so I knew I hadn't become invisible or something I didn't *see* anything wrong with my hands, arms, or legs I felt around, confirming my month-long beard what was going on here?

Something might have been wrong with all of the people driving by or something might have been wrong with *me.* If I couldn't trust my perceptions, how could I know the true nature of anything I was doing? Could I even cross the street? What if the cars I was seeing *were not the cars that were actually there?* I would step out onto pavement and get crushed.

My pulse began racing as the gears of my logic started to grind. I stared up and down the long country highway. If my perceptions were flawed, what was I supposed to see to clue myself in? The mind believes what the brain perceives if I thought I was looking at these particular passing cars, then no amount of staring or concentration would compromise that evaluation. Hell, there could be people stopped right now, asking a crazy guy standing at the side of the road if he was alright

but all I heard were the rising and falling whines of passing engines.

I couldn't cross the street any street what had I *actually* said and done in the gas station back there? Why had the clerk looked at me so strangely?

My head did hurt a little bit though I'd chalked it up to poor diet and travel fatigue.

What had I been doing out in the woods this last month? I knew what I *thought* I'd been doing but, objectively, the idea did sound ridiculous. I only trusted it because I trusted myself, and the experiences I'd had.

If I couldn't trust those how did I even know I was me?

I guess some things you have to take for granted

Bending down, I grabbed a dirty white shirt out of my backpack. I'd had a marker, too, in a side pocket, but I couldn't find it crafting some daub from mud at the side of the road, I quickly wrote out some words on my impromptu shirt-based sign, and I held it up.

*HELP. I AM BLIND*

Staring out at the crossroads, I held the shirt up at each stop sign in turn, my eyes wide. I saw the cars stopping, starting, coming, and going... *but how could I know for sure that they were really where I thought they were?*

I couldn't stay here forever. I had to keep going.

*Twenty-eight, twenty-nine thirty.*

Holding the shirt up like a desperate flag of surrender, I edged out onto the pavement, body steeled against a terrible invisible impact at any moment. Unable to even breathe, I inched across the country road, heart rate spiking as I crossed each faded painted line. Heady and feeling on the verge of passing out, I leapt the last two feet, and tumbled to the gravel on the other side.

Was anyone watching me? Had I looked insane and ridiculous? Were they going to try to help me?

I waited, but none of the passing drivers seemed to notice or care.

Standing slowly, I tucked the shirt-sign into my pocket, and started walking again, not at all comforted.

As the afternoon wore on, I debated my personal facts in an endless and painful cycle. Objectively, I had all the behaviors of a mentally ill homeless man. I had an inexplicable sense of impending doom, a rough demeanor, and I didn't even trust my own eyes and ears. It was an understatement to say that I didn't like what was happening.

But all this would be fine if I could just get home I just needed to get back there and figure everything out. I could reconnect to society and clear my head, right?

That internal discussion fell away as I found myself walking up an onramp to Route 79.

I actually knew where this highway was it ran parallel to the mountains, at some distance. I'd actually driven on it to get close to where I needed to go. It wouldn't be long now.

It was strangely peaceful out. Knowing where I was - and where my car sat ready - helped me remain calm. There was every chance something had gone wrong with the people in West Virginia, and I'd get in my car, drive back to Columbus, and find the world churning along as usual.

Eventually, I turned away from the highway and passed a few farmsteads. I knocked on a few doors, but the people within - as I watched through their windows - went about their dinner preparations without paying me a single heed. By the time the sun hit the horizon, just as I turned down the last vaguely familiar turn and approached the hidden pocket where I'd left my car, I was certain something sinister was going on. Instead of approaching my car straight on, I darted through the trees, my suspicions running high.

And there sat my beautiful old Hyundai. I'd never cared much about its appearance until that moment, when it seemed at once the most decrepit and most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Dark red, and rusted a bit about the wheel wells, it waited faithfully for my return.

Before I could get near it, someone climbed inside and slammed the door.

Suddenly furious, I bolted toward it, moving through the trees as fast as I dared.

The car roared to life. The silence and calm of nature ruptured instantly, replaced by a machine rumble of human design. The driver within looked down briefly, and then flicked on his headlights. He pulled out onto the pavement and swerved heavily, nearly hitting a tree.

He'd seen me - or, at least, he'd seen my silhouette in the tree-shaded gloom.

And I'd seen him - completely, by the light of his cellphone.

I stood in place for a moment, thoughts cold and calculating. I'd been completely right: something terrible had happened.

The other driver - was me.

Alright alright what was the plan? What did I need to do? Head him off, find out where he'd come from, what he was looking for how had this happened?

What were the facts? What did I know? Keep cool, think it through

Normal people were acting lethargic, and having great trouble seeing or responding to my presence. I'd spent a month in the woods, as far as I knew I had something to protect in my cellphone, something which I had spent weeks searching for out there and there was another me running around, slightly ahead of me, oblivious to the nature of what had been done to us.

Where would I go, if I were me?

Home.

I had to get home.

That, and I had to contact Heath and I had to make sure I reached him *first,* before that other me talked to him.

Fast food. That was where I needed to go. Somewhere with WiFi.

Running down long country roads, I headed for one of the farmsteads I'd checked out. Opening the front door gently in case my hypothesis was wrong, I walked slowly past the family eating dinner at their kitchen table. They ate in eerie silence, saying nothing though that just might have been how they ate together. It was impossible to know.

Looking around, I found a set of keys and then walked right out to the driveway and tried them in the closest truck. It roared to life, not caring whether I was its rightful owner or not.

"I'm taking your truck," I shouted, testing the family's reaction as I watched them through the window.

They didn't react.

"I'll bring it back eventually," I called.

Pulling out onto the road, I took one last look at the house - no reaction. That was that, then.

A few minutes later, I stopped at the nearest McDonald's. I parked down the street and walked, not wanting to be connected to a stolen vehicle.

Pushing inside, the familiar smells and noises immediately lessened some of my stress. I tried not to look too hard at the workers who were slowly and silently going through the motions of making food.

The world was still here. No matter what *was* happening, there was still a chance to clear it all up and fix things. I pulled my laptop out and set it up, eyeing the other patrons.

An old man and his wife sat in the far corner, munching on fries. They stared rather absently at their food as they ate. I watched them for quite some time, but neither spoke. The old man's milky-white eyes seemed perfectly paired with his blank stare

A teenager in rather baggy clothes sat at another table, carefully placing one chicken nugget at a time in his open mouth, moving and chewing at the same pace as -

His eyes jumped to mine for the barest split second.

"Hey!" I shouted, leaping up as he kicked away from his seat and darted for the door. "Wait, I'm not going to hurt you!"

He got caught on the doors, his baggy shirt sleeve catching on something just long enough for me to catch up. He pushed frantically as I came near. "Don't touch me!"

"Why would I touch you?" I asked, following him as he continued out into the parking lot.

He slowed when I slowed, remaining twenty feet away. "How are you normal?"

"I don't even know what's going on," I told him, keeping my hands visible and open. "I just came out of the woods after a month-long camping trip. What the hell's wrong with everybody?"

He stared at me for three heartbeats, sizing me up. Finally, he said three words: *"Don't touch 'em!"* and moved to run off. Just before he took his third step, he paused, turned, and threw me some sort of insect.

I stared at him in confusion. "What's this?"

"Sorry," he said quickly. "I meant a *bag*, not a *bug.*"

"Oh." I nodded, opening it to find a foul-smelling pile of gritty particles inside. "We all make mistakes."

"If you do touch one of 'em, rub that on the spot right away. It'll burn that crap right off. You got like ten seconds." He darted off without another word.

I hadn't been even remotely about to touch any of the oddly-acting folk, but I decided to take his warning - and his folk remedy - to heart. Whatever this disease was, it must have been communicable anyone who tried to help fell victim to it as well

But what did this have to do with my doppelgnger? Where did he and I fit into all of this?

I reached for my cellphone, and checked that it had not been tampered with. This couldn't have been the fault of anything I'd brought back could it? I shook my head after running through a few possibilities.

That motion brought back the pain I'd been feeling, and I kneeled for a moment, trying to catch my breath against the dull throbbing. I focused against the pain and let it pass.

Walking slowly back inside, I gave the interior a quick and wary scan. I didn't want to be caught off guard if the slow-moving and oblivious folk suddenly became hostile

And so tired. Why was I so tired? My head felt intermittently foggy.

It didn't matter. Logging on to the restaurant's WiFi, I wrote out an email.

*Heath - there's something very wrong here. People are acting strange, and I think there's a copy of me out there. Has he tried to contact you?*

The response came back rather quickly.

"What's your location?"

I frowned.

*Why's that matter?*

"I need to know where you are."

I closed my laptop slowly. That was not at all the response I'd expected. Had he been compromised? Or had my email been intercepted by someone else entirely?

Fighting that strange tiredness, I pushed my way out of the restaurant, headed down the street, and recovered the truck. On to Columbus

I drove for hours, keeping silent to match the darkness flowing by my windows.

For a few minutes, I did turn on the radio, but the music seemed to hurt my awareness directly through my ears.

At some point, I was forced to pull over and sleep. I pulled the truck off the side of the road to avoid being seen, and curled up in the backseat.

That weird fatigue must have hit me harder than I'd expected, because it was noon by the time I woke. Suddenly full of terror that I'd fallen far behind the other me, I pulled back on the road and headed out.

I made it to Columbus proper in just a few hours, and drove through familiar streets with an eye out for the behavior of those I passed. They all walked and moved with subtle slowness, and ignored me. One old man crossed the street right in front of me, and I was forced to brake as quickly as I could.

Low on gas, I began looking for a station - and that was when I saw it through a row of trees and houses.

My car!

I knew it immediately from the rust spots above the wheel wells. Parking abruptly one block away, I got out and ran toward it. It was just *sitting there* on the side of the street, as if its operator had simply come to visit somebody here.

Looking around, I saw a blank-eyed man mowing his lawn under what warmth the spring Sun was providing a kid rolling around in idle circles on a colorful plastic tricycle and an American flag whipping up and down in the wind.

No sign of the other me.

My keys still worked - though I hadn't really doubted that they would - and I revved the engine to life without hesitation. I felt much better having my car back, and, with it, some semblance of control. Perhaps there was a way out of this, if I could just get home

I coasted quietly down the street, gaze alert. Just as I turned a corner I saw him. 

He was hiding behind a bush, studying the spot where our car had been. He wore the same clothes and backpack as I had on was that how he'd used my car? Had our belongings been duplicated as well? What phenomenon - 

The phone!

Was his cellphone also a duplicate of mine? Had he interacted with it? Had he *used it?*

I slammed the car to a halt and leapt out.

He was gone by the time I came back around the corner on foot, but there was only one way he could have fled. I had to warn him...! Running between the houses, I came to a long, low valley of backyards, overcast by a heavy and looming sky. Two very different families sat outside, eating idly and slowly at picnic tables.

Where had he gone?

I saw the back door on the third house down slowly move closed.

My every muscle on fire with fatigue and exertion, I ran for it, but found it locked. Looking in the glass panels - and then the kitchen window - I tried to see if he was inside.

"You crazy, boy?" an older man asked, and I turned suddenly at finally being spoken to first. It was about time I met somebody who could give me answers, and -

I froze. He had a gun. Christ - was he worried about people touching him, too? Or was it for self-defense? I needed to know what was going on before I made a fatal mistake.

"What are you doing?" he prompted quietly. "You stupid? Have you touched any of them?"

I shook my head slowly, staring at his eyes and hands during alternating heartbeats. Which would give away his intent to fire first? "Just tell me what you want me to do," I said softly, even as a few drops of rain began tapping on my forehead. The families at the picnic tables didn't seem to notice. "If you could just tell me what's going on -"

His eyes widened at that, and he lifted the gun a little higher.

A shot went off before I had time to react, but I didn't feel struck. Nerves afire, I ran - straight through the bushes behind me. 

As I ran, I heard a door open roughly near where I'd been, and the old man shouted *"What the ever loving hell?"*

That shout was followed by a single exclamation: "Christ!"

My voice.

Which direction would he go? I had to warn him if it was me, I'd go through the house.

I waited against the bricks near the front door, wondering just how long I dared stay.

The rain began falling harder. Would it interfere with the old man's gun? I shivered and waited some more, ready to run at the first sign of danger but I heard nothing. In fact

I tried the front door, and it opened smoothly.

It didn't seem like he'd come this way. I looked around the front hallway, and then up the stairs. My peculiar intuition reconstructed a path he might have taken if he *had* come through the house I had to make sure. Climbing the stairs carefully, I inched down the upper hallway, entering a miasma of foul rot. Had something died up here?

Rain pattered on the roof above as I passed two rooms where blank-eyed children sat staring at textbooks in a mockery of studying.

Not there and not in there

The master bedroom.

I entered the space with a hand over my nose. Three lumpy corpses lay under the sheets, rotting, horrific, and bloody evidently someone had not wanted to go out the way their children had. Judging by the ghastly arrangement of lumps, they must have taken one with them, and then been too pained to hurt the other two

Eyes brimming from the residual pain and terror I felt still echoing about the room - like desperation and fear hiding in darkness - I approached a sweet and humid breeze.

The open window - he'd escaped along the roof! Damnit!

I ran as fast as I could back out and down the stairs, hoping to catch up to him somehow. 

If he looked in that cellphone if it was like mine God

What options did I have left?

Out on the street, I almost tripped over four children. They stared blankly at one another, feebly kicking a ball back and forth.

As I got back in my car and prepared to drive off, it struck me: these people had no idea anything was wrong with them. These kids were playing ball in the street to them, life must be going on as normal. Were they speaking to one another somehow, in a way I couldn't understand? Or were they just imagining themselves holding conversations?

I knew, then, what I had to do. I had to try to find that old man and get some explanation out of him. Home could wait, at least for a little while. The only people left conscious and aware *had* to have the answers because nobody else even knew anything was wrong.

	<TEXT> Love this post. I also think there's a responsibility inherent in being basically *the* place for horror on the Internet - 2.7 million subscribers means this place is far and away the central hub of new content. Restricting certain types of stories means people just don't really get to see those subgenres at all. They're tucked away in very small subreddits and seen by very few people, leading to a feedback cycle where authors are less inclined to contribute. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is the girl on the lake in any of the earlier stories?

I don't normally do this (in terms of overt discussion about story elements), but the girl on the lake is an homage to a fantastic CreepyPasta that particularly impacted me. It's weirdly difficult to find... as in, these are the only places it seems to exist.

The original author was [Emma Froh](http://afroh13.deviantart.com/), and I only heard this story while participating on a Chilling Tales podcast - it was a memorial, since she had recently died. Her story stuck with me, and it was on my mind as I was writing.

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/31d8se/i_think_i_may_have_somehow_missed_the_end_of_the/)

I picked a serviceable watch from the display, and then reached for my wallet. I counted out the cash, but, then what did it matter? I put the money back in my wallet and departed, too tired from walking to feel bad about technically stealing a watch from an empty store.

And, too, my thoughts were elsewhere.

It was just past noon by the time I arrived at the general area of my apartment. Still four blocks away, I stayed in the noisy shade near a billowing evergreen tree, and I watched the one highest monument on the near horizon: a church bell tower. I was honestly surprised that it wasn't ringing by itself in the intensely surging afternoon winds.

Just above the pinnacle of the bell tower, the sky hung black and glowering, threatening a tremendous storm at any moment. I'd thought the sky a cave ceiling the day before; that effect had become even more pronounced. Even though I was standing out in the streaming winds and watching the distance, I still felt a little claustrophobic.

The bell tower was the perfect vantage point for this neighborhood. From it, I would be able to see my apartment and everything surrounding it. I knew what I had to do.

The church itself, like many other buildings around, had been left unlocked. The enormously thick wooden doors vibrated slightly with the gusting winds, but they did not open until I pulled them directly with much of my strength.

The environs inside were startlingly normal. If someone had been hanging out in here, they might have never guessed the rest of the world had vanished. It was just somebody's neighborhood church. Velvet-lined pews faced a quiet and shaded altar, all crowned by lovingly hand-painted parables on the arching ceilings high above.

I sensed a few traces of faded despair and residual pain, but that was all drowned out by an almost glowing sense of peace and devotion devotion, above all, to the belief that everything was going to be alright. I supposed that made sense.

Although it was rather startling how clear those sensations felt. They were practically a scent in the air; or a kind of almost visible spectral light. Were emotional residues more obvious now that the chaotic ocean of daily human feelings had gone? I wondered if the traditional belief might hold some weight - could the hope and faith people imbued in places like this actually have the power to repel evil?

I would have to bet the negative on that one.

Moving through the side halls, I found a set of winding stairs. Numerous signs warned me not to ascend unless I was *staff only.* Staff? Curious word for those who worked at a church. Made it almost sound like a business.

To call the tight staircase rickety would have been soaring praise. I stepped carefully on each creaking piece of wood, and the spiraling walls came so close that both my shoulders began brushing against their narrowing surfaces. After adjusting my backpack to fit, I actually considered turning back lest I get stuck like I was in some sort of tightening cave passage - but the final door soon appeared around the corner.

Locked? No that was a relief. I didn't want to waste needless time, and I did not relish the thought of searching through some priest's office for keys.

Pushing through that door was like splashing into a busy stream. Violent winds surged through the small square space at a near constant rate. Three of the walls sat open to the air, with high handrails as the only barrier to the void beyond. From here, I could see a vast sea of bare trees swaying with the oncoming storm. I turned back to my task.

And there sat the bell.

It was smaller than I'd expected.

A rope trembled rapidly in the wind before me. I studied the places where it had been tied, and then carefully undid the knots and moved them to a new spot.

This was the best vantage point, most definitely, and therefore the most dangerous place to be. My pursuit seemed very personal somehow, and I had no doubt my hunter would know I was going to try to get home and find answers. My hunter also knew I was no fool, therefore, it knew I would try to scout the area before I made my play.

Slipping back down the stairs, I left the church just as I had found it - calm and quiet. Pushing out through the heavy doors, I re-entered the growing winds with a sense that time was growing short.

I held my backpack in place and ran for the trees.

Breathing hard from both exertion and sudden fear, I found a place to hide among thick bushes and evergreen trees roughly one block from my apartment. Crouched just between two brown-bricked buildings, I could see the front door from here, along with either direction up and down the street.

I waited, heart pounding.

The wind's illusion of busyness faded as I remained still and grew accustomed to the patterns in that swaying motion. The trees wavered the bushes wobbled the grass ran with waves of rolling air but nothing moved.

This street, like so many others, was dead and empty.

A chilly and humid slice came in along the storm winds, and I shuddered. For a time, I thought I was being overly cautious paranoid, even, to assume that my hunter somehow knew me or where I was headed I weighed the risk of entering my apartment blindly.

A single exultant peal rippled out across the black clouds above.

The bell!

The hunter *was here!* But also firmly located blocks away.

Burning with sudden adrenaline, I bolted from my hiding spot and ran straight for my apartment door.

My pursuer would realize what I'd done almost immediately - I'd tied the rope to the door itself, and then carefully positioned everything so that someone entering without knowledge of the trap would ring the bell at least once. It would know what I'd done, and it would know where *I* was in turn.

That meant I didn't have much time. I started the timer on my watch, and it began counting down the estimate I'd made.

I crashed through the living room, stomped up the stairs, and kicked my way into my own room.

My stuff my stuff had been moved! Nothing lay where I remembered it. Somebody had been to *my room* in particular and my computer was on. I entered my password to log on.

It didn't work.

Well, it *had* been awhile frowning, I tried another password I commonly used.

It worked.

I went through my files quickly, noticing that things had been moved and files had been accessed during the last month when I'd been gone. Who the hell had been here? What had they been looking for? Confusion rising, I tried to make sense of it.

I'd been assuming that I was being pursued in possibly the same manner as all the people that had disappeared but what if it was just me?

I looked down at my backpack, slung briefly on the floor next to me.

What if it was for the contents of my pack? I'd spent a month in the goddamn woods for -

My watch began beeping.

Pulse racing, I silenced it quickly, grabbed all the nearby papers I could and my laptop! Yes! I stuffed it into the top of my pack and darted down the stairs, heading for the front door - I would go out the front purposely, assuming my hunter would shoot for the back to head off the route it expected me to use.

But what if it had guessed that, too?

I didn't have time to react. I pushed through my front door and into waiting, grasping hands.

I fought viciously for a moment, but a few shouts brought me down.

"Hey, stop!"

Looking around in agitated confusion, I found myself surrounded by at least half a dozen men. The one that had had grabbed me let go, but did not back off very far. His imposing expression and harsh features were betrayed by his casual tone. "This the guy, Roger?"

Behind him, the older man nodded. "That's him."

A particularly strong gust of wind nearly straightened the shoulder-length brown hair of the man who seemed to be in charge of this little posse. He tilted his head back toward two pickup trucks - one black, one red. Both looked well-worn. "You're going to come with us."

I looked at my building for a brief moment, considering another attempt to run. My pursuer would just now be reaching the back yard "Alright."

He grabbed my arm with surprising strength, and pulled me along as the men scattered toward the two trucks. I couldn't help but notice they didn't have guns well, at least not out in plain sight.

Their leader, my temporary captor, spoke just loud enough for me to hear him over the whipping wind. "Don't ask stupid questions."

Don't ask stupid questions? That was word-for-word what the other guy had -

He lightly shoved me into the back of the lead pickup truck, and climbed in alongside me. Two other men followed - Roger, and an older Chinese man that didn't look tough or brutish. These people didn't seem like thugs at all. They weren't trying to intimidate me, as far as I could tell

The trucks began moving.

"Check his stuff," their long-haired leader ordered. He looked me in the eyes, evaluating my every subtle reaction. Keeping his eyes on me, he lifted a radio from his belt for a brief message. "We found Roger's ghost. Yeah, he's real. Dirty as all hell, too. Looks like he's been through some shit. Checkin' him out on the way."

Heart knotted, I let them take my backpack and cellphone.

I still had a few moments to think of something. I couldn't let them see what was in the bottom of that pack, but my computer was near the top, and it would certainly warrant investigation first.

The older Chinese man rooted through my papers. "What's GLORWOC?" he asked, leafing through some of them.

I'd never heard of it. Had it been something the person invading my space had left behind? Maybe it was a clue. I shook my head and frowned. "I don't know. How do you pronounce it?"

He gave me an odd look, but, after a moment, shrugged off my refusal to answer. He then pulled out my laptop, just as I'd expected. "What's the password?"

I grimaced, trying to look annoyed. If I could start a minor argument, I could buy some time to think. "I'm not gonna give you my password."

"I'm Jay," their leader interrupted, still watching my face for some unknown cues. "I was a plumber. Still am. Nice to meet you. What were you?"

I held out my hand instinctively, but said nothing.

Jay looked down, his eyes unreadable even as his hair leapt back and forth around his face. Slowly, he reached out his hand and shook mine. That ritual done, he looked back at his two men for some reason, and then back at me. "Give us your password. We're not going to do anything with it. We just need to see."

I believed them. I did. It was just -

Roger sat straighter and made a little noise of alarm. "Jay - the phone." He handed it over.

I frowned. What could he possibly have found on it?

Jay studied the phone for a second, and then glared up at me. "What the hell is this?"

"What is *what?*" I asked, genuinely confused. Had Roger planted something on my phone to get me in trouble?

A radio at his belt crackled to life without warning. "Jay, we got somebody over here that claims to know your guy."

Clutching my phone, he reached down with his other hand to answer.

Hope surged in my chest. It was about damn time I got a break. Was it someone I knew? Was it Chris? Had he survived whatever had happened and been on the lookout for me? But, Lord, if they looked deeper in that pack

The trucks turned a corner, and a long, low whine began reaching my ears. Gradually, both vehicles came to a stop.

The men in the truck bed with me froze, and slowly stood.

The men in the cabin of the red truck just behind ours froze, and began looking out their windows.

The men in that truck's bed slowly stood, their fearful gazes sweeping the area.

As the sound intensified, I recognized it implicitly: a tornado siren. Its long crescendo peaked, remained steady, and whined for several long seconds before anyone reacted. The sound filled me with intense fear - not in the least because my favorite horror movies and games had used that very noise to signal the approach of Very Bad Things.

But even without a supernatural component, a tornado siren still meant Very Bad Things for people caught out in the open. With the trucks motionless, I could feel that the wind had picked up to rather incredible strength and it still hadn't started raining.

"God Almighty," Roger mouthed, his grip on the truck's edge white-knuckled.

"Let's go!" Jay shouted, his radio forgotten. He pocketed my cellphone and slammed his hands on the roof of the driver's cabin. "Go!"

They didn't need to be told twice except they didn't start driving. They opened their doors and climbed down to the street. The men in the other truck saw, and began following suit.

Wordlessly but clumsily, as if they'd practiced it but never done it, they pulled heavy wooden boxes down from the truck beds and began handing out the contents.

Jay took a moment to shove my pack into my hands, and then gave me one of the bundles the other men were receiving. "You haven't earned any trust yet, but I guess it doesn't really matter anymore." A subtle grief and fear passed over his rough features, and he looked up at the boiling black sky. "I thought we had more time"

I frowned. It sounded like he meant more by that statement than just a race against the storm.

Sliding my pack on, I freed my hands to investigate the bundle I'd been given.

A variety of objects had been gathered together inside objects both common and weird. Most notably, I lifted a wooden knife from the pile.

The men around me were stuffing everything they could into pockets and packs and anything else they had available. I followed suit, and slid the knife under my belt. It didn't seem like it could really hurt anyone, but they'd passed these collections out for *some* reason.

"Let's go!" Jay shouted again, and an abrupt motion took over the group as each man noticed and began running after the others. I followed in back, wondering why the hell we'd abandoned the trucks to proceed on foot. I could have slipped away, I knew but intuition kept me near the only other human beings in the city as they ran from dangers unknown.

I had no idea where we were headed. All I could do was follow the men down one identical suburban street after another and they, in turn, could only follow Jay as he kept up an unrelenting pace. Many of my muscles began straining with little bits of fire as we ran, but the fear was strong enough to ensure I would run to my very collapse if so needed.

I felt it before I saw it. A slight purple glint came under my focus - I'd already been looking right at it, even before it had appeared. It was maybe a block ahead, right at the corner of someone's expansive lawn.

Someone shouted over the roaring winds, and the others noticed, too.

Jay turned our angle suddenly and headed for it.

We clustered around it, in awe.

"It's actually happening," one man commented, eyes wide.

Roger just shook his head and frowned with pained fear.

Jay began rooting through his own pockets.

Maybe five feet above the ground, it floated and glimmered quietly, a jagged little glowing purple line - a rip in nothing. As we watched, it began to grow thicker. The purple glow intensified, as if welling out from something deep inside.

Reaching out, Jay began tying something dark and thick around it - once, twice, three times. "Come on, guys," he said, his eyes on his task, his tone determined. "We can handle this. We -"

A jittering pulse in that purple slash popped his restraints right off.

He took a breath. "Ok. That didn't work at all."

Even as we stood there, another glimmer of purple appeared down the street. He shook his head in three exaggerated motions, the gears in his thoughts visibly turning. At long last, he winced. "Let's just run. Nothing we can do."

He took off again, and we followed in two haggard lines.

For a time, there was only huffing, running, and the wind at my back. It had gotten strong enough that it was actually making the run easier, and it blanked out all sound except an ongoing roar.

For that reason - the lack of sound - it took the group nearly two minutes to notice.

I couldn't make sense of the feeling at first. It was the usual twinge - a plucking on the strings of my fear - but it was coming from above.

The black roiling sky hid them until they were dangerously low.

I stared up, and slowed.

Little flashes of light ethereal, a brief instant of white no not white

By the time the entire scattered group had slowed to a standstill, the silvery strands were drifting down all around us strands that were eerily unaffected by the raging winds.

Jay thought for a moment, and then shouted something at us in alarm.

We couldn't hear him.

Realizing the problem, he grabbed his wooden knife and lifted it up for everyone to see.

Not sure what the hell I was supposed to do with it, I grabbed mine, too, and held it ready as long silky strands of silver began gently piling around us.

Our determined leader pointed at a nearby house - but there was no time.

The first of us touched a slowly falling strand by accidentally backing into it. In a flash, it whipped taut, and - Christ! - wrapped around his neck, writhing like a living and wickedly deadly snake coiling around a victim. In shock, the middle-aged and slightly chubby man dropped his wooden knife.

Jay leapt up and slashed at the strand just before it managed to lift up viciously.

The rescued man fell to his feet, grabbed for his knife - and immediately ran afoul of another filament, which wrapped savagely around his arm and began coiling up toward his neck again.

This time, there was nobody to save him. A pale fiber pulled Jay back by the leg, and the entire group began flailing against sudden gripping strands.

Intensely focused, I moved only forward, so that I would avoid backing into any of the deadly filaments. I stared up at an angle, not daring to blink, staying motionless until I judged a single step safe.

*Step step step*

Screams echoed on the wind.

*Step...*

I looked away for an instant to judge my distance to the front door of the house Jay had indicated.

Force whipped up my torso and around my neck like a suddenly applied leash. Instinctively, I gripped the strand with my left hand, and found it impossibly smooth and cold. That grip was probably the only thing that kept my neck from breaking as I was jerked forward and up with brutal force.

In shock nearly to the point of being unable to think, I slashed with the knife in my right hand with nothing but animal fury. I didn't really have a chance to think about where I was at least not until the choking grip released, and I found myself on the downward slope of a rollercoaster without a car.

The impact came as a massive crack against my entire left half.

Gasping, I rolled to the side in abject pain and fell again, my numb left arm caught in something weak and metal that was already giving way.

Even as I tried to catch my breath and stop my awareness from spinning, the metal gutter traveled a long arc through space.

I smacked into the ground proper, tears flung from my face by sheer force.

Somehow, I still had my wooden knife, and I slashed at another sudden grip on my numb left leg and then I took the knife into my burning left hand, using it to slash at the new leash on my right arm.

"Hold it, goddamnit!" someone shouted. "They're gone! *They're gone!*"

Forcing my eyes to focus through the panic, I realized that the last grip had been the hand of a thin older man. He'd only just barely avoided my slash. Shivering as he pulled me up, I managed to breathe, "Sorry"

He glared, but seemed to understand.

Around me, many men were looking up.

I joined them, watching two bodies soar up into the black tumult among a cloud of silver strands.

"No time," Jay panted, nursing a deep red wound on his neck. "Move. Keep moving."

Nobody had any words or breath left to respond. Instead, tired and desperate men helped each other to their feet, and we began stumbling forward.

The first drops of icy rain started pummeling us as we started passing a still-frozen lake at the edge of the suburb we'd been cutting through.

Roger was the first one to see her. "There's somebody out there!"

The thin older man who had been helping me along turned his head. "Is that a girl?"

"Is she trying to cut across the lake?" someone asked, confused.

"We gotta send someone out there to get her," Jay thought aloud. "We can't leave anyone behind."

I stared, my soul jumping with repeated surges of invisible electricity. Overwhelmed, I decided to speak up despite not knowing whether these men were friend or foe. They were still human, right? I couldn't let them go out there. I knew *exactly* what that was. My whispered words seemed to cut through the wind and panic and slice directly into their awarenesses. "Jay *there's nobody alive on that lake.*"

Fifteen feet away, he turned his head slowly to stare at me. I could almost *see* the conflict between the normal guy that worked most of his life as a plumber and the man he needed to be now. In that moment, I was certain he was someone to be trusted. And, yet, he seemed more frightened to his core by me and what I'd said than by the purple cracks still opening up all around or the silver strands from on high. I watched him gulp down a choking knot in his throat. He continued to stare at me as he spoke. "Is the girl moving at all?"

I kept his gaze.

In the corner of my vision, Roger shook his head slowly. "Actually I don't think so. She' s just standing there." He jumped. "No wait, she's waving! She's waving us over! It does look like she needs help!"

Jay trembled subtly.

"You don't want to be a part of that story," I told him, dead serious.

He took in a deep breath. "We have to go."

"What?" another man asked. "We gotta help her!"

"No," he said flatly, his own order ashes on his lips. "That girl is already dead. Don't look at her. We're leaving."

They did look back, of course, but something about their otherwise stalwart leader's despairing demeanor kept them from arguing any further.

He looked back at me with suspicion, but said nothing.

Something enormous crashed through the back yards to our right, shaking the row of houses directly. As a group, we veered to our left, and ran through back yard groves to stay out of sight.

A cloud of yellow and cyan gas rolled through the woods around us. It seemed to chase us and cling to us in hungry earnest, but instructions were passed around to eat the foul tasting pink bubble-gum like substance from our bundle. I popped it into my mouth and nearly threw up, but the disturbing cloud of gas reeled away from us as if struck a physical blow. As fast as it had come, it darted off through the trees.

We emerged from the trees at the exact instant the pattering rain broke into a blasting torrent. As water continually surged against my face, I held my arms up and struggled to see.

Something was on fire ahead and to our left - a massive green flame that seemed unaffected by the rain.

Stomping through the mud, the group headed to the right.

At the end of my endurance, I slowed.

Through the curtains of rain, I sighted what must have been their center of operations. In that case

I turned and ran a different direction, intent on hiding and scouting out what they were doing for myself - without their control. I couldn't be sure what they'd meant to do with me, but I felt safer on my own.

They had someone who claimed to know me that was a lead. But what if it was my hunter? Or some other enemy? I couldn't let the contents of my backpack fall into the hands of anyone other than myself.

And nobody in this damn city is willing to talk about where everyone has gone.

I have to find out at any cost.

So, I'm sitting in a basement, waiting out the storm, while everything goes to hell outside

For some reason, I'm not afraid. The terrors out there are all random. They're not specifically after me it's the hunter that I have to fear, and those chaotic nightmares out there have stalled the hunt for tonight.

In a weird way, I feel safer surrounded by untold horrors lurking just outside than I ever did alone in a city with other human beings.

I wonder what the world will look like tomorrow

At first, I didn't even realize that he was a human being.

He sat motionless on a streetside bench. The tint of his skin and the dirtiness of his clothes nearly perfectly matched the weathered oak slats beneath and behind him. If anything, traces of white in his hair might have given him away sooner had I been more observant.

After some time spent walking down the quiet suburban street under the feeble warmth of the clouded afternoon sun, a slight fluttering of clothed edges in the wind made him suddenly appear in my vision - and I froze.

I'd investigated the most obvious questions, of course, and found nothing. The Internet had held no traces of what had happened. At the same time, any newspapers I came across were at least a few weeks old, and none mentioned anything related to the world's vast emptiness. Other people were the only source I had left for the truth and, as much as I felt vaguely pursued by some lurking threat, I hadn't seen another living soul since the power plant.

I darted back around a corner to avoid being seen, and then stared past the edge while I studied him. This man was one of the very few people remaining, and he was alone.

I needed a plan. I had a suspicion, from what the power plant manager had said, that nobody was going to talk to me directly about what had happened. They'd seemed disturbed that I'd asked and some had even seemed afraid.

*Don't ask stupid questions* but why were the questions taboo?

I needed a plan alright, what did I have? I looked around.

Low on fuel, I'd left my car a few blocks away and proceeded on foot to find a gas station. GPS still worked, and the maps on my phone still helped, but I'd had to be certain before I chose a station to drive toward with my last remaining fuel.  No more gas no more car. I knew I could resort to stealing gas from the cars littered all over the suburbs, but I wasn't exactly sure how to do that, and I didn't want to go through all that trouble if I could avoid it.

Was there a guide for stealing gas somewhere online? I resolved to look it up later. I was more than thankful for those inexplicable men and women keeping the infrastructure running. How inept would I be without the Internet?

A chill sogginess hung over the road. Several shops and fast food places formed low canyon walls on either side of an empty concrete river. A few sidestreets jutted off in either direction. What could I use here?

My eyes fell on a gas station I'd already checked. The pumps hadn't been working, but the station itself had been stocked. I darted down the sidewalk.

One of the glass doors sat unlocked, and I swung it open with mild surprise. I'd generally found very few locked doors. If everyone *had* disappeared, had it happened suddenly? None of the details were adding up.

An odd smell permeated the interior, like something small and edible molding over in a corner, but the place remained that odd mix of organized and cluttered that could only be found in a convenience store. The shelves hadn't been looted, as far as I could tell and the refrigerators were still on.

I left the price of my items in cash on the counter.

A few minutes later, I returned to where I'd seen the lone man, this time with beers - five in my backpack, and one in my hand.

He still sat motionless on that brown streetside bench, and I approached him with a tale in mind. As I got closer, I noticed that his extremely dirt-splattered clothes had once been a uniform of sorts. I also noticed that he wasn't moving at all.

Was this the first dead body I'd come across? Eyes wide, I reached over into unkempt grass and picked up a small stick.

He jumped at the prodding, and I leapt back.

Coughing lightly, he blinked wearily and looked around in a wide circle before setting his sights on me. "Oh." He sat up a little straighter. "I was just taking a nap."

I sheepishly put down the stick, carefully holding my beer bottle up to keep from spilling any.

"Got an extra one of those?" he asked, his weathered eyes lighting up with restrained eagerness. "The wife never let me drink"

"Yeah, sure," I told him, sliding my backpack down to the sidewalk and pulling out another beer. "Blue Moon alright?"

He laughed briefly, took the offered drink, and spun the top off. "Got any oranges in there?"

"No, sorry"

"Oh well." He smiled. "I'm Roger." He lifted the bottle high and took three large gulps.

I watched quietly until he lowered it. After waiting for his long and satisfied sigh to end, I asked, "Well, Roger, how are things around here?"

"Not from Columbus?" he asked.

"Pittsburgh," I told him, carefully emulating subtle signs of exhaustion. "Walked west, looking for work."

He groaned sympathetically. "I used to be a lawyer." Turning his head, he threw a nod toward a massive white truck parked just around a distant corner. Slashes of rust were visible on various edges, and splatters of dirt were prominent along the bottom. "Now I'm a garbage man. How 'bout that luck?"

A garbage man which meant that more than just electricity and the Internet were being maintained and this man had to know where more people lived. "Yeah, things didn't go too well for me, either."

A single laugh followed that. "Hey, at least we're better off than the Hunted."

I tried not to stare at the capital H in the word he had used. What did that mean? Was it a clue? *Had* someone been hunted, or were they still being hunted now? I shivered at the thought of the ineffable presence that seemed to have trailed me from the Appalachian Mountains. Or no it hadn't been in the mountains. Not at all. I'd been free, clear, and alone up until the moment I'd reached my car. What had I felt then? A return to machinery, and human intellect? A return to civilization?

A spark began building in my thoughts - something vital, energetic, important - a connection - but to put it into words, to make it solid, I -

He took another swig, then narrowed his eyes. "I didn't think there was anybody left in Pittsburgh. How long you been in Columbus? I feel like you should have run into somebody by now."

"Um, just got in." Thrust back into the conversation, I gave a sheepish smile. "Tried to hack it back home, but it was too lonely."

"That's what, a four hour drive through mostly empty country?" he asked, brow furrowed. "Long walk without food and shelter."

I nodded. "Grabbed what I could - food, beer, and such - and headed on out. Who's in charge here?" I asked, trying to change the topic away from logistics. "Who do I talk to about a job?"

"Well," he began, thinking. "If you ride my route with me, I could take you later, and -" His words slowed to a stop after another sip of his beer. He looked down at the bottle, then up at me.

I realized the error at the same time that he did. I'd bungled my claimed timeline with the simplest detail I couldn't possibly have just arrived here. *The beer was cold.* I'd taken it out of the refrigerators purely by habit - instead of using one of the warm cases stacked near the shelves.

After his realization, I expected suspicion I expected narrowed eyes, and a subtle game of questions

Instead, he *widened* his eyes, full of alarm, and then began fumbling with something in his pocket.

I picked up my backpack and began running the moment I saw it. He obviously wasn't very good with it, or I might not have gotten away, but I did look back once to see him trying to aim the gun at me with shaking hands. He shouted something terrified and angry as I made it around the corner.

Heart pounding, I took only a few seconds to breathe, and then I kept moving. I couldn't take the chance that he might get his garbage truck and chase after me.

As I ran, I tried to understand. What had I done that'd been worth *pulling a gun?* Jesus Christ I'd guessed that nobody would talk to me about what had happened, but I hadn't guessed at how terrified and defensive they might be about even basic attempts to get information.

I kept running through the chilly grey afternoon until I found the last turn back to the road upon which I'd tucked away my car.

Heart pounding, breath ragged, I came around the corner and immediately saw the spot where I'd parked it a spot which was now just a gap between other parked cars. After a brief moment of confusion, in which I wondered if I had the right street, I realized that my car was gone.

Ducking back behind some hedges so fast that I almost tripped, I studied the street. My heart still thumped in my chest, and my pulse still raced, but I did my best to stay absolutely silent. Two-story houses and thickening lawns flanked the road, and regularly-set towering trees shrouded the area in icily breezy gloom. I shook against the exertion still coursing through me, but I kept quiet and watched.

Pushed forth by the wind, a colorful plastic tricycle rolled down a distant driveway.

An American flag whipped idly up and down, unbothered by the cold.

This was suburban life, just without the living, and I found myself once more overwhelmed by how empty, boring, and *normal* this all felt. There were no bodies, no bloodstains, and no sense of tragedy. It was just a street a street in which I had thought nobody would ever see or notice my car.

I saw nothing to hint at what had happened to it. How long had I been gone? An hour? Two? 

Had another wanderer somehow happened across my vehicle and what? Hotwired it? It seemed exceedingly unlikely that somebody had just happened across this street and decided to steal *my* car, as opposed to the thousands of ownerless vehicles parked all around the city. I felt in my pockets, confirming I still had the keys. That definitely wasn't it.

Or was it something else?

I whirled around and fell roughly on my butt, my eyes scanning the nearly identical suburban street behind me. I saw nothing but chill grey filtering down between the trees, and uncomfortably cold breezes sifting through hedges and bushes. The frigid lawn beneath me ran an unhealthy brown and green - the grass was only slowly coming back to life after a long winter.

That odd sense of being pursued surged within me, and it became immediately obvious that the theft of my car had been no accident. Whatever it was, it was *here,* and I was just scrambling around in a suburban yard like a crazy fool.

Running between the houses, backpack straps held tightly to keep my bouncing belongings from making noise, I entered a long valley of back yards that seemed its own half-mile long world. On one side, houses; on the other, trees - and, in between, strewn toys, a soccer ball, and a picnic table or two, all part of a miniature vista of discarded home life stretching out before me like a dusky cave with a roof of ominous dark grey clouds.

One of these goddamn doors had to be 

The third one I tried swung open into gloom. I hesitated only for a split second, and then became propelled forward by the feeling of some approaching titanic and horrible awareness rounding a nearby corner into the soon-to-be-defiled sanctity of my little backyard valley. I dared not breathe. Instead, I turned around as swiftly and as silently as I could, and eased the house's back door closed.

The door itself was still mostly glass, and I was nowhere near safe. Creeping further into the kitchen's shady gloom, I half-crawled behind the island that dominated the middle of the slippery white-tiled floor. I hadn't had time to absorb any other details about the space - all I knew was that the cabinets and countertops converged to hide a very small area from prying eyes that might be looking in the windows at that very moment. I hadn't yet seen any destruction - no broken windows, no busted doors. Would human constructions protect me?

My back to dark cherry oak woodwork, my pack clutched close, I forced myself to let air flow in and out between my lips at an agonizingly slow pace. My hammering chest and burning lungs demanded more breath, but I couldn't.

The light snap of a branch echoed feebly from outside. Was it my unseen pursuer?

The door handle rattled. Adrenaline and alarm shot through me like lightning. *Had I locked it? Had I thought to lock it?*

I could almost *see* the attention sweeping across the kitchen, like unseen beams of malice-filled light. It scanned every visible corner, narrowly missing my hiding spot and I stopped what little breathing I had still been managing, keeping completely still 'til the throbbing in my head threatened to knock me unconscious.

My ears absorbed the barest sound of a handle rattling on the house next door.

I almost let out an explosive breath - until the thought occurred to me: I had no idea what was hunting me. What if there was more than one of Them? What if one was still standing behind *my* back door, and the distant entry attempt I'd heard was a ruse?

Holding my own mouth shut forcefully with one desperate hand, I remained in place, my vision slowly narrowing as each heartbeat brought me deeper toward darkness.

And, still, I couldn't bring myself to breathe. How could I be *sure?*

At exactly that moment, the patter of rain began tapping against the windows.

Could I use that? If the rain surged, could I -

My body betrayed me. I let out an explosive gasp for air.

At exactly that moment, a loud crack rang out from somewhere beyond the windows.

Loud scrambling echoed on the patio just outside the door I'd entered, and something gracelessly crashed away. A very human shout echoed from somewhere distant.

Jumping to my feet, I took another deep breath, exhilarated by the return of life and chance, and I ran for the door. Spilling through, I saw a wide-eyed and brown-dressed man standing one yard distant under the darkening evening sky. In his hand, he gripped his gun, holding it awkwardly forward.

It had been his shot that had driven off whatever had been outside.

"Roger!" I shouted, incredibly relieved. Clearly, something had changed. It was humanity against the darkness, right? "Thank you -"

His eyes widened into even larger white circles, a terrified contrast to the oncoming twilight. "What the ever loving hell?" His gun swept toward me.

"Christ!" I shouted at him, charging back into the house. After everything I'd been through in my life, was I really going to finally get taken down by some scared old man with a revolver? Who the hell just carried a gun around like that?

As I crashed through the house, accidentally knocking over family pictures and portraits of children hanging on the walls, I realized: if you were one of only a very few people left in the world, and there were otherworldly threats lurking, *of course* you would carry a gun. He was just a scared old man and, to him, I looked disheveled and homeless, and I'd proven myself a liar. Too, if he'd followed me, he might have seen me running and hiding and rolling about on lawns like a madman. He had no way of knowing I'd been tipped off by the disappearance of my car

He was just a scared old man - but he had a gun, and, for as few times as I'd actually seen one in my life, let alone seen one fired, guns were undeniably real and deadly.

I curved around the last bit of hallway and reached the front of the house.

I almost opened the front door and bolted outside.

I almost did it.

It was only as I had my hand on the knob that I realized this heavy wooden door had no windows alongside it. I couldn't see outside - and, if I was hunting someone, and the situation out back had just happened, I would wait *out front* for my prey to cut through the house.

It was fear, really, and nothing more. I'd been guided by my honed awareness of fear most of my life, and it had saved me countless times. Whatever was hunting me, it was *perfect.* It had made no noise, given no solid indication that it existed, and shown no cards. I had no idea what it might be, what it might want, or what it was capable of.

...except I did have one thing: the fact that millions of people had disappeared during my month in the mountains, and, now, those who remained were absolutely terrified to talk about it.

Had this been what had *gotten* everyone else?

The only edge I had was my fear. Where others might have panicked, where others might have been blithely unaware of pursuit, where others might have made a mistake I was determined to survive at any cost.

I took the last few steps up to the second floor with the same silent focus that I'd used the entire backwards path away from the front door. I refused to let my eyes off of that closed wooden portal. As long as it stayed closed, as long as I could make my way down the upstairs hallway and into a hiding spot, my pursuer would have to assume I'd chosen another escape route. 

As I'd stepped carefully backward, the gears in my mind spinning, I'd swiftly hung up and reset the pictures I'd knocked over.

As far as it might see if it came in, I'd never entered the house.

*Step back, breathe ever so quietly, step back, finally make it 'round the corner*

The front door clicked softly open just after the hallway below disappeared from my view.

The people that had lived here had left everything unlocked. I'd been right to assume that nothing was going to go in my favor without me making it so.

A creak sounded from downstairs.

I couldn't stay in the hallway like this, as much as I wanted to remain motionless. Stepping carefully, pack still held in a death grip, I backed smoothly and inaudibly into what I guessed, from the layout of the house, was the master bedroom.

Where I'd stepped soundlessly on the stairs, my pursuer failed once, eliciting a subtle noise of stretching wood that was barely audible beneath the pattering and surging rain outside. I stood in place in the thick gloom and listened intently. Was my pursuer heavier than me? Was it even human? Even at this distance, it smelled horrible, cloying, like

I turned my head, but not my body, to examine the room for options.

Oh.

Steeling myself for what I had to do, I eked a window open, studying the rooftop below that might let a person clamber down and leap to the ground. Slick rain coursed along every surface.

I made my move, and then lay quietly.

What capabilities did my pursuer have? If it had a heightened sense of smell, my hiding spot would take care of that. In case it had sharp hearing, I kept my breath held, my body still, ready and willing to go back into that dark well of unconsciousness rather than die. Astute eyes would not be a factor with a broken line of sight and my hiding spot already in a shape that might obscure my presence

If it were telepathic, or had other senses well, there was nothing I could do about that. It came near, utterly near, and I thought I heard a slight moist organic sound. I felt a shift as weight moved along the master bedroom floor. Was it checking under the bed?

No - it was at the window.

After a silent and tense moment in which everything held frozen startlingly loud motion and creaking erupted, and I listened to it rush back out, down the hall, along the stairs, and out through the front door.

It was only then, deep in a swirling pit of shrunken senses, that I finally began breathing again.

I gasped and choked on that fetid air, and clambered desperately out from between the two soggy, maggot-infested, and fly-covered corpses on the bed. Drenched in black rotting gore and various unidentifiable green and yellow and red slimes, I fell to the floor, letting my body force up the scant food I'd eaten earlier.

Rubbing against the white carpet in desperation, I tried to get some of the corpse-rot off of my bare skin.

They'd committed suicide together, in that bed. The entire thing had been stained in the disgusting colors of life and death. There'd been just enough room between to hide under the sticky sheets and blankets. My hunter had either overestimated me - in thinking that I could have silently climbed along and down a rain-slick roof - or underestimated me - in thinking that I would never climb between the embrace of two rotting suicide-slain lovers.

I'm not invincible. I did break down, finally, at that moment, on the white-carpeted floor now smeared widely with grisly juices and gobbets of flesh from my tearful crawl. I just wanted someone to talk to someone, anyone at all what was the point of surviving if it required such  ghastly and desperate acts, and if there was nobody to go home to?

It was then I knew that I had to get home. I'd been avoiding going straight there. It was too easy, too obvious. My pursuer would know what I was trying to do - that much I felt. I'd never met it, but the pursuit was hungry, and personal. It'd risked another encounter with Roger and his scared trigger-finger to stick around and chase *me.*

Chris Caitlin where are you?

Heath why aren't you responding?

And it's only now, while I sit in a hole-in-the-wall bar whose WiFi password I remembered from long ago, that something occurs to me: a man and a woman had killed themselves together in the master bedroom of that house but I'd seen pictures even knocked those pictures down shots of kids, of children, happy and smiling.

There'd been no other bodies in the house.

Was that a clue?

I had no way of knowing not yet but I had to keep it in mind.

And my life now sitting in a hole-in-the-wall-bar from my early twenties, alone, eating stale cornbread with hands I can't quite seem to get clean. I'm not afraid the smell of my horrendous hiding spot might never go away. No I'm afraid I might get used to it. The world has changed, and the change happened without me. Why am I here? What am I doing?

A relentless voice in the back of my head urges me on, even now. I live for the fear, and for the mystery. I always have. I have to know.

I have to go home. I have to figure this out.

I don't even think I can save anyone. I don't even hope that there's anything left for me but empty streets. Even though nobody's around, I'm well aware that I'm unshaven, dirty, reeking to high heaven, and acting like a madman.

It doesn't matter. What point does life hold if there's nobody around to share it with?

There is only one drive: I just have to know and when the Sun rolls back around the Earth and dispels the empty and quiet night again, I'll make my play for home, and hopefully have a shot at finding more clues

	<TEXT> There's something beautiful about raw nature. It existed before you did, and it'll exist after you're gone. It's wide open space, with all the vastness of galactic clusters and long-dead stars that still shine, and it's tangled closeness, rife with fractally expansive life of every sort that grows into and upon itself with ravenous earnest.

As I descended from the crest of a rough high hill clear of trees, where one half of that spirit was evident, and then pushed my way through the brush and tangle below, where the other half ruled, I wondered at the ability of nature to still exist here. With all the cities humanity has carved into the earth, with all the billions of us walking and driving and flying about, how could whole mountain ranges still sit out here largely untouched?

Ongoing patter dripped slowly around me; not rain, but a long-awaited melting above, below, and all around. Endemic white trails still clung to every bole and shadow, awaiting higher angles from the Sun. I felt at one with that anticipation - the month I'd just endured out in the wilderness had been spent trudging through snow, fighting biting breezy chills and the surging heat of exertion, and generally filling myself with calm acceptance to avoid shivering.

The Sun would be a very welcome sight and sensation, once it emerged from behind the gray clouds and once I emerged from the oppressive maze of Appalachian evergreens. Even as I worked my way down steep inclines, I began counting more deciduous oaks and less coniferous trees it wouldn't be long.

Northwest ever northwest. Somewhere ahead, flat land and then a river and then more walking.

And then people.

The very thought of returning to society suddenly reminded me that I had an appearance. I felt my rough face I had a *beard!* A month wasn't so long that I should have looked like a bedraggled nightmare, but I could feel the gears of atrophied social mechanisms churning slowly to action in my head. How should I behave? What should I say if I see someone? How do I explain where I've been for a month to people in my life?

I could never show them the hard-won contents of my backpack.

I probably couldn't even hint at what I'd been doing, either. Who would believe that a suburban author from Ohio could simply head out into the wilderness one day, without any skills, and survive four entire weeks alone? Each day had been a terrible endeavor, and I'd have never *chosen* to take such a journey - but I hadn't really had a choice.

On the other hand, I didn't really regret it. I felt more in tune with my body and existence than ever before. The air was warming and full of energy, and I was alive.

It took the better part of the day to reach a road. By then, the sky was a blazing sea of drifting orange, and I was vitally tired. I sat on the curb for a time, and no cars passed but that was not unusual for some backwoods road in northwestern West Virginia, or wherever I was.

The oncoming night brought a returning chill that refroze the wet ground. I resented the cold, but it did make the walking easier. Rather than slog through muck, I moved quickly across frozen earth, following the road. All I needed to do was find a building - any building, really - and charge my phone.

After that, a single power-button press would hook me back into civilization.

Gloom set in, replacing fiery orange with fuzzy blue, which itself faded ever so slowly into impenetrable black. Still, I walked.

I dwelled on my excuses. It had been a camping trip. People went camping sometimes, right? They didn't need to know the details, or the gear I had or hadn't brought and, no, I hadn't had WiFi out there to answer my emails

The ground changed underneath my shoes, and the wind began slicing perpendicular to me - I'd come to a larger road. No lights shined in either direction, and no cars passed as I decided which direction I should take.

After a half-hour of stumbling progress, I realized that I was stuck for the night. The absolute lack of passing cars hadn't escaped me, but it was too early to begin wildly speculating just yet.

After four weeks in rugged forest, the road's edge felt like a luxurious hotel. I sat a few feet into the brush, hopefully close enough to be woken by a passing car, and far enough in to avoid being seen. The cloudy sky hid the stars and kept me blind, but the darkness didn't bother me. There were terrible things out in the night sometimes, sure, but the open sky and quiet forest felt empty and calm. This was not one of those places where horrible fates lurked. This was simply nowhere important.

I awoke to burgeoning grey light, and I knew, somehow, that no cars had passed in the night. The mind never truly relaxes when one is alone and exposed a half-present sleeping awareness remains, and had remained for me. I was less rested than I might have been otherwise, but I felt safer for the subtle drain behind my eyes.

It was also time to start speculating.

Walking along the road in a drifting ocean of swirling dawn light, I began keeping a more active eye out for cars. Like the tide pulling out sand, each passing hour brought a slight sharpening to the heavy hole underneath my heart. Something was wrong, and not in the usual way. Having left society's net so abruptly, and for so long, had I simply lost the connection entirely? Had everyone else always just been a dream?

I shook my head and soldiered on.

Warm hope welled up around my heart as I sighted - at long last - a gas station. It sat at a gravelly corner in the country road, quietly soaking up near-noon spring rays.

Worries dispelled, I marched right up to the decrepit once-white building, readying social phrases. The door opened easily, and a bell chirruped above me as I swept in.

There's something about an unused building that immediately strikes one as deathlike and *wrong.* That something surrounded me instantly. Outside, it was nearly noon, and brightening in here, it was dingy and quiet. The lights were off, if such a lonely gas station even had any, and there was nobody at the register.

The shelves sat undisturbed. They were stocked, and free of dust from what I could tell no sign of where the clerk might have gone. Was this station closed today, and someone had forgotten to lock it? Or had the clerk gone out for a smoke? A subtle staleness in the air hinted that the abandonment had been longer than a few simple minutes.

Others might have called out. Others might have shouted.

I remained quiet, instead moving through the dim store with wary eyes.

I found no threat, no sign of struggle.

I found an outlet, and got my phone out of my backpack, taking care to avoid the carefully packaged contents at the bottom. Taking the cord out, I put one end in the outlet. Here was the true test of the dread eroding the hope beneath my heart: if the electricity worked, then that meant -

My phone lit up.

The electricity was working. I shook my head and laughed quietly to myself. I'd been out in the woods too long. Of course the world was still here! Civilization had carried on for ten thousand years without me. It certainly wouldn't disappear during the scant month that I had opted out.

I frowned.

No signal.

*Of course.* It would have been too easy to simply have my phone *work*, right? No, we're going to put me through the gauntlet, here

A curious screeching noise echoed outside, like a car engine straining against waking cold, and I leapt up.

Nope - I paused and grabbed my phone and charger. Not a chance in hell I was leaving my lifeline unattended in this abandoned station.

A moment later, I burst out into the noon sunlight but if a car *had* been passing, it was long gone.

I ran across gravel until I reached the edge of the road, and looked in both directions - nothing.

Memories of myself as a child resurfaced, unbidden. I'd stood and waited for the school bus on a gravelly curb just like this one, many years ago. Life had been much different, then - simpler, in a way. Less technologically bound, for sure.

I suddenly felt like an idiot.

Outside my narrow daily life experiences, landline phones still existed.

Sighing, I headed back into the station, and found a phone by the register. It had a dial tone, though I wasn't sure what I'd expected - weren't landline phones reliable? Wouldn't they work even if the power grid went down? I wasn't sure. Why did I know so little about such a longstanding technology? I frowned, and tried to recall phone numbers for anyone I knew.

I didn't know phone numbers, either. There simply hadn't been a need to remember.

I did know my *own*, though just to make sure, I dialed it.

Without a signal on my end, my cellphone didn't ring, but I did get my voicemail.

So the phones still worked

I called a number I thought *might* have been a friend of mine's, but I got no answer, and the voicemail had no personalized message. I couldn't be sure it was the right line.

Alright, what else?

The operator! Was that still a thing? How did I dial an operator? I reached for my cellphone to look it up, then groaned. It had to be something simple, like right.

I hit zero.

The phone began ringing.

I waited, expectant, until that space underneath my heart began sinking again.

I gave it twenty rings, and then hung up.

There was no operator

Time to get serious, I realized. My thoughts began pulling at information as I started doing what I did best: thinking.

There was no car parked outside the gas station. I should have known, immediately, that there'd be nobody inside.

The lack of an operator could just mean that this station didn't have proper landline support. I didn't know enough about how landlines worked to be certain.

The shelves were stocked I went through them, checking expiration dates.

The food was older than it would have been in a functional store. Some expiration dates had passed. Others had not. I looked up, but saw no security cameras. Taking as many bottles of water as I could - and some peanut butter - I left a twenty in the empty register.

Okay, time to hit the road again I needed more data.

Back in the noon light and warming breezes, I began walking and thinking. How many times had I watched this situation in a television show? How many times had I read stories about it? This was a classic case of confusing information and possibly missing people. What had *those* situations turned out to be?

I came to a crossroads and stopped. The crossing road seemed wider and more traveled than the one I'd been walking down.

More often than not - and, likely, this was the best of bad options - something was wrong with *me,* not the world. Everyone was still out there, and I was simply having perceptual issues delusions, or worse. If that was the case, then

I jumped back from the crossroads.

If I wasn't in my right mind, then cars could be passing all the time. There could be cars rolling by even now, and I just wasn't aware of them for some reason. If I couldn't trust my perceptions

I couldn't cross the street.

If something was wrong with *me*, I'd step out onto that road, thinking I was the only man out here and I'd get blindsided by a speeding car.

My pulse began racing as the gears of my logic started to grind. I stared up and down the long country highway. If my perceptions were flawed, what was I supposed to see to clue myself in? The mind believes what the brain perceives if I thought I was looking at an empty road, then no amount of staring or concentration would compromise that evaluation. Hell, there could be people stopped right now, asking a crazy guy standing at the side of the road if he was alright

but all I heard was the wind, now colored with an imagined desolate sigh.

I couldn't cross the street any street and what if there *had* been a clerk back at that gas station who *had* been out back for a smoke, and I'd just been oblivious?

My head did hurt a little bit though I'd chalked it up to poor diet and travel fatigue.

What had I been doing out in the woods this last month? I knew what I *thought* I'd been doing but, objectively, the idea did sound ridiculous. I only trusted it because I trusted myself, and the experiences I'd had.

If I couldn't trust those how did I even know I was me?

I guess some things you have to take for granted.

Bending down, I grabbed a dirty white shirt out of my backpack.

I had a marker, too, in a side pocket. I hadn't brought it on purpose, but there it had been the entire last month. Now I had a use for it.

I quickly wrote out some words on my impromptu shirt-based sign, and I held it up.

*I AM BLIND - CROSSING THE STREET THIRTY SECONDS. HELP*

Staring out at the crossroads, I held the shirt up at each stop sign in turn, my eyes wide. I saw nothing - no cars, no drivers. I heard nothing - no engines, no confused shouts. *But how could I know for sure?*

I couldn't stay here forever. I had to keep going.

Twenty-eight, twenty-nine thirty.

Holding the shirt up like a desperate flag of surrender, I edged out onto the pavement, body steeled against a terrible invisible impact at any moment.

Unable to even breathe, I inched across the country road, heart rate spiking as I crossed each faded painted line.

Heady and feeling on the verge of passing out, I leapt the last two feet, and tumbled to the gravel on the other side.

Was anyone watching me? Had I looked insane and ridiculous? Were they going to try to help me?

I waited, but felt no unseen hands on my arms, and heard no distant concerned questions.

I had to believe that I was alone.

Standing slowly, I tucked the shirt-sign into my pocket, and started walking again, not at all comforted.

As the afternoon wore on, I debated my personal facts in an endless and painful cycle. Objectively, I had all the behaviors of a mentally ill homeless man. How did I know that wasn't true?

No. I liked I who I was.

But wasn't that one way people stayed trapped in mental illness? Their assumed beliefs were preferable to reality

That internal discussion fell away as I found myself walking up an onramp to Route 79.

I actually knew where this highway was it ran parallel to the mountains, at some distance. I'd actually driven on it to get close to where I needed to go. If I could find a mile marker, I would know where my car was

and this highway, too, was empty.

I almost couldn't handle the feeling of walking down a major highway without seeing a single car and I was darkly confident I would never forget those first few hours. Each passing moment lent weight to the insane idea that I was somehow the last man left alive.

It was then that I began delving into darker thoughts.

If I was the last man alive, where were the bodies? It was easy to think the rest of the world had died, but that would have necessitated disease, rot, and devastation on a scale that was unavoidable by someone on foot like myself.

I had to know something first.

I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and stepped out onto the highway.

I counted to thirty, my heart beating three times for each second. This was probably the end, I knew

except I remained.

Only wide breezes slammed into me.

Only warm sunshine shot across me.

Jesus Christ

it *wasn't me.*

It *was* the world.

Or at least this region of it.

And still the surrounding terrain felt calm and empty, free of threat. If the human race had died or disappeared, what had caused it? I should have felt *something* but there was no lurking evil presence, no great air of sorrow, no dark misery on the wind.

As I began the long walk toward where I'd left my car, I had time to consider new worrying questions. Science fiction and horror had oft been obsessed with the end of the world for many decades. I'd read about this a hundred times. What would I do now? More often than not, the manner of the end was less important than what the survivors did afterwards. It was entirely possible I would never know what had happened. Perhaps everyone had simply vanished.

Had it been the Internet, somehow? Had everyone with a cellphone or near a computer been pulled into another dimension?

Had a terrible creature come through our televisions and monitors?

I laughed. Something about the idea just seemed too ridiculous to be scary. I'd been scared of the static-filled television in Poltergeist when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember the last time I'd actually seen such static. That movie was over thirty years old now I sighed.

It was strangely peaceful out. Knowing where I was - and where my car sat ready - helped me remain calm. There was every chance something had gone wrong in West Virginia, and I'd get in my car, drive back to Columbus, and find the world churning along as usual.

I did start seeing cars, although they were all parked. I passed a few farmsteads, some of which I checked out - all were empty of people. None showed signs of struggle.

I did note that many houses lacked cars, as if their owners had all driven somewhere.

By the time the sun hit the horizon, just as I turned down the last vaguely familiar turn and approached the hidden pocket where I'd left my car, I was more curious than fearful. These people had to have *gone somewhere in an orderly fashion.* They hadn't simply died or disappeared.

Right?

And there sat my beautiful old Hyundai. I'd never cared much about its appearance until that moment, when it seemed at once the most decrepit and most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Dark red, and rusted a bit about the wheel wells, it waited faithfully for my return.

I unlocked it and climbed inside with an exhausted sigh of relief.

This was civilization, signal or not. This was human ingenuity made subservient. This was a machine.

And this machine was mine. That gave me power over my situation once more.

The car roared to life with a guttural shout that matched my own. The silence and calm of nature ruptured instantly, replaced by the machine rumble of human design.

I checked my phone still no signal. No matter. I knew vaguely where I was going.

Headlights bright to slice away the growing gloom, I pulled onto the pavement.

Just as I did so, I looked back in the rearview mirror - and almost hit a tree. For a heart-stopping split second, I thought I'd seen someone in the woods behind me. Swerving to return to the road, I spared a glance toward my side-view mirror but saw nothing.

And I certainly wasn't going to stick around to find out.

The terror of that moment faded as the drive deepened into a familiar and interminable journey. I did have the oddest sense, now, that someone or something was following me in the pitch blackness behind me on the highway but I had to shake it off after three headlights-off attempts to perceive anything back there. Driving without light wasn't smart, and I had to carry on.

Alright alright I had to distract myself. Stick to major highways, first no back roads up 77, then west on 70 that was the plan

Alright, distract myself who was I? I was me, I was driving, I was heading home. I hadn't seen a single other person in days - or a month, really had there been an emergency?

I turned on the radio.

It had to be done, but, at an emotional level, I immediately understood that I'd made a mistake.

The sounds on the air were spacious, breezy, and subtly twisted. It sounded like I was listening to a deep cavern, the depths of which hosted something terrible and unknown a void. Nothing, save the occasional static.

That dark aural caress hammered home the reality that something was *very* wrong.

I flipped the channel.

I flipped it again.

I flipped it twice more.

Loud rock music blared through the car, and I clutched the wheel in momentary terror. For a brief moment, my spirits soared, spurred on by that touch of normalcy until the song ended, and another began, with no voiceover in between. I listened for half an hour and nobody ever spoke.

It was automated. Somebody had left their station running on autopilot.

I clicked off the radio, and glanced behind my car again. Nothing presented itself from the absolute darkness behind, but I still felt invisibly pursued

Alright, I told myself, heart thundering in my chest I'd been out in the woods, and something had happened, and I'd somehow been spared which meant there had to have been others. I hadn't been the only person on Earth in the woods in the last month. *Somebody* had to have survived.

And who are *you?* I knew I was going write it all down to make sense of it, as I always did. The written word is the best weapon against unclear realities. Who are you, then? Who would read this? I saw you, a vague possibility, someone reading this online, perhaps, at a computer - probably. I could feel some number of readers hovering in the fog of the future, in the same way that I usually felt the beating hearts of those around me when we stumbled into living nightmares. That, more than anything, let me know something out there still existed

If the electricity was still working out in the boonies, was the Internet still functional? I had to contact Heath. He could help. How long would the power grid remain operational without oversight?

Not long, I knew.

In that case I did happen to know where a power plant was. I'd driven by the facility a few times over the years. If the power grid was still operational, that meant somebody had to have been maintaining it. If there were people left, that was where at least some would be.

I drove long into the night, reaching the outskirts of my home city only as dawn began cycling up 'round the Earth yet again.

I was tired, but mightily fueled by adrenaline. I couldn't see the city's buildings this far out, but I was confident that I would find people this way more effectively than wandering around an abandoned downtown quadrant.

I pulled off the road some distance down, and walked the rest of the way. Fences surrounded the vast complex, and I circled until I found the entrance.

There didn't seem to be any security. Then again, why bother locking things if there's nobody around?

The complex didn't have any windows, so I couldn't tell if there were any lights on inside, but I began to hear the deep rumble of machinery.

I was wary, but desperate to see another human being.

I pushed open a side door.

Harsh light streamed out, forcing me to blink, and I stood there as a dozen men and women in hardhats froze and stared at me.

It suddenly occurred to me that my personal mental illness theory might have some weight. What did these people see? A disgustingly disheveled wilderness-man busting onto a power plant floor? They stood at various places around the vast space, each at their specific stations or frozen in place on the way somewhere. A few had clipboards in hand. It was 2015. Why were we still using clipboards? Come on!

Several awkward moments passed, but none of them said a thing.

I stepped closer, and they watched me warily. "Hello?" I asked, my unused voice cracking.

"Hello" one man in slightly nicer clothes said, stepping forward. He waved at his subordinates, and they all went back to work without a word. "Can I help you, sir?"

I studied his stony but kind features. This was a normal middle manager type, like I'd seen in any number of offices. "Um" I coughed twice. Should I really ask questions that now sounded insane? "I've been, uh, camping for a month, and I couldn't help but notice there are a great many people missing."

The traces of kindness in the older man's cheeks vanished.

I narrowed my eyes cautiously. "Did I miss something important?"

He stared at me, his shoulders subtly tensing. "You should go."

I took a step back. "I didn't mean anything by it, I just -"

He lowered his voice to a whisper, to the point that his subordinates wouldn't overhear his words. "You should go *now.* And if you run into people out there, don't ask stupid questions."

Not one to take such seriously intentioned advice lightly, I nodded and slowly backed out, keeping my eyes on him the entire time. He made no move to stop me or follow me.

Once outside, I bolted through the rising dawn light. My sensation of being followed was sharper than ever, and I leapt into my car as fast as I could. Speeding off, I headed for the only other place I knew to go - home.

On the way there, I rose high above downtown on a soaring highway, and I was forced to take it all in.

The skyrises glittered in the morning sunlight but that glitter was dark, and the city was silent. The lights still worked, and my cellphone began getting signal but Columbus, Ohio was empty.

The city was empty, but there were still skeleton crews running the infrastructure, and they'd been terrified and confused to see me. It didn't make sense.

I'm sitting in an empty Starbucks now, using the free WiFi. I worked in this store in my college years, and it's intensely eerie to sit alone in it during what's normally the afternoon rush. If this is an apocalypse, it's the strangest one I've ever heard of. No death and destruction, some people are left that refuse to answer questions, readers whose existence I can't pin down or understand where are you?

and something following me, out there in the quiet streets. I feel it waiting for me to make a move. I think it knows I'm going to go home, and that I have no choice but to try but I'm going to make sure I'm prepared. I'm going to outsmart it. I have to, because I'm on my own.

Wherever Heath is, he's not responding to my emails. That has me worried more than anything else I've seen.

I'll keep my moves to myself until I get a chance to write again. Until I know what the thing pursuing me is, I can't risk it knowing what I have planned

A subtle staleness in the air hinted that the abandonment had been longer than a few simple minutes.

Others might have called out. Others might have shouted.

I remained quiet, instead moving through the dim store with wary eyes.

I found no threat, no sign of struggle.

I found an outlet, and got my phone out of my backpack, taking care to avoid the carefully packaged contents at the bottom. Taking the cord out, I put one end in the outlet. Here was the true test of the dread eroding the hope beneath my heart: if the electricity worked, then that meant -

My phone lit up.

The electricity was working. I shook my head and laughed quietly to myself. I'd been out in the woods too long. Of course the world was still here! Civilization had carried on for ten thousand years without me. It certainly wouldn't disappear during the scant month that I had opted out.

I frowned.

No signal.

*Of course.* It would have been too easy to simply have my phone *work*, right? No, we're going to put me through the gauntlet, here

A curious screeching noise echoed outside, like a car engine straining against waking cold, and I leapt up.

Nope - I paused and grabbed my phone and charger. Not a chance in hell I was leaving my lifeline unattended in this abandoned station.

A moment later, I burst out into the noon sunlight but if a car *had* been passing, it was long gone.

I ran across gravel until I reached the edge of the road, and looked in both directions - nothing.

Memories of myself as a child resurfaced, unbidden. I'd stood and waited for the school bus on a gravelly curb just like this one, many years ago. Life had been much different, then - simpler, in a way. Less technologically bound, for sure.

I suddenly felt like an idiot.

Outside my narrow daily life experiences, landline phones still existed.

Sighing, I headed back into the station, and found a phone by the register. It had a dial tone, though I wasn't sure what I'd expected - weren't landline phones reliable? Wouldn't they work even if the power grid went down? I wasn't sure. Why did I know so little about such a longstanding technology? I frowned, and tried to recall phone numbers for anyone I knew.

I didn't know phone numbers, either. There simply hadn't been a need to remember.

I did know my *own*, though just to make sure, I dialed it.

Without a signal on my end, my cellphone didn't ring, but I did get my voicemail.

So the phones still worked

I called a number I thought *might* have been a friend of mine's, but I got no answer, and the voicemail had no personalized message. I couldn't be sure it was the right line.

Alright, what else?

The operator! Was that still a thing? How did I dial an operator? I reached for my cellphone to look it up, then groaned. It had to be something simple, like right.

I hit zero.

The phone began ringing.

I waited, expectant, until that space underneath my heart began sinking again.

I gave it twenty rings, and then hung up.

There was no operator

Time to get serious, I realized. My thoughts began pulling at information as I started doing what I did best: thinking.

There was no car parked outside the gas station. I should have known, immediately, that there'd be nobody inside.

The lack of an operator could just mean that this station didn't have proper landline support. I didn't know enough about how landlines worked to be certain.

The shelves were stocked I went through them, checking expiration dates.

The food was older than it would have been in a functional store. Some expiration dates had passed. Others had not. I looked up, but saw no security cameras. Taking as many bottles of water as I could - and some peanut butter - I left a twenty in the empty register.

Okay, time to hit the road again I needed more data.

Back in the noon light and warming breezes, I began walking and thinking. How many times had I watched this situation in a television show? How many times had I read stories about it? This was a classic case of confusing information and possibly missing people. What had *those* situations turned out to be?

I came to a crossroads and stopped. The crossing road seemed wider and more traveled than the one I'd been walking down.

More often than not - and, likely, this was the best of bad options - something was wrong with *me,* not the world. Everyone was still out there, and I was simply having perceptual issues delusions, or worse. If that was the case, then

I jumped back from the crossroads.

If I wasn't in my right mind, then cars could be passing all the time. There could be cars rolling by even now, and I just wasn't aware of them for some reason. If I couldn't trust my perceptions

I couldn't cross the street.

If something was wrong with *me*, I'd step out onto that road, thinking I was the only man out here and I'd get blindsided by a speeding car.

My pulse began racing as the gears of my logic started to grind. I stared up and down the long country highway. If my perceptions were flawed, what was I supposed to see to clue myself in? The mind believes what the brain perceives if I thought I was looking at an empty road, then no amount of staring or concentration would compromise that evaluation. Hell, there could be people stopped right now, asking a crazy guy standing at the side of the road if he was alright

but all I heard was the wind, now colored with an imagined desolate sigh.

I couldn't cross the street any street and what if there *had* been a clerk back at that gas station who *had* been out back for a smoke, and I'd just been oblivious?

My head did hurt a little bit though I'd chalked it up to poor diet and travel fatigue.

What had I been doing out in the woods this last month? I knew what I *thought* I'd been doing but, objectively, the idea did sound ridiculous. I only trusted it because I trusted myself, and the experiences I'd had.

If I couldn't trust those how did I even know I was me?

I guess some things you have to take for granted.

Bending down, I grabbed a dirty white shirt out of my backpack.

I had a marker, too, in a side pocket. I hadn't brought it on purpose, but there it had been the entire last month. Now I had a use for it.

I quickly wrote out some words on my impromptu shirt-based sign, and I held it up.

*I AM BLIND - CROSSING THE STREET THIRTY SECONDS. HELP*

Staring out at the crossroads, I held the shirt up at each stop sign in turn, my eyes wide. I saw nothing - no cars, no drivers. I heard nothing - no engines, no confused shouts. *But how could I know for sure?*

I couldn't stay here forever. I had to keep going.

Twenty-eight, twenty-nine thirty.

Holding the shirt up like a desperate flag of surrender, I edged out onto the pavement, body steeled against a terrible invisible impact at any moment.

Unable to even breathe, I inched across the country road, heart rate spiking as I crossed each faded painted line.

Heady and feeling on the verge of passing out, I leapt the last two feet, and tumbled to the gravel on the other side.

Was anyone watching me? Had I looked insane and ridiculous? Were they going to try to help me?

I waited, but felt no unseen hands on my arms, and heard no distant concerned questions.

I had to believe that I was alone.

Standing slowly, I tucked the shirt-sign into my pocket, and started walking again, not at all comforted.

As the afternoon wore on, I debated my personal facts in an endless and painful cycle. Objectively, I had all the behaviors of a mentally ill homeless man. How did I know that wasn't true?

No. I liked I who I was.

But wasn't that one way people stayed trapped in mental illness? Their assumed beliefs were preferable to reality

That internal discussion fell away as I found myself walking up an onramp to Route 79.

I actually knew where this highway was it ran parallel to the mountains, at some distance. I'd actually driven on it to get close to where I needed to go. If I could find a mile marker, I would know where my car was

and this highway, too, was empty.

I almost couldn't handle the feeling of walking down a major highway without seeing a single car and I was darkly confident I would never forget those first few hours. Each passing moment lent weight to the insane idea that I was somehow the last man left alive.

It was then that I began delving into darker thoughts.

If I was the last man alive, where were the bodies? It was easy to think the rest of the world had died, but that would have necessitated disease, rot, and devastation on a scale that was unavoidable by someone on foot like myself.

I had to know something first.

I took a deep breath, closed my eyes, and stepped out onto the highway.

I counted to thirty, my heart beating three times for each second. This was probably the end, I knew

except I remained.

Only wide breezes slammed into me.

Only warm sunshine shot across me.

Jesus Christ

it *wasn't me.*

It *was* the world.

Or at least this region of it.

And still the surrounding terrain felt calm and empty, free of threat. If the human race had died or disappeared, what had caused it? I should have felt *something* but there was no lurking evil presence, no great air of sorrow, no dark misery on the wind.

As I began the long walk toward where I'd left my car, I had time to consider new worrying questions. Science fiction and horror had oft been obsessed with the end of the world for many decades. I'd read about this a hundred times. What would I do now? More often than not, the manner of the end was less important than what the survivors did afterwards. It was entirely possible I would never know what had happened. Perhaps everyone had simply vanished.

Had it been the Internet, somehow? Had everyone with a cellphone or near a computer been pulled into another dimension?

Had a terrible creature come through our televisions and monitors?

I laughed. Something about the idea just seemed too ridiculous to be scary. I'd been scared of the static-filled television in Poltergeist when I was a kid, but I couldn't remember the last time I'd actually seen such static. That movie was over thirty years old now I sighed.

It was strangely peaceful out. Knowing where I was - and where my car sat ready - helped me remain calm. There was every chance something had gone wrong in West Virginia, and I'd get in my car, drive back to Columbus, and find the world churning along as usual.

I did start seeing cars, although they were all parked. I passed a few farmsteads, some of which I checked out - all were empty of people. None showed signs of struggle.

I did note that many houses lacked cars, as if their owners had all driven somewhere.

By the time the sun hit the horizon, just as I turned down the last vaguely familiar turn and approached the hidden pocket where I'd left my car, I was more curious than fearful. These people had to have *gone somewhere in an orderly fashion.* They hadn't simply died or disappeared.

Right?

And there sat my beautiful old Hyundai. I'd never cared much about its appearance until that moment, when it seemed at once the most decrepit and most beautiful thing I'd ever seen. Dark red, and rusted a bit about the wheel wells, it waited faithfully for my return.

I unlocked it and climbed inside with an exhausted sigh of relief.

This was civilization, signal or not. This was human ingenuity made subservient. This was a machine.

And this machine was mine. That gave me power over my situation once more.

The car roared to life with a guttural shout that matched my own. The silence and calm of nature ruptured instantly, replaced by the machine rumble of human design.

I checked my phone still no signal. No matter. I knew vaguely where I was going.

Headlights bright to slice away the growing gloom, I pulled onto the pavement.

Just as I did so, I looked back in the rearview mirror - and almost hit a tree. For a heart-stopping split second, I thought I'd seen someone in the woods behind me. Swerving to return to the road, I spared a glance toward my side-view mirror but saw nothing.

And I certainly wasn't going to stick around to find out.

The terror of that moment faded as the drive deepened into a familiar and interminable journey. I did have the oddest sense, now, that someone or something was following me in the pitch blackness behind me on the highway but I had to shake it off after three headlights-off attempts to perceive anything back there. Driving without light wasn't smart, and I had to carry on.

Alright alright I had to distract myself. Stick to major highways, first no back roads up 77, then west on 70 that was the plan

Alright, distract myself who was I? I was me, I was driving, I was heading home. I hadn't seen a single other person in days - or a month, really had there been an emergency?

I turned on the radio.

It had to be done, but, at an emotional level, I immediately understood that I'd made a mistake.

The sounds on the air were spacious, breezy, and subtly twisted. It sounded like I was listening to a deep cavern, the depths of which hosted something terrible and unknown a void. Nothing, save the occasional static.

That dark aural caress hammered home the reality that something was *very* wrong.

I flipped the channel.

I flipped it again.

I flipped it twice more.

Loud rock music blared through the car, and I clutched the wheel in momentary terror. For a brief moment, my spirits soared, spurred on by that touch of normalcy until the song ended, and another began, with no voiceover in between. I listened for half an hour and nobody ever spoke.

It was automated. Somebody had left their station running on autopilot.

I clicked off the radio, and glanced behind my car again. Nothing presented itself from the absolute darkness behind, but I still felt invisibly pursued

Alright, I told myself, heart thundering in my chest I'd been out in the woods, and something had happened, and I'd somehow been spared which meant there had to have been others. I hadn't been the only person on Earth in the woods in the last month. *Somebody* had to have survived.

And who are *you?* I knew I was going write it all down to make sense of it, as I always did. The written word is the best weapon against unclear realities. Who are you, then? Who would read this? I saw you, a vague possibility, someone reading this online, perhaps, at a computer - probably. I could feel some number of readers hovering in the fog of the future, in the same way that I usually felt the beating hearts of those around me when we stumbled into living nightmares. That, more than anything, let me know something out there still existed

If the electricity was still working out in the boonies, was the Internet still functional? I had to contact Heath. He could help. How long would the power grid remain operational without oversight?

Not long, I knew.

In that case I did happen to know where a power plant was. I'd driven by the facility a few times over the years. If the power grid was still operational, that meant somebody had to have been maintaining it. If there were people left, that was where at least some would be.

I drove long into the night, reaching the outskirts of my home city only as dawn began cycling up 'round the Earth yet again.

I was tired, but mightily fueled by adrenaline. I couldn't see the city's buildings this far out, but I was confident that I would find people this way more effectively than wandering around an abandoned downtown quadrant.

I pulled off the road some distance down, and walked the rest of the way. Fences surrounded the vast complex, and I circled until I found the entrance.

There didn't seem to be any security. Then again, why bother locking things if there's nobody around?

The complex didn't have any windows, so I couldn't tell if there were any lights on inside, but I began to hear the deep rumble of machinery.

I was wary, but desperate to see another human being.

I pushed open a side door.

Harsh light streamed out, forcing me to blink, and I stood there as a dozen men and women in hardhats froze and stared at me.

It suddenly occurred to me that my personal mental illness theory might have some weight. What did these people see? A disgustingly disheveled wilderness-man busting onto a power plant floor? They stood at various places around the vast space, each at their specific stations or frozen in place on the way somewhere. A few had clipboards in hand. It was 2015. Why were we still using clipboards? Come on!

Several awkward moments passed, but none of them said a thing.

I stepped closer, and they watched me warily. "Hello?" I asked, my unused voice cracking.

"Hello" one man in slightly nicer clothes said, stepping forward. He waved at his subordinates, and they all went back to work without a word. "Can I help you, sir?"

I studied his stony but kind features. This was a normal middle manager type, like I'd seen in any number of offices. "Um" I coughed twice. Should I really ask questions that now sounded insane? "I've been, uh, camping for a month, and I couldn't help but notice there are a great many people missing."

The traces of kindness in the older man's cheeks vanished.

I narrowed my eyes cautiously. "Did I miss something important?"

He stared at me, his shoulders subtly tensing. "You should go."

I took a step back. "I didn't mean anything by it, I just -"

He lowered his voice to a whisper, to the point that his subordinates wouldn't overhear his words. "You should go *now.* And if you run into people out there, don't ask stupid questions."

Not one to take such seriously intentioned advice lightly, I nodded and slowly backed out, keeping my eyes on him the entire time. He made no move to stop me or follow me.

Once outside, I bolted through the rising dawn light. My sensation of being followed was sharper than ever, and I leapt into my car as fast as I could. Speeding off, I headed for the only other place I knew to go - home.

On the way there, I rose high above downtown on a soaring highway, and I was forced to take it all in.

The skyrises glittered in the morning sunlight but that glitter was dark, and the city was silent. The lights still worked, and my cellphone began getting signal but Columbus, Ohio was empty.

The city was empty, but there were still skeleton crews running the infrastructure, and they'd been terrified and confused to see me. It didn't make sense.

I'm sitting in an empty Starbucks now, using the free WiFi. I worked in this store in my college years, and it's intensely eerie to sit alone in it during what's normally the afternoon rush. If this is an apocalypse, it's the strangest one I've ever heard of. No death and destruction, some people are left that refuse to answer questions, readers whose existence I can't pin down or understand where are you?

and something following me, out there in the quiet streets. I feel it waiting for me to make a move. I think it knows I'm going to go home, and that I have no choice but to try but I'm going to make sure I'm prepared. I'm going to outsmart it. I have to, because I'm on my own.

Wherever Heath is, he's not responding to my emails. That has me worried more than anything else I've seen.

I'll keep my moves to myself until I get a chance to write again. Until I know what the thing pursuing me is, I can't risk it knowing what I have planned

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sure it had always been there but, from my perspective, it just *appeared* one day, disrupting the horizon over the woods beyond the suburb where I live. I remember standing on the sidewalk and thinking to myself, *what the hell is that?*

All I could see over the treetops were boxy corners and a high curving arch made of rusted metal.

Except for the occasional suspicious glance, I thought little of it for several weeks, and nothing happened until I mentioned it to an artist friend of mine. She enjoyed taking artistic pictures, and we'd often gone on adventures to forbidden places in order to find a great shot. She was the adventurous one, and I was the one who made sure we didn't die in the process.

We went on a cold and grey afternoon. The walk from the suburb didn't take very long; this thing was literally right around the corner, [down what looked like an unused utility road.](http://i.imgur.com/EY2znpS.jpg)

As we approached, I slowly realized that the structure was way bigger than it seemed from afar. It was enormous. [The pictures couldn't do the scale justice](http://imgur.com/a/LuRwC) here was a ten-story-tall rusted-out hulk, a mile from home, and I had no idea why it had been built or how long it had been here. I realized, then, that I'd only noticed it because the leaves on the trees were all gone.

In fact, [everything around the place looked grey, dead, and twisted.](http://imgur.com/a/DrH1j)

While my companion went around taking pictures, I explored more than I usually did. I was curious as to the nature of this structure and the devastated area around it. Someone had left construction equipment and gear to rot, and this disturbing industrial facility had been built and abandoned less than a stone's throw from my home... yet I'd never heard of it.

I moved around the side of the structure, but she walked straight underneath, heading for a long and narrow set of metal stairs. I hadn't noticed at first, but precarious stairs and walkways snaked their way around the inside and along certain edges of the structure, offering a winding path up to the top. At the pinnacle, a small railed platform crested the complex design.

"I want to get up *there,*" she exclaimed, moving higher, her finger aimed at that top platform. "I bet the view's incredible"

I stood at the base of the stairs, feeling a little weird. I often got strange heady rushes when I entered places I knew I shouldn't be in, but this one was refusing to ebb. I sniffed. "Do you smell that?" An odd acridity punctuated each breath I took in through my nose, and I thought I detected metallic undertones.

"I don't smell anything," she responded. "I'm sure there'll be weird chemicals left over somewhere in a place like this. It'd be fenced off if it wasn't safe, right?"

"It *was* fenced off," I grumbled.

"They left the gate open. How bad can it be?" She reached the first level of walkways and looked down at me from two or three stories above. "Come on up. There's graffiti here. We're not the first to explore this place."

Taking a deep breath, and wincing at the odor, I began climbing the [uncomfortably patterned metal stairs.](http://i.imgur.com/9qUaNiz.jpg) Even through my shoes, they felt sharp, rigid, and complex. The path up was narrow and steep, and I clung to the rusty rails to make sure I didn't fall backwards. At that moment, I definitely regretted coming.

The first layer of walkways curled around the base of the bulk of the structure, and I followed her around several corners.

The smell grew stronger with each step.

She kept snapping pictures and looking at her camera. "They're not coming out right."

"Something wrong?" I asked, starting to cover my nose against the growing chemical stench. Even though I wasn't moving, it still kept intensifying was something about the area changing? Had we disturbed something, or tipped something over by accident?

"No, I'll fix it," she said, snatching the camera away from my offered hand. "I'll handle it."

"Jeez, fine." I didn't understand why she was so snappy, so her behavior irritated me.

After fiddling with her camera for a moment, she began climbing more stairs. These ones were far more cramped, and went directly up through several tight mazelike passages. As the chemical smell intensified, so did my concern, and I hesitated but I still saw graffiti up there, so how risky could it be?

I avoided touching anything. Jagged rusted metal sat exposed all around. At the next plateau, anger, confusion, and suspicion washed over me. "I think we should go back. This isn't safe."

"You're so terrified," she responded, climbing higher. "It's pathetic."

I narrowed my eyes. "What the hell? Look, we're halfway up. Your camera isn't even working. We did it, adventure complete. Let's go home."

"No," she insisted. "I wanna see the top. If you're scared, you can go home."

"I can't leave you here."

"Sure you can. I don't need you anyway."

She ran blithely up another even narrower stairway, and I followed her, pissed off. "What's your problem?"

"I don't fucking need you to tag along on these things," she responded, furious. "You basically force yourself on me."

"What? That's bullshit!" I ran up more steps, energized by adrenaline and fire. "You *make* me come on these stupid things. We're always risking arrest or injury for some pictures. It's not worth it."

"Then don't come!" she shouted, hurling her camera at me.

I ducked, and it bounced off a rusted red pipe before falling to patterned metal, broken.

She practically snarled. "Look what you did!"

"Me? You're the one freaking out!" I breathed hard against the anger, and against the overwhelming and terrible slicing sensations in my nose. "*And what the hell is that smell?*"

She balled her fists, turned, and stomped further up, reaching the second-to-last plateau. "**Who cares?** It's just a smell! You're just using it as an excuse to chicken out. *And,* you broke my camera."

I watched her shiver and tremble for a moment. Her fists were balled so tightly, I could see her knuckles going white.

Even as I stared, she slowly bent down and picked up a piece of rusted metal.

I glared. "What are you doing?"

She turned around and stared at me with rage-filled eyes.

I had the distinct sense she was about to try to kill me, and I wasn't about to let her do it. At that moment, I felt that she was an inexplicable asshole who cared nothing for other people and if she got hurt when I defended myself, so be it. I picked up a rusty bar and backed away slowly.

Or *should* I only defend myself? I hated her so much. She was the worst person I'd ever known. She'd just thrown a camera at me, and now she was approaching me with a rusty shiv. The world would be better off without a horrible person like -

I looked down at the corroded rod in my hands, noticing more than one kind of dried, craggy red on its ancient surface. "Jesus Christ" She came at me then, and I dropped my bar and grabbed her wrist. "Chemicals," I breathed, my vision fuzzy. "We're gonna murder each other -"

She tried to bite me, and I squeezed her tight enough to force her to drop her weapon.

"Come on!"

Ever so slowly, she blinked, refocused her eyes, and started to actually look at me. "I feel like I'm swimming"

I stood in place, my thoughts lost. What had I just been doing? It felt very important.

"We have to get out of here," she said, stumbling down the rusty steps and pulling me along.

"Alright"

I remember half-falling, half-sliding down the narrow walkways and sharply rusted steps. I have no idea how we didn't slice ourselves open on the hazy path down to earth. Stumbling across the dead lot, we grasped for the safety of the street -

...and we both stood upright at the same time, heads clearing. I gulped in fresh air, free from that terrible odor, and she did the same, clutching my arm.

"What the hell was that?" she asked.

I shook my head. "I have no idea"

We walked home, carefully monitored ourselves, and tried to figure out what the hell had just happened. Research online found extremely little; the industrial site was only mentioned in one list in one obscure court document.

Apparently, the site had been given a clean environmental bill as part of a lawsuit to shut down the entire company. Clean? That place was a nightmare and there were, apparently, over six hundred sites just like it dotting the United States, all owned by a company that had been dissolved for *gross safety violations.* The environment around the facility had been given a clean bill, but this particular site had been shut down due to two unnamed on-the-job fatalities.

We let the experience go for a few months, until I came home one day and saw cop cars outside that area. Over the next few days, we heard bits and pieces but the truth soon became clear.

Based on an anonymous tip, police had found bodies on site. Fourteen people had been found in various states of decay, their bodies wedged in pipes, chutes, and tumblers.

Nobody said anything about an odd smell.

Nobody said anything about police going crazy.

Nothing of what we experienced seemed to happen to anyone else.

The structure still lurks on the horizon of my suburb, watching me from afar. I have the oddest feeling that it's still hungering for the two that got away and I think I know why the police didn't experience anything strange.

Among the fourteen dead, there were seven pairs total and it looked like they'd killed each other and fallen into various inaccessible places lining the structure. We'd been walking among twisted and rotting corpses without even knowing it. We'd even taken pictures of many of the spots in which they'd been found. And the thing was - the thing that convinced me that this was no chemical spill, no natural occurrence - each pair was exactly the same one man, one woman.

The evil in that site, however it had formed, had taken on a very particular preference.

It'd been waiting for *us.*

And that brings up the realization that there are hundreds more sites out there, and probably many more evil locations unrelated to the particular company that ran this one - so, remember:

Other people may have gone somewhere safely, perhaps even for years, but that doesn't mean there isn't something evil out there waiting for you... and only you.

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2u5mr1/am_i_the_only_one_that_sees_that_the_moon_is_on/)

I never knew how hard it would be to set up a resistance movement. You can't trust anyone *at all.*

I wished I'd had more time to watch spy movies. We had to come up with tactics on our own, especially because we didn't have the same test that the Changed had. Eight is four.

They could force someone to look up at the Moon, and then assume that person had become theirs. They didn't know that they could be wrong, and that those of us with mental issues were instead made whole by the conflicting energies in our skulls, but rumors were beginning to circulate to that effect. And, for us, even if a person *was* free and sound of mind, that didn't mean they wouldn't defect out of self-interest, like Donald had. I'd resented him at first, but he'd taught me a valuable lesson.

I've never met my co-conspirators. We can't meet. I can't be sure they're on my side, and they can't be sure I'm on their side. I don't even know how many of us there are. All I know is that we've been passing messages through ridiculously elaborate methods, or anonymously online, and I'm getting some sense of what's happening in the world at large.

That's the weird part: life is going on as normal. Farmers are farming, cab drivers are driving, office employees are lounging around talking and taking smoke breaks every hour the only difference is that any talk of religion has been replaced by praises of the Dreamer On High, and the world lies excited for the coming event. Some believe it will be a Rapture, and some believe the Dreamer will simply come in person and rule over us for all time.

Me? I'm using my newfound clarity and solid sense of reality to work my way up the ranks of trust. I feel smart and capable in a way I've never been. Is this what normal people feel like all the time?

I understand now that individual motivations have not changed. Will still thinks he's helping me, in his own way. He thought tricking me out of the house and forcing me to accept Him was saving me from the life of a homeless and mentally deficient outcast.

He wasn't wrong, I suppose.

He continues to pursue relationships with higher-ups, and he continues to try to get us deeper in and trusted more.

"We're going to be His prime disciples," Will says often, excited and determined. "Brother, I always said I'd take care of you. You and Laura and Dad, too we're gonna be at the top of the food chain when the new order comes. We'll be taken care of."

I would nod and smile, but secretly think: *tell that to our step-mom.* Minutes are hours. It's funny that we all started out paranoid and suspicious of the Changed, and now the Changed are paranoid and suspicious of us. Or is it sad, rather than funny? That the free human race is now the fringe?

They had a funeral and buried Tracy in the cemetery and everything. Dad stayed sober for two whole days, and cried publicly at the reception.

*You killed her, you psychopath,* I remember thinking to myself. But he didn't feel guilty about it, since *it had to be done, son.*

The doublethink the Change engenders brings hypocrisy. You want what you want for your own life, but service to the Dreamer On High takes precedent over all of your desires, no matter how strong. That's why I know that I can't trust anyone, not even my own family. They wouldn't hesitate to murder me, and passersby would cheer the silencing of another heretic.

That's the crazy thing: I remember people acting this way before. This isn't new to humanity. Suspected heretics are the new second-class citizens, the new victims of the witch-hunt. Different race? Different ideology? Different religion? Now it was down to simply having a different *mind.* It's insane how scared they are of anyone who might not share their fanaticism.

I got a look at what their plan is. Yellow is blue. I understand, now, why their plan will actually work. They have, among them, members of the cult that I'd thought I'd imagined. They're called *brownshirts*, now, because of their distinctively plain manner of dress, and they're among the top priests of the Order. They've got abilities that I can't explain. They can sense electromagnetic waves of all sorts, and they *hate* computers and robotics of any kind. I don't know who they are, but I get the strangest sense that they're not human. They look completely human, and they eat, breathe, and walk around, but the way they talk and move and peer at things is just *wrong* somehow, like somebody who never learned to be a person.

Which is unfortunate, because I need to get into contact with at least one of them. If anyone out there knows a brownshirt that hasn't been Changed, I need to meet them.

Leave a note at Location Yellow in eight minutes from the time of this post.

---

The meeting went well. There are two Free brownshirts still alive and present. From what they said, the rest of the Free fled southeast, over the mountains, and to another universe, if you can believe that. They're so strange, I kind of accept it when they say it so calmly. I also accept it because of what I've seen the Changed building in the center of the city.

Why Columbus, Ohio? This, I wondered often. The answer turned out to be very simple: they're building the altar here because this is where the brownshirts were, and are. My hunch had been right.

The two said they'd remained behind to try to save what members of their kind they could. They claimed to be from *elsewhere*, and that they were on an exodus to a place of safety, a place where they hoped old alliances were still in place. They would not elaborate.

But they did say that they would help. We have our first real allies now.

They swore their assistance when I told them what I'd seen: a gigantic altar being built in front of the city capitol building. The base was mostly in place, but the rest seemed to involve strange biomechanical artifice, and a row of brownshirts, chained and integrated to the machine. They were aware, and happy to be of service, save one. One remained Free, perhaps due to the same effect that kept me so, and his face and arms were battered and bloody from torture.

It's a week until Christmas, and, somehow, I feel like it will be humanity's Last Day. The irony is not lost on me: a holiday tale about the birth of a religious savior will, in some twisted sense, be made true.

Get ready, everyone. If the plan we've built together doesn't work, it's going to get bloody.

---

They caught somebody skulking about the high rises downtown. They know for certain that we exist now, and they know why we exist, because he was an escaped mental patient. I've come under intense scrutiny, but Will has been protecting me.

I fear that they will force me to undertake some act of loyalty to prove I'm not a heretic. They've been keeping Laura close. I have a feeling they're going to ask me to kill her.

She and I haven't been close since my illness started, but that's just one more reason I don't think I can bring myself to do it. She's still my sister.

But the entire world's on the line

---

I've been watched and followed recently. Updates and communication are going to get sparse. Stick to the plan, everyone. Two days remain. The altar construction seems right on schedule.

---

God, it's not going to work! I don't think even half of you will get this message in time, but it's not going to work! My brownshirt allies sensed it first, and, then, an observatory contact of mine confirmed it - not that the holy news isn't spreading among the Changed like wildfire.

There are five more objects on the way, coming in at near-light-speed. They'll be in here in a day and a half, roughly, same as the first took from detection to arrival. God, we've nearly lost it all to just one. It sits up there, mocking us, brainwashing us, and now *five more are coming?*

This can't be a coincidence. The timing is too neat. A day and a half to Christmas; a day and a half to the ritual; a day and a half to the arrival of five more apocalyptic near-luminous objects. Will they hit Earth? If so, we'll never know, because we'll all be dead. Perhaps the Moon saved us the first time but if these five also hit the Moon, the threat of the Dreamer On High will grow sixfold. What are these godforsaken things? Seeds? Embryos? Brain matrices, portals, what? I can only imagine, and theorizing is pointless. If we don't stop this before they arrive, we lose.

We lose *everything.*

We have to move up the plan. We have to strike *now.* But it won't work unless everyone's on board we're in a serious bind here.

Spread the word: we have to strike at the alternate time we discussed from the beginning.

---

It's hard for me to think back on it all. Quite a few of you have asked me to detail exactly what happened on that day. Now that January is over, and a month has passed, I think I can face it. News and understanding has been fragmented, obviously, but I do think I can paint a clear picture.

As you know, our plan didn't work. It was a really good try, but we were amateurs, and half of us were spies and defectors.

It did help that absolute chaos broke out at the proper time.

I went there on Christmas morning, to the city center. Tens of thousands had gathered to see the Coming of the Dreamer On High. My two brownshirt allies stood with me, wearing the normal clothes I'd found for them. I'd trained them on how to act, and we'd worked together to mask our *feel*, because they said their kin could sense them otherwise.

Will thought they were just two friends of mine. He was thrilled to see me making friends.

Will was the High Priest's assistant by then, but that old man didn't trust me very much. I had to stand a bit away from the altar, in the dense crowd, while the High Priest began giving a speech to thunderous cheers and applause.

The weird thing is - weird in many ways, as it turned out - was that the altar was already active. They'd built it and completed the first parts of the ritual the night before. A gigantic oval lay torn in space in the middle of it, kept open by the row of chained brownshirts. It was a portal; an honest-to-God portal in space. That's not the weird part, though: my two allies whispered that it shouldn't be able to do what it was doing.

It wasn't just a portal in space. Among the random flitting locations on Earth it displayed, I recognized some as very ancient but bustling with life. It was showing other *times*, too. I saw a tribe of cavemen. I saw the Colossus of Rhodes. I saw the crowd, our crowd, then and there, from behind. Many of the sea of people waved at themselves for a few moments, laughing and cheering.

That should have been impossible, my allies told me. The configuration of the altar was not just augmenting and focusing the abilities of the brownshirts, it was fracturing spacetime, too. Whatever might have intended to use that portal, they said, it was something extraordinarily dangerous. They couldn't emphasize it enough: there was dangerous, like a gun; really dangerous, like a nuclear bomb; extremely dangerous, like a universe-eating swarm of machines, and then whatever this was.

It was worse worse than all that.

They couldn't even hazard a guess as to what it might be.

But it didn't make sense to me. The Dreamer On High was on the Moon. That much had to be true. The object had hit, the Moon had gone molten - and remained molten, so massive as it was, casting lurid orange over my Free senses and the crowds and high rises around me - and then, the Dreamer On High had begun His insidious work.

He was already here. He didn't need a portal strong enough to fracture spacetime. He was already here He was just stuck on the Moon.

And now, five more *somethings* were coming to reinforce his power.

So what was this portal for?

I understood the gravity of our errors the moment I saw Him.

A black-robed figure moved through the crowd, parting disciples like waves. A hood covered his face, but I knew who it was the moment I saw him. He walked slowly up to the altar and faced his High Priest. My brother Will stood to the side, among many helpers and assistants, each dressed in flowing purple and gold. Next to them, and in many strategic places, stood brutish men with guns.

We'd had provisions in our plan to handle the men with guns, but that plan was on thin ice, now.

The Dreamer On High was already here. They'd summoned him the night before. They'd brought him to Earth somehow the night before

We'd been tricked. We'd been outsmarted.

They hadn't cared about the holiday at all. They'd just used it to subtly dupe us!

He moved past me, close enough to almost touch. I thought, in my mind, that I should pull my knife, leap forward, and slice his throat but chill waves kept me frozen in place.

My two brownshirt allies looked away, lest he sense them.

Had that been my chance? I began feeling my limbs again as he stepped up onto the altar.

At that moment, the crowd murmured, and I turned to look with the rest of humanity.

A single man ran down the empty wake left by the Dreamer's passing. He looked wild and half-homeless, but desperate the men with guns hefted their weapons and began to aim, but they were too late to stop his simple attempt.

He hurled a book at the portal.

That was all.

With twenty thousand other pairs of eyes, I watched it sail through the air. It wasn't a fiction book. It had no image on the cover. It must have been a journal.

It looked like it was about to fall short, but the effect was an optical illusion. It curved up a bit in the roiling air and sailed into the vast portal.

The moment it passed through, the portal flashed into a dozen fractured images of other, similar books sailing through the air. Behind them, we could all plainly see other individual men and women in other crowds completing throws in the midst of vast crowds. In each alternate version of our own scene, a Dreamer stood, black-robed, calm, and unmoving.

Instead of shooting him outright, the armed thugs grabbed the lone man and brought him to the ground. Whoever he was, the lone man screamed for help, half in gibberish and no one helped him. How could they? To do so would mean death.

"That's what it's for," one of my brownshirt allies whispered. "He's accessing a different vector than we expected. He's not trying to access alternate Earths in the parallel reality sense. He's trying to access different quantum choice trees of *this* universe."

"What?" I asked fiercely, sort of grasping what he was talking about.

He moved a little closer to speak without being heard by the crowd pressed against us. "This could have happened a thousand different ways. We could have come to other cities. A different man or woman could have thrown that book. That's what you're seeing: all the other presents and futures of these events."

I kept my expression positive despite my intense worry about what he was describing. We hadn't understood or planned for any of this. "*Why?*"

**Silence.**

A blasting tidal wave of utter quiet tore across the city center. As one, humanity froze.

The Dreamer turned to face us.

**A vast darkness comes.**

A cheer began swelling.

**Silence.**

The chill voice, as if someone were whispering directly into our minds, brought absolute stillness.

**I can sense that not all of you love me. I can feel your minds. I can feel your hatred.**

I gulped, and kept my thoughts positive. Each of my two allies clutched one of my arms, and helped hide us from the probing energies I felt roving around the air.

**I speak to you now, non-believers. A great darkness is coming. I have always been here, watching you from just outside the walls. Security is illusion. Safety is a self-imposed tomb.**

I reeled under the icy cold of his words in my thoughts, until something occurred to me: why was he speaking to us at all? He would only address us in this manner if we were threats if we actually stood a chance

The portal's destinations were starting to slow down, going from rapid randomness to slowing coherence, almost as if a spinning wheel was losing momentum as someone applied the brakes. I could see the chained brownshirts focusing and a thug near the one Free brownshirt applied a shocking prod to him to force him to comply, too.

If the Dreamer was addressing us at all, then we actually stood a chance.

I lifted the flare gun I'd hidden under my shirt, wondering if it might be the last act I ever took.

I pulled the trigger, and an orange flare shot up, burning the color of the molten sky.

As I said, absolute chaos did break out at the proper time.

Two of the armed men were with us, it turned out. They rotated in place and immediately shot several of their fellows in the back.

The crowd around us surged intensely, and fighting broke out all around. Nobody knew who the enemy was; Changed or Free, everyone suspected everyone else. It was as we'd expected, but I hadn't anticipated the sheer violence. Blood sprayed through the air as friend murdered friend; as family murdered family.

A concerted push aimed for the altar plateau - our plan, actually taking shape.

A knot of men, women, and even teenagers that I'd never seen before surrounded us, and we punched, sliced, and kicked our way to the staging area while five blue stars grew brighter in the sky - the approaching objects, blueshifted by their sheer speed.

The goal wasn't to get *me* to the portal - it was to get our two allies close. Together, the two Free brownshirts stared at the portal, and the space around it trembled from the interference.

Somehow, though, it was me that the Dreamer turned to face.

**Stop.**

The command was inviolable, and I froze as ordinary men and women massacred each other in a circle around the two of us.

**Order them to stop.**

I'd never felt pain like that, and I can still remember it vividly: the two rooms in my mind began cracking, as if their foundation was shifting. I remember shaking, and seeing my vision brim crimson as blood began welling out of my eyes.

Behind the Dreamer, Will pushed his way through the fighting and reached me. "Stop hurting him!" he shouted - and the black-robed figure turned his attention on my brother instead.

That freed me, and I stumbled forward, through misty red, lurid orange, and growing blue, to feebly try to tackle the Dreamer On High.

I fell right through him.

**Fool.**

"The portal," I breathed, writhing on flat metal. "How can you use it if you're not here?"

**It's not for me. It's for you all of you. I am your savior. There is a chain of events in which the human race survives the coming darkness. There is one future in which you escape the crushing forces that approach. You will come to that land of plenty and be safe there under me.**

The Dreamer stood in place and looked up at the molten orange sphere hanging low above us. He lowered his hooded head as five streaks of vivid blue rapidly sliced across the sky.

I turned my head as blinding white and orange exploded above. Even that wasn't enough as successive impacts followed, and the sea of people fighting one another fell in waves against the sheer brightness.

The ground trembled beneath us, and incredible winds began pouring through the channels between the high rises.

Many began running without prompting, and the rest organized an evacuation. I helped unchain the brownshirts, all now Free, and we ran.

The Dreamer was gone, the portal was gone and, as you all know, so was the Moon. A ring of molten rock arcs through the sky now, lighting each day and each night until it cools.

The remains of the Dreamer On High are up there, too gobs of unidentifiable organic mass that many say looks like brain matter. I believe it.

Thing is, we never understood what we were facing: the Dreamer hadn't come with that first object. It had *always been there.* It had, in all likelihood, formed the Moon by its arrival. That's why we have - well, had - two Moons, and why one has always been so different from the other. The other Moon lurks still beyond the molten ring, glimmering with reflected orange. I don't like that sight at all. Not one bit. I still feel watched. It'll go back to staying beneath my horizon for three months soon, like it was from October to December, and I can't wait for that reprieve. Let the southern hemisphere take a turn feeling creeped out.

Some unknown power shot those objects at us eons ago, some power unrelated to the Dreamer. That's what we figure, now, and I'm sure you've all heard the theories. The first object was a calibration test, possibly, and failed to kill the Dreamer On High. The next five were right on target, and completely obliterated the Moon just to make sure.

Whoever had fired those objects hadn't been trying to kill us. They'd been trying to save us. Had they suffered at the hands of the Dreamer On High, or something like it? Had this incredible gift been their final act? Scientists turned their telescopes toward the origin point, but there was nothing left there now that star had gone nova when Earth was in its infancy.

Whoever they'd been, they'd saved us without a word, and without a single thank you. Still, we thanked them, the world over.

But I can't help feeling like we're not safe. The words the Dreamer spoke to me - and to nobody else - linger with me. Was it actually, in its own twisted way, trying to save us from something worse?

The brownshirts have moved on, but they left me and the other members of the resistance they trusted with a few concerns.

First, if they can find the rest of their people - the ones that moved on - and if they can find the old allies they spoke of, they'll come back for us to make sure we're alright.

Second, they left us with a small metallic chip, one of several they had, that will show us the way to some sort of safe haven if they never manage to return. The chip is very old, and I'm not sure how to use it, but I'm certain we'll figure it out if the coming darkness turns out to be real

And, finally now this was the odd one they warned that someone or something was hunting them. They didn't know who or what it was, only that they sensed it on their trail, and it had already passed through here following the rest of their kind. There was no guarantee the hunter would not return. They requested: if anyone came through here asking about them, *lie.*

Gladly, I told them. That is why I give no specific descriptions in my tale here. I don't want the hunter to know what they look like. As far as anyone else is concerned, they're just slightly odd humans.

Me, I'm procrastinating. I have to go visit Will's grave with Laura today. Dad can't go, of course, because he drinks even more than before this all happened - before he killed Tracy, the only woman who put up with him.

It's just me and my sister now, and I'm left in Will's place to take care of the tattered remains of our family. On the bright side, I don't need pills anymore. The Dreamer permanently gave me wholeness of mind, even as it took away my older brother. He died there on that altar, taking the Dreamer's attack in my place. He died there a hero, along with the thousands of others who didn't survive Christmas day.

And the human race recovers from their shared hangover together, with me as a new member. I've got a strong handle on myself now, and a new confidence born of everything I went through. I'm even going on a second date with Ashley in a few days, and, this time, I think I won't screw it up.

Silver linings, I suppose

Yeah, I'm finally a functioning member of the human race, alright. Only, I'm not sure I like this club. I can't help but dwell on the statistics that came out last week. According to the surveys and studies done after the fact, only eighteen percent of the population truly came under the Dreamer's control.

Eighteen percent. That's how many people were one hundred percent brainwashed. That's how many human beings have completely whole minds.

It was like a grand social experiment, the lead scientist said on TV.

Only eighteen percent. The rest were partially controlled, or totally free. The rest simply fell in line out of fear, self-preservation, and paranoia. That's the thing: like so many eras in human history, nobody knew who was who. Nobody knew who to trust. Lines of communication were controlled by key members of the Changed, and neighbors were turned against one another in classic fashion. I can't shake the dark despair that such news leaves in me.

The Dreamer had no power - except what we gave it.

As I was getting ready, I saw some of the replies. Many of you advised that I should secretly record my date, if I could, and well, I gave in to the paranoia.

For the first time in my life, Im glad I did.

It was already getting late by the time I managed to shave, shower, and fix my hair up the best I knew how.

She drove, and I tried to make *small talk*. To be honest, I had no idea what I was doing. She didnt seem to mind my awkwardness, and she took us to a nearby bar that she said was a favorite of hers.

I dont drink. Ever. My doctor had mentioned once that alcohol might interfere with antipsychotic medications, and Ive been fearful ever since.

Still, I was determined not to let my issues run my life. I ordered a beer and pretended that it was something I did all the time. I wasnt sure if she noticed my shaking hands, but I clenched my fingers together and put on a calm face.

I said stuff, and she laughed. I didnt get it. Nobody had ever thought my sarcastic and bitter comments were funny before. I had always just been that weird guy on the fringe. Why was this girl even talking to me? It just didnt make sense.

And thats when your comments started getting to me. I just couldnt believe that I was interesting or attractive to anyone. So, I left my phone at the bar, set it to record audio, and I said I was going to the bathroom.

I did stay in there quite a bit longer than I wanted to, but I was afraid to come back out. What if she noticed that I'd set my phone to record? What if I shook my head, messed with my hair a little in the mirror, and then finally went back out.

Everything seemed normal. She sat at the bar checking her phone. I used that opportunity to pick up my phone and pretend to do the same.

"Oh, a voicemail," I said. "One second."

Instead, I actually listened to the recording.

I heard myself making a small excuse and walking away. A moment later, I heard her ask someone: "How are you liking the weather?"

A voice I recognized as the bartender's followed: "It's fine"

Their reactions were odd. It sounded as if there was some sort of hidden meaning to the exchange, but that the two were unsure of one another.

I looked over and noticed the bartender watching me. I hurriedly glanced away.

The recording wasn't much, but something about it felt off. I couldn't shake the feeling that something was very wrong but I was on a date, and I was still determined not to let my paranoia get the best of me.

Even as I began to put the phone down, the last of the recording captured one more muttered sentence: "He's never going to look, damnit"

Had I really just heard that? Was my mind playing tricks on me again? Feeling heady, I lowered the phone.

"Everything alright?" she asked.

"Yeah, just forgot about something I have to give back to a friend," I lied. I put on a happy face and pretended like I hadn't heard anything.

And had I, really? I could feel ripples in my awareness, as if I was half-dreaming, but I knew that I was awake. It was a familiar and typically disconcerting sensation, and I hated that it was happening *now* of all times.

Saying that I needed some air for a second, I stepped outside. Thankful that nobody was out front smoking at the moment, I clutched my head and tried to breathe in some sense. The sidewalk beneath my feet still seemed cast in burnt orange. God, why did I have to be like this? Why did I have to suspect everything? Why did I have to see and hear things that weren't there?

Feeling a rather strong bout of paranoia, an idea occurred to me.

Going back inside, I sat down and put on a neutral face. "I just looked at the Moon. It's gorgeous tonight."

She hesitated in the middle of a sip of her drink, and lowered it slowly. She watched me intently, her eyes and expression carefully balanced. "Is it now?"

I had the distinct impression that she wasn't sure whether to believe me. Why would that matter, if I was just talking about the Moon?"

"What's it like?" she asked. I imagined I heard a subtext of interrogation beneath her nonchalant question.

I hadn't thought the idea through this far but what if everything was fine? I'd sound like a weird asshole if I said what I really knew was up there. "Full, very bright silver."

She locked gazes with me for a very long moment, but I had years of practice faking that I was fine. At long last, she sighed. "I thought you'd never look."

A blast of panic tore through me, but my practiced fake calm kept me in place. I wanted to scream *what did you just say?* Instead, I nodded, gave a weak laugh, and picked up my drink. "So what now?"

"I guess we wait," she replied, leaning against the bar. "It's tough, you know? Can't be certain about anyone these days."

I nodded again and took a long gulp of beer, trying to understand what was happening. I couldn't be hallucinating this entire conversation, could I? And I couldn't ask questions without exposing the fact that I was what? That I was myself, or that I hadn't actually looked at the Moon?

The bartender came over and slid me another drink as I nervously finished mine. I went to offer him some cash, but he shook his head. "I couldn't help but overhear. I wasn't sure, but I suspected - now I know. First one's on me. Welcome to the club. Here's one for the lady, too." He slid a second drink over.

Ashley smiled at him. "Thanks!"

I took a moment to text my brother my location, and a message: *Please help me, I feel like I'm losing my mind. I don't know what's going on. There are people here acting strangely. I don't know if they're messing with me or what.*

"Don't you know it's rude to text during a date?" Ashley said, and I sheepishly dropped the phone. I could do nothing but act normal.

Past the initial weirdness, nothing else strange seemed to be happening. Waffling back and forth between terror and self-doubt, I did my best to keep up our prior level of conversation. After an hour or two of drinking and hanging out, I started to doubt I'd ever seen or heard anything strange. In fact, I was glad I'd ignored the few odd sentences I'd thought I'd heard from Ashley and the bartender.

Alcohol did, indeed, make me feel weird. Was it interfering with my medication, or did alcohol just naturally make people red-faced, loud, and stupid?  I knew I was starting to behave oddly, and I actively tried to reel myself in. Still, she noticed.

"Ok, time to get you home," she laughed. "You don't drink much, do you?"

I shook my head.

"Good. I'm glad. Dean's an asshole when he drinks."

She helped me up and led us outside. This time, three guys and a girl stood outside smoking. We crossed the street, heading for her car, and she looked up as we got to the opposite corner. She sighed and smiled. "Isn't He beautiful?"

I froze. Did she mean the Moon?

There was no helping it. It only took a moment. She knew I was purposely avoiding looking.

She backed away a step. "You lied!"

She looked across the street at the smokers, and I guessed that she was judging whether she could trust them. She half-shouted something, but then changed her mind mid-sentence - if there were other people *in the know* with whatever she was doing, was it possible that she didn't know who they were? She couldn't scream for help in that regard, so, instead, she shouted something much worse.

"Help! This creep is attacking me!"

"What?" I screamed back. It was my worst nightmare to have my awkward interactions misinterpreted as threatening but, wait, that wasn't what was happening here. "No - no I'm not!"

Immediately, the three guys across the street frowned, assessed her fear, and then charged in my direction. I ran, but they were faster than me, and one took me down from behind with wide gripping arms. I hit the sidewalk roughly, barely keeping my face from slamming into concrete, and they rolled me over.

I remember holding up my arms, feebly trying to keep the punches from landing somewhere critical, but one did manage to leave a horrible pain in my eye socket. I was certain I'd have a black eye, if they didn't just kill me.

But someone tore them off, shouting at the top of his lungs. Pushing and shoving them away, he kneeled next to me and helped me sit up.

I'm not proud of it, but I did cry. There was blood and bruising all over me, and my 'date' had turned horrible in all the ways I feared most. What if I'd really attacked her? I couldn't believe anything, not with the alcohol messing with my head.

"Alek, christ," came the savior voice from above. "What the hell's going on?"

"Will?" I couldn't believe it - he'd actually come! "I'm really confused. And she made me drink. But don't look at the Moon. Something's going on."

He sighed and went to lift his head, but I covered his face with my hand. "Don't look, Will. This isn't a joke. Remember how you said I had three promises I could ask you, as a brother?"

"Yeah"

"Well, I've got two left, and I want to use one for this. Don't look at the Moon. I can't explain why, because it would sound crazy, even for me."

"If it's that important to you, fine. It'd probably hurt to look at, anyway, since it's still burning so brightly."

"It's what?" I asked, stunned out of my pained daze. "The Moon's on fire?"

"Of course it is," he replied, confused. "Did you somehow miss all the craziness?"

I couldn't talk anymore after that. I was too overcome by relief, as if I'd been plucked right out of a nightmare and saved. The Moon *was* on fire, at least in the memories of myself, Donald, and my brother, Will. It wasn't just me.

As long as it wasn't just me, I was happy.

I did have to show him, though, online. I had to show him how all the articles, videos, and pictures had been scrubbed. There wasn't a trace online.

He'd met Crazy Donald once before, too, and it shocked him to see the old man lucid and calm. Well, mostly lucid and calm. He still sat in the corner, stunned by the loss of thirty years of his life.

And now I'm trying to figure out what to do next. My date went horribly, but I'm not convinced that something isn't really going on. Guys, is anyone acting strangely around you?

---

Sorry for the delay in posting again, but I gather a bunch of you are feeling the same way. These people don't seem to know each other, but they're starting to talk and figure out who's who. I keep feeling like I'm being stared at in the grocery store, which is weird, because normally I feel invisible.

Will is staying for the time being. He's concerned for a lot of reasons, but mainly I think he wants to make sure I'm okay. Donald is sleeping on our couch, and we have been keeping mostly to ourselves for the past few days. Every time we go out, conversations with other people feel strange and suspicious, like everyone suspects everyone else of either being *in on it* or *not in on it*, and nobody knows for sure

But what is *it?* What's going on out there? Donald keeps having dreams about a hateful presence watching us from a great distance. I can't help but think back on what Ashley said - *isn't He beautiful?* Who? Who did she mean?

Did that object that hit the Moon bring something terrible to our doorstep? What would have happened to us if it had landed here instead? We thought we'd been saved, but were we really safe at all?

All of these thoughts push the boundaries of the logic I usually use to keep myself sane. Will isn't talking much about this, but I can tell he's worried. He knows something's going on, but nobody can say for sure what it is.

He did mention that he thinks ideas can be very powerful. The right kind of rumor could spread all over, making people fear each other. Maybe that was what we were feeling when we went out: people afraid of each other, suspicious of each other, on the basis of rumor - not on the basis of some spreading secret agenda.

Funny thing is, whatever's going on, it isn't affecting life as usual. I still see people driving and going to work. People are still shopping at the grocery store. I've been watching horror movies for ideas which is usually ill-advised, given my condition, but it feels like research and I've never seen anything like this. These people aren't crazy, and they're not fanatics, and they're not mind-controlled they're something else entirely. They're completely themselves, but

Hold on, it seems like something's going on outside.

---

We barely got away.

A mob of people, maybe eight or ten guys, came looking for me. They said it was because of 'what I did to Ashley' or, at least, that's what they shouted as we ran. We heard them coming and went out the back basement door. Will gripped my arm hard the whole way, and I'm sure he was wondering whether I'd really hurt somebody. With nowhere else to go, Donald followed us, trembling.

"That's *not* why they're after us," I insisted. "They know I'm not one of them. They want us to look at the Moon."

"I've had enough of that talk," Will replied as we hid in the bushes outside my building. "I'm not gonna look, because I promised, but how can looking at the Moon change people?"

It was Donald who finally got through to him. "I don't know you, man, but you need to wake up. You're a nice, strong lad, and I'm sure life has got along rather well for you. You need to believe in the society that empowers you."

I stared at him, surprised.

"Alek and I," he continued. "We're metalheads. Outcasts. Anti-establishment, man. We don't have the same need to believe that everything is fine, and we're probably still free because of who we are. We fell through the cracks, like we always do." He gazed up at the Moon. "I had a priest and a bitter old woman screaming in my head for thirty years. I looked up for thirty seconds, and it all went away. There's a whispering in my brain that pushes back against the screaming. In between, I'm free."

Will took a moment away from peering at our building to stare him down. "Then how do we know you're not one of them? That the Moon didn't change *you?*"

I hadn't thought of that. Why hadn't I thought of that?!

"I guess you don't know," Donald answered, grim. "But I've got nowhere to go. I'm sorry." He turned and shouted towards the building. "*They're over here!*"

I remember screaming something in anger, but Will punched him quickly, knocking him senseless. 

It didn't matter. The mob had heard. They came storming out of the building in a flash.

"They'll find us," Will breathed, grabbing my arm.

We ran again, diving between bushes, climbing fences, and slinking through back yards.

"Did you hurt that girl?" he asked.

"No!" I whispered angrily. "I didn't hurt anyone!"

He said nothing further, his expression focused. We seemed to be making a large circle, and, after two hours of exhausting sneaking, we found his car. I climbed into the passenger seat with a sigh. Cloud cover had come and hidden the Moon, and I felt strangely more secure for it. "Where are we going?" I panted.

"We're going to make sure Laura's alright," he responded. "Dad and Tracy, too."

We're in a coffee shop right now. I thought to bring my laptop when we ran, and I'm glad I did. It's our only lifeline to the world at large. News pages, forums, comics they're all going on as normal. How much of the world is affected? Do the affected people even know something is different? The people in the coffee shop here aren't looking around suspiciously. Do they have any idea what's going on? Have they narrowly avoided looking at the Moon somehow? It *has* been rather cloudy

Or is all this going on in my head?

How do you guys cope with feelings like this? I just can't trust myself

---

The tone of the conversations on this forum has definitely changed. I think they're reading our posts and changing their behavior accordingly. If you're not affected, don't trust anybody. It's *not* just you. You're *not* crazy.

I made it home. Dad's passed out drunk, and Tracy is making some coffee. Will is talking to them quietly in the other room. I wish I could hear what they were saying. I have this strange feeling that Will might be making the case to lock me up. If most of this is in my head, I must look totally insane to him.

Or what if he's been compromised? What if he's already looked at the Moon?

Oh God

---

Guys, I don't know what to do. I panicked. I've only got like thirty in cash on me and I ran.

I ran away. I took my stuff and I bolted. I couldn't risk getting locked up.

I've been hiding out in an abandoned house down the street for two days, and using the neighbor's unprotected wireless. I used to listen to music with the kid who lived here. He's gone, but the house is still in good shape. I don't think anybody will be looking for me indoors.

This'll work it has to work I'll figure out how to live

---

Other people were using this house as a hideout. I'm cramped in a basement closet, and I've been here for hours. They're weird cultish, in a way. They're all dressed in plain brown clothes that look like someone's piss-poor attempt to be inconspicuous to the point that it's blatantly obvious they're not normal.

They talk funny, too but they seem just as wary of what's going on. I saw them peering out windows and hiding when a car drove by.

Crap!

---

Those people found me somehow, like they knew where I was hiding. But that was two weeks ago. They keep to themselves, and I still find them very strange, but they're trying to figure out what's going on, too.

I'm still not sure this isn't all just in my head.

I've been trying to get a read on these people. They seem like foreigners, but they speak perfect English. If they're a cult, I can't figure out what they're called. They seem to be worried about another half of their group that got changed by the Moon.

I'm almost out of pills. I'm nervous, and I feel surreal all the time. I have a strong feeling I'm hallucinating these people entirely.

I sneak out and get food at night. At first, I used cash, but I didn't like the suspicious looks I got from the people at the store. How much of the world is affected, now? It seems like society is going on just fine without me, and *I'm* the Crazy Donald on the fringes.

Am I standing around muttering to myself on a corner somewhere?

Maybe not, but I'm still living in a basement and hallucinating a bunch of brown-clothed strangers.

It's getting cold, too, now that it's November I notice people replying less and less on here I've gotta steal food

---

Oh God, oh God I don't understand. I can't believe it. I don't *want* to believe it.

They found me.

A dozen men and women - and my dad, Tracy, and Laura - found me.

They stood outside the house and shouted for me to come out.

"Come on out, son," my dad yelled, his face a little red from drinking.

I peered out the window.

Behind me, the brown-clothed people prepared to fight with makeshift weapons. I thought it hilarious that my hallucinations were preparing like they could do anything.

"Look," Tracy yelled. "We know you're scared because of what you did to that poor girl. Don't worry. We convinced her not to press charges. Come on out, and everything will be fine."

What were they waiting for? Why didn't they just storm the house? They had more than enough people and the molten Moon cast everything outside in lurid orange, making me terrified of even touching the light streaming in the window.

Outside, they muttered among themselves, and then Laura took a turn. "Alek, we're all really worried about you. You need to come out of your own free will. It'll show us you're not violent."

"Don't do it," a voice said beside me.

I turned and looked. "Will?!"

"Yeah, we're not going out for anything. They can rot in hell."

I stared. "When did you get here?"

"What?" he asked, frowning. "I've been here the whole time, hiding out with you. We're not gonna get caught and turned into one of *them.*"

Was I losing my mind? Or had he just snuck in the back and said all this to confuse me? How could I have forgotten that he was here the whole time? I wished I had time to go back and read what I'd written down. Had I mentioned Will at all recently?

"Ah, the hell with it," my dad yelled. "We don't have time for the cat-and-mouse game anymore. We need to be ready for His coming. *Come outside right now!*"

"No!" I shouted back.

He lifted a gun - not at me - but at Tracy. She shouted next. "Alek, Will, come out, or you're going to start paying the price for resisting."

"Don't do it," Will told me gruffly.

"I'm gonna count to three, boy," my dad yelled. "Threetwoone"

I didnt move.

The gunshot rang out with a surprising auditory punch, and I felt my awareness go numb. Had he really just?

Tracy fell to the ground, bleeding from the side of her head.

He lifted the gun and pointed it at Laura. "Do you understand? I'm gonna count to three"

I stared, horrified.

Beside me, Will was crying.

Behind me, the strange brown-clothed people had used the opportunity to slip out the back door and escape if they'd existed at all.

Will stood.

"No!" I insisted, trying to hold him - but he tore free and moved for the front door.

"Don't do it!" he yelled, going out with his hands up. "Don't kill her!"

My dad smiled. "That's one. Alek, come out now."

Will faced the house, his expression resigned. "Come on, Alek. We don't have a choice."

He was right, in a way. I had no money, no allies, and no idea what was really going on. Hesitantly, I stepped outside.

Will grinned, and the dozen men and women snatched me.

But he didn't look at the Moon.

He didn't look.

He didn't need to he'd already been changed.

I'd been tricked.

I'd been tricked because I was easy, and vulnerable.

They held my head and forced me to stare up, and some even held my eyelids.

As I watched, the blazing cloud of fire around the molten Moon seemed to condense, swirl, and disappear into me leaving behind a silver crescent.

They let me go after thirty seconds, because they didn't need to hold me anymore.

I was myself, still, but no longer.

It was like having access to another room in my mind. In one room, I was me. In the other, I was also me, but a me that eagerly awaited the coming of the Dreamer On High. I hated the fact that some people did not believe in Him, and I wanted to seek them out and make them *see.* They had to see his glory. They *all* had to see his glory

But a temple of self remained within. They didn't know. The slightest resistance kept the believer in me from mentioning that I was out of pills.

I was utterly His for a week or two but somewhere around the first or second of December, the lack of pills began setting in.

I write this to you now, friends, because we are all on this forum for a reason. We've all got our issues - and those issues can free us. I write to you now, completely free, and *they don't know.* They don't know that I'm myself once more. There's talk of His coming in one more cycle of the Moon, which I think means something big is happening in the next month. December 2014 is not going to be a good month for humanity but I'm going to do my best to get close to whatever is going to happen.

And I'm going to make sure it crashes and burns.

If you're out there, and you're still reading any of this, you have to do the same. Don't let them know that you know. They started out with deception, when they were few, but they're not afraid to be violent now. If anyone else is left, lay low, and wait for the right moment.

I'll write again when I can.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this might be an odd question to ask on a mental health forum, but - does anybody else see that the Moon is on fire?

I'm not joking. I'll run through this for a second. I know I'm not the most reliable person, but I don't think I could imagine something like *this.*

Hell, I remember the entire lead-up to what happened. People were *freaking out.* It was the end of the world, by all anybody knew. What did they call it? An 'unidentified object at near-luminous speed' That's what the media said, over and over, for like the day and a half we had until it hit. I guess that meant it was going really fast fast enough to destroy all life on the planet, anyway. That was the part nobody misunderstood.

They said somebody had to have created this object and aimed it at us. It was unlike anything natural they'd ever seen. They said somebody had probably shot this thing at us billions of years ago, probably aiming to wipe out the competition before it evolved aiming to wipe *us* out before we were anything more than barely living goo.

But, apparently, it'd been sent out - hold on, let me check my scribblings about what they said - between 4.54 and 4.527 billion years ago because whoever had shot it at us hadn't taken the Moon into account. They couldn't have, because it didn't exist then.

Miraculously, the timing was just right, and it hit the Moon instead.

I remember the noise and the flash. How could I forget? Absolutely everyone was outside watching and listening, thinking the world was about to end but it was daytime here, and the Moon was on the other side of the planet.

We only saw the edges of the blast spraying up past the horizon. A sprawling cloud of flame and glowing dust erupted across the sky as I stood on the street among dozens of neighbors I didn't know. Well, I knew Crazy Donald, a homeless guy who I sat with sometimes outside Wendy's - he was there, muttering to himself and holding a plastic bag filled with plastic bags, but I don't think he knew anything was going on. He was just going around asking people for change, even before we knew that we were going to live for another day.

I like him, because he and I get along, in a quiet and lonely sort of way.

I followed him around and made sure he was safe as the crowd grew confused, excited, and loud, scaring him.

The radios came alive and said we should probably stay inside for the next few days. We didn't need to be told twice. I urged Donald to move along to somewhere safe, and then I hid in my apartment.

The parties were absolutely insane - from what I could hear through the walls. I imagined that people were amazed at being alive, and, since they had nowhere to go until the all-clear, it was party time.

Me? I keep to myself, mostly.

See, that's why I'm asking. I remember all this very vividly. I could have *sworn* it was real. Thing is, even despite the pills, I have a tough time with reality. I can feel the rippling waters of dreaming while I'm awake. Often, I can't distinguish between the cold hard lines of the real world and half-formed concepts of waking imagination. I don't want to have my dosage upped again, because the pills make my brain feel like cement, so I pretend.

I'm not crazy. I don't mutter to myself or attack people. My thoughts are all still there - my 'faculties,' as my brother Will calls them. So I force myself to behave normally when I see something I don't understand, and I use logic to control what I do.

I like music. Songs keep me grounded, because they float through the air like mathematical chains. The songs that I know, I know by heart, and I know I'm solid as long as the notes keep making sense. I'm listening to *Man on the Silver Mountain* right now, trying to keep coherent, but the strategy doesn't help memories of my hallucinations.

Is it a hallucination? I ask, because the media coverage of the molten Moon dropped off pretty quickly over the last week. I mean, there's a massive cloud of glowing dust and flaming gasses spread out across the sky like somebody thrust a burning spear straight through the Moon - because *that's what happened* - and nobody seems to care.

Today, I can't even find any mention of it. All the videos and pictures are gone. I can't find the articles anymore. It's been too cloudy here to see it myself, and I don't have any windows in my basement apartment, but I've ventured out a few times to look up. I still see the orange glow, like a smeared second sun behind the clouds, and I have to wonder: why the hell isn't anyone talking about this anymore? Has our attention span really gotten that short? Are we right back to the next reality-television drama and celebrity gossip *already?*

A weird thing happened when I ran into my next-door neighbor, Dean. I normally avoid him, like I avoid everyone, but this time was different.

"Hey Alek," he said, smiling at me in the hall.

Why would anyone smile at me? Grubby, unshaven, wearing a Megadeth t-shirt, I was the epitome of *that guy you ignore who is fine with being ignored.* I would have said hello back and moved on quickly, but I had a question myself, this time. "How about that sky?"

"Yeah?" he asked, studying my face. Tall, blonde, and good-looking in that annoying Abercrombie sort of way, he had no reason to so much as look at me. I wondered why he was even talking to me. "What about it?"

I remember frowning slightly. Something seemed off about his interest. I wasn't about to make a huge social blunder and mention the sky was on fire if I was just hallucinating the whole thing, either. "Crappy weather's blocking the view."

He smiled at that. "Yes. It's quite unfortunate."

I nodded, laughed sheepishly, and hurried down the stairwell. I think he stood there watching me until I closed the door

The more I thought about it, the more I was sure that he didn't remember that the Moon was on fire. If I were a normal person, that's the *first* and *only* thing that would be on my mind. Hey, remember that time the Moon freaking exploded?! Yeah, me too, since it was like last week! And because half the goddamn sky is still on fire!

Every couple hours for several days, I'd go outside, but I kept missing the sight due to the cloudy winter weather. From the pictures I remembered seeing, the Moon was a molten coin burning in between two jutting clouds, almost like a fiery eye, and I wanted to see it for myself. If I could just see it if I could just stare at it for a time I could finally convince myself one way or the other. I was becoming pretty certain that the Moon would just be the same old silver dollar it had always been. Thing is, I thought I'd gotten a pretty good handle on my issues.

If I've just imagined the entire thing, then I'm in serious mental trouble.

I left a few messages for my brother, but he hasn't called me back yet.

I even texted my younger sister, Laura, on the excuse that I just wanted to see how she was doing. She didn't respond, either no surprise, though. Dad's probably passed out drunk right about now. I might call Tracy if I get any worse although I wouldn't know what to say to her, really. She's probably busy taking care of Dad's mess, anyway.

I don't know. I'm sure I'll get over this. I just don't want to have to go to my doctor. She'll up my meds again, and then I'll be a zombie.

---

Thanks for the responses, although now I'm just more confused. Some of you say the Moon isn't on fire and to go look for myself, and some of you are just trolling and say the Moon *is* on fire? Hope the mods ban you. This isn't a place to make fun of people.

Some of you have asked about Will before. Yeah, he listens to me. He's the only family I have that takes me seriously at all. I think that he considers it his duty as an older brother. He takes care of Laura, too, although she's got a good head on her shoulders, mostly. I don't think Will would have to do nearly as much if Dad got a job, or stopped drinking. Tracy's nice and all, but we're not her kids, and not her responsibility.

But, uh even Will isn't really returning my calls anymore. Not after that incident I posted about last month. He got mad that I woke him up in the middle of the night for a dream I had while I was *sleeping.* Waking hallucinations were one thing, he said, but dreams while I was asleep were perfectly normal, and I had to deal with them on my own.

He didn't seem to care how traumatic or horrifying the dream was. I mean, I can't blame him. I'm sure, on balance, he's done so much for me, and I've done very little for him, but I've had a terrible sense of impending doom ever since that night. I think about the kinetic terror I felt, and I still can't shake it.

The tough part for me is that my dreams seep into my real life. Like, right now, I feel like I'm being watched. I'm looking up, and there's a small mirror to the right of my laptop. I can't look away, even as I type - or am I looking away, and just *believing* that I'm looking at the mirror? I keep looking deeper and deeper, seeing further into the apartment behind me, and a sense of tension pulls at me, a building scream-to-come that keeps rising to higher and higher intensity. I already see it, I already sense it, but I'm not consciously aware of what it is, not yet

A grenade goes off inside me, throwing terror and adrenaline in a thousand conflicting directions within the confines of my chest and limbs. *He's there. He's standing there, in the shadows, watching me with hatred and intent.* He sees me - he sees that I see him - and he stalks forward, approaching me from behind.

But he's not there. He can't possibly be there. Why would Dean be in my apartment?

I just have to sit still, breathe deep, and -

---

Oh my God. I don't know what to do. I think I killed Dean.

But I had to.

I had to.

I have to make sense of this I have to figure this out ok, step by step

I wasn't listening to music, or I would have known that *he was really there.* Or was he? Is he? Is he really on my floor, bleeding from his head? So secure in the matrix of logic I usually keep myself in, I was certain he wasn't really there. I kept believing that, even as the fear surged up right behind me - and he grabbed me around the neck!

He was trying to drag me toward the door, that's all I could tell. He didn't say a word. I don't know how I got out of his grip, except by going limp and flopping down at a lucky moment, and then he lunged at me again. I scrambled away, pulled a lamp down, and threw it at his face.

A couple bits of shattered light bulb stuck out from his cheek, but he kept coming, furious. He tried to tackle me, but I slipped and fell out of the way, and he smashed sideways into my table. I used his moment of disorientation to lift my printer and bring it down on his head.

He fell, and stopped moving.

What do I do? What do I do? My condition, my pills, would make me out to be a lunatic. Would they lock me up for this? It was in my own apartment, sure, but they'd just say that I invited him inside.

Wait

Did I?

Did I ask him to come look at something? Did I then attack him?

If I'm hallucinating things again, how can I know what's real? I've always hated him hated his niceness I always thought there was a smug arrogance behind it, even if he never showed it.

I couldn't call the police, could I?

But I did. I had to. This wasn't some movie. I couldn't hide the body or any such nonsense. Besides, that would just look worse.

So, I called.

The first thing the cop on the other end asked me was my location. He was very insistent on knowing where I was - even before I'd mentioned what I'd done. Something about his energy spooked me, and I hung up before giving any identifying information.

Goddamnit, Will, where are you?

He's moving! Dean's moving!

---

Thanks for all the replies. Yes, Dean was alive, just unconscious. He woke up, staggered to his feet, and mumbled an apology. It was the weirdest thing ever.

No, he didn't explain what the hell he'd been doing. He seemed confused, more than anything. He did say: "That was really stupid of me. I'm sorry."

About twenty minutes after he stumbled out, through the wall, I thought I heard somebody berating him in his apartment.

Now I'm more confused than ever. I don't understand what he was trying to do. It's satisfying, though, hearing someone shout at him for being an asshole and an idiot. Yeah, I know, right? If I didn't have my own issues, I'd call the police on him myself for breaking and entering.

Sometimes, mental problems make you feel like an outcast. You don't get to call the police. You don't get to ask for help. If there's a problem, *you're* the one in trouble. That's one of the many reasons I don't leave my apartment much.

You guys ever feel like that?

---

I just had the oddest experience. A girl came by - Dean's girlfriend - and asked if I wanted to take a walk. She wanted to apologize and explain what happened, so that I wouldn't 'press charges.' I guess she had no idea I was terrified of interacting with the cops.

She was like Dean. Thin, blonde, perky like a fashion magazine model I hated her immediately, even though she sort of reminded me of my sister. "Fine," I said, and locked my apartment behind me.

The first thing that hit me, aside from the cold night air, was the blazing orange casting everything in eerie burnt colors. The weather had cleared up! Immediately, I could sense the molten Moon and blazing veil above, but I avoided looking at it. It wasn't real, and I wasn't going to give in to my waking dreams.

"Nice night out, isn't it?" she said, oblivious to the burning sky. She walked beside me as we circled the neighborhood. "Look, I'll be honest with you. Dean's kind of a controlling asshole. He's never been violent before, but I think he got the idea that something's going on between you and me."

"What?" I laughed, the last note rising awkwardly high. "I don't think we've ever even spoken."

"No, we haven't," she agreed. "But I saw you in the hall last week and mentioned that I used to date dirty grunge types. You know, metal."

I suddenly felt very warm, and I'm sure my face was red to someone who saw silver moonlight instead of orange. "You did?"

"Yep. He's not really my type. Crazy, right? Since we both look like we belong in an Old Navy ad."

"You said it, not me," I replied. Did I actually just make a joke? I don't think I'd ever gotten this many seconds into a conversation with a pretty girl.

And she actually laughed out loud. "I know, I know. When I dress and act like this, I know what Im doing. Call it an experiment. If we're being honest, I had to get away from the drugs. I love me some Megadeth and Dio, but the scene -"

"Wait, what?" I asked, surprised. "Those are my two favorite bands right now."

She blinked. "Really? I didn't think anyone our age liked the classic stuff still."

I opened my jacket and showed her my t-shirt.

"No friggin' way," she said with a smile. "Well it's nice to meet you, -" She held out her hand.

"Alek," I said, shaking her hand and marveling at my own ability to actually hold a human conversation. I didn't feel numb or terrified, I just felt normal. The fact that she reminded me of my sister had made it easier to deal with her. "Short for Alexander."

"Alexander," she said, smiling. "I'm Ashley." She looked up at the sky for a moment, but I did not follow her gaze. "Beautiful night out," she said.

I still didn't look. I didn't want to face the flaming hallucination that was so insistently trying to ruin my first real connection with someone else in a long time.

"How about this," she continued after a moment, finally looking back at me. "I'm done with Dean either way. He's such an asshole but I honestly believe it's a one-time thing from him. If you don't press charges, I'll go on a date with you."

That part finally broke my scant coolness and made me clam up. I'd seen that moment enough times on television that I knew to force myself to say one word: "Sure."

I think she mistook my terseness for aloof confidence. A genuine and warm smile crossed her face, and then she took my cellphone and put her number in it.

Ten minutes later, I'm back in my apartment, and more shocked than when I thought I'd killed Dean.

Now here's the part where I need some help from you guys. I know I'm posting a ton tonight, and I'm sorry, I just it's so hard to tell what's real. I keep thinking back on it and obsessing over our little walk. I can't help feeling she was trying to get me to look at the sky. Little details, like her choice to talk to me outside, and her long pauses to look over at the Moon and Dean had been trying to drag me to the door

Had her whole thing had our whole connection been fake? Am I just being paranoid? How would they even know about my hallucination? Oh God, what if it's a cruel trick? What if they read my posts and are messing with me?

What do you guys think? Am I just psyching myself out for no reason? I hate this so much I hate my brain, hate my affliction, hate myself why can't I just be normal?

---

Thanks for the support. I *am* kind of freaking out, and you guys make me feel much better. Still a ton of trolls here, though, please STFU

Although I don't agree with the popular sentiment here that going out and looking at the Moon to 'face my fear' will help. I'm not going to do that. Ignoring my hallucinations has always worked for me.

Hold on one second another knock at the door.

---

What the *hell?*

I just got a visit from Crazy Donald. Guess what, though?

He's fine.

He seems lucid.

He looked at me with a clear and direct gaze that I've never seen from him before. He knew my name, too. I opened the door, and he stared at me for a moment before saying, "Alek - you're alright!"

"Yeah," I replied, confused. "Donald, are you like - actually there?"

He nodded. "I'm feeling better. Father Abruzzo has stopped shouting at me." He tapped his head. "I think he's finally forgiven me, after all these years."

"Father Abruzzo?" I asked, concerned.

Donald smiled and nodded. "My mother's stopped scolding me, too." He breathed deep. "I'm feeling good, man. And I don't know anyone else."

I stared at him. "No family?"

He shook his head. "Somewhere. Detroit, last I can remember, before I, uh before the screaming got so loud I couldn't think."

"When was that?"

"I dunno, man. Black Sabbath is the last big thing I can remember. Uh, Glenne Hughes was on vocals that time."

I knew my metal trivia. "Their 1986 tour? Shit, I think they played Detroit that year. You've been out of it for *thirty years?*"

"Thirty years? What year is it now?"

I frowned. "2014. It's October, 2014."

"Damn," he replied, gruff and sad. "Can I look in a mirror?"

"Sure," I told him.

He's in the bathroom crying right now.

I know how to handle this less than I knew how to handle talking to Ashley. I've always sort of gotten along with Crazy Donald - well, just Donald, now, I suppose - but I never suspected that he was aware of me through the fog of his mania. I can't just kick him out, either. Do I have to let him live here? The thought of someone in my space, even if it's just for a bit, makes me nervous.

This has been one hell of a night. I don't think I can take much more emotional stress. I'm already fragile in the best of circumstances, but tonight has been a trip. What do you guys suggest? How should I handle this?

---

I didn't say anything to him. I didn't even mention it to him. I'm terrified beyond all logic right now.

I stood outside the door and tried to calm him down, the way some of you suggested. And you know what he said, as he cried?

"*It's that damn burning Moon,*" he complained. "*I'd rather go back to the screaming than find out I've lost so much of my life.*"

I didn't say anything to him. I never told him about the molten Moon. He said it, unprompted, and I nearly had a panic attack.

It wasn't just my imagination - or, we'd had the same hallucination.

"Donald," I remember saying very weakly. "Do you remember having bad dreams recently?"

He immediately quieted. "I always have bad dreams. My whole life has been a bad dream."

"I'm serious, Donald. In the last month - have you had any particularly horrible nightmares?"

He breathed for a time, in between pathetic sobs, and I heard him move a little on the bathroom floor. "Yeah. Even with Father Abruzzo shouting at me and my mother hurting me, I saw him standing there on the outside, trying to get in."

"Who?"

"*Him,*" he said cryptically. "The Sleeper the Dreamer On High. He's on the outside, looking in. He's always looking in."

I felt a terrible chill at those words. I didn't have a name for the shadow of impending doom I'd felt ever since that night, but I did have a feeling: the sensation of being watched. It felt just like Dean's presence had felt, like someone was standing in the shadows at the back of the room and watching me with fury and hunger. "Don what did you mean when you said it was the Moon?"

"I looked, man. I looked up at it and it looked down, into me."

That was all he would say. I left him to his sobbing, figuring I could get more out of him after his first good night's sleep in thirty years. I left him a blanket, too.

And, now, I'm left with a terrible foreboding. There's a small pool of blood on my floor, and nobody seems to share my hallucination that the Moon is on fire except another crazy person. Still, I called my brother one last time.

"Will," I said to his voicemail. "Don't look at the Moon. I don't know if you've looked - but don't! It's important!"

I don't know what else to do. How *can* I know? How does anyone know what's real? If something's happening who would I even turn to? If it's not, how do I shake this waking nightmare?

And why do so many of you keep insisting I go outside and look at the Moon? I'm not finding this funny anymore.

I have a text from Ashley she wants to go on our date *now* which is way sooner than I expected, I guess, but who knows? I gotta go but I'll be back with more updates when I can manage. Wish me luck, guys!

I'm not gonna let this get to me. I'm not gonna let my issues get in the way of my life. Not this time.

*Havent heard from you in a few days,* the message said. *Are you alright?*

I stared at the two sentences for quite some time, failing to comprehend that they were actually meant for me. Id been answering messages, coordinating responses, and watching the worlds burn for so many uninterrupted hours I couldnt remember the last time Id eaten, or slept, or even taken a walk around my office building prison.

Theyd tried to destroy themselves. Or, someone had tried to destroy them from the inside out. Id spent eleven hours breaking into a military mainframe to shut off a nuclear launch countdown gone awry. Who was in charge on that world? Why had they tried to detonate all of their nuclear weapons? I was still getting messages from people there, all desperate for help against black transmorphic spheres that kept evolving new defenses against anything used against them - black transmorphic spheres that liked to stab people through the skull and then take up residence inside. Were these the brain-eaters Jonathan had mentioned? Or were they a new threat?

Somebody high up had panicked, and started a twelve-hour countdown to global suicide.

Id managed to turn it off with four minutes to spare.

*Haven't heard from you in a few days.* I stared at the two sentences that had been meant for me in particular. *Are you alright?*

I had no way of knowing - had the writer of the first message Id read, the man trapped eleven thousand feet underground with the fate of the world at his fingertips, been the one to start that countdown? Had he seen what was happening on the surface and given up?

I didnt think so. The military mainframe Id gotten into hadnt been nearly as secure and high-tech as the encryption of his message had implied. Most nuclear arsenals on human worlds had been built during the Cold War - an era theyd all shared - and the technology was equally as outdated, [often scarily so.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Y1ya-yF35g)

I stared at the two sentences that had been sent with concern for *me*, something nobody else had really been shown during my efforts. They had their own situations to worry about, and their own homes to defend.

My author contact had remembered that there was a person behind the screen.

The candle I lit during the Game started a fire, I wrote back slowly. I watched it burn out a couple rooms, until the sprinklers took care of it.

*Oh wow, Im sorry.*

Its fine. I kind of wanted it to take this whole place down. Ive smashed all the windows, flattened half the cubicles, and trashed all the pictures my coworkers left behind.

*Are you losing it?*

I sighed. I was considering lying, but, as I watched my map, the circle I'd thought I'd saved went red. *Connection lost.* I stared at it for maybe thirty seconds, too numb to feel anything. Had I missed something? Had I made some error? Had they overridden my shutdown? We'd actually lost one. We'd actually lost an entire world while I'd watched. The sheer size and complexity of the defense efforts had practically guaranteed somebody would slip through the cracks eventually, but I hadn't thought about how it would actually feel to realize, finally, that it was a losing battle, a battle of attrition that we could not win a crushing fist of intense stress squeezed my awareness, and I felt like bursting.

Was I losing it? Yes.

*Ive been thinking about your situation. I enjoy puzzles, and youve got the mother of all puzzles on your hands. We're going to think you out of this situation.*

"Alright" For some reason, I actually believed there was hope. He seemed sensible, and a fresh perspective might see things I couldn't.

*Let's start with the basics, then. Do you have hands?*

"What?"

*Do you have hands? Simple question.*

I looked down at my outstretched hands, fingers poised over my keyboard. "Yes."

*Are you breathing?*

I suddenly became aware of my own breathing as my chest rose and fell.

*What about your eyes? Are you blinking?*

If I hadn't been before, I certainly was after thinking about it. "Damnit, stop," I said, annoyed at suddenly having all sorts of bodily functions brought to my awareness.

*So we can reasonably guess you're alive, right?*

I froze. "You think I might be dead?"

*Well, no. From what you told me, that mind-entity used a different word to describe you. In a way, it specifically listed doomed and dead as things that you were not.*

"So I'm not dead" Aware of them as I was, I took a moment to widen my eyes with surprise. "And I'm not doomed!"

*Right. You're vwaal, whatever that is. If you're not dead, then you're not a ghost, or a spirit, or some other nonsense. If you're not doomed, there's still hope for you yet, in some small amount. And you drew the attention of that entity by thinking very loudly, so you've got a real mind.*

"Of course I've got a mind," I responded, typing the words out on my keyboard. I stretched my hands, suddenly aware that they must be tired from my endless days of working.

*I said a real mind,* my author contact wrote. *I suspected, from the details of your situation, that you might be an artificial intelligence. Possibly a backup system, since you don't mention anything prior to a few weeks ago.*

Still consciously aware of my body, I swallowed uncomfortably. He thought I might be an artificial intelligence? A computer? I blinked, and clenched my hands. I felt floaty and disconnected at times, trapped here in the dark for so long, but I knew I was alive. I *knew it.*

*Which brings me to my next question,* he continued. *How long have you been working there?*

"Two or three years," I replied. "I remember it well."

*Right, that bright day of training.*

I frowned.

*Where do you live?*

I looked down at my hands for a moment. "An apartment on the west side."

*Alright hmm.*

I waited for two minutes until his next question arrived. I wondered why he was asking about *me* rather than my situation.

*Here's one that might disturb you: what's your name?*

I laughed. "It's -"

My mouth hung in place, open at the end of its last fading syllable.

*I was worried this might be the case,* he wrote slowly. *It's not just the building, and your coworkers. There's something wrong with you, too.* He paused again, probably thinking. *Do you have a personnel file?*

"Maybe," I said, struggling to remember my own name. "But without my name, I wouldn't know who to look for"

*Frustrating, isn't it? Perhaps by design. Now there's one detail I've been hesitant to mention as yet. You're not going to enjoy it.*

"What is it? Tell me. I have to get out of here."

*Alright it's the phones. You said there were people screaming on the phones.*

"Yes"

*We have a tendency, as people, to dehumanize traumatizing things like that. I don't know how often I've read stories where strange screaming is used as a background scary detail. But, you know what? A scream requires a person behind it. Someone conscious, awake, and in pain.*

I let my face go slack as I realized the truth of what he was saying.

*I suspect you're not alone there at all. I hate to say this, but your salvation may lie in the most basic of all horror questions: who was phone?*

I gave the message a long - and deserved - dour look.

Then, I jumped up, and ran out of the server room. Heading for one of the cubicle farms I hadn't destroyed in one of my despairing rages, I brought a landline phone down from a desk and sat in front of it, steeling myself. Alright, let's do this

The screaming began the instant the phone left the hook.

Heart racing - I was so aware of it, I felt it in my head - I lifted the phone to my ear. My ear, too, seemed very vivid to me, running chill with the office air conditioning. I began experiencing a drilling pain as I brought the screams close, but I fought through the pain. "Hello?"

The screams changed tenor and tone, briefly, as if the people in pain had heard me.

"**Hello?**" I shouted.

A choir of agonized shouts turned toward me, in an aural sense, and I almost recoiled. "Shut up! Just shut up!" I screamed back at them. "One at a time!"

I caught my breath as they went silent.

One voice - hollow, trembling, and pained - asked a single word. "Heath?"

My entire head suddenly tingled with fire and electricity. A flood of images and associations washed through me, too much to comprehend, and I smiled haggardly at the cubicle wall.

Heath. Heath, from I.T. - had the weeks trapped here in the dark, alone, made me temporarily forget? "Yes, it's me," I said into the phone, suddenly acutely aware that I'd found something else very important. "What's going on?"

"Oh my God, oh my God," said an unknown woman whose voice I thought I vaguely recognized. "You're still there. We thought we'd lost you. Heath, where've you been?"

The first man's voice added to hers. "Heath! Are you alright?"

"Am *I* alright?" I asked, growing confused. "You're the ones screaming!"

A moment of silence echoed loudly between us.

"He doesn't know," a teenage male voice said, almost sadly.

"Where do you think you are, Heath?" asked a wise, slow, and older voice.

A second woman commented, too, her voice overlapping with the other speakers. "Heath, you have to wake up."

That drilling pain from the screams had lingered in my forehead, and now seemed to intensify, forcing me to wince. That's what the eldest boy had said to me a few days ago: *Man, you gotta wake up. Somethin's wrong with you.* What was I missing? What part of me remained shorn away, as if I lay dreaming?

"We've been trapped like this for over a year," the first male voice said again, his words evincing the growing pain of that imprisonment. "Heath, you have to end this."

I thought back to the piles I'd seen on the security feeds. Why had the children battered them with weapons? It was obvious, now that I thought about it: they were ensuring, out of a sense of anything-goes precaution, that they would not be attacked by zombies. Hadn't their protector - my only friend - told them that zombies weren't real?

I supposed it might never have come up in casual conversation.

I knew who the voices on the phone were. "You're my coworkers."

"Yes."

I sat for a moment, just feeling my breathing, before I said it aloud: "You're dead."

"Not quite," the man answered. "But we'd like to be."

"We've all agreed," the first woman chimed in, almost hopeful and relieved. "This is no existence."

I lolled my head back and stared up at the ceiling. My disbelieving gaze followed the white square patterns above. "You're vwaal"

"Where did you hear that word?" the old male voice snapped. "No matter.  You have to snap out of whatever's wrong with you, and end this. You have to kill us."

"No," I sobbed and laughed. "I'm alone. I'm alone. I can save you. Maybe -"

"Nobody's coming, are they?" the second female voice asked. "I've got my son here. There are children here, trapped with us. It was *bring your kid to work day.* If God exists, he's a bastard for this."

"Keep it together, Marjorie," the older male said. "We've got to get Heath to kill us, or who knows how many years we'll spend like this? The nuclear reactors could power this place for centuries."

"God, why? *Why?*"

"Heath -"

"Mom, is that the guy?"

"Heath!"

I clamped my eyes shut as they began shouting at me. "Tell me what's happening," I insisted, repeating my words until they stopped clamoring.

Finally, the first male voice spoke to me again. "Heath, where do you think you are?"

"I'm in a cubicle right now I can't get out of the building and the whole place is underground"

"I see. Is there a server room?"

"Yes, I work there."

"Good. You need to go there and look around. I believe it will be behind your desk, on the wall. Please, hurry. There is nothing more maddening and painful than being awake, aware, and helpless every single second of every single day."

I lowered the phone back into place, my eyes functioning, but my gaze unseeing. Blankly, I got up and walked back to the server room. I moved through the server stacks, enjoying the breezes from their fans on my skin. I approached my desk, but did not sit. Instead, I looked at the wall.

It was right there - it had been there the whole time. I'd been aware of the poster on my wall, but never looked at it, never comprehended it. It had just been there. There were a dozen other posters in a dozen other cubicles and break rooms I had never looked at, either.

*READING THIS?* it asked.

*If you're reading this poster, then something has gone terribly wrong. Undoubtedly, you feel trapped, scared, and/or confused. It's important that you calm down and understand your situation.*

*First: provisions have been made for this situation. You are not trapped here.*

*Second: you are not being held against your will.*

*Third: you are not dead.*

*Proceed inside.*

I felt weak as I read it, and nearly fell; I caught myself with a hand to the wall. The smooth white paneling felt cool to the touch. How many new sensations had I felt since the author had made me aware of my body? So strange, that I'd been oblivious to so much

including a door, apparently.

There was a door in the wall that I'd never bothered to think about.

Right next to the poster sat a nondescript white door.

Pushing through, I found myself in a vast rectangular space designed to look much like a server room - except this one was white - startlingly white, bright, and clean. Large white cubes sat at regular intervals. Each had a monitor set into the side, and I moved from one to the next, watching individuals I began to recognize as coworkers as they moved around blank white rooms much like the one I was moving through.

As I passed one, a haggard-looking man with a foot-long peppered beard leapt up to the feed. His voice came in quietly over the speaker. "Heath?"

I faced the monitor. "You can see me?"

"We've been screaming to try to get your attention for months," he breathed, clutching the camera with an overjoyed grin. "Or, at least, that's why we started"

"What *is* this?" I asked.

"You don't know?" he asked, narrowing his eyes. "How much do you remember?"

"Bits and pieces," I said, shaking my head. "I feel scrambled. I've been spending most of my time here alone, coordinating local defenses against the Crushing Fist."

He stared at me for a moment, and, then, his eyes softened. "I suppose that's an appropriate name for it." He looked to his right. "Heath, we need you to turn us off."

"Why can't I just save you?" I asked, frustrated to the point of near-crying.

"You always want to help. If all else fails, you still keep going. That's why I knew we could count on you. That's also why it'll be hard to accept this: we died, buddy. We died over a year ago." He gave a long sigh. "We didn't have much time when the shit hit the fan here, so we tried to upload our consciousnesses to the system. I mean, it worked but without bodies, without admin rights, and with nobody coming back to save us, we just managed to create our own private hell."

I frowned, full of heat and anger and frustration and confusion and anguish. "But the poster says I'm not dead"

"You're not," he laughed. "By *we* I meant *us.* The forty-eight of us that worked here. We're just computer simulations, now. You're not like us."

I almost didn't want to accept the faint sliver of hope growing inside me. "I'm still alive?"

"Of course, buddy. I sealed you off so you'd be safe. Last thing I ever did if I'm really me, that is."

I took a deep breath and stilled my heart. "What do I do?"

"There's a switch at the back of the room. I can almost see it from here. Maddening, right? Just turn it off. The blue one. That'll kill the processing power for all of us. We're probably eating up most of the system resources. Then the green and red switches are for you." He smiled sadly. "If you want out."

I walked past them in a surreal fog, watching each of my former coworkers rage, cry, and rock back and forth in their blank prisons. Had they been here, screaming, the whole time? Of course they had and I'd been oblivious for some reason

I looked back.

They each watched me from their monitors, praying, laughing, and cheering. I remembered each one, only now, as if their faces had emerged from haze.

I flicked the blue switch.

The monitors went dark one by one, and the room first got louder as exuberant shouts filled the air, and then quieter, as those voices went dark.

In a few moments, I was alone.

What he'd said had been right: they'd been using a tremendous amount of processing power. As soon as the last monitor faded to black, a rush of energy and awareness hit me. I could suddenly remember *everything.* The fog was gone. The haze had lifted. My brain felt sharp and aware for the first time in months.

And I suddenly knew, for a fact, that I was not an artificial intelligence, and I was not dead.

I was alive!

This, and a thousand other things, I suddenly knew.

I faced the green switch and the red switch, and regarded the two posters above them.

---

I slipped the helmet off and blinked with my real eyes for the first time in over a year. My arms cracked and snapped as I moved them under my own willpower. I could see electro-stimulators that had exercised my muscles during my long sleep, and I carefully pulled IV tubes out from my forearms before removing the stimulator patches.

Climbing up from the chair, I immediately fell to cold, smooth marble, and I remained there for a time, enjoying real breathing and real sensations.

The underground office building had been a simulated environment. I knew that now. Human brains weren't designed for direct access to the network, and the false environment had served as an interface. The building had been locked down, not to trap me, but because nobody had designed anything beyond it.

I was still in the white room - the real version this time, behind the sealed door the eldest boy could not possibly have opened when the children had come here. If only he'd gone one room further, he would have found me asleep, my mind adrift in the network but he couldn't have gone further, because my work buddy had sealed me in to protect me.

And I'd have been fine, even then, if the forty-eight other minds hadn't used up so many resources that I'd forgotten myself.

Staggering onto uncertain footing, I moved along the walls, clutching my way toward the exit. It opened at my touch, and I found myself in the server room again - the real one, this time.

I could even see the messages I'd received and written open on the monitor. My experiences had been real, they'd just been virtual.

Clambering through the rainbow-lit darkness of the racks themselves, I reached the odd heavy metal door to the server room. I knew what it was now that my mind was my own: it used a special array of static generators to keep dust out of the room. That was it. It wasn't a portal, or an elevator, or anything else I'd theorized.

I took a moment of silence as I found the bodies in the hallways.

I'd been under when it'd happened, so I didn't know what threat had killed them all, but I'd seen my only friend's swarm of children storm through here a few days before, so I knew the threat must have departed by now.

Stumbling to the nearest break room, I raided a fridge. Our food at this facility was designed to last, and last it had. I broke some into frozen chunks and stuffed it in my mouth, relishing the burn, and then I left some out to thaw.

After a few minutes spent gathering strength, I made a journey to the windows.

Outside, across the parking lot, lay a bombed-out building I recognized. The cars in the lot had been trashed and devastated in various ways, and I saw a few bodies lying on the pavement. Is this what the children would have seen, had they ventured near a window? Oh, the comedy of errors that had kept the truth from me for so long

I returned to my desk in the server room after a time. My world was gone. Everyone I'd known was dead but all I felt was relief. These things were still foggy to me, after so long absent from my mind, and I was just happy to be free and alive.

I found it sublimely hilarious, and I couldn't quite describe why: even in the midst of terror and imprisonment, I'd sat at a virtual recreation of this desk, and helped people. Now, with the ability to go anywhere - and no living world to actually go to - I was still going to sit here, survive on company food, and do my job.

Because I wanted to help. I felt like I was part of something.

There were people that needed me not because I was some hero. Far from it. I just happened to be a guy on a computer, in the know, at a time when knowledge was everything.

Sighing and shaking my head with a smile, I returned to my messages.

"I got out," I wrote to my author contact - no, my author friend. "I'm out!"

*What are you talking about?* he asked.

"I was connected to the system in an immersive virtual reality chair, complete with intravenous nutrition and electro-stimulators. Someone put thought into serious long-term uses for that chair."

*Heath, I don't understand.*

"Wait, how do you know my name?" I wrote, confused. "I never told you. I only just remembered."

*You said you found out what happened to you, and you sounded like you were having a complete breakdown. You said you were dying from a terminal illness, and wanted to help people, so you volunteered. You said the posters told you that you were surgically removed from your body and kept alive as a brain in a medical vat, to serve as the most capable, loyal, and unhackable network processing center possible. You said they left you two switches: one red, to kill you, and free you, once you wanted out and one green, to erase your personal memories so that you could keep working without the pain of knowing your situation.*

My stomach twisted up in a knot. "I said that? God, is that true? Am I just a brain in a vat somewhere in the building?" A horrific sense of terror began swelling up through me. "Did I really say that?!" I checked through my logs for the past hour, but they'd been deleted because of the AI shutdowns? I couldn't be sure I couldn't be sure! Was I just like those men, women, and children I'd just freed? If the green switch removed my personal memories, and left my skills intact God, how many times had this happened? How many times had I used the green switch because I

because I'd wanted to help out

He didn't respond for several minutes, probably watching me panic. At long last, he wrote: *Oh, no. I'm just messing with you. I'm a horror author, remember? I think up the worst possible scenarios all the time.*

The panic drained out of me, replaced by a burgeoning sense of relief and purpose. "Lord, not funny. That is not funny at all."

*Sorry. I guess I couldn't resist such a good prank.*

Remembering that I had a headset here in the real world that could dictate my spoken words and allow me to interact from anywhere in the building, I donned it and spoke into it. "You got me good. I was freaking out for a moment, there."

*Yep, got you good.*

He paused, and I waited, expectant. Damn good joke...

*Quite a few strange happenings in my hometown the past few days,* he finally wrote. *I could use some assistance.*

I smiled at my monitor. "Absolutely. How can I help?"

	<TEXT> You could say I've always been a bit of a miser. The thing is, it's not money that I pinch. It's time.

Ever since I was a boy, I've made it a priority to spend my time as efficiently as possible. Build a sandcastle for five minutes. Play two rounds of tag in ten minutes. Rest, three minutes. Fun complete, time for chores.

Needless to say, the other kids found me rather odd but I didn't let that stop me.

Once I was a little older, I got a job as soon as I could, and poured all my time into working. With the inherent ethic that I had, it was easy to impress my managers. Even at my young age, I was surely in line for a promotion.

Except I worked, day in and day out, and the first promotion came and went. They gave it to some new guy who laughed a lot, talked loudly and inappropriately, and went out for drinks with them often.

No big deal, I thought. It was an obvious case of favoritism. Makes sense. I'll wait for the next.

Of course, as we all know, the depression hit, and promotions stopped being a thing. I took a second job at a deli to increase my chances of getting somewhere, and began working eighty hour weeks, all with the extreme efficiency I'd always applied to everything in my life. I was slowly getting more and more tired, yes, but I often got impressed comments from my managers.

Years *years* went by, as we all know, and the economy never got better. Still, life had to go on eventually, and promotions began happening again as those higher up moved on in various ways.

I was passed over again, several times, at both jobs.

A cold bitterness began gnawing at the back of my tired eyes as I hustled and bustled each day.

I could blame someone, perhaps. I could be angry, or resentful, like my coworkers. Or, I could work even harder.

I began working overtime at both jobs, and sleeping less. To say I was dead tired would be an understatement - but nobody noticed, given my carefully calculated work habits and efficiency.

Then, it happened.

"Keep this up, and you're next in line for a promotion!" my manager said offhandedly on one chilly Friday evening.

I smiled and nodded and secretly burned with hope and rage. It was what I wanted, but how could I possibly keep this up? I could feel my body and mind falling apart as the exhaustion deepened in every fiber and nerve.

A customer overheard the exchange. "You look weary," the old woman said, coming up to the deli counter. I looked down at her. Hunched and wizened, she looked far too old to be wandering about on her own. She was dressed in a distinctive foreign style, but I couldn't quite pin down which one. She turned her milky blue eyes up at me and held out her hand. "Take this. Does me no good now. No children, and not long for this world. You seem like nice young man."

I took the object from her - a small green gem, maybe a half-inch across, cut with many facets. It glittered darkly in the store's light. I thought I saw a small pulsing object embedded within, but it might have just been a trick of the internal reflections.

"I can't take this," I told her, eyes wide. "It's against company policy."

"Not worth any money," she said. "You can take. It helps you."

"Helps me?"

The skin around her mouth was the color and consistency of aged parchment, and I stared as it moved. Her lips curled up into a weak smile. "Tell it what you want, then make cut in your skin and put it inside."

I recoiled. "That's disgusting!"

She squeezed my hand around the gem, smiled one more time, and then hobbled off.

Desperation can do odd things to a man. It can take away his fear, and give him a false bravery.

I stared at the gem for the next few days, mesmerized by its emerald inner glow and by the possibility of her claims. I washed it with rubbing alcohol once or twice, just to make sure it was clean. Had it been inside someone else before?

I put the gem away, intending to sell it, until a comment from my *other* boss set me off.

"Keep up these hours, and you'll go places!"

He'd meant it in good faith, but I could only nod, my heart burning. How could I *possibly* keep up extreme hours at *both* jobs?

I went home in an exhausted rage, and got a knife. I chose a spot on the inside of my arm, in the meat just past the elbow, and made an incision. I thrust the gem inside, shivered at the odd feeling, and then stitched it all up.

I passed out in bed, my arm leaking spots of red along my sheets.

Of course, I felt like an idiot when I finally woke up. Not only had I cut a hole in my arm and put a strange object inside, I'd forgotten to set an alarm, and I was three hours late for my shift! 

I dressed and hurried over only to stop dead in my tracks outside the store.

Through the window, I saw someone already there, handling my tasks. It was *me* another me!

I stared down at my arm, where dark emerald veins pulsed around the gem I'd made part of me.

Had I just gotten so tired that I'd lost my mind? Or was I really seeing another me, working in my place? What did that mean for me? Where would the other me sleep? Where would he live? Was he aware that he was a duplicate? I could work both jobs now but share the expenses? Pay for food for two people?

The gem had been trying to help, as the old woman had said, but that good will was misguided in the face of cold, hard economics.

My heart raced the entire day as I waited. I knew what I had to do, and I knew how to do it. I'd seen enough movies - duplications like this always ended in murder. Perhaps I was jumping the gun by going immediately for violence, but I only had one chance. As soon as he realized I existed, he would be on guard for this, because he was me, and he would know my thoughts.

I waited in the shower, behind the curtain. I knew myself, so I knew he would come in and nervously eye the closed curtain as he always did. I never *really* thought someone was behind it, but god, what if there was? I always slid it open before I brushed my teeth, just to make sure.

This time, he finally found something.

I leapt forward with the hammer as he pulled back the curtain, and his forehead crumpled in around the metal head. He fell to the floor, twitching, and staring up at me in confusion but a few more squelching blows put a stop to that.

I dragged his body to the loose floorboards under my kitchen area, and hid him in the four-foot high crawlspace I'd found underneath. A few chemicals I'd learned of on the Internet would take care of the smell and that was that.

Except for the bloodstain on the bathroom floor, and the splatter on the curtain - which I threw out - there was no evidence my duplicate had ever existed. I scrubbed away at the stain, took a shower, and then passed out, relieved.

I awoke before my alarm, at 6:59 just in time to see another me appear in the other half of the bed. He didn't stand a chance. I grabbed the hammer from the nightstand and slammed it into him repeatedly before he even had a moment to comprehend what was happening. "No, wait -!"

He never got to finish his sentence. His body joined the first under the floor.

I worked my two shifts that day, and then went home, realizing that I had a bigger problem on my hands. I tried to pry the emerald out of my arm, but the strange veins had hardened into my skin, and I couldn't even cut the thing out without taking off my whole arm.

Just as I'd expected, at seven in the morning, a third me appeared.

This was, apparently, going to happen every single morning for the rest of my life I'd wanted to be in two places at once, and do more than humanly possible, and the throbbing gem in my arm had given me that capability.

I just had to think outside the box.

It took a while to come around to what I knew I would have to do. For several months, I murdered myself each morning, and then went to work, a little more haunted and tired. The screams got me every time. They were *my* screams and how did I know I wouldn't be the one waking up with a hammer to the head the next morning? I tried not to think about it even as I created more efficient means of instant death for my duplicates.

A few months after *that*, I ran out of willpower. I quit my jobs. At first, it was because I had a sub-basement full to the brim with corpse versions of me, enough that they couldn't fit under the floorboards anymore.

Then, it was because I was selling the duplicate set of clothes that came with them each day, and living off that money. I invested in a nice suit, went to sleep in it, woke up, murdered myself very carefully, and then sold the new suit to someone else.

When my buyers started asking questions, I had to go legitimate, and open a business. Only, I didn't sell suits. I didn't have enough inventory for that. I could only produce one set of clothes a day, and that would never be enough

So, I innovated.

I'd already worked at a deli, so I used that experience. Now I run the most popular butcher shop on the west side. You should come by and check us out some time. We're having a sale. The best cuts are half off and the meat is sourced entirely locally.

[Part 5](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2s0icg/judging_by_the_message_i_found_someone_somewhere/)

I scanned quickly through my messages. I had more than I could handle. Apparently, a great many people out there were facing dangers beyond mundane comprehension and a great many people simply had active imaginations. It was my task to pick out the ones I thought were true and serious, and try to help.
 
First up for the evening was a guy near the outer shell.
 
*Hey man, I read your stories, and I had a question for you. I found a pen knife out in the woods, stuck in the side of a cliff. I pulled it out, and I think it can cut through anything. Have you ever heard of anything like this? Im really scared to tell anyone I have it, cause its so weird. I heard something out in the woods, too I think somebody might be looking for it.*
 
I considered his question, but a search brought up nothing. He didnt seem to be in immediate danger, and I had no way of knowing the strange object was real, so I moved on after noting the location and reality from which the message originated.
 
*nice story, man. You must be on some pretty good stuff. Remember that one story about red pills that turned you into a vampire or something? That was my favorite*
 
Alright I did remember that story. Was this a hint at something? Or just a random message? I decided to move on again.
 
*I really dont like what Ive read here,* the message said. *I have a feeling Im about to get sucked back in no matter how hard I resist.*
 
I immediately knew this person was something special. I wrote back: Into what?
 
*Ive been running into these things my whole life.*
 
I checked - whoever it was, they were on one of the rare intact worlds on the outer shell itself.
 
*I dont know if I make things happen, or just sense them, but I can literally seek them out and find them. The fear runs like threads through my awareness.*
 
That sounded like a very useful ability. Researching more, his world seemed more or less functional socially. Somehow or another, hed avoided the fate that had befallen so many of the other outer shell worlds. Did his experiences have something to do with that? I asked: Can you tell me more?
 
He simply linked me to [stories hed already written about his experiences.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/147wn3/the_house_beyond_the_edge/)
  
I scanned through them, intrigued. I'd seen them before, but it was strange to read them with a new understanding that they'd actually happened. So youre really a horror writer?
 
*Youve already read my stories?* he responded. *But, yes. It was only natural, given the background I have to work with. I try to stay aware of whats going on, and something is very wrong with the world.*

"Yes, more than you know," I told him, sending him a map of the situation and all the information at my disposal. I was sure it would be some time before he digested it all and responded.

As I began to move to the next message, an alert popped up, notifying me that the proximity systems had detected someone entering the building.

Suddenly torn from my coordination efforts, I raced through all the files and feeds at my disposal. Who was in the building? How had they gotten here? I found a security camera, and saw a dozen humanoid forms moving through darkness.

As they moved under a red EXIT sign, I saw them more clearly.

They were the children I'd seen, briefly, on my friend's headset camera.

They were the ones she'd had to leave behind.

What were they doing here? Were they here to exact revenge for my role in her disappearance? They were armed

No, that didn't seem right. They were a bunch of kids, and a few teenagers. The oldest boy led at the front, a baseball bat in hand. It occurred to me that they wouldn't know anything about her disappearance. To them, she'd just never come back.

But how had they found *me?* I thought it over the dead sentient flame, speaking through the book, had said that one of *those people* was nearby, and then my friend had said the people we'd found trapped on the plant-God planet were beings of light disguised as humans. They'd sensed my activities on the computer. If she had one of them as an ally, had that ally followed my interactions with her to here?

That must have been it. Whoever it was, my signals to her had been a beacon, and they were coming to look for their protector.

The eldest boy began hitting something that had been lying in the hall, and I stared at the security camera stream.

My head hurt briefly, and my vision flickered. How long had I been working? I felt floaty and exhausted.

If they were here, that meant they'd come through a portal. Was it still open? Of course it was! They wouldn't be coming in unless they had a way out excited at the prospect of rescue, I activated the building's speakers. "Hello?"

As one, the group of kids jumped.

"Is that you?" the eldest asked, looking up and around 'til he noticed the security camera. "Where is she?"

"She's gone," I replied sadly. "She didn't have much choice. There was a reality-fracturing bomb being sent out through a portal machine, and she had to stop it."

He sighed. "That sounds like her."

A few of the children lowered their heads, and one began crying.

"Oh, oh no!" I said hurriedly. "She's not *dead.* She just went through another portal."

"What? Where is she?!"

"She said where she was going was home," I told them. "That's all I know."

The oldest boy looked around at his armed companions. "I don't like this. Go get the book."

"What about the portal?" one asked.

"It'll survive one or two transitions. This is important."

Two kids ran back, and the oldest boy looked up at the camera again. "What happened here?"

"I don't know," I told him. "I've been trapped here for weeks now. I'm in the server room right now. That's usually where I hole up."

"Tell us how to get there."

I gave them directions, and they moved through the halls, occasionally bashing dark objects strewn about the floor. I zoomed in on a few of the piles, trying to comprehend their shapes, but the feed was too fuzzy and the building too dark. Their flashlights arced around, making contrast higher and vision difficult.

"Is there still any danger?" one kid asked, looking up at another camera.

"Only outside," I replied. "Don't break the windows. There are slimy weird things out there. Don't get too close, and don't let them see you."

The kids looked around warily, but there were no windows near them. They proceeded down dark, cramped hallways, leaving marks on the walls to record their way, and heading toward my location.

"That's it!" I practically shouted, seeing them come up to the heavy server room door. They studied the same odd metal frame that I had studied some weeks before.

"You sure this is safe?"

"Yeah, I go in and out all the time."

The eldest pushed it open with his foot and then proceeded into rainbow-lit gloom and heat. I saw him enter through my security camera feed, but he must have been moving quietly out of caution. Where was he in the room?

"I'm inside," I heard him shout, through the camera feed. "I don't see you."

"I'm right here," I replied, looking around. "Where are you?"

"Dude. There's nobody in here. What are you doing?"

"I'm *right here!*" I said again, moving to the server room door. "I -"

Nobody stood outside. The hallway was the same, but the kids weren't there.

I couldn't see the security camera feed from here, but I guessed what it might show.

Dejected, I returned to the computer. "It must be the wrong reality I was worried that would be the case. I'm trapped somewhere that's a copy of there."

"That sucks. Hold on." I watched as he re-entered the hallway to meet two returning kids. In their hands was an extremely convoluted device that had an enormous number of metallic moving blades, gears, and pipes.

I zoomed in, curious.

The eldest boy took it from them, holding it by two pipes, his fingers narrowly avoiding the gears and blades. He manipulated pieces of it, his eyes blank. "Tell me about the man in the server room." After a minute or two, he lifted his head, his breathing ragged with fear. "We have to leave *right now.*"

"Wait, what?" I asked.

The kids ignored me and bolted back through the halls, following their marks and jumping over the dark misshapen piles on the floor. Terrified that I'd lose my only hope of rescue, I closed an automatic security door in their path. "Come on! What's going on?"

Instead of answering, most just started screaming. They began to run, too, but they were stopped by a thrust-out arm.

The eldest glared up at me. "Let us go."

"Tell me what's happening! I'm stuck here, *please.* What did that weird metal thing tell you?"

"Weird metal thing?" He looked down at the device in his hands. "The book?"

Confused, I echoed him. "What book?"

He looked back up at me. "You *see* this thing the way it really is?"

"What does *that* mean?"

"I saw this thing the way it really was, and apparently, I started bleeding out the eyes. I don't remember, because I went into seizures. So how can you look at it and see it for real?"

I opened the door, not really intent on scaring or holding the kids. "I don't know"

They ran further down the hallway, and then turned into a side room where my cameras could not see.

The eldest remained for a moment longer. "Man, you gotta wake up. Somethin's wrong with you. I appreciate what you did with all the help, but I think you gotta help *yourself* now."

Confused and terrified, I watched him go.

I sat for a time, processing. It was true what he'd said: a great many things about my situation didn't make sense. I'd always felt a certain logic to my imprisonment, hovering somewhere outside the grasp of my facts at hand, but I'd always had an aversion to thinking too deeply about it. What if I found out something horrible? What if I lost all hope?

While I considered these questions, I looked at the next message I had.

It was from a man who had a problem with something dark lurking in his neighborhood something the people there had been wary of for a very long time. Just like everyone else, his problems had been growing worse over the last year, and now he needed to get inside the dark heart of the place. The strange thing was, [the threat had already been there for quite some time.](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2sohn9/it_watched_us_play_update_part_3/) He, too, was on an outer shell world most of my most concerning messages were from out there.

He was also on the same world as the person who had sent the pen knife message odd.

"So you can't get inside?" I wrote. "I happen to have gotten a message from a guy about three hours' drive from you. He stumbled across a pen knife that seems to be able to cut through things it shouldn't."

*A pen knife?* he asked.

"I can't verify it myself. You'll have to go in person. Here's the address."

He took it with cautious thanks.

I went through a few more, and then stopped, feeling a sense of despair overtake my need to help out.

It was surprising how hard it was to do any work when only one thought dominated my mind: where was I?

I had eyes and ears everywhere, but I couldn't *get* anywhere at all.

If I was in a very special pocket reality, one that was important for the running of the vast network, then I was in serious trouble.

For a time, I wandered around my building, studying the details. People still screamed when I picked up the phone, and the electricity still worked, and there was still food in the fridge to last a while I stood at the window and gazed out, risking notice to try to study the slimy creatures out in the fog. As I watched, I saw one go by with a bear carcass in its grip.

I froze.

One bear carcass had been noteworthy but two?

Seized by a sudden suspicion, I ran to a nearby cubicle, grabbed a metal chair, and smashed it hard against the window over and over again. A crack formed, and then spread, urged along by my violent bashings.

Finally, the entire glass pane went opaque. The next hit shattered it.

I stared beyond - at a rock wall.

I was underground.

It was all fake.

I was just like that lonely soul whose first message I'd found. I was underground, and there was no way out.

Running around the office building, which I now knew to be deep under the earth, I smashed random things into pieces. My efforts were cathartic, in a way. I'd tried to keep everything normal and untouched, in some subconscious effort to continue a feeling of normalcy, but now I knew that nobody was ever coming back here.

I'd been abandoned.

*I'd been left behind, just like the men and women on the walls.*

I was alone, just like all those poor people messaging me about the terrors working their way deeper into the realms of man.

Anger faded into frantic terror, and I began searching for the way I'd gotten in here in the first place. An elevator? Perhaps the odd server room door was part of a non-obvious lift mechanism. I found nothing, but the idea remained. Was there an elevator somewhere in this place?

What did I remember about showing up for work, before I got trapped here?

I slept during the day, so my trip into work was always a groggy blur and I hadn't seen the sun in longer than I could remember except for that one shining day of training.

How had I entered the building on that day?

Nope. The front doors were fake, too. I broke them, then climbed out and slumped against the cool rock wall, wracking my brain.

I'd *seen the purple glow of a portal opening* outside the windows when I'd activated that massive facility's portal machine. What had that been? My goddamn imagination? There had to be *some* link with the surface office building duplicate that the kids had just been in.

I returned to the spot where I'd witnessed the foggy purple glow. The windows there remained intact. Lifting a chair, and fearing what I would find, I broke the glass.

Beyond I saw a tunnel!

Stepping out over the glass, I rushed down it and found a wide circular scorched section of cave wall, where the portal had appeared. At least, that's what I imagined it to be which meant that I'd stayed inside the glass out of pointless fear. I'd missed my one shot at escape.

Above all else, that discovery broke me.

I returned to the server room in a daze.

"I'm going to die down here," I said aloud, to nobody in particular.

And I knew it to be true unless

I began to respond to my messages with a new energy. I wasn't done, not at all! Someone out there had to have an ability, a device, or knowledge that might get me out. After all, if I'd almost escaped once before, I could do it again - and, this time, I knew a little bit more about my situation.

And there were people in need, too. All over the place, creatures were roaming the woods, entities were stalking people, loved ones were exhibiting odd behavior, neighbors were disappearing, and bad luck was rampant. It overwhelmed me, at first, seeing the sheer range and volume of problems, but it hit me: I had the information, I had the communication, and that meant none of us were alone.

I started responding to every single message, giving people what info I could find, and putting them in contact with those around them who had also clued in.

Then, the author I'd been talking to responded once more. He finally sent back: *This is a very grim situation. What do we do?*

"First, I'd like to get out of here," I wrote him. "I'm trapped." I explained my situation as thoroughly as I could.

*Those are some very odd happenings,* he wrote back. *I'm not sure you have all the pieces of the puzzle yet, as they don't quite fit together in a way that makes sense. Although, I know for sure how you can get out of there.*

"What? How?!"

*No matter how bad things are, you can always make them worse. What you need is a sudden serious problem. Then, while thinking quickly and trying to survive, you'll have a chance to turn that problem into an opportunity. In your case, an opportunity to escape.*

"That doesn't seem logical. How would making my situation worse help me get out of here?"

*We live in strange times. Existence follows certain trends. In a sense, there's a grim fairness about it. If you do nothing, you die. If you risk it all, you've at least got a shot. That's a rule.*

"And if the shot doesn't work out?"

*Then you die anyway. But isn't a slim chance better than none at all?*

He was right.

And, in fact, I had dozens of Internets at my disposal. I could find the right threat, tailored to my situation, and try to use that threat to escape. Were there any creatures that used portals to move around? Were there any dark entities I could make a deal with? I began my search of the stories online. It quickly became apparent that those with specific intents usually sought out a certain type of ritual.

What I needed was a Game and someone with the power to make it real.

"Do you know of any Games that might help me?" I asked my author contact.

*Hmm I've never really gotten into Game stories, but here's how I imagine an actual real one might work*

I memorized everything he told me, and I began searching the office building for the proper supplies. It was a shot in the dark, and incredibly risky but, as he'd said, it was better than doing nothing and dying here alone.

If a soul was a thing; or, at least, if a mind was a thing, then there had to be more to existence than the physical spatial dimensions we saw. What *was* a mind? Why were humans self-aware, and animals not? I'd read stories of a creature that could cut away and eat a person's self-awareness, turning them into walking biological machines that talked, ate, laughed, and watched movies but with nobody inside, not for real. If that existed, then a mind must be a real thing.

And if minds were real things, there was a dimension or plane where they existed. They were *something, somewhere.*

And if they were something, somewhere then there might be other things there, too.

I sat in a dark, quiet corner of the building, a single candle lit in front of me, and a pad of paper and a pen on hand. These were not necessary for the Game, but they might help me focus, and then remember. I'd been instructed not to bother with mirrors, or pentagrams, or blood, or any other human physical or mental fear. *Human* concerns didn't matter for something like this

Sitting in place, senses dark, I thought a single word: *aware.*

I thought it again, repeatedly: *aware, aware, aware, aware*

I made the thought louder. *AWARE, AWARE, AWARE*

I began shouting it in my mind. **AWARE. AWARE. AWARE.**

I kept screaming the same word in my mind, *from* my mind, over and over. Fear of actually attracting attention held me back, but fear of dying here pushed me past an intrinsic barrier.

For each repetition, I envisioned the words as louder than the chant before them, the volume ever-increasing, until I was sure I was shouting throughout an entire mental universe.

I kept this up even as a feeling of impending doom swept over me. Again, I might have stopped but survival instinct kept me going.

Then, eight minutes and seven seconds after I'd begun, it happened.

I opened my eyes and looked out.

A shadowed face flickered beyond the candle's flame, shifting shade dancing across darker darkness. It wasn't really here, and I wasn't really looking. I understood that but I still felt a chill seize me.

It smiled hungrily, its teeth a row of jagged voids barring infinite blackness. *Congratulations, you've attracted attention.*

I had nothing to offer it, and nothing to keep me safe. As the author had told me, human rituals were probably useless in the face of entities that existed beyond the physical realms. I knew there were other realities that I could travel to, if I had the means, but *this thing* was from somewhere else entirely. But, as my contact had also informed me, all things followed logic in at least some sense. My only hope was that some part of its value system overlapped with ours.

"Wait," I thought aloud. "It's important that I talk to you."

*It always is,* it whispered back, its empty eyes icy. *None of you ever* **want** *to be consumed. How short-sighted of you.*

I didn't ask what it meant by that, and I didn't want to know. "Are you aware of what's happening? Are you aware of the Crushing Fist?"

It hissed softly, but did not kill me or consume me or anything else. It waited. I assumed that meant it was at least open to my proposal, and that the Crushing Fist meant something to it.

"I want to work with you, or make some sort of deal with you. I need to get out of here. I need to be able to help others of my kind more directly, or we're all in trouble."

Something behind it moved, and I realized the vague humanoid shape before my awareness was a front. The real entity behind it lay shrouded in darkness, both massive and elegant at the same time. I dared not look directly for fear of offending it.

*You have no idea what you're up against,* it finally replied. *But I envy your ignorance. You scramble ever forward, like bugs in mud, like* **fivhen** *in* **squuar**. *You don't even stop when you're already doomed, dead, or* **vwaal**. *That obstinance is, likely, the only organic trait worthy of mention.*

"So you'll help me?" I asked, confused.

It grinned again, its mock shadowed face stretching horribly. *Didn't you hear me? You're already* **vwaal**. *You cannot* **be** *helped. You should do yourself a favor and allow me to consume you. I am experiencing pity for your pathetic situation, so I will allow you the choice, rather than force it upon you.*

"Um no thank you."

*So be it.*

A non-light flared behind its massive shadow-form, and I prepared to scream as I caught a glimpse of what it really looked like. The shape, the size, the complexity - it was absolutely -

I fell backwards as if struck, suddenly ejected from the realms of the mind, and I hurried to write down what had been said before it faded like shreds of a dream on waking fog.

Then, I tried to draw it.

What had I I'd seen it, but the image was gone

Sitting on the floor, I let myself wallow in despair for a while. Even shadow entities from the realms of the mind couldn't help me unless I'd fallen asleep, and dreamed the whole thing.

Despondent, I returned to my computer, and began half-heartedly responding to calls for help again.

I'm intent on helping as many as I can before I starve to death down here but who is going to help *me?*

After what seemed like endless hours mapping connections between systems, I'd finally done it.

I'd figured out where I was.

I'd also discovered something very strange about the sphere of protected realities we were in: there was another smaller sphere in the center that I couldn't contact or connect to. I'd worked through the night verifying it, but I didn't feel tired at all. I was too excited to share the news with my strange colleague, and possibly get rescued from my inescapable office.

"There's a central reality," I told her, the moment she logged on to our chat server. "It's walled off by another shell of realities around it."

"I know," she said quietly. "And the metal square I found is a sort of message."

"What's it say?"

"Nothing - not in words, anyway. It acts like a compass. My -" She paused. "It's pointed inward, toward the inner worlds. I can use it as a guide, to move in that direction."

I would have leapt for joy, if I'd been able. "That's where I'm stuck! I'm somewhere along the inner shell."

She remained quiet for several moments. "That makes sense. You'd almost have to be, if you're somewhere with such widespread access."

"Maybe Command is in there?" I suggested. "Or *someone* who knows what's going on."

This time, she said nothing at all, instead signing off the chat server.

This time, she turned on her headset before traveling. A vast oval rift in space sat open before her, and she regarded the other side. "This look like your place?"

Beyond sat concrete hallways marked with numerous colored lines and information. The light from her sun illuminated what would have otherwise been gloomy darkness.

"No. But it does look military or something. Maybe that's Command, wherever that is."

She stepped through into constantly shifting gloom. The hallway split into a T-junction around her, and each concrete ceiling corner contained a spinning red emergency light. Not all of them were functioning, but enough were operational to paint the corridors flashing crimson. I heard no sound but her quickening breathing - if there had been a noise accompanying these emergency alarms, it might have burned out long ago.

She looked left, forward, and right, studying the lines on the walls. The colors were hard to see cast in red, so she lifted a flashlight. One line was green, one was white, and one was yellow. Each led in different directions. "Any guesses?"

"White?" I ventured.

She shrugged and began moving along the heavy squat corridor to her right, covering her face as she passed under a spinning red light.

"Something wrong with the lights?" I asked her.

"No," she replied. "It's just not a good idea to look directly at unfamiliar red lights."

Odd. I wondered why, but she was trying to be as quiet as possible as she moved deeper into the structure.

Her flashlight fell on equipment ahead - crates containing guns, mechanical parts, and badly rotted food. "Seems like it's been a while," she said, kneeling over a box of food. Rotating crimson and darkness gave the mass the illusion of writhing, and I wished she would look away.

She examined it as best she could without touching a thing. "Can't guess how long this stuff has been here." Moving on, she skirted around several more piles of gear that nearly blocked the hallway.

Passing a droning hum in the wall, she peered down the dark flashing corridor. Beside her, a single yellow light cycled gently off and on, casting a low glow along the floor. "Air's still working. This might be underground. The smell is horrendous, stale."

I hadn't even thought of that sense. Upon hearing her mention it, I started smelling the various aspects of the server room I must have gotten used to - the various trace acridities of computer equipment, plastics, and electricity. I imagined the cramped corridor around her, filled with rot and musty air, was far worse.

The visual stream shuddered briefly as she kept moving. "What's that?" I asked.

"Something's vibrating the floor" she whispered. "Something very large. Feels mechanical." Slipping down a hallway where all the emergency lights had broken, she kept her flashlight poised ahead. Set at the end of the corridor was a monstrously thick metal door that had frozen in place with about a foot of space underneath it. She kneeled down and sighed. "Not a fan of this, not at all"

Very carefully, she flattened herself and began sliding underneath it, her headset scraping along the concrete floor. Moving between two planes of grey - one rough, one shiny - she inched herself forward.

How thick *was* that door? It looked nearly ten feet across. What could possibly -

She made it through to the other side and looked up.

An arcing dome of grid-patterned metal rose high up above her, lit in vast violet by dim emergency spotlights. It was so tremendous a space that I thought at first that she'd come outside, and that the dome was glass over some sort of miles-wide hangar but, no, it was metal and concrete, probably holding back tons of arched rock.

She stood slowly, and the camera caught a better view of the rest of the domed chamber.

Within lay a swirling sea of rotating movement that I first thought was a whirlpool; as I zoomed in and studied it, I realized that *it was mechanical.* First, I saw the enormous cranes towering over the edges, and then - dozens of chrome rings, miles in diameter at the greatest, surrounding a stationary circular platform. Each ring rotated at a separate height and pace, descending with each step, but the platform in the middle remained high and unmoving. Atop it sat a wickedly intricate object made of chrome and black, with a shape approximating a dodecahedron. It rested in a small framework metal lattice that kept it suspended a foot above the rest of the platform, and the platform itself sat on a high narrow pillar of steel that grew straight up from the deep and unseen center of the metal vortex below.

"I don't like the look of that," she said aloud, mirroring my thoughts.

"Me either," I told her, and then noticed something. "Say how are we communicating?"

She looked back at the thick door and concrete. "Good catch. You don't sound fuzzy at all."

I sifted through my data stream, and found something exciting. "I'm *connected to the network there now.* My stream defaulted to the better connection. Maybe your portal is giving me connectivity, or our signal turned something on automatically I don't know but I can look at the computers."

"Do it," she ordered.

I officially logged in and began rooting around the new network that had opened up before me. First up was a map. "This place isn't too big, but it's complicated. It looks like all the routes - like the white line on the wall you followed - end up here eventually."

She nodded, keeping her gaze on the machine whirlpool. "What else?"

"I can see you," I said, surprised. "It's got you listed as a heat signature on the map."

"Any other signatures?"

I scrolled around a bit. "No"

"Alright. Any files that detail what happened here? A log, maybe?"

I worked through a bunch of personnel directories, but came up empty. "Everything's been deleted. I could try to recover some stuff, but it'll take time."

"Try to, if you can. We have to find out what happened here." She began walking along the edge of the violet-lit dome, circling the gigantic machinery within.

Eager to use my tech skills for something useful for a change, I began the recovery process while I looked through more of the network. I found the control interface for the cranes in the dome, but no information about what the mechanical vortex was *for.*

Maybe twenty minutes along the edge of the dome, she came across a factory-sized loading area at the termination of tremendous tunnels containing several rail lines.

I stared at everything as she studied the area. "What do you think all this *is?*"

"Run through the possibilities," she replied calmly. "What do you think it is?"

She sounded much like a teacher, and I responded that implicit authority automatically. "Well, it looks like there's infrastructure to move a great deal of freight and supplies in and out of this room and into the gigantic machine. The map of the place also has no entrances or exits, and no other structures this large. I think this might be"

She nodded. "Go ahead. No idea is too crazy, given what we're dealing with."

"I think it's how they do it - how they move things between realities," I suggested, amazed. Her calm certainty made me feel certain, too. The size of the operation - and the logistics of the rail tunnels and cranes - meant it had to be true. There was no way in or out except by portal. "But where'd they all go?"

She said nothing, instead turning to look at the wall of the tunnel, where large letters had been spray-painted. The splotchy red looked ugly brown under the violet light of the dome, but the words were clear:

*WHY BOTHER?*

A guilty spray-paint can sat discarded on the concrete beneath.

She stepped close and touched the paint, finding it long dried.

"Not exactly the kind of final message one would expect," I said, confused.

If she had any ideas, she kept them to herself. Her hand lingered on the wall for several moments longer. "Do you have anyone you care about?" she asked, without warning.

Taken aback, I could only tell the truth. The answer was embarrassing, but I didn't feel like I needed to lie to this woman, no matter how strange and impossible she was. "No."

She seemed in a rare open mood. "There's nobody in your life?"

"My hours don't really allow for much socializing," I told her, running through my own personal rationalizations. "I bet they chose me for this job because I was already a loner who stayed up all night. And, I figured, why not get paid to do it?"

"Then why do you want to escape?" she asked, beginning to walk again.

That was a strange question. "Well I don't wanna die."

"If there's nobody in your life, and you're a loner anyway, what's the difference between being trapped and being free? You were in that room all the time either way - the only thing that's changed is that you've become aware of your walls. You're safe in there. Why do you want to leave?"

A deep pang of worry and sadness curled up in me. "Why are you saying these things?"

"Strange things happen to people that don't have something to care about," she replied. "I didn't have a purpose for a long time, and I'm not proud of the person I was, or the things I did but I did find something to care about again. I have someone to take care of. I would do anything - *anything* - to keep him safe. Do you understand?"

The protective element in her voice made me guess that the subject in question was her son, if she had one but I wasn't quite sure what she was asking. "I just want to help."

She climbed across the long expanse of a flatbed railcar as she asked the million dollar question. "Why?"

I thought back on all my time spent browsing the Internet and working late nights at the office. That first day of training, bright and sunlit, still shined in my memory. I remembered what that poor freezing man on the mountain had said: *I've still got warm sun and bright beaches and memories of you in my head, but I'll never have those sensations again.* "Honestly?" I realized aloud. "It's because I'm lonely. This empty server room is my world. Nobody on the Internet knows who I am, or cares. It's more than that, though. The entire way people live now seems driven by outrage, and money, and being offended, and tribalism, and hating the other guy. Even if I was out there, and part of all that, it would still be empty for me. Life feels hollow somehow and I just want to be part of something *real.*"

"That's a very human feeling," she said quietly, approaching what looked like a control station. Jutting up from concrete, the metal kiosks held enough controls to rival pictures I'd seen of an airplane cockpit. Beside the kiosks sat an odd piece of circular metal with four jutting rods. She studied it for a moment, lifting the two-foot-wide object up with both hands, and then placed it back down. Looking over and out, she gazed at the center platform of the dome. "This looks like part of the metal surrounding that device."

I zoomed in on the dodecahedron on the central platform, and, indeed, it looked like there was a gap at the top for the curious sculpture, where it would fit in perfectly with the surrounding chrome latticework.

"Can you figure out what that device is?" she asked.

"One second." Moving through files, I found what looked like another control interface. This one wasn't integrated with the system, however. It was a separate series of programs with much more basic controls. My enthusiasm dropped as I realized what was sitting idly out there on that platform, and I instinctively resorted to dumb Internet humor. "Someone set us up the bomb"

"What?"

I sheepishly got a hold of myself. "Um, it's the bomb. The same kind that broke Jonathan's world."

"Who?"

"Oh, right. You'd already run off. Jonathan was - *is* - the guy whose eye camera I was looking through."

She froze as she realized what I was saying. "*That's a dimensional fracture bomb?*"

"Yes. Thats not what they call it, though, in the file. It doesn't look like it was supposed to do that."

"Obviously," she replied, backing away from the consoles around her. "Why's it sitting out there? Were they trying to send it somewhere?"

I read over the logs that had been left in the accompanying folders. "Looks like they sent one through before. It went to" The realization brought a slight bitterness within me. "The outer shell - Jonathan's world. That's all I can tell. It looks like they gave up, after seeing what happened, and this one was just loaded on the platform much later by automatic -" I froze.

The dome's lights shifted to bright white, and a hum buzzed in over the stream.

She looked back and forth wildly. "*What'd you do?*"

"Nothing!" I shouted back, frantic. "A ton of this stuff is automatic. I didn't even - I mean, I did, I accessed the interface, but - it's turning on!" I stared in horror as the central platform of the gigantic metal whirlpool began ever so slowly rotating.

I heard her voice rise to an uncommon tone of emergency. "Where's it pointed?"

"Where's what pointed?!" I asked, panicking. Was my meddling going to destroy someone's reality?

"The destination!" she shouted. "Where's it going?"

Of course! I stared at the process files. "It's pointed at the inner reality, the last place they went"

"Tell me how to turn it off," she ordered, her tone determined.

"I don't -" I already knew I couldn't turn off the automated process without the proper passwords, but I quickly did a few key word searches for *off* and *shut down* and *terminate* "That thing! That metal thing! The circle with the four rods! You have to put it in the top. That's the mechanical failsafe - it can't go off if that's in!"

Before I was even finished speaking, she picked it up with both hands and began running straight onto the first metal ring, which was picking up speed. In seconds, she was judging her jump to the next ring, which was moving at a different speed

It was eight tenths of a mile to the center, and the files said the whole process took four minutes. How much time had we wasted talking? I did some calculations, and with a sinking feeling, I realized: she would never make it.

Watching her leap from ring to ring, falling once or twice at each abrupt change in speed, a wave of despair passed over me. I hadn't been able to help *anyone* I'd read about or talked to, I'd screwed up and cost Jonathan an eye, and now *this?* I had the paralyzing sense I was about to watch this woman die and her son, or whoever it was she cared so deeply for, would be left on their own because of me.

Before I even knew what I was doing, the crane nearest her was moving. Two bars crossed high above the machinery, supporting the crane on its own mobile platform, and I sent it at top speed after her. The two perpendicular beams moved across open space on my map of the facility, chasing her heat signature.

I thought, as I got closer, that she might actually make it until the inner rings began descending. The entire system of rings shifted and dropped slowly, their vortex configuration deepening. She stumbled, fell, and bounced down three rings, before grunting in pain at the sudden shift in velocity on her new inner ring - this one only a few feet wide, with a rising curved wall of metal on one side and a steepening drop on the other.

From my perspective on the map, she was whirling around at incredible speed, and the camera in her headset was no help. Did the crane have a camera? It did. Turning it on and using that one, I slowly lowered the claw.

*Come on* how many videogames had I played during my existence? This was just like any other Flash game with a simple setup and devilishly difficult to master controls it just happened to have a life on the line, and possibly a reality.

She whipped past.

I waited.

She whipped past.

I waited.

She whipped past - and I lowered the claw.

Despite herself, she screamed once as she impacted the metal on the next go around. Still, she clung to the deactivation rods and forced out an order as the tines closed around her. "Get me up there!"

I'd only intended to get her out and save her, and we had less than thirty seconds left, but even in my panic, for some reason, I trusted her.

Lifting the claw in staggering jolts, I moved her up alongside the central pillar, and up above the platform with the bomb on it only to find that it was spinning fastest of all.

There was absolutely no way she would be able to jump down and stay on - not with both hands around the awkward metal object she carried.

"Get me above it," she shouted, and I lowered her down as close as I could while trying to ignore the scant seconds left. Even as I moved the claw lower, though, the rapidly spinning platform began to drop. I understood where it was going - down into the center of the device, the nadir of the mechanical vortex - but I also knew that meant we were almost out of time.

Lowering the claw as smoothly as I could, I brought her to just a foot or two above the sinking bomb, jolting up and down a bit as I tried to get the dropping speed right. From her camera perspective, the bomb was a whirling sphere of black and chrome and utterly impossible to interact with.

She tried to lower the four rods into place twice, but then judged against it. "Spin me!" she shouted at the top of her lungs, still barely audible over the intense roar of machinery.

Could the claw do that? It could! Of course it could turning on the servos, I started giving her rotational speed even as the bottom of the vortex dropped away. Chrome rings melted into a vast well of purple light and waves of white. Through her camera, I could see into eternity and the platform was moving down into it.

We were far past out of time.

Agonizingly slowly, the rotating bomb and platform seemed to slow down as her spinning grew to match. I could hear her straining not to get sick or pass out I knew her spinning had to be subjecting her to painfully high *g* forces, but she remained ready despite the crushing intensity. The purple below us imploded into bright white lines, and the illusionary corridor widened and the platform, from our perspective, seemed to finally stop spinning.

It even went the other direction a little bit, but I edged off the slightest bit of servo power, and she came back to even with it.

"Open the claw," she shouted grimly, hardly able to speak against the tremendous pressure.

"What? But you'll -"

"There's no choice."

I knew she was right, and I had to listen to her order, but I still felt horrible and empty as I gave the final command. The claw opened.

Despite the chaos, she dropped eerily straight down, and immediately fell across the top of the bomb to keep herself from falling off. With a swift motion, she oriented the four rods and shoved them down into interlocking access ports. I saw all this through her headset camera, and I saw her descending into an infinite tunnel from the crane camera and I saw her heat signature disappear from the base map.

"What do I do?" I asked her, at the last, the roaring crescendo reaching a final peak. "I can't get you with the crane"

"You might be on your own now, friend," she told me calmly, her strained and quiet voice oddly audible despite the storm. "I needed to go there anyway. Maybe - just maybe - they can help."

"Who?" I cried.

She sighed with worry, regret, and a dozen other unidentifiable emotions, her hands gripping white on the bars around the bomb. "I'm going home."

In a flash, the tunnel compacted, swirled, and was gone.

The platform remained - with nothing on it.

Slowly, the entire configuration began powering down and resetting position, and I lifted the crane's claw lest I damage something. I did all this automatically, without thinking, because I could not think.

I sat and processed what had happened for several minutes. I hadn't been there physically - I'd just been watching video and listening to audio and rooting through files - but I still felt as if I'd been through a life and death situation and only barely survived.

I hadn't even had time to anticipate it... it had all just happened. Six minutes ago, she'd been standing on the edge, and, now, she was gone.

Shaken, I got up, and took a walk around the office building. Outside, the same slithery creatures moved, and I watched them for a time, lost in thought.

Who had she been? Who had she been trying to keep safe? She'd been searching for *some people*, she'd said, and that search had led her inward, to the inner shell of our protected realities the silent sanctum at the center. Who might be able to help? The people she was looking for, or the people already there?

Because there had to be people already there, I imagined that was the part I couldn't quite grapple with. She was *going home*

And now I was alone. The darkness and seclusion hadn't hit me, not with full effect, until I stood standing there at the windows and realized I truly couldn't leave. The only friend I'd ever made was gone, and the portal she'd used to get to that underground complex

was still open.

Rushing back to the server room and my computer, I went through each and every option I had at my disposal in that distant base. Automated railcars in the tunnels, operational cranes, what else? Was there anything that could actually physically move something to her initial portal? There had seemed to be children on the other side in the brief glimpse I'd seen the other day her family? That boy at the front

What would they think if she didn't come back?

Something else occurred to me. The gigantic vortex device had to be able to pull things back as well as send. How else were men and equipment moved between realities? While I was still connected, could I use it to save *myself?* I could go there, then go through the portal she'd left open!

Yes. The complex there had much more mapping and targeting capability, and I even found an approximation of the map I'd created by hand. Indeed, our entire bubble was a sphere of dozens of realities with an outer shell separating us from the rest of the multiverse, and an inner shell protecting one central world.

The outer shell, on this map, was practically covered with warning symbols and alert signs. Numerous entire realities on the map were completely red. Had they been destroyed? Were these the cracks the flame entity had spoken of? There were so many what was holding back the darkness, save our lonely desolate guardians? Individuals enduring beyond all imagination, the most human of all, struggling to carry on at the walls

Haunted, I focused on finding my coordinates. The base already seemed to have my office on file, and I activated the machine with the new destination. Apparently, a portal would open for thirty seconds, and I would have a chance to step through.

I watched through the crane cameras as the entire cycle spun up again. Four or five minutes later, I dared not hope as it declared the tunnel open and stable.

Rushing out into the office building proper, I looked around for vast purple light - but found none. Racing around, I went through every room and hallway - and found nothing. Where was it?!

I stopped in place as I finally sighted it.

A dim purple haze emanated from the fog outside.

Staring out the window, my hope shriveled. It was out there, with those slimy things and getting out there would require breaking a window. If I tried to reach it, and failed, there would be no more safe haven.

Despondent, I watched the purple expire, and then returned to my server room. I knew I couldn't ignore, for much longer, the growing likelihood that I was going to die in that room. Our little corner of the multiverse was falling apart, held together only by the threadbare hardships of quietly heroic human beings, and the only person trying to fix it had just disappeared into an unknown situation with an extremely dangerous bomb, leaving her kids behind and alone and all I could think about was the slow process of starvation and loneliness I was about to face. I could protest and call for help all I wanted on the Internet, but nobody would believe me, and their mockery would only make it worse.

And even if I made it out of here, the Crushing Fist, whatever it entailed, was coming for us - something bad enough that even ascendant living flames were scared of it. This new threat was approaching, and there was nobody left to stop the tide.

If only I could *do something* but being trapped here made that impossible unless

I looked at the base's more complete map of realities again, and something hit me.

I already knew what the Crushing Fist was. It was already here it was already happening had been happening for more than a year. The exact mechanism, agenda, or plot behind it was irrelevant. Humanity was under siege.

And there was nobody left to stop the tide meaning there was nobody watching me. I'd wondered why nobody had ever come to check up on my activities, even as I'd begun blatantly breaking into military networks. I was the only network manager left. The bases were empty. Lone survivors manned the walls.

There was nobody left to fear.

Suddenly full of excited hope, rather than despair, I logged into every network I could and implemented my plan.

*I* was trapped here, but that didn't mean there weren't others out there like my only friend. There had to be other people out there who knew something of our situation, or who had minor capabilities we might cobble together, or who had artifacts in their possession like her device that talked to souls. There were nine hundred and twenty-four billion human beings alive between the inner and outer shells, by all accounts we weren't done. Not yet.

Alive with electricity, I decided to step out from my safe anonymity and *do something* for the first time in my life. That's what she'd been trying to tell me, I guessed: having something to care about meant taking risks, even unknowable risks with very little hope to cling to.

I sent out the call.

On every single network, in every single reality, on all the Internets and all the forums I could reach, I began posting. I was fiction. I was a joke. I was a scary story. I was an entertaining read. For some, I was nonsense.

But some people would understand. Some people would see the elements at play, and some people would know I was serious. With nearly a trillion humans alive in our little walled city, even a one in a billion chance would net us nearly a thousand people. With all that just *one* had accomplished, what couldn't a thousand motivated and capable human beings handle?

I wrote as many posts on as many different Internets as I could myself, and then made a script to continue on.

And now I wait.
