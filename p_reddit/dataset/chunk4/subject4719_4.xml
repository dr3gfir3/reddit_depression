	<TEXT> Hey! My bf loves star trek   I wanted to surprise him with some vintage memorabilia just cause he's awesome:) His room decor is very modern   "adult", so I'm iffy about getting action figures. What options do I have?  I know some vintage memorabilia stores in my area (im in chicago if anyone knows specifc good stores), but I don't even know what to begin to look at! Thank you for any help or advice!!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! In my non professional (but experienced) opinion, weed is one of the best medicines for depression and anxiety (but can also make it worse based on the strain, so be careful). I highly recommend you stay away from other drugs, because, as you said yourself, they can make you much worse. If your friends can't hang if they're not f*cked up, you shouldn't be friends with them anyways. Maybe be like "hey i'll get stoned with you, you guys do your thing I'll do mine" and see if that helps. But honestly, if they reject you cause you dont wanna do harder drugs then they're not your friends to begin with. Therapist and medicine is a good idea as well! Stay strong   try to make good choices.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I know, you can accept the job and take back your response before you sign the contract. If they want you to come in tomorrow make up some reason why you cant make it in before next week (just to give yourself time for other interviews to get back to you) 
Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thats awesome! Congrats on getting your T! I try and prepare myself when I see that it's about that time on my birth control and my game plan to cope is usually work.  Its just summer   the having absolutely nothing to do which is messing with me so badly. I teach math to seniors (and maybe even juniors this year!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your response! My therapist said its normal that this happens, and to help I've been on birth control. Its gotten better since I've been on it! However, therapist says its just another battle that i'll have to learn to overcome:( 
I'm glad to hear i'm not alone and im happy to hear you found yourself! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You do have a right to be depressed, but it is important that you learn to cope with it. I often times have a "crash" after having such a great time. It can even last for days. Almost like I used up all my happy hormones. So that part I think is normal for people with depression. 
The fact that you have understood the impact your suicide will have on others and that it is shaping you, it means you are getting better (in my non professional, but experienced opinion). Stay Strong! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hi! I'm kind of in a similar boat as you. I just turned 25 last week, I have an amazing job (almost my dream job!) that pays enoughish, I'm independent, I have a wonderful bf, wonderful friends, I feel that I am skilled at my other hobbies, yet I am consistently depressed. I'm a teacher, its my dream job, it is very rewarding and I'm super passionate about it. It helps me cope with my depression a LOT, but it's summer now and I'm really struggling. From an outside perspective my life is freakin amazing, right? But somehow, every single day I have to remind myself that SH is not an option, and neither is suicide because I dont want to hurt others in my life. What helps me cope the best is constantly being distracted, not letting my mind wander.
Are you sure the career you chose is the right one for you? Is there nothing else that excites you (hobby, a different profession)? Have you tried/thought about trying medicine? 

I dont know if i've helped, but I hope you feel less alone in the struggle

	<TEXT> When I feel like this I go work out. Not only does it help with "ok i'm not going to be/feel like a tub of lard", working out also releases those happy hormones that will help you cope and not feel as numb/empty/dead. I know its super hard to get yourself to get up and go work out (speed walk, run, do easy stuff at home if you dont have a gym membership) , but once you do and finish your work out, it will feel a little better. If you do it consistently, it might even feel a lot better. Good luck and stay strong! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Periods + Depression </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been very proud of myself to have come very far in my coping with depression. However, few days before and week of my period.... man do I hit some lows. I'm a teacher and on summer break, so I do not have my job to help distract me (best coping method ever! Love my job). It almost feels like I have forgotten how to deal with lows like this. Past few mornings all I could do was cry it out, and spend most of my day convincing myself SH isnt a good idea. I do my best to distract myself (going out with friends, run errands, read, watch movies, seeing my SO) but because I have SOOO much time free, I find my "period depression" to be so tough to deal with. I have about 1 more left before the school year starts, and I dread it. 
Anyone else have that period depression bs? Any advice on other coping skills? Thank you!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I felt the same way when I started feeling better too! The longer this goes on the more you'll discover who you are without all of the heavy weight of depression. Congratulations! I hope you continue on the path of feeling better :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right to be excited and nervous! Emailing your mentor is a great idea that everyone's mentioned so far, maybe even ask them for a copy of a syllabus for the classes you're teaching. You're definitely expected to go to all the before school orientations, so ask them about those dates too! In order to make it a good experience for your students you have got to try your best, and that's about it. Kids see your effort and passion, they will feed off that. 
And just a little of my two cents about student teaching: You're going to mess up and you're going to have tough days. That's so normal. That's how you learn. I know it doesn't make it easier, but just keep it in mind that we all started off this way. Don't be afraid to ask your mentor or fellow redditors any questions you have. Good Luck!!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This past year life has been amazing to me. My own place, dream job, amazing friends, amazing relationship. However, depression still kicks my ass a few times a week. I cannot come up with a reason for it. I can't find the trigger. I just am depressed because I am. Self harm thoughts come from no where   for no reason  (not followed through, fortunately ). I don't tell anyone about it anymore because the first question is "why" and I have no answer. I keep it all inside cause I feel guilty and burdensome to tell anyone. I can't explain my depression and I don't want them to worry. I always somehow pull through on my own, but I wish I didn't have to.
How do you approach people in your life when you are depressed without a trigger?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> perhaps you're just a fuck boy? I just dont want to hear strangers telling me that teenage boys wanna do me. And I do not understand why thats a compliment or even part of the idea of hitting on someone. Unfortunately, because you're not in this position, I doubt you'd actually understand how uncomfortable and disgusting it is. This is not something I go through strictly as a female. Male teachers who are attractive get comments like these too. Please think before typing.  </TEXT>
