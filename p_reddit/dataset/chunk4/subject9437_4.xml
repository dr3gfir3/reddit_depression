	<TEXT> Found this end-of-world scenario in Islam extremely funny and thought I'd share: http://islamqa.info/en/8806 : a one-eyed man will emerge at the end of time and then Jesus will descend from the sky and decapitate him.

I am extremely confused how 1.5 billion people believe this laughable nonsense lol :)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Violence in Islamic Hadiths </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I came across this image from a Muslim Facebook page: http://i.imgur.com/ugfeyUU.jpg 

It shows a Muslim with a gun looking out for a Jew to kill him and a tree speaking to alert the Muslim that there is a Jew hiding behind it and should be killed.

This is absolutely ridiculous, but it is funny how many Muslims actually believe this (that trees will speak). According to Saudi cleric Muhammad Al-Arifi: 

"Studies conducted in Tel Aviv and in the Palestinian lands occupied by the Jews showed that they plant  trees around their homes, because the Prophet Muhammad said that when the Muslims fight the Jews, each and every stone and tree will say: Oh Muslim, oh servant of Allah, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him. The only exception is the  gharqad tree, which is one of the trees of the Jews, and if they hide behind it, it will not reveal their presence. According to reports of people who went there and saw it with their own eyes, many Jews plant  gharqad trees around their homes, so that when the fighting begins, they can hide behind them. They are not man enough to stand and fight you. " 

Here is also a hadith: 

" Sahih Bukhari Hadith Volume 4, Book 52, Number 176: Narrated by 'Abdullah bin 'Umar: Allah's Apostle said, "You (i.e. Muslims) will fight with the Jews till some of them will hide behind stones. The stones will (betray them) saying, 'O 'Abdullah (i.e. slave of Allah)! There is a Jew hiding behind me; so kill him.'" Sahih Bukhari Hadith Volume 4, Book 52, Number 177: Narrated by Abu Huraira: Allah's Apostle said, "The Hour will not be established until you fight with the Jews, and the stone behind which a Jew will be hiding will say. "O Muslim! There is a Jew hiding behind me, so kill him."

That's the so-called religion of peace, eh?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't stop laughing at this part: 

"Al-Bukhaari (137) and Muslim (361) narrated from Saeed ibn al-Musayyab, and from Abbaad ibn Tameem, from his paternal uncle, that he complained to the Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) about when a man thinks that something has happened during the prayer. He said: Do not stop unless you hear a sound or notice a smell. 

I can imagine someone at the time walking up to the Prophet and saying: "O Messenger of Allah, I just farted. What do I do?" 

These hadiths are quite funny </TEXT>
