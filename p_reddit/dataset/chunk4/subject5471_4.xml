	<TEXT> I just finished Lolita by Nabokov 10 minutes ago. As I read the 307th and final page I felt incredibly disappointed. I was bored throughout the whole book. The plot was kinda interesting mainly because the subject matter is insane. The prose was beautiful but it felt repetitive. The puns and witticism were nice but only a few managed to make me laugh as I did while reading Pnin. The French was nice at first but got annoying as it went on. Has anyone felt this way after finishing a book (maybe one that is "rated" so highly)?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to start reading In Search of Lost Time by Marcel Proust. I have Swann's Way already but I am intimidated to start it. Do any of you know a good biography of Proust, introduction to his work, etc that would be good to read before reading him? Thanks ahead of time </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hardcovers last longer but paperbacks will take a beating and are easier to carry around. I personally think paperbacks are easier to read from but hardcovers look cooler on a bookshelf. In the end, it's up to what you think looks nicer. I personally think some older paperbacks have much nicer cover and spine designs (especially the Bantem Books ones that made their cover art look like an old movie poster) than the hardcovers.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Reading All of an Author's Work </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Over the last year I have tried to read all the published work of some of my favorite authors. I read all of John Green's books. I am almost done with Hunter S. Thompson, Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, David Sedaris, and J.D. Salinger. I plan to finish all of Chuck Palahniuk, David Foster Wallace, Hermann Hesse, Camus, and Joyce's works. Before these lists get any longer, I am curious to see if any of you have read all of an author's work. If so, which author(s) and why?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite is a tie between "Looking for Alaska" by John Green and "The Perks of Being a Wallflower" by Stephen Chbosky. I think both novels perfectly capture what it is like being a teenager and high school and the corresponding emotional roller coaster ride that is growing up. I have always felt that good young adult novels can make you feel the sublime ecstasy of being a highschooler again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I printed out a few lists of the best books of all time/20th century/etc, compared them all, and marked which books were on multiple lists. But besides choosing from these lists, I usually just ask the nice people that work at bookstores. Most of the people that work in bookstores are well-read and can probably recommend something if you describe a type of book you want to read. The recommendations/lists on Goodreads.com also are pretty good for finding what you want to read.  </TEXT>
