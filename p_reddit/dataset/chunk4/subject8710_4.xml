	<TEXT> Since the start of this decade (2010-present) only 2 linebackers have been selected as the AP Defensive Player of the Year: Suggs   Kuechly

The question is, which does r/NFL feel is the better linebacker   why?

Also, this award has been dominated by J.J. Watt for 3 out of 4 years this decade or we could've seen more linebackers. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-12 07:06:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As someone that doesn't follow college football due to the fact that we don't get college football games in Canada for the most part, I'm not familiar with college football at all. 

However, looking at the SEC Championship records since 2008, Alabama has been to the SEC Championship game 6 times and have won 5 times. What's the secret for Alabama's dominance from their players, coaches, tactics, staff, and everything in between?

Also, can someone provide some insight into how big football culture is in Alabama? How has Alabama's success in recent times had an impact on the University of Alabama and the state in general? 

Furthermore, which players from Alabama have gone on to be drafted in the NFL and have they been successful or unsuccessful? 

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love how Real Madrid fans are obsessed with Inter all of a sudden.

Real Madrid might be a rich club, but there's no club in the world with as much capital as Inter. Unlike PSG, Man City, Real Madrid and whoever else, Inter's shares are all owned by multi-billionaires and multi-billion companies. Pirelli themselves wields an unfathomable amount of influence, you should probably read up on them. 

Inter has a long history of signing mega-stars anyways. The original Luis Suarez, Ronaldo, Crespo, Ibrahimovic, Figo, etc. Maybe not Messi, but why are other superstars not possible? 

As a Real Madrid fan, you should be aware of Inter's influence over players, too. Inter, Milan, Benfica and Real Madrid will always be the most historical European clubs   players are drawn to that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He'll always be compared to Peyton Manning, that's why. But would anyone question his status as an elite QB if he wasn't Peyton's little brother   just another guy? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Favorite Starcraft II tournament? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-27 08:01:28 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Throughout the years of Starcraft 2, we've had a ton of IEMs, Dreamhacks, WCSs, GSLs, SSLs, MLGs, KeSPA Cups, Homestory Cups, and everything in between, but what 1 tournament stood out as the best or most memorable or simply your favorite? 

For me:

I'd go with the 2011 GSL Super Tournament. 

The top 4 consisted of MarineKing, MMA, TOP and Polt and it just symbolizes the golden era of GOMTvT to me. There was even a K-POP performance.

Honorable mention: 

Razer King of the Beta

I remember how hyped I was for Starcraft 2's launch and this tournament shot my hype through the roof.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The UK is probably most alike Toronto in terms of clubbing culture. As someone from Toronto though, I'd actually argue that Montreal has a better club scene than Toronto plus French girls are gorgeous. 

As for the UK, I heard from sources that Leeds   Newcastle are good for partying plus there's tons of hotties. What's your opinion on Leeds   Newcastle?
