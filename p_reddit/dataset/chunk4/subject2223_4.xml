	<TITLE> The book club selection for November is Radiance by Catherynne M. Valente! She will do an AMA here on November 30th. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-27 20:41:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If you have already read this please do not post spoilers here.  I will be posting a discussion thread on Saturday where those who have finished the book can discuss it and include spoilers. 


#Radiance by Catherynne M. Valente: 


Radiance is a decopunk pulp SF alt-history space opera mystery set in a Hollywoodand solar systemvery different from our own, from the phenomenal talent behind the New York Timesbestselling The Girl Who Circumnavigated Fairyland in a Ship of Her Own Making.


Severin Uncks father is a famous director of Gothic romances in an alternate 1986 in which talking movies are still a daring innovation due to the patent-hoarding Edison family. Rebelling against her fathers films of passion, intrigue, and spirits from beyond, Severin starts making documentaries, traveling through space and investigating the levitator cults of Neptune and the lawless saloons of Mars. For this is not our solar system, but one drawn from classic science fiction in which all the planets are inhabited and we travel through space on beautiful rockets. Severin is a realist in a fantastic universe.


But her latest film, which investigates the disappearance of a diving colony on a watery Venus populated by island-sized alien creatures, will be her last. Though her crew limps home to earth and her story is preserved by the colonys last survivor, Severin will never return.


Aesthetically recalling A Trip to the Moon and House of Leaves, and told using techniques from reality TV, classic film, gossip magazines, and meta-fictional narrative, Radiance is a solar system-spanning story of love, exploration, family, loss, quantum physics, and silent film.
