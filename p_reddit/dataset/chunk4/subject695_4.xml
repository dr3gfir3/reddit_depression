	<TEXT> I here ya. I really tried to give their new stuff a chance but man does the latest album, the Devil put Dinosaurs Here, really suck. It is so fucking boring and long. I thought Black Gives Way for Blue was a decent hard rock album but it is not a real Alice in Chains album.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it is quite a bit relevant because it shows what a big phony he is. Here he is pretending to care about the plight of the poor, when all he wanted was a photo op for his vice president campaign. He is a immense believer in Ayn Rand and does not give a fuck about the poor or the middle class for that matter. He is a member of Congress who keeps coming up with budgets that cut social services for the poor. Bush is no longer relevant but Mr Paul is because he still has a lot of power in Congress and is very influential. He may even run for president in 2016. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand you completely. I'm 34 and probably going to be alone for the rest of my life. I have come to terms with it and am not bitter toward women at all. I do get frustrated occasionally, though. For example, my best friend's fiance twice tried to get two of her friends interested in getting to know me. I was rebuffed both times. She is a kind person and I really appreciated that she was trying to help  but the rejection the second time around made for an awkward ride home. I was gave them the silent treatment and it was not because I was mad at them. On the contrary, I was upset with myself for being so fucking undateable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> None taken. I didn't say that you couldn't be offended. Some jokes will offend people and comedians know that when they take a risk in telling them. You are the one who said that a lynch mob should be formed to come after her just because you didn't like the joke, you dickhead! I expect you to come after Louis CK and Marc Maron as well then because they tell rape jokes, too! Have a nice day!  </TEXT>
