Played against mousesports not the current lineup but the old with nex, Spiidi, ChrisJ, Niko and Denis. They were warming up for an event and they didn't speak but in my head I had a thing going against nex. And some other days friberg and sunnY.

You'd expect the chat to go abeshit but must of the time it is just maybe one or two persons saying "Oh look it's x " and then the chat goes quiet again or some general banter.

Pug:

Well I didn't play against a pro, but I had Karrigan and his gf on my team. We played cobble and he told us on t side "Always go b". So that is what we did. His gf awped mid but Karrigan carried us the game ez.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the one by /u/SpartahWaffle 

It seems solid overall and with just $4 over the 800 budget pretty good! The other ones are ok as well but they safe the money to get on $800 by recommending a micro ATX motherboard, which is not only very small and looks ridiculous in a normal case, but also leaves few to no room for further upgrades in terms or more RAM or other stuff you need the PCIe slots for. Not horrible but not recommendable in a normal build. </TEXT>

Might need to add an optical drive but the site wouldn't let me :S Well I kept it a bit under $800 so you can still buy a Windows key or something else. 

Opinions on this build appreciated. 

Edit: Why the fuck put I in an i3?Get an i5 6500 or similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I would ask them for is a picture with them next year ESL One Cologne. 

I am a huge NiP fan and have been since I started playing CS almost 3 years ago now. CSGO was the first CS I played and I came mainly from RPG type games or console games and my brother had played a bit CS in 2014 around the major. I did not know any of the teams but my brother said "Haha, a team named 'Ninjas in Pyjamas' won." Neither of us knew that majors are such a big thing but I could not forget the name due to how silly it sounds. Now in late 2014 my brother gifted me a skin, a Souvenir PP-Bizon Irradiated Alert with a NiP and a LDLC sticker. I thought hey why not give this game a shot? I played a lot with my brother, mostly mm tho. Then Dreamhack Winter 2014 arrived and I thought "Wow this is a really big thing!" and then I saw what team is in there, Ninjas in Pyjamas. Little fun fact here, I played the pick'em and got 96 points with only 1 team being a false choice, which was iBuyPower. So I watched all the matches after I came from school and I can remember one thing especially. The final was NiP vs. LDLC after LDLC got into the final after the Olofpass thing, and I couldn't wait for the final to beging, so finally the game starts and I am exited as hell for the whole match and my heart was beating like crazy. In the end LDLC won and I was a bit sad but then I saw, I think f0rest, hugging someone from LDLC. I think it was Shox, but I am not sure :x I will never forget that moment and after that all the other moments NiP and their fans cheered! And with them I did! Even when they were on a losing streak, a Ninja never cries but always cheers! So this year my parents and my brother gave me money to buy a ticket for ESL One Cologne and I was so happy that I would finally get to meet my great idols. The guys that motivated me to go beyond my limits and always give my best in game even when my internet is shit, but then F3 won... I was devastated.... I wouldn't meet my idols. But I had hope. Hope that I see them one day and take a picture with them and just thank them. I think being a part of such a great community as the cs community made me more confident in real life and I even met friends due to being such a NiP fan! Maybe one day I will even play against them :) .  </TEXT>

Here are the parts I picked. Now I will try to give an explanation to why I picked those parts. I chose an i5-4460 for the CPU as it is a solid CPU that I can only recommend and I highly doubt that you will need 6 cores. Motherboard changed due to CPU change (other socket). Memory could have stayed but I picked you the blue one which is a bit cheaper and fits the Mobo \:^) Now coming to the GPU. I tried to get some money of your budget for games and all that stuff that follows so I went with the GTX 1050Ti since it is a very solid card and should do the job just as fine as the GTX 960. Case stayed the same, a little tip at this point, you can take of both sides of the case for easier cable management. Power supply stayed the same tho I would have gotten a 550W if you want to upgrade further later on. I also thought about a 600W for 30 but I don't know how the quallity is and 600W would be overkill to be honest. Wireless Network Adapter... uhm.. I don't know, I don't use them I just picked a cheap one I would highly recommend using a cable if that is a possibility. Added a DVD/CD Writer because they are cheap and useful as you will likely not have the drivers on a USB-Stick.  

With the money you saved you could buy a nice keyboard and mouse. Honestly it is no waste of money to invest into a good mouse for example the Steelseries Rival 300 or Logitech G402. Keyboards don't matter that much, it is nice to have a really fancy mechanical one but as for an example at the moment I am using an old Medion one which works just as fine.

Feedback from others is appreciated as well :) </TEXT>

Most people in my school, cause that is the only thing that requires me to go outside to talk and listen to people, were all like the world is going to end after Donald Trump was elected. A lot of people compared him with Hitler and ranted about it. Well now from my point of view most of the students, including me, don't know jack shit about the US elections except for what the media tells us, and if you aren't watching serious news or so most of the stuff is hyped up. Also most think Hillary is a saint and would have saved all of the US. Which isn't easy to do when you basically say you want to declare war against Russia and Syria...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before bullshitting all over religion etc and saying atheists rules I will just stay civil as any normal person would so.

Saying "Why can't Atheists accept that the universe was created by a non-human entity?" is like saying Why can't Christians accept that the universe was created by a non-human entity? If you have an opinion you're likely to stick to it, unfortunately that is for other things as well even when faced with facts. Coming back to the real topic it is mostly due to the fact that there is more proof for the universe being created by a big bang than by a non-human entity. As Religions are mostly based on tradition or a book it is easy to prove everything wrong what is written down there. Now you could say "But how do you want to proof me there is no god if you can't see him?", well I'd tell you "Well how about you proof me that there is no giant toilet bowl floating through space that is creating universes as it flushes." You see where I am going? Most of the stuff the church said to justify a non-human entity creating the world and everything around it was proven wrong. I am saying most of the Stuff is because I have not read e.g the whole bible so I don't know all the little stuff in there but as my example said how can you deliver a proof that there is no universe creating toilet bowl? 

But in the end it doesn't matter. You have your believe and I have mine. Why would I dictate you what you should believe in, if it isn't something as stupid as saying the earth is flat. You don't harm anyone by believing in your religion. (Before the idiots comment, no the IS does not represent the Islam) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got some uncommon habits:

* I always double check when closing something, sometimes I even run back from my car to the house to check if I locked it

* Sometimes I twitch my fingers when I walk from one place to another

* If you want to know the time I give you the exact time no rounding

* When talking to someone for the first time, or I rarely speak with I actively avoid looking into their face

* Friday is Christmas sweater Friday. Every Friday.

Edit: I also always keep one can of mountain dew on the desk near my bed.
