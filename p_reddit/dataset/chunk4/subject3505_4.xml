If you are lucky enough to have good broadband you have many other options including SVOD (Netflix, Amazon, etc) and linear streaming services (SlingTV, Vue, etc.).

And don't forget that Netflix still has DVD by mail plans.

	<TEXT> Looks like you should get an excellent signal on all major channels with an outside antenna (Hi-VHF/UHF) pointed about 220 degrees magnetic.

You might want check the signal with a TV near the antenna to make sure there are no specific problems before you run an extended cable to your room. Sometimes an older antenna may have a problem with the heritage hardware or existing cable attached to the antenna. In my experience that is not common, but it does happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Believe it or not, the classic cable TV channel guide is patented! The patent holder charges a hefty fee to have a guide in that style.

https://www.google.com/patents/US5585866

Some companies pay, others try an alternative presentation.

The legal fight about the legitimacy of the patent has gone back   forth in the courts for years. In recent years the patents have suffered some setbacks. However, using the classic format without paying a license fee is still likely to wind up in court.

	<TEXT> Lots of folks have a DBS satellite TV dish on the top of their RVs. When they park at a destination they need to orient the dish for their specific longitude   latitude; then they can watch TV. 

A satellite Internet installation demands even more precision in aiming the dish than TV. The dish is not only receiving signals, it is sending microwave signals to a satellite 22,300 miles above the equator. This is not something you easily could do through glass. And it would be impossible from a moving vehicle.

If you seek a broadband connection from a moving vehicle, cell phone technology is the only practical method.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disconnect the coax at the dish. Then you can reuse the cable within your home. 

One thing many folks do is to put up an outdoor TV antenna and use the dish coax to distribute OTA TV around the house. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Latency depends on the distance the signal has to travel between the satellite and the ground. All geostationary communications satellites are in an orbit approximately 22,300 miles (35,786 km) above the equator. The time it takes for signals to travel 22,300 miles round trip is 240-280 mS, depending on location on the ground.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geostationary_orbit

The proposed satellites will be in a much lower orbit at an altitude between 1,150 Km and 1,275 Km. Since radio waves travel at the speed of light which is 300,000 km per second, the round trip latency would be about 7.6 mS. This is a lot shorter than traditional satellite broadband.

The low orbit means that these satellites will not be geostationary, will need significant on-board fuel to maintain their orbits, and will have to be replaced on a regular basis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Streaming linear TV channels are less expensive than those same channels on cable, but it is still linear TV. Aside from live events   news, video on demand is my strong preference for how I consume content. 

The one very useful thing I get from linear TV channels is content curation. So I find a lot of interesting old films via Turner Classic Movies. That said, I really want to watch that content (including the TCM introductions) in a Netflix-like environment. I don't want to hunt through a month worth of program guide info to set a recording timer so I can watch a film at my convenience.

I used to imagine a utopian future where I could subscribe to TCM a la carte. Not anymore. Now my utopian wish is for TCM as Netflix.

	<TEXT> PVR = DVR. The term PVR (personal video recorder) predates the shift to digital video. Somewhere around the house I still have an old PVR PC card that I used to record analog OTA broadcasts back in the day. 

I use both terms to refer to devices that record digital video data streams from cable, satellite, or OTA broadcast sources. The preferred modern acronym for such a gizmo is DVR. 

Check out the link I posted to see what's on offer these days in off-the-shelf DVRs.

I would suggest a Hi-VHF/UHF outdoor antenna like the Channel Master Cm-2018. Should run $65+, depending on where you buy it. Install it on a 15ft+ mast pointed at 122 degrees magnetic and you should be all set. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. If you live near a metropolitan area, a good antenna and a DVR offer a lot of entertainment at a very low cost. In my location I have more than 70 broadcast choices just from a simple outdoor antenna.

See the relevant subreddit guides for details.

	<TEXT> I plugged Spring Branch zip code 77080 into the TVFool data tool and found that the KPRC NBC signal is one of the strongest in your area.

Point almost any outdoor antenna due south (177 degrees) and you should have great reception. 

KPRC NBC identifies itself as channel 2. It is actually broadcasting on channel 35; it is a UHF signal. Channels 8, 11, and 13 in Houston are VHF signals actually broadcasting on 8, 11, and 13. You will need an antenna that is VHF capable to get an optimum picture in most locations. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds like you are trying to get ME-TV. That service is broadcast in the Seattle area on both KVOS (virtual 12.1/actual 35.3) and KFFV (virtual 44.6/actual 44.8). Your antenna is picking up the KFFV signal.

According to TVFOOL.COM KFFV is 4.8 miles from your location at 145 degrees while KVOS is 78 miles away at 343 degrees. You will need a very substantial outdoor antenna pointed almost due north to pick up KVOS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are correct, but in fact most Social Security recipients have too much income to qualify. 

Only those 65+ who qualify for SSI are eligible for the Charter discount. SSI is not social security; it is a separate safety net program established in 1935 for the blind, the permanently    totally disabled, and the elderly. To get SSI benefits a senior who is not blind or disabled must have no more than $9k/year in combined wages   social security benefits. You have to be nearly indigent to qualify for SSI   Charter broadband. The SSI benefit is reduced for every dollar you get from wages or Social Security and goes to zero when you hit the approximately $9k threshold.

For those interested you can read the many details here:

Electromagnetic spectrum   orbital slots are scarce public resources that are managed by an international agency that was established in 1865 to regulate international telegraphy.

Orbital slots   spectrum are allocated by the International Telecommunication Union based in Geneva. Typically, they hand off a mega allocation to a national agency (in the US it goes to the FCC). The FCC then allocates for those within their jurisdiction.
