	<TEXT> The evidence for it came from a few tools that sort of resembled tools in Europe. One of these tools was supposedly dredged up in the ocean by a fisherman so the exact context and location is unknown. Supporters believe that Solutrean tools formed the basis of later Clovis tools.

The Solutrean Hypothesis is refuted by the huge gap in time between the Solutrean culture in France and the Clovis culture in the Americas, the lack of evidence for watercraft, the difficulty in the route, and the mountain of genetic evidence that point to Siberia and Asia as the origin of Native Americans. </TEXT>

In this [About](http://archaeology.about.com/od/transportation/fl/Sacbe.htm) article, the widest sacbe was 10m at its widest but narrowed to as wide as 6m.

	<TEXT> ~6000 km2

I study the Teuchitlan culture of Jalisco, Mexico. The Teuchitlan culture, as well as their contemporaries in Nayarit, Colima, and northern Jalisco, have a tradition of burying their dead in shaft and chamber tombs. These tombs can range from very small chambers just below the surface to large multi-chambered tombs as deep as 18m. Since the late 1800s up through the 1960s and 1970s, looting was very frequent. In fact, some people made their livelihood just looting tombs. As a result, the number of tombs that have been studied by archaeologists are few and far between. I'm on the lookout to see whether there have been advances in technology that allow us to find some unlooted tombs in a very large area. The 6000 km2 area I gave covers the entirety of the Tequila Valleys where the Teuchitlan culture is centered upon. In reality, if I wanted to search all of western Mexico the area would be much, much higher. </TEXT>

El Mirador is one the earliest metropolitan cities in North America and may be larger than Teotihuacan. As work continues on the site and in the Basin, we are realizing just how important a role the Preclassic city had on its Classic period successors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The potatoes eaten by Native Americans had thousands of years of selective breeding to reduce toxins. And empires were built on the consumption of potatoes and other tubers from the Andes. So how is it that these things could happen in the Andes, but the potato was somehow too poisonous for Europeans until they did their own selective breeding? 

I would like a source on the claim that potatoes were used to poison people.

I'm not denying that potatoes can be poisonous, because they can. But you would think Europeans would look at how Natives consumed potatoes and copy them the same way Europeans did with other New World foods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  what? how is that relevant? 

Because you seem to not understand how radiocarbon dating works and how archaeologists arrive at the dates they present.

 if i didnt build the house 100 years ago but everything from the original builders was washed away you would assume that i built it. and you would be wrong.

No, I wouldn't. Not everything washes away and if it did, that would mean evidence of your occupation would be gone as well.

Plus, depending on how well preserved the house is you can date the structure based on style and construction material choice. You can then compare these things to other structures that have been dated and make a comparison.

  i didnt make any assumptions about the hunter gatherers. im saying they wouldn't have built it. there is no reason for them to have built it. 

You are in thinking that they didn't built Gobekli Tepe and had no reason to construct it.

 and there is no evidence they built it.

The excavators seem to have evidence it was hunter-gatherers.

 its a matter of belief. and i dont care about belief. i care about truth. im not interested in people making wild rationalizations just to suit their view of history.

But you're supporting Hancock and his beliefs. There's a bit of irony there, don't you think?

 well why arent you wondering if they did or not? because there is still no good evidence that they did.

jfc the pyramid exists so people built it. Who else would have done it? And if not Egyptians that had the people, food, and infrastructure to construct the pyramid, why would even earlier people build a pyramid?

 i mean the story goes that the king wanted a giant pyramid to be burred in and then for 20 years slaves built a structure

Yeah, that's a story. The reality is that slaves did not build the Great Pyramids. Rather, skilled and paid masons constructed the pyramid. This is based on excavations of the homes of the workers found near the pyramids.

  built a structure that would be totally ruined if even one stone was out of place.

The pyramid isn't some kind of house of cards. There are numerous missing stones from the exterior of the pyramid today and the structure has not collapsed.

 somehow the workers didnt revolt in those 20 years.

Why would you if you're getting paid?

 why build it in the first place?

Because pyramids stemmed from mastabas which were places Egyptians buried the dead. The Pyramids also signal and establish power and authority. Later pyramids were smaller and required less work because the pharaohs had little need to signal the power they already had.

 why three of them?

Why not? If you are trying to establish a dynasty and secure your power, you build big until it is secure.

 why did we stop building megaliths all of the sudden and seemingly forgot how to do it after making them all over the place for thousands of years?

Cost/benefit, to be honest. Because it is more costly to build with megalithic blocks it signals power and authority. As cultures changed and the methods to signal power and authority changed, there was no need to expand the labor, time, and cost on megalithic structures.

 did we get too sophisticated to do the most sophisticated thing we've ever done

It's not that sophisticated. You're basically building with large Legos. 

 why are some under water?

Like what? The geological formation off of Japan?

 again i think you let someone else do you thinking for you. theres no way you can look at the official story and not question the shit out of all of it.

Do you see the irony in your statement? You reject the plausible and fact based hypotheses for these things for an alternative explanation with little to no evidence and do not question the alternative explanation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right that parts of the plant are poisonous. The only poisonous parts of the plant are the flowers, leaves, temps, and skin of the tuber. The flesh of the tuber itself is safe to eat. And wild varieties are more toxic than domesticated. However, cooking the potato at a temperature greater than 170 C does partly destroy the toxins. 

According to Sophie Coe and her book *America's First Cuisines*, Europeans were slow to adopt the potato because it was not suited to the longer summer days of Europe. While in Ireland, which had a milder climate that allowed the potato to grow until November, the potato underwent a change that allowed it to grow in other parts of Europe. This change may have stemmed from selective breeding or the introduction of other varieties from Chile. It wasn't until the eighteenth century that the potato was productive enough to gain widespread use in Europe. She does not mention toxicity as an issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  ok so they refute two points out of many made by Randal Carlson and others. so must not be true?

No, but it is a shaky foundation.

 and carbon dating things around the pyramid makes no sense. ok so i move into a house made from stone that was built 300 years ago and you come and carbon date things i left behind 100 years ago when i lived there and assume its a hundred years old? come on.

You do not just carbon date one source, you date multiple sources from multiple contexts to piece together a timeline of occupation. You are also assuming you will leave behind no other organic material that can be dated other than said hypothetical material when you move out. If you make a campfire in your yard, garden, toss some garbage on the side of the house, etc. that all could possibly be found.

I should point out, however, our modern practice of gathering refuse to have it deposited elsewhere is a recent thing. In the past, people would have had a midden in which they dumped all their garbage and waste.

 this is kind of gettin into Occam's razor territory. imo its far simpler to assume there was some sort of semi advanced civilization and then something happened which restarted civilization than to say hunter gatherers spontaneously organized a work force to build a monument for some reason and then purposefully covered it up. and then they didn't build any other megalithic sites for thousands of years. it doesn't make any sense. and they were able to feed and house this workforce in a desert how?

I think the trouble you are having in understanding where I am coming from is based on some faulty assumptions. You assume that hunter-gatherers cannot and did not store food. Looking to contemporary hunter-gatherers will not aid you because these people live in marginal areas already. You don't see modern hunter-gatherers in fertile areas with abundant resources because they've been driven off.

You also assume that they spontaneously came out of nowhere to build Gobekli Tepi. The site itself was constructed over a period of 1760 years (radiocarbon dates range from 9130 BC at the oldest to 7370 BC at the youngest). That is a lot of time to come together to slowly work on and construct the site in piecemeal.

You also assume that being a hunter-gatherer means you are constantly on the move. Hunter-gatherers are not inherently nomadic, or at least not constantly nomadic. Hunter-gatherers may move from village to village every few years or decades as they depleted the sources in that particular area and moved onto more abundant regions.

Lastly, you assume that the climate of where Gobekli Tepe is located in Turkey now is how the climate has always been. The climate across the globe is very different now than in the past. What may be desert like now, was not always desert. The best example is the Middle East which used to be much more fertile at the time of Mesopotamia than it is now.

Take all of these things and there is no reason that a large group of hunter-gatherers camped nearby could not have worked together to construct Gobekli Tepi over even a few decades let alone centuries using food stored from throughout the year. They could have also continued to hunt and gather part time or on a rotation basis to help support the community.

 it cant be that maybe we dont have all the pieces of the puzzle yet right?

Sure, that is always a possibility. But as it stands right now with the available evidence, Hancock's ideas lack concrete support.

 but there isnt alot of evidence that man even had the capability of building the site at giza.

They most certainly did. The debate isn't whether people could carve the blocks and move them into place to create the Great Pyramids. The fact that they stand there today is evident of that. The debate is in the exact construction method to build the pyramid. Did they use a ramp? Several ramps? An internal ramp? Log rollers? Moistened sand? Teams of people? Any animals? That's the debate. It's trying to figure out exactly what they did, not whether they did or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  these are blocks that were cut out and then had 3d relief hieroglyphs carved on them. not the same thing.

I didn't say it was the same thing, I was saying that PP took a huge amount of effort for a group of hunter-gatherers. Possibly more effort than Gobekli Tepe depending on where the stone is sourced from.

 the idea is that we were hit by an asteroid. what kind of permanent settlements would you expect to see?

The comet? That idea has been refuted. 

https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2016/12/161219115304.htm

And even if we were, I would only expect small hamlets at the most 12,000 years ago.

 which animals. well i happen to have the paper right here. http://www.exoriente.org/docs/00046.pdf

I didn't see any animals that should not have been there. Mind telling me which ones specifically?

 because apparently they would ruin the site. which is a ridiculous excuse.

It's not ridiculous. Ruins are not inherently stable to allow for excavation. That's why little work is conducted on the Great Pyramid of Cholula.

  and they dont know for sure its 28 thousand years old. they suspect it is.

Ah, there's the crux. So no actual hard evidence for the claim.

 ok so whats the supporting evidence that the pyramids were built when they say they were built?

Which ones? The Great Pyramids of Giza? My guess would be radiocarbon dates from activity areas that correspond to construction activities for the pyramids. Like charcoal from the hearts of the homes the workers were housed in.

 and no one is saying that this civilization was global. actually hancock never says much of anything about the civilization.

I thought that is what he talked about in Fingerprints. 

 gobecli tepe was the first strange find that doesnt fit the narrative.

You're right, it is odd. But it doesn't upend everything we know about the preceding period of human history. There's still no evidence of advanced civilizations in the Ice Age. What we do see are hunter-gatherers.

 you can believe that hunter gatherers built it alllll you want.

The excavators of Gobekli Tepi believe this and they excavated the site. Who is Hancock to come in and say otherwise? Especially when he does no excavations himself.

 ohh and the place in india isnt in india at all. Indonesia. gunung padang. thats my bad.

Oh yeah, that place. I've never been able to find an English article discussing the dating of the site. There are some articles in Indonesian, but I can't read that and don't know what they are saying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  poverty point doesnt have megalithic blocks with 3d relief. 

Mound A by itself is 238,000 cubic meters of fill. Do you think that is easy to collect, move, and construct? Easier than erecting a few megalithic blocks? Easter Islanders created a bunch of stone heads and moved them around their island, but no one is claiming they are a global civilization.

 i guess if you believe that hunter gatherers made it i dont know what to tell you otherwise. but its not a fact. its not backed by evidence. but im guessing you think it is.

What's the evidence? Where are the permanent settlements around Gobekli Tepe?

 no because it depicts the exact same symbolism. lots of the same animals are depicted there. animals that according to the current theory shouldnt have existed there at the time. unless they did exist there at the time and a cataclysm made them all go extinct.

Humanity has a fascination with animals. We use to live around them much more than we do now. How can you not depict animals in artwork? 

And which shared symbolism? And to who? Which animals shouldn't have existed at that time?  I'm asking because I want you to think about this

 nothing dubious about it. its there. and they know for sure that there is a chamber in the center of it. just like the pyramids of giza.

But where is it? Who is excavating it? And how did they arrive at their date of construction?

 ok but humanity doesnt live under water. where i just said the structures were found. from shore means water, not inland. im not even sure what you are trying to say tbh.

One of Hancock's ideas is that his supposed global civilization was wiped away when the ocean levels rose because they lived on the coast.

 ive heard this a million times. so and so are hacks because i dont believe their theory and they sell books. there isnt alot to cite because the work is slow to get done

What about in places where a lot of work has been done? He purposely avoids more recent published works on Tiwanaku, for example.

 both india and turkey dig teams keep getting blocked. 

By who? And for what reason? If someone found a 28,000 year old pyramid you should bet your bottom dollar they would get all the funding they need, exclusive publishing rights, and work towards turning the structure into a tourist attraction. Archaeologists scoop each other for small bits of research. Why would they not scoop someone for finding something so profound? Especially if it means securing tenure and funding?

 more and more mainstream scientists (not amatuers) are saying civilization is older than we thought.

Things about humanity are older, not civilization itself. Civilization implies a cohesive culture with identifiable material culture. Finding one site with early megalithic construction and another completely different site in which people used wild oats to make flour (for example) are two completely different and independant things. And I hate to say it, but unless these other scientists are archaeologists they really do not have the expertise or knowledge to make such a statement.

 im not really sure why people are so quick to dismiss this theory.

Because it isn't a theory, but a hypothesis with poor supporting evidence.

 but im willing to bet its because you let someone do you thinking for you as i said before.

Says the guy who is blindly following what Hancock has written. I always question what people have written. Even those in my own field. Even my own graduate advisor. It's good to question and it's good to test the evidence and hypotheses of authors. And frankly, Hancock's evidence and hypotheses don't hold up to scrutiny and question. That's why he creates his persecution complex by saying mainstream science wants to silence him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  gobekli tepe is 12000 years old at the least. and its a megalithic site.

Yes, but it is not a city nor is it even a town, village, or hamlet. The structures are ceremonial. And while it may have taken a lot of effort for hunter-gatherers or proto-agriculturalists to construct, creating large monument architecture is not impossible for hunter-gatherers. Poverty Point in Louisiana is a great example for this despite PP being earthen rather than stone blocks. The shear size and volume of PP is nothing to sneeze at.

 much of whats found there looks exactly like sites found all over the world.

How so? Because it is a building? Because people sometimes build round structures?

 india there is a massive pyramid buried that could be 28 thousand years oil. they are still diggin that one. cant remeber the name of it right now. 

Sounds dubious.

 in the same area there are structures 5+km from shore. places that were above sea level 12 thousand years ago.

Fun fact: humanity does not live exclusively by the coast. You cannot get all the resources you may need or want by living on the coast. That necessitates living inland. And if you have a massive global coastal civilization you're going to leave behind evidence of resource extraction in the interior. And frankly, there is zero evidence of that.

 before calling someone a hack (presumably because someone else does your thinking for you) maybe do some actual research.

Perhaps you should turn a critical eye towards Hancock's citations. He'll cite material from amateur archaeologists from the 1920s (out of date, poor methodology) or even travel pamphlets. Like I said, he picks and chooses his information to support his narrative. He's not a rebel trying to go against mainstream archaeology, he's a con man preying upon those that can be swindled into buying his books. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One I encounter a lot is people thinking the Maya civilization collapsed at the end of the Classic period (~900 AD) and the people who survived just sort of faded into the jungle.

The reality is that while there was a major socio-political upheaval towards the end of the Classic and into the Postclassic with cities in Peten region being abandoned, not all cities were abandoned. In fact, some Classic period cities grew in size and became regional centers in their own right. Or cities that were abandoned in the Early Classic were reoccupied at the end of the Classic/Early Postclassic. Some cities, like Uxmal and Mayapan, were constructed in the Postclassic with little to no Classic period roots.

When the Spanish came in the 1500s they hard a very difficult time pacifying the area. Because the Maya were just a collection of city-states rather than one single political entity, as soon as the Spanish conquered one city all of the nearby cities would rise up. Even formerly conquered places would rise up as soon as the Spanish moved. I think if Mayapan had not been abandoned in the 1480s because of a civil war between the Xiu and Cocom family, a much stronger resistance could have been made against the Spanish. Alas, we'll never know.

One fact I like to tell people who think the Maya were easily conquered or were just people eking out an existence in the jungle is that the last Maya kingdom to be conquered was not conquered until 1697. This kingdom, centered on the city of Nojpeten, was ruled by the Itza Maya. For decades they would routinely incite rebellion in Spanish controlled regions from their fortified island city in the Peten. The Spanish actually had plans to leave the Itza alone because they thought they would be too difficult to conquer. The Spanish had control of northern Yucatan and southern Guatemala and at the time saw no need to go further. Unfortunately a young Spaniard by the name of Martn de Ursa y Arizmendi wanted to relive the glory days of his conquistador ancestors. So he petitioned the crown to be allowed to make a royal road (camino royal) from Merida to Guatemala. When the Itza Maya and their allies attacked the road builders, Ursua used this as justification to begin a campaign of conquest. We could have had an independent indigenous state if it were not for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Maya as one of the earliest advanced civilizations (5000 years ago) 

They were still largely hunter-gatherers in 3,000 BC. What would constitute advanced to you at this point in time? I mean 3000 BC is before the Olmec even

 used Psilocybe mexicana

Sources?

 which they called teonanacatl (flesh of the gods)

That's Nhuatl, not Mayan. You know those are different languages, yeah?

 They also used Salvia and Morning Glory (known as ololiuqui).

Sources?

 While they knew about alcohol and tobacco, these entheogens were preferred and used more commonly.

Sources? Because the Maya loved alcohol and tobacco

 The aztecs did the same.

Sources?

 The Inca had Coca plants; they chewed the leaves to work for much longer and the messengers used them to travel much further to deliver the messages faster between cities. They also used Ayahuasca, but this was mostly only for the priests at ceremonies.

Again, sources? </TEXT>

* Excavations at Apatzingan, Michoacan Paperback  1947 by Isabel Kelly

* The Ancient Art of Colima, Mexico by Richard D. Reynolds

* Companions of the dead: Ceramic tomb sculpture from ancient West Mexico Paperback  1983 by Jacki Gallagher

It does, actually. What these researchers thought were twins were actually two different kids. Both of their genomes are present in Native populations and one of them was thought to have arrived later. The finding shows that it didn't arrive later, but is absent from northern populations likely due to migration and genetic drift which fits with current models.

	<TEXT> To copy/paste an answer I gave previously on /r/AskHistorians

 There's a number of factors that can contribute to this answer and the debate has raged on for 100 years. Factors such as population density and a dwindling food supply are often mentioned, but I am of the mind that it was the weather. Up until 12,000 years ago the climate around the world fluctuated from hot to cold and back again in intervals as small as a decade in some cases. This makes it extremely difficult to cultivate plants to grow in a certain climate if the climate is never stable. 12,000 years ago marks the Holocene and we have had a relatively stable climate that allowed people to settle down and begin farming. Whether that is, in fact, the case or not is still up for debate but the fact remains that people just were not able to farm before the Holocene.

 [Richerson, Peter J., Robert Boyd, and Robert L. Bettinger
2001, Was Agriculture Impossible During the Pleistocene But Mandatory During the Holocene? A Climate Change Hypothesis. American Antiquity 66(3):387-411.](http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/Richerson/AgOrigins_2_12_01.pdf)

To quote the source cited 

 "Might we not expect agriculture to have emerged in the last interglacial 130,000 years ago or even during one of the older interglacials? No archaeological evidence has come to light suggesting the presence of technologies that might be expected to accompany forays into intensive plant collecting or agriculture at this time. Anatomically modern humans may have appeared in Africa as early as 130,000 years ago, but they were not behaviorally modern. Humans of the last interglacial were uniformly archaic in behavior. Very likely, then, the humans of the last interglacial were neither cognitively nor culturally capable of evolving agricultural subsistence. However, climate might also explain the lack of marked subsistence intensification during previous interglacials. Ice cores from the thick Antarctic ice cap at Vostok show that each of the last four interglacials over the last 420,000 years were characteristic by a short, sharp peak of warmth rather than the 11,600 year long stable plateau of the Holocene. Further, the GRIP ice core suggests the last interglacial (130,000-80,000 BP) was more variable than the Holocene, although its lack of agreement with a nearby replicate for for this time period makes this interpretation tenuous. On the other than, the atmospheric concentration of C02 was higher in the three previous interglacials than during the Holocene, and was stable at high levels for about 20,000 years following the warm peak during the last interglacial. The highly continental Vostok site unfortunately does not record the same high-frequency variation in the climate as most other proxy climate records, even those in the southern hemisphere. Some northern hemisphere marine and terrestrial records suggest that the last interglacial was highly variable while other data suggest a Holocene-length period of stable climates ca. 127,000-117,000 BP. Better data on the high frequency part of the Pleistocene beyond the reach of the Greenland ice cores is needed to test hypotheses about events antedating the latest Pleistocene. Long marine cores from areas of rapid sediment accumulation are beginning to reveal the millennial scale record from previous glacial-interglacial cycles. At least the last five glacials have millennial-scale variations like the last glacial. The degree of fluctuations during previous interglacials is still not clear, but at least some proxy data suggest that the Holocene has been less variable than earlier interglacials." </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is very strong evidence for North-West Alaska being the initial entry point for humanity in to the Americas, people might not have walked and used boats instead though.

Yeah, that's not up for debate in archaeology. What is up for debate is timing and method of moving. As you said, boats may have been used.

 What are most probably arrowheads (too small for spear or javelin-heads) have been found, embedded in humans remains, around lake Turkana dating back to the early Holocene, pretty much around the initial migrations in to the Americas.

Turkana is a long way from the Americas. Evidence for the bow in the Americas first pops up just a few thousand years ago. Mesoamerica, for example, did not get the bow until sometime after 600 AD. That being said, smaller projectile points could be from atlatl darts or blowgun darts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you use social media other than Reddit, I just wanted to let you know that I will be sharing a new chapter of the Florentine Codex each day. I've never actually sat down and read the entire Florentine Codex, only parts. So I thought this would be a fun thing to add with the artifacts, news stories, and other things I share. Please excuse any typos I may have made copying the chapters. If you catch any, let me know.

So far, I've only done eighteen chapters from Book 1

	<TITLE> Twelfth Night Cake from from Richard Brigg's 1788 cookbook, "The English Art of Cookery." </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-28 14:57:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I follow the 18th century cooking channel on YouTube because I really enjoy seeing all those recipes from a few hundred years ago. I decided that for Christmas I would make the Twelfth Night Cake they featured in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DS1CQlacX2U) video.

The only things I changed from their recipe was not using citron and increasing the amount of candied orange and lemon by 1/8 of a cup as well as using a metal cake ring since I could not find a wooden one. I also baked the cake at an hour and a half rather than the two hours they needed with their wooden cake ring. I think I should have baked it for an hour twenty instead since the the bottom was a little brown and hard.

[This was the result](http://i.imgur.com/zhg1l9e.jpg). Unfortunately I did not snap any pictures of the inside. It was scarfed up at Christmas dinner by my family. They all said it was amazing and I agree, it turned out really well.

Recipe transcribed from the video,

1 pound butter

1/2 pound sugar

8 eggs, separated

3 cups flour

3/4 each teaspoon mace and nutmeg

1/2 cup brandy

1/4 cup each candied orange, lemon, and citron rind

1 cup slivered almonds

1 pound zante currants

Instructions. Get a partner to help

1. Get all your ingredients out on the table and ready

2. Line a 9 inch cake ring with buttered parchment paper on bottom and sides. Tie parchment to ring for the bottom if needed

3. Combine flour with mace and nutmeg

4. Combine currants, candied rind, almonds, and brandy

5. Cream butter, then add sugar and continue to cream

6. Whisk egg whites until stiff peaks form

7. Whisk egg yolks until thick

8. Combine creamed butter and sugar with whisked egg whites and yolks. 

9. Slowly add flour to butter and egg mixture mixing constantly until all the flour is combined

10. Stir in the sweetmeats

11. Bake at 350 F for about 80 minutes with a metal cake ring, 120 minutes for a wooden one

12. Remove from cake ring and let cool </TEXT>
