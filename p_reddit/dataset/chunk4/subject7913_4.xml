	<TEXT> No it's more the difficulty of the ancient dragon fight - it's a lot different than other bosses. But FYI the easiest way to run through dragon shrine is a combination of just running past enemies and poison arrowing the ones you can't sprint past. On the big stairway you can poison the 2 big guys and hide in the small entrance, and likewise you can pull the dragon warrior guys 1 at a time or poison them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I posted a similar question earlier and got some good responses and a link to the poise guide. Someone said a minimum 106 poise is a good standard, beyond that he argued for maxing out poise and using hyper-armor from UGS etc. Basically, saying that poise is most effective if you go all in, otherwise not so much. What do you think? And how significant is elemental resistances from armor in your opinion? </TEXT>

Apparently some kids we ran into at the park on base accused us of threatening them with knives. About 10 black SUV's rolled up, split us up, searched and interrogated us for about an hour (me in particular). At one point they brought the ringleader kid by in a vehicle and had him confirm I was the one who threatened him. I was about 10% pissed that the kid was playing games with military security and the other 90% grateful I was in the US instead of a country where I would have been thrown in a hole somewhere, guilty until proven innocent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's always going to be subjective of course. Examples of douchy behavior in my opinion: 1.Using Heal Spells/Estus in duels (no problem if invaded) unless your opponent has the same option (like dragon covenant etc.) 2. Starting a duel and then hiding etc. 3. A lot of people argue certain weapons/builds are unfair or OP but I try to just focus on learning to counter those tactics - most people who use cheap gimmicks will be rekt as soon as that 1 option fails. I find DS2 PvP overall is very balanced once you get the basics down and are familiar with most weapons capabilities. At this point I enjoy losing to a superior player more than defeating an average player. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been playing vanilla on PS3 since I bought the game about a year ago, co-op ranges from 'OK' to non-existent. I've been doing mostly SL150(1-3M SM) PvP on Iron Bridge last couple months with a little Arena (but screw Arena, douche central). 'Jolly Co-op' is harder to find than PvP in my experience. It's not terrible all the time though as most comments here on reddit suggest.
Edit: Btw, I have noticed that I am routinely paired with players who have DLC (I have none yet). I don't know if that means I'm being paired with SOTFS PS3 players or vanilla guys with DLC...or both. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some general advice that I picked up recently when I started focusing more on PvP: PvP success is mostly about timing, spacing, and knowledge/experience with your opponents weapons   techniques. What really helped me improve was focusing on using the same all-around effective weapons and improving those fundamentals and just getting used to different types of opponents. Oh and a quality build is a good first pick for dedicated PvP to use a test-pilot for various weapons. GL! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way I deal with him is just familiarity with his moves and dodging. This might be very difficult if you don't have high enough Adaptability. He also has high armor and HP, so you need a decently upgraded weapon - the longer the fight the more likely you are to make mistakes and get creamed.
