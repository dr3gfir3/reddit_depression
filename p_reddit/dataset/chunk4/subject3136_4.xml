	<TEXT> Aww I feel for you. That's rough. However, luckily you're still young and for now, just enjoy the time you do have with her. Make lots of memories so that you can look back on your first love years down the road and smile, knowing you made the most of it instead of wasting precious time stressing about it :)  </TEXT>
