	<TEXT> *Hey!* Malazan is cool! It has warriors and demons and undead armies and sword - wielding dinosaur and this *awesome badass* magic and this mage who makes things go BOOM and there's this guy who's live THOUSANDS of years and carries a BADASS sword (discover this shocking fact about Dragnipur- you won't believe what it does! Gods and mortals alike *hate* it!)

Oh, did I mention the climaxes? Everything is BOOM and SLASH and sad and GURGLE and LOLJK I BETRAYED YOU and all that good shit. The series is the best series I've ever read!!!

Did I mean mention there is an artist with a *frog* as a critic? Ha! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet

There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself. I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?

And it's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore

[4x:]
(Highs, highs, highs, highs,
Lows, lows, lows, lows)
Anymore

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter. It clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
