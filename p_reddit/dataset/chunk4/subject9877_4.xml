	<TEXT> Hey guys I'm looking to get a subaru jacket to compliment my girlfriends rem cosplay (luckiest guy in the world). However, I don't really fit into any of the sizes I'm 6 foot 2 and would love to know of any websites that have affordable custom sizes. Please guys would love to cosplay with my girlfriend and I know you guys would love to see a RemXSubaru couple ;)  </TEXT>
