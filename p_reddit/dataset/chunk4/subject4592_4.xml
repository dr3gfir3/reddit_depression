	<TEXT> They are not pro-life, hell they don't give a shit about abortions. It's just a highly visible issue that is easy to exploit for quick votes.

Because lets face it, everyone likes babies and everyone wants to protect them. 

Fetuses are sort of babies, so all you need are few lies to turn abortions from painful and mostly last resort procedure to billion dollar business and "life style".

If Republicans really cared about "life" they would support universal health-care, stricter pollution standards and sexual education.

But all they care about are votes and abortions are issue that requires almost zero effort to get votes from. 
You don't need policy, funding, knowledge or research.

All you need is to denounce "those baby killing abortionists" and cut funding to couple of projects. And boom, instant votes. </TEXT>

You don't like it here? Get out! We do not need you or want you.
People who carry islamic culture are a burden not a boon. As was proven by Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and many others.

There are tens of thousands of Vietnames in Czechia, they live here for a generation or less. And yet they are better integrated than muslims who live in France or Belgium for more than five decades.

	<TEXT> Frontex should stop migration and return migrants where they came from, if they fail to do that and instead break law and ship them to our coasts than they are all criminals.

Law is law for a reason, you can't just break it because you feel like it or because you want to be nice. If you do that the anarchy reigns and we can say goodbye to our society.

	<TEXT> Antisemitism was mainstream in almost entire Europe.

Take my grandmother for example, she lived in Nazi occupied country, looked Jewish, had Jewish name, her family was persecuted by local collaborator regime and yet she kept believing in the same anti-semitic bullshit for rest of her life.

To make things worse her husband was in Gestapo prison for years, had Jewish friend who lived with him after the war AND had his sister in law was death camp survivor.
Even grandfather survived just because his father concealed their ancestry.

And not even that was enough. I believe that if Germans didn't start that madness (Shoa/Holocaust) others would, maybe Polish or Soviets but someone would. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is kind of political minefield I'm afraid, especially for Swedes with their heavy handed PC culture.

On one hand you risk pissing off people who will gleefully chop your head off, on the other hand if you omit the religious dimension you are left with, not that much really.

For example say that the Paradox would implement similar events like Catholics have now for Muslims, the doctrine conflicts, the reformation (Ibadi, Sikhs), nations implementing their own versions of rites like Albania did or competing for access to Mecca.

Those are all easy to do but you run at real risk of pissing people off. People who are not above killing because of few pictures.


I don't think the Paradox staff/management is willing to take that risk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I did run some tests. If Ming gets development boost in key provinces, like those producing porcelain, tea or silk, the rebellions are not so devastating because loosing few provinces is not a terrible hit to manpower and income.

Even better is the fact that if mingsplosion does happen the new states have more money to build armies and to reunify the empire.

So yes, development boost does help. But it would have to be more like 100-200 development for it to work.

Still pretty historical. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is that we who have autism/aspergers have to learn that the hard way. Often we just have to figure things out because asking about this freaks people out. 

To make things worse lot of us pick wrong "weather" topics because we can not fathom why others wouldn't find them interesting.
For example trains, precambrian fauna or Starfleet organisation system.

But people don't tell us it bores them until they are already pissed, because they want to be polite. They just suggest or imply, which is not enough for someone like me, mostly. 

Anyway to make it short: Stuff about socialization that most people get naturally we have to learn as they would learn to read or, in some cases, solve systems of linear equations.  </TEXT>

Anyway I agree with your assessment. Ford judged humanity.
For decades he saw what are humans capable of when they "live without limits" he saw that no matter what they never change.

We do not know much about the world outside of the park but from what we heard it sounds suspiciously Brave New Worldlike.

Ford judged humanity, and he found it wanting.

	<TEXT> Well thats the thing. Either you have high birthrate or good sex education. 

Believe it or not most children used to be(are) unexpected and people who have them have almost no idea what they are getting into. 
People who think about having children have either none at all, due to them being too old, or they have just one or two, below replacement levels.

Basically the government has to choose between lots of teen/unadjusted moms and low birthrates.

	<TEXT> I know about these cases and I know they were real. I just find this one very strange because the way victim behaves.

One thing is being afraid of your captor, I get that. But at the same time writing book about it? And proclaiming publicly what happened and what your and his name is?

That does not fit the profile of a victim too scared to press charges.

Again I do thing that British police behaved/behaves reprehensibly when it comes to rapes and other crimes committed by Muslims.
And yes, I do believe that there are more scandals like Rotherham coming. 

But this one case seems very odd to me and looks more like a hoax than a genuine case of sex slavery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, but still better than Friesland or Provence.

The biggest problem with trade leagues is how limited they are.
At best they have 6 members before they stop growing, the pool of OPMs to choose from is also pretty small. 

For example, when playing as Ragusa one gets request to join from Memmingen or Ansbach, both of which are completely irrelevant to Ragusas trade nodes.

The north is even worse somehow. The Baltic falls to the Poland/Muscovy in less than five decades, most of the time anyway.
And if that was not enough there is constant threat of Netherlands minors annexing each other or being taken over by Burgundy/France.

If other states than just OPMs could join the problem would be solved, it would also help if the bonuses were greater or if vassals could join the leagues. But sadly Paradox just wants to buff kebab and baguette.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well the Hansa is kind of there with the trade leagues mechanic.
As for Austria, it is in the game files but only after the first start date, making it pretty much useless.

I made myself a mod putting the Ladislaus Posthumus in charge of rump Austria, with Bohemia and Hungary in PU, while his uncle rules rest of Hapsburg lands as emperor. 

It really changed balance of power, when Ladislaus survived the Styria got ripped apart with large part going to Bavaria/Venice.
Austria/Hungary/Bohemia became powerhouse of the empire and essentially took over Poland/Northern Balkans. 

It was fun.  </TEXT>
