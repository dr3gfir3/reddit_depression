	<TEXT> [comp] LF male Ralts near perfect breedjects

Gallade is my favorite and id really like to run the game with a solid breedject.  Im new to this game so I have nothing to offer in return, but I remember when I was team building in X/Y I would trade off my near perfect breedjects to beginners to try and give them a leg up, so I thought id at least try to see if anyone has some extras lying around!
