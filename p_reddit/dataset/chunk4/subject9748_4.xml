	<TEXT> I am in the middle of finishing a YA fantasy which is a beast at 125K words right now. Yikes! Using my 4-person critique group to help me tighten it up when I start revising. I love this new world so much but fear the world is competing with the story so need to balance that. But can't revise yet as I just finished my paranormal suspense novel this past week (that I started in NaNoWriMo) which is the 3rd in my Element Trilogy. Needed a push-start as my publisher wants it by May 30th. So 2.5 months to revise 110K words. Another beast! Fingers crossed! After that back to the YA fantasy. Lately, I've been doing a lot of 4am rising to get the words in. Does add up! I'm just not a night owl. Good luck everyone with your word counts!

	<TEXT> Good luck to you! Starting out smaller is a good way to jump in. Also, you may want to consider starting out with having some published for free (as many online mags don't pay) just to build your portfolio. A friend of mine did this with flash fiction. :) I know getting paid is wonderful, but with short mediums like this sometimes just getting pubbed in reputable small mags can boost you up for getting into bigger, paid ones down the line.  </TEXT>
