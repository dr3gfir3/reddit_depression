	<TEXT> I literally said punching then isnt going to do a lot of good.

But punching someone is dangerous in the sense that you could break someones nose, or crack a bone or something. White supremacy is dangerous in that it could create a nationwide movement that seeks to oppress, if not outright kill, non whites.

if punching neo nazis helped, I'd advocate for it. However, I think it generates more sympathy from people than anything else </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the main subreddits rule by consensus. thats the nature of a content aggregator site. If this were a traditional forum, without scores attached to posts, and listed by time of the comment being made, then it would seem less echoi chambery.

take /r/politics, for instance. the majority is democrats, because reddit is primarily used by people who typically are democrats. As a result, left leaning news floats up, right leaning news floats down. Every subreddit operates this way based on whatever the niche opinion of the day is. 

get to less populated subs, or subs without a culture of downvoting other opinions, and you will see that there is a diversity of opinions on reddit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She may be president now if Bernie didn't exist

Thats a shallow analysis of how we lost the election. 

That bernie did so well (who was the last far left dem to do so well in a primary) against Clinton (presumed the nominee before she announced) should have shown that there was a deep divide among americans over the direction the country should go. 

She lost because she offered little appeal to rural voters.  </TEXT>
