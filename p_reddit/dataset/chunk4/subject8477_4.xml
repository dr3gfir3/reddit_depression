	<TEXT> Perspective. I was born in '82. I know its not that long ago, but My views have changed so dramatically since I was in high school that I wouldn't be able to stand having a one-on-one conversation with past me. I value things like privacy, silence, open-mindedness in other as well as myself.

I guess I'm saying I appreciate what the accumulation of time and experiences have given me with regards to any bit of insight or teeny bit of wisdom that I have gained. I'm not sure what I would like to say is coming across clearly. Oh well. "Save" and hope for the best.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh! My reply was in regards to the content of my statement as to why I feel he should be labeled as such. So when you said what you said, I thought you were saying that you feel that it's OK for him to lie, cheat and be completely out of touch with the people he is trying to run the country for. Misunderstandings, right?  </TEXT>
