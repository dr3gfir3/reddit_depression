	<TEXT> The ROTC guy said that nobody had been in there for a while. There were a bunch of bunkers on campus that I believed fell into disuse and I think it might be an entrance. Looking back it was just a long hallway on the blueprints. Maybe it is though, but props to you for working in those places! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked as an intern for the Architecture and engineering department at uni and was assigned to work on a survey to make sure that the blueprints were accurate for every building. I get through maybe 80 percent of the work and then I have to go to the Army ROTC HQ on campus to do the survey. No big deal, everything in the office was correctly represented on the blueprints, but the guy working the desk told me that there was a hallway behind the office. So he takes me back there and opens the door to a hallway full of dust, cobwebs and high windows on the right that disappear a few feet in as the building is built on a hill. Dutifully, I go forward into the darkness. I can't remember if I didn't have a flashlight or what, but I went in there and all I could think was that I was going to find a body or something. So I just said that the blueprints were right and got the fuck out of there. Definitely something you'd see in a horror movie. </TEXT>

Does he give any justification for reducing them so much; it seems like the historic norm would be skewed by the fact that the population of the world and US was smaller and the size of the economy is now larger? Is there a precedent?  </TEXT>

Also the fact that blacks are incarcerated more and sentenced harsher than whites for the same crimes at least defends my stance on that.  </TEXT>

prejudice, discrimination, or antagonism directed against someone of a different race based on the belief that one's own race is superior.

You're right, a thing does not need to benefit society to exist. However, assumptions of capitalism assert that society will benefit in the form of the fruits brought by those who successfully foresee Adam Smith's invisible hand. Additionally, the justice system revolves around this notion of improving society; bring things to the masses cheaper, great, bring things to the masses that was before impossible, also great. Historically also, did Hitler improve society? What about Stalin? Pol pot? They didn't benefit society, but they existed. 


  I believe that this article is scratching the surface of your question: whether executive pay harms society. Do the firms actually impart value to the economy or society at large? Increasingly the answer is no. Did firms harm the economy after the 2008/9 collapse? Well, wall street is doing fine, but not main street so much, and that impairs the long term health of the economy. 

There are, additionally, historic examples. Rome before the empire, and the French monarchy. Rome, with senators who not only received a greater portion of voting power than their poorer countrymen, but also with estates as large as Georgia. There were a few civil wars before Augustus put the empire in power and killed all his opponents impunity. The French aristocracy was so wealthy that one Robespierre in a speech advocated that the French people forcibly take their fortunes. So, yeah,I think it's not good for the economy/society and that this happens naturally in the progress of a nation or state. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although profits have been economically insignificant in many large firms over the last 15 years, corporate executives' pay has still gone up. If a fundamental aspect of our assumptions on capitalism is that the market rewards those who impart an added value to the economy, then current research may make us reconsider how we view the rewards for those who are responsible for the firms. </TEXT>
