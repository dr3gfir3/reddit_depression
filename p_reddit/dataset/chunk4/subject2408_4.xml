	<TEXT> As a fan of the creator's other works, this is somewhat different. For one thing, it's more narrative focused than 5 cm or Garden of Words but it is kind of a sentimental melodrama. Imo, it uses some really hamfisted ways to make you feel sad and there's some plotholes but it's a worthwhile rom-com and not as full of pathos as Shinkai's other work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you guys like this movie, you should check out Makoto Shinkai's other movies. 5 cm Per Second is my favorite adn it's also his most well-received movie (it's not as well known as Your Name though). 

Your Name has some similarities with his previous work, mostly thematically and visually but it is a bit different from other movies I've seen by him, it's more mainstream, I guess you could say. Not to say that's bad, but his other stuff tends to be more mood-focused than character or story focused. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, this was a disappointing.

The world is actually pretty cool but the writing and the visuals are shit. The animators can't draw, the animation in the fight scene was shit and the colouring is ugly in a bunch of scenes. The music doesn't sound right either, like in the scene where they talk about the military's plans to let Kyoto get destroyed, it doesn't fit at all, it sounds like generic music from a video game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> going solely by quality

OPM, AoT and Your Name

there's several better shows that are less popular than all of these (Can't be sure about Madoka since I haven't seen it). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> one thing I'd forgotten about is how good the direction is.

Yeah, I love the direction in this show even though I don't really enjoy the plot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait, really? I'm kinda surprised hearing this because when I first got into anime, if a series had an English dub, I'd just watch that. The Eva dub is what changed me into watching subbed shows only. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't  really enjoy Eva the first time I watched it but I really loved the visuals and took a bunch of screenshots this time around that I was planning on posting here as an imgur album but didn't cause it breaks the illegal content rule (watermarks).

I really like the use of flat silhouettes in some of the shots. The backgrounds showing the city in the opening scenes are pretty neat,  the buildings are very lightly done (I can't come up with the words to describe it) they're pale grey looking and not very detailed which adds to the atmosphere in a way that I can't describe (again). This show's visuals are great though, both in their shot composition and framing and its use of colour. I really like the shot of Gendo and Shinji's first meeting, with Gendo in a tiny window of yellow light in the upper corner, far out of Shinji's reach and Unit 1's horn thing connecting him and Shinji. I was pretty dissapointed in the first Rebuild because it was a lot more generic (imo even kinda ugly) in terms of its visuals.

	<TEXT> Maybe they could loosely tie the skits together, or maybe improve or add to them like Nichijou </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, that was shit. The colouring is bland, the character designs are generic and I don't like the art style, the animation is kinda meh and the story seems generic.
There was literally nothing about this episode that got me hooked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, that's true but for shows that have long running source material, the 1 cour first season tends to be them testing the waters to see if it's profitable and then next season it's longer, like with Boku no Hero Academia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm  pretty sure his smelling power was used in the first season as well, in the woods when the female titan screamed and all the other titans rushed toward her. He smelled that titans were coming. He also sniffed Eren before the trial scene. </TEXT>
