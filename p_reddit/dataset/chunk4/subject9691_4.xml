	<TITLE> TIFU by spilling water on my motherboard </TITLE>

	<TEXT> EDIT:  We just turned my computer back on and IT WORKS!!! So happy!

This just happened like ten minutes ago.  I was playing LoL with a friend and decided to take a sip of water.  No big deal, right? Wrong.  I had put the top on my water bottle without screwing it on, so before I went to take a sip, I went to shake my water bottle (i don't know why, I just did.  Yes I'm weird, sue me.) and the cap came off and a little water splashed onto my freaking tower.  I waited a second because not that much water actually got onto my tower and I didn't know if it was that big of a deal.  It was.  Sadly, what water did fall onto my tower fell right on top of my motherboard...so my computer died. Now I have to wait like 3 days before I dare attempt to turn on my computer again.  Hopefully it's not dead because I really can't afford to get a new one. 

TLDR:  spilled a little water onto the motherboard of my computer.  It died and now I have to wait and see if it shorted everything. Woe is me.

	<TEXT> One time I put my wedding ring on our bathroom sink while I took a shower.  When I went to get it later, it was missing.  It turns out, my cat hopped up onto the sink, grabbed it, and carried it to the kitchen where she promptly threw it in her water bowl. Cats, man.... </TEXT>
