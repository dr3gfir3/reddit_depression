In west Philadelphia I was born and raised
On the playground was where I spent most of my days
Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
And all shooting some b-ball outside of the school
When a couple of guys who were up to no good
Started making trouble in my neighborhood
I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
She said, "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do your best to get a job and simplify your outgoing costs as much as you can. At your age, you need a cheap car and a good phone plan.

Pick between 4 and 10 local jobs to go for a week. Explain your situation to an employer and tell them you will work hard. Employers are people, and they hire people, not robots - so I'm sure an employer will give you a chance. 

Believe in yourself. Value each dollar in your wallet. </TEXT>
