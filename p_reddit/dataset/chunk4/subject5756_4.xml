	<TEXT> In my Kindergarten class, I probably do somewhere between 5-10 brain breaks in a day (we have full day Kinder).  I use it during transitions between subjects, and any time I notice them getting squirmy in their seats (which can be in the middle of a long lesson sometimes).  The website says they have brain breaks up to the 8th grade - you should definitely check it out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I adopted a rabbit from rabbitrescue.com a few years ago and it is a nice place.  They even have a set up outside for the bunnies to run around in with toys.  They do bunny matchmaking as well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished it today and enjoyed it.  I was extremely intrigued by the world the series created and even more so when I found out that Chicago was an experiment.  To me, Tris offering to go in Kaleb's place was foreshadowed in her previous sacrifices, but a sign of maturity and her nature as Abnegation like her parents.  She would not be Tris if she had let her brother die.  To be honest, I was also curious about whether or not she would be able to fight off the death serum.  She was stubborn to the end.  If Kaleb had gone instead, he would have died via death serum before ever pushing the button, and the sacrifice of his life would be for naught.  After she died, the dual narration all made sense and everything clicked into place.  It was well-written, in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As soon as Tenzin decided not to become a hostage, he sealed his fate.  The conversation Zuko had with Korra regarding what Aang would do in this situation was foreshadowing - he would do anything to protect the Air Nation.  Tenzin will most definitely give up his life to save the Air Nation and his family.  The Red Lotus are taking out leaders, so Tenzin fits that category as well.  Perhaps this turn of events is one of the reasons Nick doesn't want to air the episodes - too dark for the little ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having the child or having an abortion is your choice, but either way you need to get a divorce ASAP. If you have the child, the first thing you should do is file for sole custody. If your husband verbally abused you, it's very likely that he would do the same with a child.

Then tell your family everything. Under the given circumstances, they should be there to support and understand you. You have zero reason to do anything this man says. He has hurt you in so many ways and you owe him nothing but payback for how he mistreated you. You deserve so much better, but need to take action before you can get to that better place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a good explanation. For more information, look up Roberta Sparrow's book The Philosophy of Time Travel - it's a DVD extra and you can probably find it online too. </TEXT>
