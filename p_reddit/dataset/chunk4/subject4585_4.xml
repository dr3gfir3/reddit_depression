	<TEXT> It's been a while since rickun had any brotherly interaction. He's been wandering with some wildling bitch for so long so I'm glad that he's finally going to be able to play around with his new brother. Maybe some tag, or swordfighting with sticks or maybe feeding an ex to dogs. Ya know just good old fun </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's the level of gon and Killua around the end of greed island. He has atleast created a hatsu which gon and Killua had only did later in greed island. He's atleast that strong maybe stronger but no evidence for that yet  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that unless facing someone with extreme speed like Killua or neteros Buddha it's an instant win for shalnark if he uses autopilot with the command of pricking the other person. I think it's possible shalnark may turn into another knov. Someone who had an overpowered ability so togashi has to do something in order to make them unwilling or unable to fight </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bungee gum because it's the ability I respect togashi most for making. Any writer can give one of the strongest villains an OP ability but bungee gum is random as hell and is only good because hisoka. Unlike most shounen villains who's abilities make them strong hisoka makes this ability strong. It's a testament to how great nen is.

Manipulation:It has so many possibilities aside from controlling people that haven't been explored yet.

Specialist because I feel like it's a sell out. When people make their OC nen abilities specialist I feel like it's just cheating because they are too lazy or unimaginative to listen to normal rules of HXH so they have to use specialist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What combinations of character and nen ability would be the strongest? I don't mean "He's physically strongest so let's give him an already OP hatsu". I mean who would be able to use this already made ability best. An example would be Cheetu having knuckles nen loan ability because Cheetu is extemely speedy and hard to hit so no one could pay their loan back. Things like that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Name:PhaseBlade
Conjugation/Transmutation
Ability: you conjure a sword which has the ability to transmute to any material thus is able to phase through that material. An example would be if I swung at you while you wore armor and it phased to steel then it would pass through the steel unharmed and the only hit you inside the steel. 
Second ability: By transmuting to phase material, example would be dirt, you can add the length or size of the blade by passing through said material. Although after a certain time that material changes back to dirt or whatever and the blade goes back to normal. 
Restrictions:In order to change material you have to yell the name of thay material and atleast 1 person has to hear you excluding yourself. 
For as long as you have the sword conjured then that's how long you have to go without it. Example: would be keeping the sword out for an hour. Once you put the sword away then you have to wait another hour to summon it. 
When you add size or length to your blade by taking another material it will only stay that length for a minute </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came up with this the other day and you can use and improve upon it. Transmuters your nen into a gas muscle relaxer and number. Or you can transmute to a muscle stimulater, partially enhancer.  Both of these gases don't have any affect on you but by only a touch on a persons skin it can make them useless. An example of how this is helpful would be if you're fighting gon and he uses jajanken while you can't dodge. Block while coating your arms in muscle relaxer so after his attack he can't use that arm anymore. Change it to however you see fit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Quirk: Holes on the soles of feet and palms of hands. Can suck in air and then fire it to push back enemy or oneself. One cool way to fight would be to have both arms full of air, have your right hand palm up and shoot a small stream of air. The other hand shoots air at the other  stream to make it curve around his fist. Would basically make a continuous air force field around the first. wouldn't work irl but hell its an anime who cares.

	<TEXT> I completely agree, I feel alone about this but HXH fights are great partially because of the building and they aren't thrown around like normal shounen. I'm sure togashi did this for a reason and it'll come full circle and will be great but I was disappointed. I personally would rather  have to wait until DC is over and we can get a good chapter or two of what leads up to this fight.  This fight has been super hyped except right when it happens. It was sudden. Although I definitely am excited for the fight  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It isn't much more controllable but when looking at the post about the skype chat they said they are getting too many people, 60 or so,  to control well. I just wanted to use this chat to help with excess people who weren't able to get into that chat.  Also kik Chats have a maximum of 50 people and they have to be invited to join so it would be easy to control the influx of people from the start. If everyone is content with that Skype chat then that's fine, kik isn't a big deal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think when the story focuses on gon again he'll have gotten his nen back and have a whole new power that's almost impossible to control. Something with hard backlash like how midoriya, boku no hero, body can't handle the power of his punches. It'll be something difficult to control. But he needs a new technique for sure. Look at Killua, he was able to fend off youpi for some time even though he wouldn't have won that fight.  Aside from adult gon, Killua is leagues ahead of gon so he needs a new power to level things out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen that there's a skype group for hunter X hunter but it seems to be overrun and hard to control. This post is asking the question of whether or not y'all would like another chat on maybe kik rather than Skype. Basically you'd be able to talk about anything HXH or anime related and can test out posts before you post something stupid by accident. Even discuss nen abilities or theories. If you'd be interested in something like that then say so.  If I get a bunch of responses then I'll post my kik later on or have y'all post your kiks and I'll follow up on you. Either way is fine. Have a nice day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This thread probably isn't active anymore but I'm still gonna try.

My three traits are strategic, nihilistic and helpful. 

My favorite character is either Meruem or Leorio.

My nen type is manipulation on the quiz but you have creative Liberty so do as you like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have manipulator and I would manipulate position. 
Summary: So basically when my nen touches something im able to switch it with anything of equal size for 15minutes, after that the nen is reset. If I wanna put a full human where a box is I could use excess air around the box to make my nen be big enough to switch the human with the box and that air. Max amount of "items" my nen can keep contact with is 25.

How to use: I would use throwing knives with my nen on them to spread my nen to places out of my reach or hit enemies without getting close.

Special abilities: Gods World is where I use En,  you'd want en about the same size as nobunagas atleast, and basically I can switch the positions of myself or anything in my circle of en with anything in my circle. This can only go on for about 3-4 minutes. If someone were to charge me while I have gods world, the second they step inside my en I could switch them with the air beside me and attack on my own terms.

Positives: works great when with a group. If you have touched your friends you can move them to attack or away from danger like pieces on a chess board. Teamwork is golden. Also once you get the upper hand, nen on the enemy, it's basically a win. Great support skill.

Negatives: Extremely weak against quick people and one on one fights. If the enemy is faster than the user then they can stay away from your Gods world and easily dodge throwing knives. It eats up aura quickly if you are keeping tabs on multiple objects.
