Business if definitely a much bigger jump than Economy to Premium Economy. Get beds for starters, a la carte menu etc, priority bags, lounge, fast track blah blah... Totally not worth the money. Would never pay that myself, but if my company does, I won't complain. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're moving from the US? If you want to maintain standard of living I wouldn't aim for any less than AED 30k per month, especially if you have family. That's also assuming you don't have to pay any tax back in the US. (I'm from UK, where we don't have to, but you may be different). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They used to do it in the good ol' days because people would illegally record songs off the radio onto tape. Having it interrupted is kind of like watermarking it. Often there's a station jingle several seconds into the start or end. This is a bit of free advertising if it gets ripped off and shared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Echoing what others have sai;. Dubai totally open. Corporate wear will be fine. The only possible cultural thing to be aware of is physical contact between genders. If they are obviously another westerner, fine to shake hands, but if you are dealing will locals, it's more polite to not offer your hand. If you do, they may or may not shake hands which could be awkward if they don't, and if they do, they will most likely be feeling very uncomfortable with it.  
Have a great time here! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Probably get downvotes for this. But shouldn't the drivers be going slower as to be able to avoid accidents, specifically in those conditions? Imaging it was a kid in the road rather than a truck. I'd be mad if the guy was driving so fast that he couldn't stop in time. Over a hill? can't see the other side? Ice? Slow the hell down! Why didn't the cameraman go down the road to warn people to slow down? </TEXT>
