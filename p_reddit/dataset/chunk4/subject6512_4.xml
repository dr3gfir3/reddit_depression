Check out https://privacytools.io/ to see which tips work for you.

Use the add-ons [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock#installation) and [Privacy Badger](https://www.eff.org/privacybadger) to block trackers. Use [HTTPS Everywhere](https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere) to force a secure connection when one is available.
If you have an Android phone or tablet, you can use [Firefox for Android](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/android/) as a browser, which is compatible with the add-ons I mentioned.

	<TEXT> No, not really. Privacy Badger is designed to only block (ads with) trackers, not ads (without trackers). I just support [EFF](https://eff.org/) and their work which is why I mention it. And for the people who do wish to view non-tracking ads, but do want to browse without being tracked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thinking out loud:
Ghostery is proprietary and has opt-in tracking of its users. Privacy Badger is open source and built by the [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/). Based on that, I would pick PB.

And the goal of PB is to block trackers, not to block ads. It doesn't block ads that don't track you, or at least that's the goal. Ghostery does block (some) ads. 
If you wish to support the sites you visit and agree with he display ad business model, PB may be the one for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, it's not just your search history. It's everything you do online that's being tracked through DoubleClick, Google Analytics, Google+ share buttons, etc. And that's just Google.
All that information is being used to make assumptions about you to target ads, to personalize search results, etc.

The privacy breach starts at the point of collection. Merely collecting it and storing it puts you at risk. Making assumptions about you puts you at risk. That information can be exposed through a hack, a leak, a rogue Google employee, a government request for data, etc.

I don't know how it affects you personally because I know nothing about you, and I don't know if you're of interest to Google, a government, or some other entity or adversary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Knowledge is power. Knowledge about you is power over you.

You don't know exactly what they collect and store about you. You don't know if it's accurate or false. You don't know who has access, whether within the company, their partners, or through hacking or leaking. You don't know which decisions are being made about your life outside of your control.

We already know that we don't all pay the same price for the same thing. If you're trying to buy a plane ticket online, the same trip will cost you more if you order it from an iPad than if you order it from an Android device. Age, sex, location, estimated income, political affiliations, etc. all influence how your online environment is shaped around you, for better or for worse.  
  
Now, this might all not matter to you. That's fine. If you're a white adult male in a western country with no clear political motivation, and you don't work in politics, in market regulation, as a journalist, as a doctor, are not (chronically) ill, don't have a substance addiction or other mental health issues, etc. and never will, you'll probably be fine, right? Wrong. Society changes around you and even your currently innocent attributes and predilections may be judged differently and cause problems for you. Who knows where you will be in life in 20 years? Who knows what society will be like? Who will be in power?

Imagine you're a gay man in an African country where homosexuality is against the law. Suddenly liking Britney Spears on Facebook can become evidence that may be used against you.

And even if you trust the current leadership at Google and Facebook, you don't know who will be at the helm in 10 years. They may go bankrupt, and the current practice with bankruptcies is to auction off any customer data they may have to the highest bidder. They ~~may~~ **will** get hacked.  
  

There is now a permanent record of us entertaining new thoughts, trying new things. We can no longer form our thoughts in private, experiment without being held accountable.

And as /u/skyroket notes, governments love this treasure trove of data. And not just the governments you deem benevolent and trustworthy.

	<TEXT> In remote areas it will probably not be cost-efficient to have high capacity vehicles. In cities and suburbia people may prefer smaller capacity vehicles and pay accordingly.  
  
Smaller vehicles are more efficient in getting people from door to door. Otherwise you're either taking groups on huge detours, or they have to disembark at fixed points, like busses do now.  
  
A pod-like system is more efficient. 2 or 4 person pods can join up with other pods to form a train when they're going the same route over a highway, but split up to get individuals and small groups to their destination in suburbs and cities.

Highways would still be needed, but 8 lanes would be a bit much, yeah. </TEXT>

From anonymized statistics on our website we know that Tails is used by around 18 000 people every day. If each of them gave 12, the price of a USB stick, our budget for the whole year would be raised within one day. As you can see, funding Tails through donations is a realistic and our budget ridiculously small compared to the multibillionaire companies and agencies running the surveillance business.

In that paragraph they [link to this](https://tails.boum.org/support/faq/index.en.html#boot_statistics):

**Does Tails collect information about its users?**

When Tails starts, two HTTPS requests are made automatically to our website through Tor:

A security check is performed to know if security issues have been announced for this version of Tails. The language of the working session is passed along with this request to display the notification in the preferred language of the user.
Tails Upgrader checks for newer versions. The version of the running Tails is passed along with this request.
We believe it is important to notify the user of known security issues and newer versions. We calculate statistics based on the security check to know how many times Tails has been started and connected to Tor. Those statistics are published in our monthly reports. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> r/privacy has nearly 70,000 subscribers, but there are orders of magnitude more people on Facebook, Instagram, Yahoo and whatnot who are either completely oblivious to being tracked and surveilled or simply don't care.

I believe it's wrong to assume that everyone who uses those services isn't aware of the implications for their privacy, or that they simply do not care.  
  
Caring about your privacy doesn't mean you have to stop using any of those services. Privacy is about deciding for yourself who you share your information with. If they choose to use Facebook and are comfortable using it even while knowing (insofar as anyone can know) what they are doing with your data, it cannot be taken as a sign that they simply do not care about privacy or surveillance.  
  
Then there's the problem with people being weak and dependent on their social ties. They are hostages of those platforms, because they value keeping up with friends and family over using other, less infringing platforms. They can both care and not leave Facebook.  
  
Awareness is spreading, legislation is getting better at catching up ([in Europe at least](/r/europrivacy)), and thanks to Snowden journalists no longer have a hard time selling stories with a privacy angle to media.  
  
Change is hard to see because it moves at a glacial pace. That doesn't mean it's not happening.  
  
A few days ago I talked with two subscribers of [my sub](/r/europrivacy) who just started caring about their privacy. Over the summer they had each watched Citizenfour and subsequently decided to change their habits: new OSes on their devices, use of privacy protecting add-ons, reading up on the state of privacy in their respective countries, etc.  

It started three years ago, yes, but we are still seeing and feeling the effects of the Snowden revelations today. Journalists are *still* working on new stories based on his docs.  
  
Cheer up, and try to see the changes.

	<TEXT> Because of a possible ad block / pay wall issue, I have quoted the full piece here:

WIRED OPINION
ABOUT
Mathematician Cathy ONeil (@mathbabedotorg) is the author of Weapons Of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy.

---

THE AGE OF Big Data has generated new tools and ideas on an enormous scale, with applications spreading from marketing to Wall Street, human resources, college admissions, and insurance. At the same time, Big Data has opened opportunities for a whole new class of professional gamers and manipulators, who take advantage of people using the power of statistics.

I should know. I was one of them.



In 2007 I was a hedge fund quant, working at D.E. Shaw. I was trained to anticipate what others would do so I could do the opposite. It was my profession to game the system. Was this stock just mentioned on TV? Bet on the bounce. Are mutual funds forced to true up their accounts by the end of the quarter? Bet on the market impact of their predictable trading. Is everyone using the same risk model? Anticipate the outcomes. There was money to be made finding patterns and exploiting them, some of it coming from pension funds and 401Ks, other from nameless and faceless heaps of international wealth. We thought we deserved it because we had the technology and because we were faster and better with numbers. It was never about market efficiency; it was dumb money versus smart money, and we took advantage whenever we could.

This behavior is by no means unique to finance. One of the early, influential algorithms is the college-ranking model from U.S. News   World Report. In fact, its been so influential, the role of many college administrators has gradually changed from improving academics to improving their colleges ranking, whatever the cost. And since the U.S. News model doesnt track cost, the more the model is gamed, the more expensive colleges become. Over time the widespread gaming has led to outrageous tuitions, bloated administrations, and the death of the safety school, since high rejection rates are bad for rankings. The pool of high school kids hasnt changed, but the system is in an arms race of prestige.

More recent big data college algorithms work on an individual student basis. Inside the college, admissions offices use algorithms that weigh each student on likelihood of acceptance and financial aid requirements. Outside the college, professional consultants charge parents more than $25,000 to help their child get an offer from, say, NYU based on predictive algorithms. Again, an expensive arms race, and the victims are the lower- and middle-class students who cannot afford either college or the college-admissions process.

Information is power, and in the age of corporate surveillance, profiles on every active American consumer means that the system is slanted in favor of those with the data. This data helps build tailor-made profiles that can be used for or against someone in a given situation. Insurance companies, which historically sold car insurance based on driving records, have more recently started using such data-driven profiling methods. A Florida insurance company has been found to charge people with low credit scores and good driving records more than people with high credit scores and a drunk driving conviction. Its become standard practice for insurance companies to charge people not what they represent as a risk, but what they can get away with. The victims, of course, are those least likely to be able to afford the extra cost, but who need a car to get to work.

Not all gaming involving big data is so obvious. Sometimes what looks reasonable on the outside has an exploitative underbelly, and sometimes the gamers arent totally aware of their gaming. Consider online personality tests, which are required of more than 60 percent of prospective American workers. The tests themselves are hard to game: They ask questions that dont have obvious answers, and the prospective employees never learn their scores. And if job applicants fail the test, they never get called back for an interview.

Now consider the perspective of the employers who use such personality tests to filter their hires. The tests are cheap, and they save tons of money in human resource hires, but they are also almost entirely opaque. In other words, the personality test is treated as a money-saving black box, but its not clear what that black box is actually doing, and whether using it constitutes discriminatory hiring practices. Seven companies who used a personality test by the big data company Kronos are being sued for that reason; the lawsuit charges that the test constitutes a mental health exam, which is illegal under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Big data profiling techniques are exploding in the world of politics. Its estimated that over $1 billion will be spent on digital political ads in this election cycle, almost 50 times as much as was spent in 2008; this field is a growing part of the budget for presidential as well as down-ticket races. Political campaigns build scoring systems on potential votersyour likelihood of voting for a given party, your stance on a given issue, and the extent to which you are persuadable on that issue. Its the ultimate example of asymmetric information, and the politicians can use what they know to manipulate your vote or your donation.

After the movie Wall Street came out in 1987, some people thought of Gordon Gekko as a villain, while others considered him a role model. The same dual promises exist in the current world of Big Data, where smart money armed with big data continually searches for opportunities to exploit dumb moneyincreasingly, individuals, swing voters, and even democracy itself. As long as the public trusts in the objectivity of statistical models, and as long as they remain intimidated by them, such opportunities will likely continue.

In 1954, Darrell Huff wrote a neat little book called How To Lie With Statistics, a how-to guide for marketers to mislead and manipulate people into believing just about anything with the right graphic and the well-placed stat. Computationally speaking, weve come a long way since 1954, but in one important way nothing has changed. Theres enormous opportunity for manipulation in big data, and we need to remain skeptical and vigilant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Edit: Ik moet wel zeggen dat al vooraf de opdracht geven "Geen van de kapers moet overleven" wel vrij bruut is.

Precies. Dat er geweld mag worden gebruikt, en zal worden gebruikt valt te verwachten. Dat er expliciet de instructie wordt gegeven dat de gijzelnemers liever dood dan levend eruit moeten komen is van een heel andere orde. Dan kom je in de sfeer van buitenrechtelijke executies. </TEXT>

I agree that you're best off with trying to keep your data out of their hands, but they will still collect, receive, and store data relating to you even if you're not a customer.

	<TEXT> De Stichting Vrienden van de PVV ontving vorig jaar ruim 108.000 dollar van het rechts-conservatieve David Horowitz Freedom Center (DHFC) uit Californi. Dat meldt het FD. Dat is flink meer dan het jaar daarvoor. In 2014 ontving de PVV een kleine 20.000 dollar van het Center.  
 
De donatie van 108.000 dollar werd aan het begin van 2015 in drie termijnen in de stichtingskas van Wilders gestort, zo blijkt nu uit de jaarrapportages van de politieke partijen. Die werden vrijdag openbaar gemaakt door het ministerie van Buitenlandse Zaken. Giften van meer dan 4500 euro moeten door de partijen aan het ministerie worden gemeld.
