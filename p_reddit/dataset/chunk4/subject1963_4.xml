	<TEXT> My fianc would switch off calling me fianc and Beyonc. Like we would say something about it and say Beyonc and I wasn't sure if I heard him correctly, so I'd ask him to repeat it and then he called me his fianc. Or vice versa. He did this for at least two months. I thought I was hearing things. And that's why I'm marrying this asshole.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That show is so. Fing. Funny. I'm a nanny to three kids, two of which are young girls (3 and 7). At first I was like "ugh this is kind of ditzy" but then I started listening in a little more. Oh my god. 

People, please. Watch this with any young people in your life. Half of the jokes are for the grown ups and there are some seriously good messages that are tucked in carefully and don't feel all after-school-special-y like some kids shows. I will willingly watch this show with the kids now. I'm 25. No shame.  </TEXT>

FH and I are getting married in SoCal, very laid back wedding up a mountain, a whole weekend with our closest family and friends. We'll likely have 65 in attendance also, and I also think a photographer is super super important!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Isn't it?? It's exactly what we wanted, without having to drive 6+ hours into the redwoods to get the feeling of woodsy greatness. And yay for SoCal! We're lucky that all of our friends and family, except for two or three exceptions, are within two hours of each other. The others are either in Nevada (stepsiblings that would undoubtedly travel down) or Arizona (step cousins and their kids that would probably come out for a day or two). So not far.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of those lines sound pretty much perfect. And you're very right about being a team and setting boundaries. I think it's a more straightforward conversation than FH wants to have about his mom and her involvement but he's going to have to deal with it if he doesn't want me to be a grumpy jerk for the next year.

And you're also right about what's big stuff and what's little stuff. I think setting the boundaries clearly and nice and early will help with the little stuff, too. We just need to be more firm. And I need to be more firm with FH too and let him know that I won't allow him to drag his feet on all of this because it affects me more than it affects him. I think he's just underestimating what these things mean so far. I told him his mom wanted the guest list and my mom wanted a room list (less than 12 hours after we last saw them!) and he was like "so what? just send her the list?" and insisted that he didn't think she'd want to make any changes. I literally sent him the text about her "tweaking" it and he was like "Oh, well she probably just wants to check it, not tweak it." He has a hard time believing she's ever in the wrong and he misses all of the snarky comments she makes towards me so it's hard because I am not going to let her "win" this. But I'm also not willing to be a doormat and just let everyone trample me. He's going to have to get on board, and maybe with a stronger explanation, he'll get it. 

Thanks for also admitting I'm being neurotic. I feel like a total fucking basket case right now. Must. Set. Boundaries. Big ones. With FH fully on board. Thank you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the advice. I've already tried the 'Thanks, but' line with planning and it hasn't obviously gone so well as it's only gotten worse, but I think I have a way to handle that now. You made a good point about letting people know or just not doing that. We're busy people so after an initial meeting saying "hey, we need your help with X Y Z and thats it" we can say "oh! We already made that decision and it's done and paid for!" 

Second person to tell me vendors have already had to deal with this stuff all the time. Feels good. I keep mistakenly thinking that they're not used to crazy parents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. I know the money thing is actually the smallest problem - I don't really think that any of the parties except for my dad are giving really super conditional financial contributions, I just know they'll whine about it. I care less about the whining and complaining than I do about that initial meeting, which actually sounds like a good idea. Less confrontational in a way than just sending an email or text out of the blue. FH and I can sort of have our "script" of things we are going to say, letting them know how things will go and what exact things we want their help on, focusing on the positive. I know there will be grumbling. I'm just not looking forward to saying it to their faces and I know I have a tendency to be a more than a little blunt, and I don't want to set off any alarms with them. I just need to find a way to make it as non-offensive as possible while also telling them they can take their ideas and shove them where the sun don't shine. 

FH and I are in counseling already for something else, but I didn't even think about using that tool to work through the parents issue. I have a hard time telling him "your mom is overstepping her boundaries" because in a more traditional family, which part of his is, that's all normal behavior. Parents get to tweak guest lists and make big decisions and the couple just has to deal with it. I am not part of that school of thought so it's going to be a little shocking to them, which I'm dreading, but I am not letting this go down like this. I'll probably even suggest that FH has to be the one to do most of the talking at that meeting, because she'll listen to him more than she'll listen to me. (She's given almost imperceptible hints during the last four years that she doesn't really like me, never when other people are around. I have only ever been nice to her and I've done everything I can to not let her bad attitude affect his relationship with her)

I just texted FH and told him that I'm having reservations about the way our mothers expect to be involved with planning and that there will need to be changes. He texted back with a little resistance and a sort of sarcastic comment, and I let him know that I will not let one person's financial contribution dictate the way our wedding goes. And that if she insists that we go her way or the highway, I would willingly choose the highway and elope rather than take money and make it go towards a wedding I don't agree with. He turned around quick. We're going to discuss our options tonight and come up with specific things that we *really, really* need our moms help on that are enough that they feel they're needed but small enough that I don't care if they royally screw up. 

Good call on parents not meeting vendors anymore. And good call on contacting the venue owner. I sometimes get this wild idea in my head that my family is so fucked up that I can't tell other people things because they'll think I'm weird. I had this idea that they owner would think I was a total bridezilla control freak already if I sent him this. Now that you mention it I'm sure he's probably had to deal with many overbearing parents. I'll send that out today before it's too late. 

Also good call on the guest lists spots. The only one concerned with the guest list is FMIL so maybe when I send her the list, because I know I'll have to at some point, I can put in a little note that, hey, surprise, we have a tiny bit of wiggle room and that if there are four people she'd like to invite, we have room for that, but no more. 

alsjkflasdjlkasjlfakjsdlf Thank you for your advice. I'll keep all of that in mind while formulating a plan.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We sort of stumbled onto it online - I had been looking at all kinds of blogs full of weddings for anything woodsy in Southern California. I realized later on that three of the eight I saved were from the same place. We took a look at two other venues way back in January, but didn't fall in love with either of them. We knew we had to see this place, and we got crazy busy in spring and summer this year, so it took us months to get out and see it. Just do a search for "wedding" + "your area" + "woodsy/outdoors/camp/whatever keywords you want" and look specifically for posts from wedding blogs - we loved Green Wedding Shoes!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm a minor league poster over at r/weddings. FH is 28, I'm 25F, we've been together almost five years already and are doing okay financially. We're both smart, detail-oriented, and laid-back. But wedding planning is starting to make my neurotic - not because the actual planning is stressful, but because we have four sets of divorced and remarried parents to contend with, all of whom have different ideas of what we should or shouldn't do with our wedding. I feel like I'm crying out of nowhere all the time and I am usually a strong-willed person but I'm so anxious and I don't know how to do this right. I've had some issues with FH and I's four sets of parents that I've posted about on r/weddings and I'll summarize here: 

My mom + her boyfriend: Mom and I did NOT get along well until well after I moved out of her house. Mom is borderline unstable and a raging narcissist. She's gotten MUCH better in the almost five years I've been out of the house, and her boyfriend helps her chill out, but she's still a pain at the best of times. Everything is about her all the time, and if she's not front and center, she's throwing a fit about it. She has already made me feel bad because she thought SHE would be walking me down the aisle in lieu of my father doing so. This is the woman who threw me out of the house upwards of twenty times during my teenage years for as little as not doing the dishes one day. I told her my sister would have that honor (I've told her this before but she conveniently forgot) and she actually thought she would be the one to do it. Nope. I won't get into details but I don't want to be 'given away' by a woman who basically disowned me multiple times and was physically and emotionally abusive for years. She's better now but that doesn't erase the things that happened. Healing will take many, many years. Not thirteen months. 

My dad + stepmom: My dad is a flake, and a liar. Always has been. He and my mom divorced about five years ago and within a year or two he was remarried. He has basically shown little interest in the lives of my sister or I since he left, I haven't talked to him in almost six months now, except to text him on Father's Day to see if we could make plans. He never texted back. He's busy with his new family, but I know he still expected to be part of the wedding, which will not be happening. He does not make an effort, and neither does his new family. That's their choice. They have two daughters that, initially, my sister and I really got along with. They have also stopped making an effort to see us, even going so far as staying upstairs and not even coming to say hi the last few times we went to my dads house, which is two hours away. I know it's because my dad's a habitual liar and would rather make up lies about my sister and I than admit he's being a shitty dad. He offered to pay for my wedding dress, "any dress you want!" then backed up to say "well, I'll only pay for your dress if you get it made by this seamstress I know that can sort of copy designs" (I've seen their work, it's okay but not what I want for my wedding. Think poofy quinceanera dresses and bright white fabric). Then back pedaled even farther to say they were having financial troubles, he was laid off (he got fired), they wouldn't be able to contribute. Fine. i wasn't expecting anything from them. But then he went and bought a new car and a new TV and pretended that they bought both of them with his wife's tax returns. Yeah. $25k in tax returns. I'm sure. I know he's in debt and I never expected any kind of contribution because he's basically just out of the picture now. He won't be walking me down the aisle. His daughters, who I once thought would be my bridesmaids, now don't even care enough to say hi. 

FMIL and her husband: FStepFIL is a cool old guy, a little traditional/conservative but wouldn't dream of imposing that on our wedding. FMIL is a different story. She loves the idea of our wedding so much that she basically wants to plan the whole thing herself. She overstepped yesterday and paid for our deposit on our venue knowing full well that that's something that FH and I wanted to do and that we had plenty in savings to be able to do it. The other day, she was supposed to meet FSIL for dinner (FSIL and her fiance live in the same building as FH and I). This was the night before our venue visit. FH and I were cooking a nice meal together, having a "date night in", drinking wine, about to watch a movie. FMIL calls and insists she has some paperwork that she has to bring over that night, it cant wait until the morning. (It's car registration, it can't be done in one day or on a sunday anyway.) But she nudges her way into our house, then asks FH to get something from his car (that, again, "can't wait", even though there's no way she can take it where it needs to go that night). Then she has the nerve to make comments about our dinner, and how good it smells, and how she wants to stay. There's only enough for two. Sorry. I already had to change into presentable clothing in my own house when it's 95 degrees so you could barge in. She then admits she's an hour early, that she was hoping she could just hang out here and, I quote, "watch us eat" while she waits. She can't. I'm going out with my sister after dinner/movie so I'm on a deadline and there's no way we'd be able to have date night if she stayed. Luckily, FH finally picked up on the frustration and realized he had a key to his sister's apartment, where he let FMIL in and told her she could wait there, but that we were busy. This is not the first time she's pulled something like this, not by a long shot. 

FFIL and his wife: The most logical, sane group of the bunch. Less outdoorsy than the rest, but totally all about our vision for our wedding, supportive of FH and I, non-confrontational, and understanding of every single thing we've told them so far. (For example, FstepMIL has a HUGE family three hours south of us. Our venue is about an hour north of them. I don't keep in close contact with all of them, maybe three of the smaller family units. When she asked which of them I'd be inviting, I carefully said I'd be inviting only those who I spoke to regularly, and that our wedding would be small, so we couldn't invite nearly all of them. Knowing my mom and FMIL, I was expecting resistance, but she just went "Oh, that makes sense. I can probably even guess who it is." And she was right and that was that.) 

Now, we're in Southern California - by no means a capitol of by-the-book traditionalist wedding planning. Every wedding here has something different, and that's great for FH and I because we are not simple or traditional by any means. We're lifelong scouts and campers, we love the outdoors, we would rather spend a month camping under the stars than at a fancy resort. We're doing okay financially, we have very little debt and are saving for our wedding at a significant pace. Our budget is around $20k, including our own contributions, which is awesome. We have quite a bit of play room here. We knew we didn't want a single day event, so we searched for seven months for our perfect venue. 

We visited it yesterday, and we loved it. It's perfect. It's pretty freaking rustic, the property is 128 years old and has been passed down through generations to the current owner and his wife. They're super sweet, majorly helpful, and we got to tour almost all of the property on a beautiful summer day. There are something like 10 cabins and lodges to rent, one big main house (three floors, sleeps 19!), a big old dance hall/soda fountain/general store/old post office, etc. The place is so charming it's actually painful. It's a full four day rental so we can spend quality time with the people we love most. We booked it on the spot for September 9th, 2017! And then the problems began. 

From the start of the meeting yesterday, MIL and mom took over. We could barely get a word in edgewise. They were talking about sailing and family vacations, and about us right in front of us. FH is a little quiet, and I could tell he felt a little off too. I am not normally a quiet or shy person by any means but I was more excited to see the venue, so I just let them do their thing. But we go on the tour and the whole time my mom is making this about her, and how much she'd love to come back up here in a few weeks and just stay for a weekend, and how she'd email the owner back right away, and etc. I don't like this for a few reasons, least of all being her overreach - she's my mom and she's excited. I get that. But at least give the first open weekend or two to FH and I so we can actually plan and see the place better. This is our wedding venue, not your new vacation home. 

FH and I took a walk on our own. I wanted a moment just for us. We ended up back at the ceremony site, with this insanely beautiful backdrop of trees and a big field and tons of golden sunlight. It's a special place. We made the decision together that this was our place, shortly after I swallowed a bug. Super romantic. 

Then, when we all sat down at the end and it seemed obvious we'd book, I asked FH to get the checkbook out of the car. Instead, FMIL pulled out her credit card and insisted that she pay for it. I had made it clear to both her and my mom that we wanted to pay this deposit. I'm by no means a control freak, and we're so so grateful for any contribution to the wedding, but this was something I had tried to be as clear as possible about without just saying NO. She still did it. And then I had to play the gushing, happy person who wasn't a bit offended and who didn't feel like I'd just been stepped on all day. 

So we drive the 2.5 hours home with traffic, drop my mom at her house, drop FMIL at her car. FH and I go to buy a bottle of champagne so we can celebrate a little. He's tired though so we pretty much drink it and go to sleep, with the promise that we'll celebrate a little more tonight and go over a planning timeline. 

I wake up this morning to no less than eleven texts. Three are spam from a wedding expo we went to earlier in the day. Two are from my mother about how I accidentally left some of the informational paperwork from the venue at her house, and how excited she is, and if I could please let her know how we plan on dividing the bedrooms in the main house (the rental of which is included in the price, unlike the other cabins, and which we will probably let some family use those rooms for free). Three are from people congratulating us on finally finding a venue. 

The rest are from FMIL - how fun the day before is, "now our planning begins!", then she asks me to send her photos (not sure which ones she's talking about) and she wants us to send her our guests list so she can "tweak it". It's like the second she forked over money for the deposit, she thinks that gives her the magic editing tool so she can invite or uninvite whoever she wants. I know it's probably not that dramatic, but could she not have given us 24 hours? The guest list doesn't need to be finalized for a few months, and she knows ours has only been written and looked over once or twice but that it's not getting any major changes.  We are inviting less than 100 people. 85% of that is family, or more. The rest are our closest/oldest friends. There's also the small family I nanny for. Nobody else, nobody extra. This is not up for debate. We know a good chunk of them still won't be able to make it for a full weekend, but we are still expecting about 65 for at least day of, and probably 50 overnight or full weekend (since 50 pretty much covers parents, siblings, stepsiblings, siblings kids, grandparents, and that's it). Our venue can take 100 but we don't want to pay for 100 people. We want to have a little wiggle room. And we don't want people there that we don't know or don't deeply care about. 

I haven't responded to either of them yet. I had intended to use the main house for certain sets of parents (I know my mom and her bf and my dad and co won't be using them), my bridal party, and my nephew's adoptive family. My mom wants me to offer it only to family. I know most of the family we've invited wouldn't even want to stay in the main house but she's acting like I'd be making a huge mistake asking my (very small!) bridal party (not including the stepsisters, so literally just like six people) if they'd like to use the rooms. 

This is already turning into a huge headache. I know FH has a problem saying NO to his mom. I want to involve my mom but she's overstepped too. (She actually just texted me as I'm typing this saying she doesn't mean to overstep, that I just need to tell her when I need her. She thinks it's that simple. If I do tell her, she'll sigh about it and make a big deal about it for several months.) 

FH is never going to tell his mother to stop, so that's going to be on me, unfortunately. FH is a bit shy and non-confrontational all the time, and I'm okay with being the one who has to put my foot down. I don't know if I'm being crazy and unreasonable. I don't think I am. I just like to have all my details lined up, I am very detail oriented and I have a way that I picture things going that does not involve parental overstep. 

I guess most of that was venting, but I also need some advice on how to talk to parents - namely, (1.) how to tell MIL that she will not be tweaking our guest list, that there's no room on our list for tweaking, that we appreciate her effort and contributions but that we're doing the majority planning ourselves, and when we have need of her, she'll know. I fully intend to have many things for her to do farther on in planning, but I'm not going to let her overstep and make us make major decisions early on that we don't want to make. Also, (2.) how to tell mom that I love her but that she needs to take a chill pill, that I'll give her a list of who might get what rooms when I've had time to at least eat a meal or two and be allowed to think for a while, and that I do not want her visiting our venue again before we've had the chance to, that the place gets busy in non-winter months and that it can book up, and that our visiting it and planning there is more of a priority than her vacation weekend. 

Both mothers made sure the venue owner had their emails and phone numbers listed as contact people. I also need a way (3.) to ask the venue owners to make sure that all communication goes through FH and I FIRST, and that we'll forward any applicable information to our mothers as we see fit. I don't want to come off as controlling, but I need to let him know that this is how it needs to be.

I also have to (4.) Let my father know that he will not be walking me down the aisle. That his daughters will be honorary bridesmaids but will not stand at the front with the bridal party (this is a thing that's not just about them, we initially planned on a bigger wedding and 7 party members each, we still want everyone to be part our or bigger wedding party, go to bachelor/bachelorette parties, etc, but only 3 or 4 people each will be standing with us now, also my FH's sister will match my bridesmaids but will stand on his side). I know this will be upsetting for him to hear, even though it should be obvious. He and I were very close when I was young, before my parents divorced. We stuck together even after their divorce went nuclear. He just stopped caring. I don't want to blame him for that, we're busy and we both have new lives. It's okay. I'm not even really mad about it. But I need to let him know that, because time and distance have separated us, that he and his new family will be no more than guests at my wedding. 

I already have a headache, and I guarantee it's not from the champagne last night. Sorry if this was long. I have tried to be as accommodating as I can over the last few months, I've let them know I intend to include them in planning in some way and that I'll let them know when they're needed. I DO WANT their help in some places, but not in others, and I can't have a bunch of people asking me for shit constantly. I used to be a total doormat when I was younger and I let my anxiety run my life, but my FH has made me a stronger person. I can finally tell someone "NO" without it being an apology like "Uh, actually, um, I'm really really sorry but..." I'm not going to start this wedding planning process by letting our toes get stepped on. I'm not going to let anyone dig that hole any deeper. 

If I'm being neurotic, say so. If you've got advice, I'll take it. If you've got internet hugs, I'll take those too. Ugh.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! We plan on it. There are cans of the stuff at every building anyway. My FHs main concern is the guests reactions to bugs, but we have a group of very outdoorsy family and they'll know well ahead of time. It's not like it's mosquitoes or anything, which is nice, but I did swallow a bug yesterday, which I'm pretty sure is some kind of spiritually binding contract stating that I must get married there. 

There's going to be a mass email/text in the week before the wedding, and a big note on the website about the actual terrain and bugs and rustic cabins, and then we're going to basically buy shares in OFF!, buy a case of the stuff, and call it a day.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's like you're me, writing about my dad! He promised to pay for my dress, "whatever dress you want!" and insisted that he'd be contributing at least 5k to my wedding. Knowing that this was hardly the first time he's flaked on me, I didn't take any of it too seriously. Then he got "laid off" (he got fired, for cause, so now can't continue working for the union where he's spent several years climbing in rank very slowly). Then they bought a huge new TV. Then they got a new car. Then they got a new dog. Actually, are you sure you're not me? Double check. If you're currently steaming from the ears, you know the truth. 

Seriously though. At least I have a history of knowing my dad is not going to come through. I wrote him off the second he started adding "conditions" to his financial contributions - ("well, i didn't mean any dress, i meant any dress you pick that my seamstress friend will make for you for $500, oh and my contribution is only for the dress, nothing else, so did I say $5000? I meant a conditional $500!") - and then by the time he started buying new things, I wrote in his contribution at $0. It wasn't disappointing in the sense of "I wish he'd pick up the slack." It was just "there goes dad again." Months after that his WIFE sent a text to say that they were flat broke and couldn't contribute. He's working again and buying fancy stuff again and he's just not talking to me at this point because that might mean admitting he was being weird. 

I'm sorry. Hugs all around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's far from most people's dream venue - it's a camping and cabin resort, faaaar up a mountain, with no cell service. There are bugs. The cabins are fairly rustic. 

But the views are insane. The ceremony spot is breathtaking. The property is 128 years old and has been passed down through generations. The owners are incredibly sweet and helpful. 

It's a four day rental, so we get to spend several days with our nearest and dearest. #camppeterson2017. Yes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the best ones I've seen recently involved wind chimes - they set up a small chime for each close family member who had passed, so that they were "there and present" throughout the day without having to plan and buy stuff for a big decorative table or anything. It was so special and a really unique way of handling things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you. I just needed another opinion to boost my confidence in my plan. I don't want to make a big deal out of it so I'll basically tell them how it's going to be (just the four people standing) and then ask if they'd like to be part of all the events and stuff as part of the wedding party. They don't have to know I don't consider them official I think. They just need to know they're not standing but that I still want them there. It's still an offer, even if it's a little different than they might have imagined. 

Also yeah, my fianc is kind of a boss and I love him. He kicks ass. He's my polar opposite in many ways but it's good for us. And the day he confessed about the money thing I cried. I cried so hard. He saw how miserable and upset I was and was willing to take a big financial loss over just a small hope that my dad would turn around. He's been so supportive through this whole thing and he's my best friend. I can't wait to marry this guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely plan a ton of activities. Even just a park can be a good use of a few hours. Make it a picnic. Museums, movies, indoor playgrounds, check your local library to see if they have a kids program with story time or something like that (ours has a 30min session 4x a week that 3F adores). Sometimes kids even just like going to places like Target or whatever and they can walk around and look at stuff and maybe get a dollar bin toy, something the little one won't care too much about that can be "special" for the big guy can go a long way in helping the jealousy. Giving him little helper tasks can be great too! especially when they're doing something the baby can't help with - helping pick up or sweep, helping wipe down a table or counter, helping pick out snacks or sorting something (I have basically dumped out a big box of crayons and 3F has been excited to sort it out for 20+ minutes).

It's going to be TOUGH when DB leaves, but keep the little ones busy. A family I babysat for a few times had a dad that drove big rigs for days or weeks at a time. The mom printed out a little picture of daddy and put it in a keychain thing so whenever the little girl missed him, she could look at his picture and give him a hug or kiss and tell him secrets. I thought that was cute and it tended to work pretty well sometimes. Not all the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, that was sort of the first red flag. They wanted to pay for a dress that I didn't want. And that's the only thing they wanted to pay for. I made it clear that it was up to them to contribute in the normal way but that we didn't expect anything from anyone so it was up to them. At this point I don't even want money from them. They'll be guests. Guests don't have to pay for the wedding.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All I'm saying is that this will be my last nanny job, I have officially decided. I've been long-term sitting and nannying for several years. I am done. This family is usually so amazing to work for, I know there are obvious nanny job problems we all deal with, but I'm just at the end of my rope. Tantrums are getting ridiculous. I'll probably work for these guys one more year. Maybe a little longer. Then who knows what I'll do. 

There have been six major tantrums this morning. It's not even 11AM. Two each from a toddler, a 7F, and a 9M. A nine year old boy and a seven year old girl throwing tantrums with crying and screaming and kicking on the floor. That's beyond my lexicon. I have never known kids this ill behaved. They can be such great kids but they're awful when they have to follow rules or when they get punishment for anything.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Letting down potential past bridesmaids who are my sisters. Also telling my dad I don't want traditional stuff. Mostly because family drama and bad relationships. Help. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, a little backstory. My fianc and I have been together for over four and a half years. We got engaged in December, finally found our perfect venue, and are hopefully booking it on Sunday! I've posted here before about my dad but the problem has expanded to now include my stepmother and stepsisters. 

Right when my fianc and I got together, my parents were divorcing. I was 20, it was hell, they were extremely toxic to each other and to our family. Separately they're both okay but my parents lack maturity and are both troubled. Roughly two years later, my dad remarried. At the time things seemed great - they invited us out to their house all the time (2 hours away) and we talked all the time. My stepmother has two daughters who I adore. They're younger than my sister and I (I'm 25, my sister is 22, they're 20 and 19) and we all got along really well. My initial thought was that I would have all my sisters as bridesmaids. That would mean my sister, those two stepsisters, my youngest stepsister from my moms relationship (17), and my two closest friends. 

However, the last year or two has been different. My dad is a pathological liar and a flake. He likes to pretend he's making an effort but really doesn't. He tells people that my sister and I never call him back, etc etc. That's sort of beside the point, he moved two hours away from us and stopped making plans and was always busy. As it stands now I haven't seen any of them since February. 

This is not without having made an effort. I have called and texted my father and my stepmother. They just don't bother to answer or they do and then they say they'll let me know when they're free. I texted him on Father's Day and he replied twice, told me he'd call me, told me he'd let me know when they were free, and didn't. 

I know for a fact that he's lying about us to his side of the family. Even the extended family. My great aunt asked if I would even be at his wedding waaaay back when and that's when I realized he'd started lying. I don't doubt he's continued to poison my own family against me. The sisters no longer text me back. 

That's the problem - I now only talk to these sisters maybe three times a year, when I see them for holidays. I don't have a ton of friends, so sisters made sense to talk about for bridesmaids when I wasn't yet engaged and when we were all getting along well. At that time, there was no doubt they would have been my bridesmaids. But time passed. We took a while to get engaged. When we do see each other it's all hugs and getting along like we see each other all the time. But that's two or three times a year. 

But our wedding is small. 100 people, probably only 70 attending. I'm okay with this. We don't have a ton of friends and we don't have jobs where we'd ever invite coworkers. We're renting this camping/resort place out, up a mountain, and we've got the place for four days. It's going to all be pretty informal. Originally our guest list was over 130 and we planned to have something a little more traditional, so having 6 bridesmaids made sense. Now it doesn't. And honestly, I just don't want them up there with me. They haven't made an effort. They probably have had their opinions of me poisoned by my father already. I'll admit I haven't reached out yet either but I'm not about to make a big deal for two girls who I don't see often and who, even when we do head out to their house, sometimes don't even come downstairs to say hi. Seriously. 

My dad and his wife have also decided that, despite their initial offerings to contribute financially to the wedding, they will not be giving us any money. My dad initially offered to pay for my dress, but so did my mom and grandma and others. I don't need 15k worth of dress. So I told him he was welcome to contribute any amount he was comfortable with and know that it would at least in part be going to my dress. He didn't answer for several weeks then tried to tell me that I should get my dress made by this seamstress they know in downtown LA. I do not want that. It's a personal decision. They told me for $500 I could have any dress made I want. Again, I do not want that. They kept pressuring me, I kept giving them the "general contribution" line. Eventually his wife responded telling me they're really short on money (yeah, neither of them are working! He's scamming disability and she's doing who knows what, and they've bought three new cars in the last five years.) 

My dad also is just a shit person. He once several years ago gave my fianc and I a few hundred dollars when we were in a crunch and insisted we didn't pay him back. He said it was a gift and he was happy to help. As part of the divorce agreement, he was also supposed to give me $2k to help buy a car while my mom helped my sister. He gave me $900. I wasn't going to complain. Both were, to my understanding, never to be paid back. About two years ago my dad got fired (he claims he quit but he collected unemployment and is no longer allowed to work for the union he was working for). He basically texted me one day and asked how soon I could pay all of it back. I didn't answer him for a week, I was floored. They were gifts. He'd reiterated multiple times that I was not to pay him back. I was, at the time, out of work because I have a moderate disability and was dealing with big health issues. I had medical bills up to my ears. I told him I thought it was a gift, but that if he had changed his mind I could pay him $50 a month from my unemployment checks. He never answered. And in fact; that's the time he stopped inviting us out to the house all the time. He stopped answering my calls and texts. He blocked me on freaking Facebook. I was devastated. He had pulled little shit before but cutting me out of his life over money was shitty. 

A few months later he called me and made plans. I thought he had just had a hissy fit and was over it. He's dramatic. I was happy he was trying again, we had dinner, it was great. He started making a minor effort again and I thought things would be okay. Then he stopped calling again. He'd answer my calls after a few days but was always busy. I got a new phone and went to get my dads number off my fiance's phone. His texts were open and I had occasionally used my fiance's phone to text my dad when we were on the way to their house, so I decided to get the number from there. Instead I saw a weird text from my dad that said "Sure, I'll be here this afternoon". That was weird. I opened it. It was dated on my dads birthday a few months before. Right around the time he'd called to make plans. I opened the texts and saw my then-boyfriend, now fianc, had sent a text that said "I have something to drop off for you, will you be home?" In hindsight, my stupid selfish father probably thought my fianc was bringing him a birthday gift. He was working an hour and a half away from my dad and took a half day to drive out there. I confronted him and he confessed that he'd taken a sizable amount of his own money and driven out to give it to my father. He said he hated money coming between family and he had given it to my father as reverse Shut Up Money. He had given nearly a thousand dollars of his own money to my father under the condition that my father make a better effort to be a part of my life. It lasted a few months. I so appreciate that my fianc even tried, and I know he did it behind my back because he knew I'd say now he knows why. Since then I have known that my father will not be walking me down the aisle. He literally couldn't even keep up a relationship with me when someone paid him to do it. 

I was always close with my dad as a kid. I still want him there. But he and his family will be guests, not wedding party. 

I think it's assumed that the girls would be bridesmaids, I mentioned it to them once or twice and mused about bachelorette party ideas. I need a tactful way to rescind that. It's not about my dads refusal to contribute. I just don't feel like our relationship is strong enough that I want them up with me. It was once. It isn't anymore. It's not entirely their fault, my dad is poison, but they haven't made an effort either. 

I would still love if they would get ready with me, go to the bachelorette party, etc. I want them to know I still want them to be part of my day. But not standing. My list will then be my bio sister, my youngest stepsister, and my two closest friends. 

 I do sort of have one idea but I have no idea how it would sound to other people. My fiance's sister is going to be standing on his side. I had initially planned on asking her to be a bridesmaid but she's close with my fianc and I think it's so sweet that he wants her in his wedding party. She's going to wear what the bridesmaids wear, or at least the right color, she's just standing on his side. She's sort of an honorary bridesmaid since she'll be doing all the bachelorette stuff and all that with me. I'm thinking of letting the sisters know that they're honorary bridesmaids, but that since my fianc doesn't have a ton of friends to be groomsmen and our ceremony space is admittedly a little small, that I just don't have room for everyone up front. That they'll sit front row and they can wear the same color as the bridesmaids. Come to all the events with us. Get ready with us. Etc. 

I don't know what to do. I just would not be comfortable having them up there. It would just make me sad. Theres just not a solid relationship. But I feel bad anyway. I felt bad about my dad at first but I don't anymore. 

Sorry this was all over the place and so long. I've been thinking about the situation as just me vs dad for a while and only in the last few weeks considered the sisters. It really hit me this morning that this is how I need to do things. I cried. I'm not good at this. It would have been easier to just do this to my dad but now I'm doing it to that whole part of the family. 

Help.  </TEXT>

Maybe have a verbal face to face conversation with her about what exactly you guys are looking for in this other girl, physical stuff and all that, but let HER do the talking and be careful about which parts you agree with. i.e. If she's a blonde, don't be like "yeah, redheads are my favorite!" 

My SO and I have had the same conversations, and he lets me point girls out for this exact reason. I roughly know what he's interested in because I look in a mirror! But from a woman's perspective, even in the context of talking about a threesome, it can be hard to hear a partner talking about things or specific people they want to bang that are not us.  </TEXT>

Nope. Shortly after I deleted all but ~100 Facebook friends (from ~1500!) and stopped following hundreds of IG accounts. I basically only use it once or twice a week now and it's so liberating. I'm more present in my own life. My anxiety is close to zero, which is insane. I was having panic attacks and constant ruminations about how my life was so subpar, how unhappy I was, etc. I didn't realize it was a social media problem until like two months later when I realized how much happier I was.

	<TEXT> Partners who refuse counseling like this typically do so because they're embarrassed. Their partner is calling them out on shit they've been getting away with for years, and they know a neutral party who says shit like "you have to actually help parent your children" and "having an affair is a terrible thing to do" is going to strengthen their partner. They don't want that. 

It doesn't sound like things got worked out on your own. It sounds like you threw a bandaid over the problem and it went away because he said a few things he knew you wanted to hear. Therapy can help but it sounds like your relationship does not have a good history. Demand cooperation in therapy and a FAIR share of parenting duties or leave this guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently tossed/gave away like half of my palettes in favor of singles. The only palettes I really kept were two Coastal Scents Revealed palettes (cheap enough that I don't care if I'm only using half of the shades) and an older Tarte palette. I rebuilt my shadow collection from MAC singles. They're only $6 now and a big empty palette from them isn't too expensive. I had forgotten about MAC for so long in favor of Sephora brands but MAC is my go-to for shadows again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This could have been my post 4.5 years ago. I had had quite a few sexual partners but was a party girl and picked many bad dudes. My now fianc had been a virgin when we met. The first time we had sex he was like "are you sure you want to?" And I was like "no, it's up to you, given circumstances this is your choice" and he was like "no, actually it isn't, I obviously want to (*gestures to raging boner*) but it's still your choice, do you want to?" 

Oooopen the floodgates. Physically I was like KNEES UP but emotionally in my head I was like "cool I'm gonna happy cry later when you're sleeping" 

And now I'm gonna marry that dude so hard  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not saying I've ever done it - I haven't, by the way, but I'm living a totally different set of circumstances. I'm saying I have known nannies who have done it. It's partially a stability thing, too - if a nanny is on unemployment and takes a nanny job over the table and it ends up not being a good fit, she can't quit and go back to unemployment until she finds a better fit. Quitting an over the table job will make her ineligible for unemployment. She then loses the dependable source of income through unemployment that she still definitely needs, just because the kids aren't a good fit or the family is weird or any number of problems. We all know finding a perfect fit family is difficult.

	<TEXT> Okay, I see a lot of people offering the same advice and to tell your friend to move out sooner and to not tell the boyfriend, but this needs to be expanded upon for clarity's sake because every detail is very important when getting out of a relationship that's this chaotic. 

1. Angela's son can never be in this guy's presence again. He is clearly not in a sane state and its not worth risking any sort of greeting or goodbye if he's proven to be this far gone. 

2. Angela needs to gather her important paperwork and documents. Offer to hold it for her while she makes the transition. 

3. Ask for a police escort to move her. They can basically make it so that he can't be on the property for 24-48 hours so that she can safely move her things out, and if there are officers present while she's moving, he'll be a lot less likely to get violent. She needs to get a temporary restraining order also, and work on a permanent one, but getting out and staying somewhere he can't find her for at least a week is the biggest part. 

4. Remind her that making a scene is a hell of a lot less important than staying alive. If you've had to hide knives in your house, saving face is the least of her concerns. If she wants her kid to still have his mom, and she might need to be reminded that it is exactly that serious, she needs to carefully but quickly remove herself from this guy. 

You may also want to get a restraining order against this guy. He was like this in your home. You were afraid to sleep in your own home. Because you stood up to him once before, he will think of you when he's thinking of places she could be. Preemptively get an order and serve him so that he doesn't get a chance to come after you. 

A lot of people have mentioned the involuntary admittance. Call 911. Call now. Tell them that he is a threat to Angela, that she has a son, that he's threatened to kill her and himself and that he's self-harmed in front of you all before. Go through the whole evening in detail. The drugs, the threats, all of it. 

Do not wait until something has already happened. He could kill her. It's not worth waiting for. Hesitation could mean her death. I repeat it only because I've seen it happen and you'd be stupid not to take action now. 

Editing to add: do not have her stay with you. It's a place he could easily find her just by looking places where he's gotten like this before. His thought process would easily go from "she's trying to get me" to "everyone's out to get me" to "who has stood up to me and seen how I treat her?" Help her find a women's shelter or an unknown friends house or a cheap hotel room. Make sure anyone there knows to pretend she isn't there. She may hesitate to make a statement to police immediately, but you don't have to. You know you fucked up by letting her go. You regret that. Don't screw this up again.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For some nannies, it's not a pay scale problem as much as it is other arrangements. I get paid under the table and that's the only reason I get my health insurance covered by the government. I have health issues that qualify me for MediCal if I don't have a job. If I were being paid over the table at my current rate, I'd actually bring home ~12 an hour with CA taxes, x30 hours is 360. I would be paying almost 250 a month for insurance that wouldn't be as good, plus copay. I currently bring home 450 a week. If I did taxes and insurance, I'd be bringing home ~300.

They could also be collecting unemployment, and being payrolled will jeopardize that. I have known three nannies who have collected unemployment while nannying. To them, they could be getting paid under the table plus unemployment, or over the table and without unemployment. So it can be a bigger difference than it looks like on paper, even if they don't admit to whatever reasons they might have for not taking taxes out.  </TEXT>

The whole face lot is yours if you want it, plus any of the eyeshadows still listed. You're next in line so let me know which ones you want before I pass them to the next person. There are 14 of them - if you're interested, I'd be willing to do the whole rest of the eyeshadow lot, plus the cheek lot, for $30 plus a few dollars for shipping. Or just take your pick of what's left. Thanks!  </TEXT>

Roulette, Birthday Girl, Kimono, and Rumer Has It have been paid for. Daddy and Hammered have been claimed but not paid for and could fall through. Girl Crush, Bae, Nillionaire, have not been claimed yet. The cheek stuff, someone has expressed interest in the full lot but not paid, except for Between the Sheets, which was claimed before that and not paid yet, so if those fall through, you're next in line. (2nd for remainder of lot, 3rd for between the sheets, I'd discount the lot obviously if BTS sells)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! This is my first time attempting to sell on MUE, though I've bought a half dozen different things from here before. I've been meaning to get rid of some of this stuff for a long time and, with the reorganization of my house/battlestation/life, I decided now was the time to do it. I have a HUGE stash of BNIB Benefit items - I won them in a contest a little while ago and can't find anyone to give certain shades to, so they're being offered here at a decent discount to anyone who fits the bill! I also have a TON of lightly used Colourpop shadows and blushes and highlighters.

I'm not currently looking for swaps, only selling. I'm getting married in a little over a year and I need to start saving! :) Please feel free to make an offer if you would like to try a different price on anything offered. I've listed retail prices and what I think is fair, but I'm up for most negotiations! 

All items have been sanitized/cleaned prior to shipment, as well as can be done. 

If an item is no longer listed, it's unavailable and paid for. 

Items marked with an (!) after the price are also available as FWP - one item per $20 pre-shipping. 

Minimum purchase of $10. 

Shipping starts at $3 and increases with weight/number of items. Tracking will be provided as soon as I can ship. I ship as soon as I receive payment. Failure to pay within 24 hours will mean I release product back into sale. PayPal gift only, please.

	<TEXT> It's like you're me, from the past! 

Despite what you may be feeling right now, your diagnosis is a GREAT thing. Chiari is treatable. I have Chiari 0 in addition to Syringomyelia, which basically means that my whole spinal cord/brain stem combo isn't reacting well to pressure. 

I went ~8 years with migraines that didn't respond to migraine medication, and worsening back pain that nobody could explain, as I was an otherwise healthy 22 year old. An ER doc finally told me I should see a neurologist, that neurologist put in the whole slew of tests, including - you guessed it - the MRI. That MRI revealed Chiari 0 (very slight herniation, mine is more about the pressure in the brain stem area because of the SM also) and a decent-sized syrinx (fluid-filled cyst that's actually inside my spinal cord, which is not where things are supposed to be.) 

SM isn't treatable for me - I'm not a surgical candidate - but Chiari is infinitely more treatable and I've spoken with so many people who have or haven't had surgery and have gone on to lead fairly normal lives. This is not a death sentence. It's sure as hell scary, and the terminology can freak you out, but you're going to be okay! And now that your doctors have something to work with, my biggest piece of advice is to be proactive in your own health care. Push for specialist visits, push for repeat MRIs, ask for a full spinal MRI if you haven't gotten one already. 

Funny enough, MY docs also think my Chiari/Syringomyelia is not the cause of MY migraine issues - so that's still being searched for several years later. But it's a good thing that they found this! 

Do your research. Find and talk to people with Chiari, which won't be hard. Check Facebook for support groups - they've been a HUGE help to me - and look for in-person support groups for anything from chronic pain to nerve damage to cerebrospinal and head trauma. It's hard to find a perfect fit for illnesses like this but finding the right group will be SUCH a relief. Talking to others who have been in your shoes is invaluable. 

If you have any questions or anything please don't hesitate to PM me!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yay! I can totally relate. SOs do the best shit sometimes. Mine was a little crazy. 

When my parents were divorcing, right around the time I met my SO, part of their agreement was that they were supposed to give us money to help us get a cheap used car to get around - to the tune of $2k. My mom gave my sister her money, my dad gave me $800 in cash and never said anything about it. I tried breaching the subject a few times but he'd just change topics. My dad is kind of an ass. So then like a year later, he's doing well financially, and we're having trouble because I was out of work for a few months for health reasons. My dad gives us like $800 again and says it makes up for how short he was with the first payment (it doesn't) and that he insists we don't pay it back and it isn't a loan. He stresses this point, like he wants to FEEL like he made it up to us. Don't get me wrong, it was a huge help, but he still never lived up to his end of the bargain. 

Two years ago he quit his job out of nowhere and was then struggling for money. He asked when I was going to pay him back all of that money I owed him. I was fucking livid. I didn't respond to him, I didn't want to talk to him. I finally texted back to remind him that he said I shouldn't ever have to pay him back and to remind him that I'm up to my neck in medical debt and have zero way to repay him. He started being a jerk, stopped answering my calls, etc. I was then devastated, because it was clear to me that my father was only making an effort to get the money out of me and didn't actually want to see us. Then like three weeks later he texted saying we should get dinner, hang out, whatever. I was skeptical but it seemed like he had started to put it behind him and maybe realized he'd been a jerk. 

Nope. Months later I was using my SO's phone to get my dad's number since I had gotten a new phone. His texts were open so I just decided to use that to get the number. I had occasionally used SOs phone to text my dad that we were on our way out there (two hour drive) if my phone was dead. There were two weird texts between him and my dad, on my dad's birthday. SO said "Will you be home today? I have something I wanted to drop off to you." My dad said "Sure, I'll be home all afternoon." That was it. That was around the time my dad started talking to me again. I connected the dots pretty quickly, but basically my SO gave my dad almost a thousand dollars. When I confronted SO he said he didn't like to see money get between people, especially family, so he gave my dad "shut up money". It worked for a little while, anyway, but it totally blew my mind. I mean we'd been together like three years, and I know my SO is that kind of person, but he didn't want me to feel bad about the money, since it was all SO's personal money, so he just didn't say anything to me. He had hoped so badly that my dad would change, which I would not have hoped because I know my dad, but SO did it just with a hope that my dad would start to treat me better. 

I can totally imagine the scene at the door, too. My very quiet but strong SO shows up to my dad's house (not even his house, his wife's mother's house where they all live, so he's not even paying rent?? How is he so broke??), dad answers door, confused as to what it is to be dropped off. Dad stupidly assumes it's a present or something. 

Ends up that was pretty much the truth. He basically walked up, handed my dad a bunch of cash in an envelope, said "That's all there's ever going to be, start answering her calls, do not ask subject1963 for money ever again." 

Dad went back to not giving a shit a few months later, but still. Damn. SO coming through as usual. 


He also basically helped me build my credit from having no credit history to having awesome credit. My mom had offered to help me get started but she has TERRIBLE credit, so SO swooped in fairly early in our relationship and got a joint credit card with me so I wouldn't be connected to my mom's credit in anyway. I now have excellent credit. Fuck yeah.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My depression comes and goes in waves, at times manageable and minor, but often crushing and absolutely debilitating. I often question if what I'm experiencing is "just" depression. I have a chronic illness and a wedding to plan, a decent job and an unsavory past. I'm just trying to look forward. I'm just trying to be better. 

But I can't do that without a little help. My fianc has trouble missing emotional cues, he had a weird childhood, so he often doesn't see the signs of my depression until I'm already in bed at 6:30PM or standing in front of the open fridge for twenty minutes or I've skipped showering for four days. I've tried to teach him but when it comes to sensitive topics, he's a slow learner. He takes care of me in a way I never imagined could be possible, he handles my illness so well now, but my depression is some mystic level shit that he can't seem to wrap his head around. 

I've at least gotten to the point where I recognize exactly what my depression is - a severe imbalance of chemicals in my brain that make me feel like absolute trash. Rationally, I know that this is it. It doesn't make it any easier to deal with. And I don't need any less support. I need just as much. But it's still... Lacking, sometimes. I can't expect him to be perfect. And of course I miss the good things when I'm too wrapped up in blankets and self-pity. 

So it's 1:20AM, I have to be up for work in 5 hours, I can hear him softly snoring in the other room, and I envy his comfort. I envy his sanity.

He's logical to a fault, we've not-so-jokingly referred to him as a robot. He can manage our finances and make sure we eat dinner and find my missing birth certificate and email it where it needs to go. He can make sure I remember to call the right people and take some me time and he encourages me to go get coffee and write on my days off. He can basically handle my day to day minutiae with ease but he can't tell when I'm suffocating. 

There are times, though... When he pulls me away from the fridge doors, gets me some water, and holds my hand on the couch. When he curls up behind me in bed and presses his face into my hair and tells me he loves me. When he asks what he can do for me, what I need. 

But those times are not common. They are fleeting. And then I'm back under the covers by myself while he balances the checkbook. Sorry, honey. The electric bill is due, so I can't be your lighthouse.

Like okay Toby knows they're suspicious of the guy, he knows the guy was married to their friend, you'd think there might be one audible gasp or something. Instead they all just stay totally silent and give each other guilty looks and Occifer Toby misses it entirely and like paces back and forth wondering just who in this gosh darn town could be involved with something like this!

	<TEXT> Very simply put: tell your boyfriend that the immature ploy to sleep with other women is a deal breaker. He has zero right to say those things. 

Example: I was a floozy in college, and high school, and pretty much all the time before I met my fianc. For five years now it's been all him but I had slept with 19 (19!) guys before him. My fianc was a virgin when we met. If he ever told me he had to go out and sleep with 19 women to make things "even", I'd tell him to go fuck himself. Sexual history is not a competition. And you're not awful for sleeping with other people as a young adult. 

Your boyfriend does not respect you. This is crazy. No. Just no.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Out of courtesy, wait a few months to get engaged. Give the sister her own time to be in the spotlight. You can always start wedding planning before you get engaged, anyway. Nobody needs to know. 

As for wedding dates, I suggest you and your SO pull the sister aside and explain that you guys are also ready to get married, that you were looking at June, and that you want to let her know ahead of time so that she's not told out of the blue and thrown off. That you wanted to come to her first so she wouldn't feel stepped on. 

However, don't let her responses have a huge bearing on what you do regarding planning. Stick to whatever dates you want. Do what you're going to do. But warn a girl, and even if she's pissed about it, she can't say you're blindsiding her.  </TEXT>

I gave my parents each an ultimatum. They can behave and be at the very least cordial, or they can miss my wedding. I told both that I will not tolerate any fighting or drama at my wedding, so they have the option to leave or they will be removed if they cause problems. 

As for the legal side, try contacting your county to ask what might need to be done regarding the orders and If it requires a lawyer. I don't have too much experience there. 

Big picture though, if you suspect that any drama might happen between your parents, set the rule and let them break it if they want. Hire a security person for the ceremony and reception. It will be worth the peace of mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DO NOT give these people money. Not unless they're willing to pursue a relationship without the money attached. 

Your wife's mother sounds like a raging jerk from what you've told me. She clearly had a bit of a tough relationship with her after meeting you, and if her mother was that harsh before you, which I'm sure she was, it could not have been good times. It's all about her, she sends the sister as the olive branch while she sits back and does everything in her power to get what she wants without having to show any form of remorse. 

They disowned your wife. She needs to disown them too. Money will not help their relationship or teach your MiL a lesson. It will only cause more disappointment. 

When my SO and I were having some mild financial troubles a few years back, my father - who is similarly selfish and rude normally but seemed to be in a good mood - offered to give us a few hundred dollars to carry us over while I was unable to work because of health issues. He insisted that we never pay him back, that it was a gift. 

Almost three years later, he's out of work and asks me if I'm ever going to pay back that money he lent us forever ago, and that he needs us to start making payments to him. I reminded him that it was a gift, but that if he needed money I would be glad to give him what I could afford to give him for a month or two until he got back on his feet. I couldn't pay back the whole amount (I'm disabled!) but I would do whatever I could. He had asked for $1200 back, I told him I could get him roughly $100 a month until I had some medical bills due 2-3 months from then. But that after that, I needed that money for rent and bills and that's all I'd have. It was clearly not the whole amount, but I had never expected to have to pay the money back, so it just wasn't possible. 

He started ignoring my texts and calls, and when I could get a hold of him he said he was busy. He just wanted money. He showed his true colors. After a month or two of being devastated by his actions, he started calling and texting again and asking when we would come to dinner. I thought he was just doing better and wanted to rebuild our relationship. Nope. Ended up my SO went to my dads house and handed him money, to the tune of eight hundred dollars, so that my dad would stop being a jerk to me. A few months later my dad was back to being busy all the time and not calling. I think he realized we weren't going to keep giving him money when he wasn't even trying to get a job. 

Giving your wife's mother your money will not help cure her cancer. She knows you're doing well for yourselves and she's regretting cutting you guys off ONLY because it would be easier to get money from you. Tell the sister you're not able to contribute at the moment, but that you'd like to get together soon anyway. See how much they actually care when you let them know they won't be getting a dime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For a period of time I was trying to stop using harsh chemicals on my hair and skin to see if I had any improvement. I used skincare solely from Lush for several months and dropped hundreds of dollars, and I don't think it helped that much in the end. Was it harmful? Not necessarily. My skin felt oiler and never really felt clean, but it was hydrated (all those oils!) and that's not too bad. My skin is super sensitive and drastically combination so it was nice to just have to deal with oiliness for a while. But it ended up increasing the number of comedones in my opinion and the products are so so expensive for what they are. I dropped the lush thing for normal drugstore face wash a few months ago, and just last month switched to the SCA routine. It hasn't helped me a ton either but it costs a hell of a lot less to figure that out than Lush cost me.  </TEXT>

Make goals moving forward but make sure they're not solely about you - if he suggests a goal related to your education or career, suggest that he set a goal for emotional growth. He needs to realize your career is not up to him, but you need to realize he's in a place where he's moving on up and being successful and he's feeling like you have the potential to move upward with him but you're choosing not to.

	<TEXT> My fianc [28M] and I [25F] have been engaged for a little over six months, dating for a little over 4.5 years. We've lived together for all but a week and a half of our relationship, so marriage is something that we're excited about but not bothered with rushing into. We're looking at what we're pretty sure is going to be our venue later this month, with a projected date range of next August - September. There are a few things my fianc and I have known from the beginning are things we definitely wanted in a wedding - a full weekend to enjoy with family and friends, somewhere in the mountains with plenty of trees/greenery, something laid back, etc. We're both long time scouts and our love for camping and the outdoors is a big factor in our relationship and a big part of who we are. We've been very clear from the beginning with family that we're going to do most of the planning ourselves, but every time wedding talk comes up, it seems like certain sets of parents forget whose wedding this actually is. 

We haven't even started serious planning and I'm already at the end of my rope. Part of me just needs to vent but if anyone has any advice on any of this, please pipe up. 

Our parents are all divorced and remarried, giving us four full sets of parents, a sister on each side, and five step siblings total. Factor in the amount of aunts and uncles, step family, cousins, etc, our list of "close family" is at 90, and we're including only a dozen or so of our closest friends. People we'd actually want to spend a whole weekend with. We did a lot of the initial brainstorming on our own so that we'd have a hard list of things that we would not budge on. 

You'd think that with six months of engagement already passed, that moms would cool down a bit. Nope. One set of parents, my FH's dad and stepmom, are the best. They have ideas, but they're not pushy. They have generously offered to contribute a sizable amount to our wedding, their talk of who they wanted to be there only went as far as "oh, you're inviting these people? Cool. Sounds good." And they love that our planning so far is about US. 

My dad and stepmom are a whole other ballgame. My dad moved away right after he and my mom divorced about five years ago. We were extremely close, so it was difficult, but he's immature and has quickly distanced himself from his old life, choosing only to see my sister and I when it's convenient to him. He barely answers texts or calls. In the beginning, I used to visit them all the time, despite the two hour drive, and my stepmom seemed interested in helping me plan the wedding. My dad had offered to pay for my dress, but so had my grandmother and my mother and three other people, so FH went with the response that "everyone else wants to pay for the dress, and I don't need 20k of dress and 5k of wedding, so it's a general contribution fund." Then it turned into "Well, we'll help pay, but only if it's for your dress and only if you use the seamstress we used for our wedding." That dress was not good, and I basically just said no thank you. When I tried to confirm with my dad two months ago that they wouldn't be contributing, which I repeated that I didn't mind, my stepmom replied that they wouldn't be, but that she'd like to help plan the wedding, and all kinds of stuff. I don't know. My dad is not going to be walking me down the aisle or anything, I haven't had that talk with him and don't know how to breach that either. 

My mom is an event planner in her daily life, and while I do feel like she has my best interests at heart and she does get a feel for what we want to do with our wedding and is respectful of that, she keeps insisting that we don't need any sort of planner (I agree there) or day of coordinator (I don't want her to have to be doing this and stressing out during her daughter's wedding, also she is unmanageable when stressed out and I don't want her being like that at my wedding). I don't know how to tell my mother Thanks, but No Thanks, that I'll be hiring a coordinator because I can't handle her dramatics. Her SO isn't married, but I love him like a stepfather and honestly, he's been more of a father to me for the last five years than my own dad has. My sister is walking me down the aisle, but if she wasn't, he would be. His daughter (16 now, will be almost 18 at the wedding) will be my youngest bridesmaid and I'm not sure how to handle a bachelorette party with her age. I'm thinking of doing two things but I don't want to leave her out, she's my sister too.

My FH's mother is... Oh man, I don't even know. She's always been extremely opinionated. She pushes this false sense of friendliness but it's very clear that I am not what she envisioned for her firstborn. FH doesn't see how false it is, so I can't bring it up when she says something that's a little underhandedly mean. Even after we told her what we want for our wedding, we know our budget is fairly large, she kept insisting we get married some place she picked out because she's contributing. Well, yeah, so are three other sets of parents and my grandparents, and she's hardly contributing the largest chunk. The worst part is she keeps suggesting weirder and weirder places to get married. First she wanted us to get married where she and her husband got married. They had something like 20 people and that was the max there. We couldn't get away with 20 people if we tried, that wouldn't even include immediate family. It has gotten weirder (get married at the beach! She says. I hate the beach.) and weirder (get married seven hours away! She says. Not happening.) until her last suggestion - that we get married at a local public park. Like, a plain local public park with swings and a slide and little kid's birthday parties. Her reasoning? "It's outside! You guys love the outdoors. And it'll be cheap!" Thanks, FMIL. My FH has a hard time saying no to his mother, so it has fallen on me every time to say "Oh, that's a neat idea. Sure, give me the info and I'll look into it, but I think we're looking for something a little different." I have it down to a science. She looks offended when I tell her we're not going to get married next to a sand pit. 

My maternal grandmother is also contributing several thousand dollars, but she literally could not care less what I do with it. She and I are extremely close, which is good, and she pretty much offered to tell my mom to bug off with the whole "Event planning/coordinator" junk. 

So one set of parents doesn't care what we do, one set of parents isn't contributing because they couldn't pay for my dress (which I know is so that they could SAY they paid for my dress, knowing that the seamstress is not good and very cheap, just for the sake of saying they did that), one set of parents wants to run the show, and one set of parents wants the show to go down in a public park next to a freeway. And my grandma is writing me a fat check and telling me "subject1963, it's well within your rights to tell everyone to f*ck off with their opinions, just because they want to redo their own weddings again and again doesn't mean you have to give in to their dumb ideas." 

I'm having a hard time figuring out how to tell everyone (minus grandma and FH's dad and stepmom) to go screw themselves. I feel like I don't even want to talk about wedding planning with people because it just makes me nervous. I know whatever we go with will be amazing and my FH and I are strong people, but holy crap. We haven't even settled a date and I already want to elope. Not that I could, because I think my mother and sister literally might stab me. 

Anyone with four sets of parents (or three, or two tough ones, or whatever) have any input? How exactly do you politely say "thanks, FMIL, but your ideas are totally not at all what we would ever want and we'd appreciate not having to say this to you anymore" without hurting everyone's feelings? You'd think I could say "hey, this is our wedding and we're going to do this our way" (in nicer terms, obviously) but apparently that is offensive and not okay at all. You all already had two weddings. Get the f*ck out of ours, thanks.  </TEXT>
