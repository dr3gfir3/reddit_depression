	<TEXT> Coming from the sister of somebody with an eating disorder: you cannot help by yourself. Unless you have gone to school and specialized in the complex area that is eating disorders, you are in no way able to comprehend what she is thinking. I know that, as a sister, you want to be there and you should be, but don't be surprised when she pushes you away and tells you that you don't understand.

My parents were also very hesitant in accepting that my sister was sick. At first, my mother aided my sister in her endeavor to lose weight, taking her to the gym and buying her low calorie foods. It wasn't until she started showing actual psychological differences that my parents actually took notice. She was hostile and depressed, always working out but whenever she was sitting she had something (a pillow, a book, a bag) over her stomach. We used to be very close, but during that time she became a whole other person. When my parents realized that, they got her to a therapist.

Keep in mind, once your parents notice the journey will still be far from over. You sister needs to accept that she is sick. If it took your parents this long to realize, your sister will take a while as well. The process of her getting to see that is hard. At first, she will not even want to go to therapy. She will claim it is a waste of time. If she is under 18, your parents can force her. Hopefully, she will gradually come to terms with the fact that she is getting help whether she likes it or not. In the case of my sister, we were getting her to realize that she was sick when she flat out lost it. Her therapist and my parents had to have her put into a inpatient program for kids with eating disorders. She resented my mother and father for a long time, she even threatened to kill the therapist, but this was the best thing for her.

After weeks of inpatient and outpatient programs, my sister finally returned home. It has been over 5 years since then, but I know that she still struggles every day. Once you have an eating disorder you always have an eating disorder. You need to keep in mind that eating disorders are less about food and more about control. My sister needed to take control of her life and did it in the wrong way, it seems your sister is too. They are taking food (of the lack thereof) and manipulating it to make themselves feel better. Your sister is sick, and she will need you there for her recovery. Don't get mad when she treats you badly, both her mind and body are warped. Recovery is possible.

My sister is now planning on becoming a therapist and helping kids such as herself. She could probably explain this a lot better than I could.

TL;DR She needs to realize she is sick, you need to be there to help her through.

**EDIT**: I just saw that your sister is 20, which makes things a bit more difficult. It's hard to get a person into therapy when they believe that nothing is wrong. One thing that helped my sister was letting her control other environments of her life. For her, that meant getting a job at a stable and working with the horses. Something like that may seem small to you or I, but it made a huge impact in her life. Although she no longer works with horses, I know she still cares about them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My cat Arwen ran away when I was little. She was a black cat, nothing really to help identify her. One day, my mother came home from the pound with a black cat. She swore to me that it was Arwen. Everybody in the family carried on as usual, happy that their cat had returned. I, on the other hand, refused to believe that it was Arwen. I told my mother again and again it wasn't her and that we should keep looking, but she told me I was just being paranoid. A few days later, Arwen showed up at our back door. When I let her inside, she looked at the new black cat and looked mildly confused but quickly ran to the food bowl. We kept the new cat, and named her Jasmine. (Personally, I wanted to name her Eowyn, but whatever.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mine isn't life or death, but is a string of perfectly timed occurrences.

One day, my boyfriend and I showed up at my fathers house during a big thunderstorm. We were surprised to see him and my older sister outside calling for my dog. Like most dogs, this one was a big sissy when it came to thunderstorms. At this point, the storm had been going on for 10 minutes and showed no signs of stopping. Even after it did, I was driving around my town looking for my dog. When my father finally told me to go and dry off, I went in for the day. The next morning, it started again.

My father and I went together, driving around and asking people if they had seen our dog. I had photos of him to show people. We drove by a work truck and asked the man in there, he said a co-worker of his had a dog jump in his truck during the storm. We asked what kind of a dog, he said "boxer." Our dog is a Australian Shepard, those two look nothing alike so we wrote it off and moved on.

My father had to go to work, so I spent the rest of the morning posting pictures on local facebook pages. One was the town's newspaper page. A woman posted and said she saw my dog a block from my house. She said he was in a parking lot with a truck trying to take shelter from the rain. When she looped around to pick him up, he was gone. She assumed the driver of the truck had taken him in. The truck was from the same company as the man before. I called my dad, who called the company who told us this amazing story.

Apparently, the driver of that truck was there in that parking lot waiting out the storm. Our dog jumped into the bed of his truck to hide, without the driver knowing. As the storm eased up, the driver drove away with our dog in the back. He traveled 30 miles with our dog unsecured in the back, cars beeping at him and waving at him. When he finally stopped, our dog jumped out and ran.

Luckily for us, we knew exactly where our dog had left the truck, and with the help of local police we had him safe and sound at home that night. [Here he is after his vet visit.](http://i.imgur.com/0YoUe.jpg)

tl;dr: my dog hitched a ride 30 miles to hide from a storm, we managed to find him with good samaritans.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried therapy, made me feel worse. Tried medication, made me feel like a different person. Tried hospitalization, felt trapped. 

The moment I stopped all these treatments was the moment I started to get better. I've lived my life with people telling me something is wrong with me, that I need to be fixed. Turns out, there wasn't anything wrong.

I'm not telling you to stop your treatments, because I don't know you or what you need. Only you truly know you and what you need. I'm here to say: don't give up, there will be a positive outcome for you.  </TEXT>
