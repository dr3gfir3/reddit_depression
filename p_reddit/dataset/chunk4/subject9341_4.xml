	<TEXT>  I'll admit that I developed behaviors like hers only because I was a product of my environment and thought that her behavior was typical. After I realized that I was ruining myself by being the person I was, I snapped out of it and managed to get rid of many of the behaviors that practically made me almost a splitting image of my mother.

I have been struggling with this for a while. My social life was a train-wreck when I first went to university because I had no idea what 'normal' was. Luckily I now have a very supportive girlfriend who is helping to re-train me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had quite a few landlords and most of them do scummy things like that. Worst one was a 9-bed house we lived in at uni. Before we left we cleaned it top to bottom, but got charged 170 for cleaning. Apparently they just contract a cleaning company who bills them the same regardless of the cleaning done, then pass it to us. We asked what exactly needed cleaning and they said 2 ovens and dust on skirting boards. Get fucked 170. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone with chemical engineering education here. Yes, sarin does thermally decompose when exposed to relatively low temperatures [(source)](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sarin#section=Stability). It does not mean that all of it will decompose immediately at elevated temperatures. Also, sarin is 5x denser than air, so any release would stay low to the ground. I'm not saying the Russians' story is true, but it is plausible.  

**Edit:** [This](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn24142-how-the-us-may-try-to-destroy-syrias-chemical-weapons/) article from new scientist backs up my assertion. **'[The destruction of the chemical weapons] could not be comprehensive and explosions could release intact lethal gas with fatal results, even if done with sufficient heat.'** </TEXT>

r/place was this years April Fools' Day social experiment that Reddit launches yearly. To sum it up, it was basically a giant collaborative online drawing that everyone could see in live action, where each user could place a single pixel anywhere and in any color on a digital "canvas", before being given a 5-10 minute cool down before they could place another one. The general idea was that everyone could work together to make artwork (or just vandalize the place). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm similar, was top in the class for maths and science in primary and secondary school (ages 5-16) without really trying. I was always praised for just being smart. Now I find it really hard to deal with not 'getting' things immediately, and I struggle to motivate myself to work hard at something which I don't immediately find easy. </TEXT>
