	<TEXT> Today Leah was well, she was her loving self.  She made dinner for us  a spinach and cheese quiche.  Leah doesnt cook normally, not for us anyways.  Im talking about once every two months.
In her defence, she doesnt really have time to cook for us.  Its because she works late.  Or so she says.  I dont know what shes doing.

Leahs acting normally. I told Mary.  Mary glanced at me.

Why, didnt you expect her to?  Mary frowned, She didnt seem to be mad about something.  Shes just worried about finishing her assignment.

I nodded, but didnt say more.  Leah was always studying.  She was always writing an essay, doing an assignment, or doing something.  But she was always busy.  

I checked her internet history before I put my phone away.  I blinked rapidly.  

Home-made bleach
How to bleach hair
How to break my own wrist

What what was she doing?  What on earth was she thinking?  I wanted to tell Mary, but then I would have to admit that I was looking at Leahs internet history.  Wed always given Leah freedom on what she could watch and do.  That probably wasnt a good idea, because she developed a freakish obsession with horror films and serial killers.

Serial killers!  Shed been binge watching Dexter again!

I put my phone down just as Mary glanced over.  I didnt want to explain.  It would make things awkward.

Just go to sleep, honey. She said. Hey, wheres Spotty?

We had three dogs.  Kira  Leahs dog, Spotty  my dog, a large pitbull, and Boy, Marys miniature chihuahua.   Boy was lying wrapped around Marys ankle, sound asleep.  Usually Spotty lay at the side of the bed, and in the middle of the night she would get onto the bed and wrap her flabby body around my head.

But when I glanced down, Spotty wasnt there.  

Did we lock her outside? I asked, getting up and pulling on a pair of pants, Im gonna go check.

I walked outside.  Boy lifted his head, curious, but then laid it down again when he realized that Mary wasnt getting up.
Outside I called my dogs name.  After about three minutes, Leah came out of the flat.  Her hair was messy, and she was rubbing her eyes tiredly. She wore a pair of short shorts and a tight shirt  well, she left nothing to the imagination!  

Dad, whatre you doing? She said grumpily.  At her heels followed her small dog, its eyes curiously on me.

I cant find Spot. I said, and she smiled at me again.  

You cant find Spot, daddy? She asked sweetly.  I shivered.  Her smile spread around her lips again, the same smile that I saw on her last night.  You cant find your little darling?  Your little fucking darling?

Leah, this is

Your dog is DEAD. She deadpanned.  She took another step closer, her eyes boring into mine.  Your dog is DEAD, daddy.

No I started, because Spot was well, she was my best friend.

I killed her.  I broke her fucking neck.

No

Like Im going to listen to you saying no? Leah tilted her head to the side. Like you listened to me?

Honey?  Did you get her? Mary asked from the back door and I looked at her.  What are you doing?  Leave Kira and look for your dog!

I looked back at Leah, but she well, she wasnt there.  All that was left was the small dog.  I bent down and picked Kira up, but she didnt want to be in my arms.  She started to growl at me, and then she bit me!

Motherfu- I started, but Kira bit my hand again.  I dropped her, and she yowled.   She ran back to the flat  which was dark.  Leah was asleep, or she was gaming, but anyways she didnt hear it.  Kira almost fell over herself as she ran away from me.

Had I imagined Leah?

I strode to the flat and hammered on the door, screaming her name. Leah!  Leah, open up!

It took a few seconds before the door opened after her keys tingled as she unlocked the door.  Leah looked annoyed. WHAT?  Im slaying, dad!  Im gonna get play of the game and youre just fucking it up!

Leah had her wireless headphones on her head. Guys, one sec, okay? She said, and then she turned off her microphone. 

Were you just outside?

Seriously?  Daddy, Im slaying! She said, stomping her foot childishly.  What is it?  I looked down  she was wearing a pair of sweats and an oversized T-shirt.  It wasnt It wasnt what shed said just a minute ago.

Im looking for Spot. I said, ignoring the strangeness.  Maybe I was imagining things.

Oh, She said, turning the microphone back on.  I heard the sounds of gunshots and bombs being thrown. Guys, going AFK, give me a while. She took the headset off and set it on her laptop, where her avatar had died and had already respawned.

She walked next to me outside. Spot!

Spot!

Spot!

This went on for fifteen minutes.  

Leah looked in the street, Mary in the front yard and I looked in the back.  

And then I stumbled over her.  Over Spot.  The large dog was lying on the grass, and at first I was relieved.  Come, Spot!

But Spot didnt move.

Spot?

Spot was a happy dog, and she would wag her tail after she took a piss.  But she was lying still.

A light shone on Spot, courtesy of Mary  and I saw blood.  Spots throat had been slit.

LEAH! I yelled, WHAT DID YOU DO?

Leah came running.  She screamed when she saw Spot. Mom!  Mom!  Spot Mom, Spot.. And she started to sob.

I turned to her, took her by the shoulders and started to shake her. What did you do?  What did you do, you little bitch?

Daddy, please! Leah begged, sobbing harder.  I kept on shaking her small form, and she kept begging me to stop.

The next thing I knew was that my ankles were being bitten and I was looking up at my wife.

What?

You just told my daughter that she is an animal killer. Mary said icily. And she, understandably, knocked you out.  I know youre sad, but dont you ever do that again!

Mary looked at Spots body, before she picked up her own pup, the one nibbling at my ankles, and went inside.  Leah and Kira was gone.  The flat was alight now, but I heard the television.  Leah was glaring at me through the window.  I just knew it.
