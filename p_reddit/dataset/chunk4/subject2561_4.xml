	<TEXT> It depends, if you can use the airline credit every year and can make the most out of the bonus categories it might be worth it. 

I also generally recommend the Everyday card. It has no annual fee and can store your MR points longterm. There's currently a 15K/$1k offer via referral or 25K/$2k via incognito </TEXT>
