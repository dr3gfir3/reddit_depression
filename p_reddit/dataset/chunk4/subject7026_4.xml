	<TEXT> Cool! The second one I really liked, even though a totally different vibe than the first. Creepy mysterious bumbling bureaucracy.. Almost like modern day Kafka.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They even put signs on the little circular step stools saying not to sit on them. Let me tell you a secret, I still sit on them. 

They want the only seating to be in the cafe so you feel compelled to buy refreshments.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems a little tough OP.. Might as well give him Proust's In Search of Lost Time, lol. The classic science fiction novels mentioned by goodfellowgal- sound like good options.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Visitors to a bookshop in Cairo are being invited into a dark, soundproof room to scream at the top of their lungs in an effort to relieve their frustrations and escape from the stresses of daily life.

"I entered it at a time when I was really stressed and came out much more relaxed," said frequent visitor, Mohamed el-Debbaby.
"What's even better is that I was able to find solutions to the problem I was facing, those realizations came as I was screaming."

Hah, that's awesome.. I wouldn't mind one in my Barnes and Noble so I could scream each time they remove bookshelves to add more toys and other useless shit.

	<TEXT> "Scott Rudin and Eli Bush, who are producing Annihilation, will also produce Borne, which is expected to publish in May 2017. It's about a young woman named Rachel who lives in a near-future city littered with the remnants of a former biotech firm known as the Company. While Rachel is out scavenging, she brings back a green lump called Borne, which begins to "grow and change in unexpected ways.""

The new book sounds pretty cool! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If they wanted to give an award for music they should make a music category in my opinion. I guess it comes down to whether or not song lyrics are considered literature, which I think is a stretch. I mean I guess you can say song lyrics are poetry so it's ok, but really.. Just give literature awards to people who write books and poetry, and give music awards to people who make music. 

Also, I like Bob Dylan and all but don't know that I really agree that he reinvented music as some people were saying in the other thread. Folk music has been around for ever and was plenty popular before Dylan came around, he just decided to go electric and turn it into pop rock music, not that that's a bad thing. But still..  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Books that deal with the absurdity of life and society </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, basically, I'm looking to discuss and find more books that have this common theme. I've been reading Kafka (The Trial and The Castle) lately and just love him and his commentary on absurd bureaucracies and just life in general. I think I'm going to go for Catch 22 by Jospeh Heller next. Also I really liked a book called Satin Island by Tom McCarthy about a ridiculous corporate anthropologist. Camus's The Stranger also fits in here I think too. Also maybe some classic postmodern stuff like the Crying of Lot 49 by Pynchon and White Noise by DeLillo. I want more though! What are some good reads that make you feel the darkly funny absurdity of modern life? Doesn't even have to be humorous, just some good old existential dread is fine sometimes too!

Edit: Also really into all the funny and awkward social interactions between characters in Kafkas short stories!  </TEXT>
