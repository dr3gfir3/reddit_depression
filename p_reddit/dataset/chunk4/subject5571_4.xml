	<TEXT> We live on the second floor of a two story set of apartments where we have a 5x15m balcony area where we keep Sky's kennel. She only spends time out there when we're not home and the railing is far too high for her to jump.

The problem:

We absent mindedly moved her kennel against the railing underneath a bird feeder. Why not? She's not going to jump off our balcony into the garden below right?

The result was our 15 month old Whippet jumping up to get the birds and falling 26ft over the balcony railing to the garden below us. Luckily she hit a tree (lucky's not a great word to use) which broke her fall and every branch on the way down.

Ironically the reason we've been in and out of the vets the last few days wasn't because of broken bones. It's because she was then loose in our estate for about an hour until we came home where she ate a box of KFC chicken bones which have become stuck in her colon.

Three days and two enemas later she's a little sore and sedated but largely on the mend. When we realised that she'd fallen off the balcony, chicken bones were the last thing on our minds. Lesson learned.

Also were now considering pet insurance since our Whippet has about as much concern for her physical safety as John McClane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the schools are partially responsible. So is the education system. Schools widely acknowledge this and so does the education system. You clearly don't know what you are talking about if you are saying it's not the schools fault and that I am biased when I am merely repeating what all concerned parties already agree on. You can keep replying with your angry uninformed racist comments. There are people debating where the responsibilities lie with the travelling community but they don't use racist terms because they're intelligent to know that proper communication is the only way you get your point across. You on the other hand are on the fringes because you just want everyone to know how angry you are.

I'll say it again. Schools, teachers and the education system all recognise they have a responsibility in rectifying problems they have caused. You don't get to say that's wrong simply because you don't like it. The schools and government themselves would actually disagree with you. If you don't like travellers fine. You lose credibility when you say things that simply aren't true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've recently gotten married and have started to look ahead to family and kids and the one thing I don't have are pictures of me from birth to about 16. I'm not really about to just forget about them and move on becausw they're very important to me.

The issue is that I have been NC with my entire family for several years, I do not speak to anyone. A while back my NSister contacted me pleading to end the NC to which I simply did not respond.

I'm just wondering if any of you have experience with getting things back once going NC. I'm not afraid to ask but I worry that I'm (a) being hypocritical and (b) undermining the while idea of going NC by asking for the pictures. Any advice would be really appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The fact that you are using the phrase "knackers" shoes that you choose to use a derogatory phrase showing your bias and therefore lack any objective input.

Every educational training program from primary to secondary education (HDIP etc) supports this. I haven't plucked this out of the air.

It isn't the schools fault for their losses and problems. It's probably 50/50. But you've made top many assumptions for anything I say to matter. There are statistics and data that back up what I'm saying not some leftist rightist whatever stupid label you want to use movement.

At the end of the day. If you think you are justified in making a sweeping statement about a group of people that you don't know in its entirety then fine. I've spent my career on this. With regards to the educarion system im right here. Im not being emotive. Im just talking about statistics that every teacher and education officer understands. Typically people who use offensive language are not as informed on a single topic as others. You've shown your bias already by saying you hate them. You're as bad as the groups that wanted to exterminate the Jews or african or the Chinese. 

I don't want to have a row with you because clearly you've had bad experiences with travellers growing up so I can't deny what you've seen. But you're not approaching this argument objectively so you can't really make a valid statement on it.

I will discuss what I know happily but there's no point in calling a 6 year old or a 10 year old or a 45 year old youn dont know a term they find offensive because you're angry. You're Pont of view will never be heard if you only throw stones. Please chill a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're the sort of person that doesn't mind playing slightly dated graphics I would consider getting the trilogy. To be fair there are only certain parts of the first game (exploring worlds) where you might question the graphics but it's not something you really notice either.

Personally I found the series to be fantastic. A brilliant story arc with fairly decent RPG elements. I found the good/evil aspect to be fairly meaningless outside of individual questions choices and personal preference. But I'm nitpicking and others may disagree. 

Play from start to finish. The best aspect of the game is how your save from each prior game can be uploaded to the next. So how you finished ME1 can unlock unique aspects to the next game. So something small you did in ME1 can decide whether a particular companion is alive or not in ME3. 

So yeah. </TEXT>

I have noticed that she has the weirdest way of sitting down, on the tail itself sometimes, so the cause may simply be mechanical. </TEXT>

Management have a small remote with a prepaid sim card that activates the barrier instantly. Seeing as we're all using the same number, is there a way to modify my android to do the same thing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not so bad. I'm OK with change and I understand that this needs to happen in order for the series to progress.

From both sides it seems that the biggest issue was the dialogue. That's disappointing tbh. But after a while in NV I would skip a lot of that when I knew what was being said.

I found changes like that a but Jarring in other series too, Dragon age for one threw me but I love them now.

I'll have to play it for myself to see but I'm the sort of fan that thinks Canon is Canon so we need to suck it up and find a way to love the game because I love the series. Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How on earth could they do away with the skill tree? What's the point in specialising now? It's just another shooter game then. I feel like this is a step towards making the series more populist like they did with Skyrym. In NV your build didn't just affect how well you did in every mission from start to finish but also decided which path you would take either. I'm really surprised by this because with the reintroduction of a proper faction system I hoped they were moving back towards the depth we got from 1   2. Ruined my day this has. </TEXT>
