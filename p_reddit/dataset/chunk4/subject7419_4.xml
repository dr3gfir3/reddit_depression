It looks like "COAST TO COAST" is on the bumper, "PEARL" is on the building and I think it says "PEARL BORAX SOAP" on the truck.

	<TEXT> You are easily impressed. Those are 1 megapixel jpegs. The original photos were shot with a hand-held 35mm camera using Kodak Tri-X film. The equivalent digital resolution that film and camera setup was capable of is debatable but is probably in the neighborhood of 5 megapixels. At that time, with the right camera, film and lighting, you could get probably get photos equivalent to about 50 megapixels. </TEXT>
