	<TEXT> Not good. From what i hear, lag seem to be the biggest problem in other countries besides U.S AND U.K. ..dont waste ur time, unless Activision buys dedicated servers for countries like switzerland, new zealand, united arab emirates, aus and india..dont bother.  They dont care. No consistent matches and horrible lag.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello ALL, please tell me HOW you got your bloodthirstys for this gun. I'm a decent top scoring solo player 90% on my team. I've gotten all my guns and knife diamond EXCEPT the argus. This mother fucking pain in the ass gun is frustrating the fuck out of me. I played about 2 weeks str8 and still haven't even got 1 bloodthirsty yet. I get trips consistently and the occasional 4 piece dinner, but the final kill never comes. I always get spawn flipped, lag spiked, latency,  outgunned, hitmarkered, no ammo, choked, wrong button, annihilated, katnissed, electricuted, tubed, naded, knifed, mistakes were made, c4'd, trip mined, semtexed, streak'd   my personal favorite, team killed and never get that 5th kill. I play HC only, gung ho for hip fire, dead silence, 6th sense, ghost,  fast hands and awareness. Please help. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dark Matter toggle HUD </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-23 16:59:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all, I know going after darkmatter can be a bit frustrating. Sometimes people don't know how good they did with a specific weapon until after a match is over until they see the medals and try and figure out what challeneges are left to complete that specific gun. What if treyarch had a DM toggle that users can enable in options that if they select a specific gun, there is a small hud on the upper right hand corner of the screen that will display, in real time, how many headshots are left or how many more bloodthirstys, kills left to complete that specific gun. Its kind of a hassell to wait til the end of the match to view earned medals and then go into the gun camo option to see what challenges are left. Also, I find it very ridiculous that all the other challenges are locked until the headshots and one shot one kills are completed. Sometimes when I'm on a streak with a good lobby, i get multiple bloodthirstys, but they don't count because i haven't gotten my 100 headshots yet. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> People have said that adding every game mode would dilute the playerbase in mutiple playlist that would cause longer match making. Okay, but why keep playlist/game mode that no one plays in the game still? People cant find matches. Here's what to do, for 2 weeks, add all the gamemodes that people have been asking for. At the end of every match for the duration, add a message that says " did u enjoy this playlist? " let the people vote. After the 2 weeks. Just permanently add in the most voted/populated playlist. Yay or nay? </TEXT>
