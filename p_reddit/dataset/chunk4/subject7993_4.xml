Your parents promise you a puppy. You Dad gets back from the pet store and parks across the street.  You're standing on the front porch and you see the dog in the car window. Your Dad opens the car door. The dog jumps out and runs to you.  You're so happy. The dog gets hit by a passing bus.  The dog is gone and you never got to even touch him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You make good points, I guess I was being overly critical. I agree with you about the suspensions.  However I think they're just trying to be honest. For example the Pacioretty/Chara hit (watch the video) If he immediately pops back to his feet it's not the sh*tstorm it turned out to be.  Although he didn't get any suspension and  I thought he was dead, so nevermind. I can't defend the NHL on this point. 

I'd make a terrible lawyer...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First this has NOTHING to do with the John Scott situation. I think it's great. 

The All-Star game = joke (admittedly I don't have a solution to this one) 

The yearly awards = same people every year or deserving people overlooked *cough Babcock/Shea Weber* = joke

Hall of fame = everyone gets in = joke 

Coaching  = "old boys network" carousel  = joke

Referees = situational calls = joke

Fighting (for some not me)  = joke

Lockout/Strike every time the CBA is up = joke (get ready for 2020)

I love the game but there's a reason it's as  not popular as it should be. 

Go Habs Go! </TEXT>
