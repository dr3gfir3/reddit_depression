	<TEXT> I've tinkered with my public transport and now up to nearly 15,500 from 93,000. I think I may have gone bus route crazy in some areas (small district loops to metro stops) but they seem to be working. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Out of your total population how many Cims use public transport? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> At the moment my first proper city (its working well, just ugly as sin - much like me!) has around 92,000 Cims, of that 92,000 around 13,400 use public transport. So roughly 1 in 6.9 Cims use my public transport system (including a few hundred tourists). I wondered if this is a good number or if others have got a higher number of Cims using theirs transport systems compared to overall population and any tips for getting more Cims to use it.

I use small "district" bus lines that go to either a transport hub which links in with metro and trains or just to metro stops. I have tried to keep my metro lines linear but think I may have too many stops. The only people who tend to take my trains are tourists weirdly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ahh I didn't realise that. Makes it a little more tricky but I suppose with unlimited money things should be easy to solve if I plan well enough at the start.  </TEXT>
