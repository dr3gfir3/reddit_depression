	<TEXT> Im a bit late to this thread but here goes:

Better research system. I heard that was some changes coming in 1.2 but i havnt seen that. 

a much better management system for employees. have them ask for a raise instead of complaining about pay and eventually quit. there were wage negotiations in theme park 20 years ago... im not asking for a minigame, but it just feels weird to quit before asking for more money?

Maybe have a system where employees have work schedules, call in sick or whatever, so you might need to spend more money on wages, because you'd need a few excess staff, for when times are busy. 

maybe have the day/night system matter, in terms of how busy the park is. during the early hours and mid-day, maybe there are more families with children. and during the afternoon and evening, we see the older crowd staying around. 

Have some types of food/drink shops be more interesting to different types of people - depending on the time of day. Donuts in the morning and tacos in the evening, or something. this means you might wanna have multiple stores of multiple types all over the park, depending on the time of day, the employee management system could close down donut shops at 18:00 and open the more dinner-related stores or go home (to save a few bucks - this might be important to adjust on harder difficulties)

I'm just basically kinda bored with only building my park. i find that the "game" is lacking a lot, and i've not played the game since january </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check to see if the windows (And outter doors) are closing properly. air might be coming right in through shitty windows. thats expensive (in heat/aircon)

come by at night to see if there's much noise (nearby disco for example or very party-like neighbours)

check your cell reception (and a friend/partners reception, if they have a different carrier)

Check if you can have proper internet speeds

ideally check if theres mold (bulging wallpaper, weird smells etc). I just drilled some holes to wallmount something, and i drilled straight into a brick wall, and it was very mushy, on the left side (e.g. dust didn't fly out, but rather the drill was just sticky). That wall is shared with the bathroom... thats a bad sign i think. luckily im planning on moving soon, and its a rented apartment, and im not responsible for any walls internal damage

something handy to notice too is.. check if there's wall outlets in all rooms (preferably multiple). there isn't were i live. its very annoying...

and ask if you're allowed to drill into all walls etc. having limitations can be frustrating. It's rare though as far as i know. but i've heard of some people having to pay X per hole drilled into dry wall, even though they rented the house for a fortune for 6 years.. this meant they didn't hang up many pictures. tv used a stand and they only had 1 ceiling mounted lamp.

rather than... whatever amount of "traditional" solar panels you mount on your roof?

lets say, the flower costs... 1000 bucks, gives you let's just say 500 KWh

and for 1000 bucks, panels on your roof... do they give more or less? you could probably get MORE panels, that each produce less. but overall? </TEXT>
