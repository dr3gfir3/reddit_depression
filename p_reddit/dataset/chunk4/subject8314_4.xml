	<TEXT> Family vacation to Hawaii with my mom, dad, younger brother and older sister. We're out on a nature walk with a tour group coming back from some sacred waterfall. Out of nowhere, my Dad just rips ass, and it's loud. Like the sound of a chainsaw roaring to life. To this day, about 10 years later, I feel so bad for the older couple that was walking right behind him.  </TEXT>
