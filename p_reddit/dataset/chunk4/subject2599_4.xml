	<TEXT> Worth the click-thru. Especially Greenwald's point that, even if you're not fond of what Trump represents, this is *very* much the wrong way to go about doing something about it.

There is a real danger here that this maneuver can harshly backfire, to the great benefit of Trump and to the great detriment of those who want to oppose him. If any of the significant claims in this dossier turn out to be provably false  such as Cohens trip to Prague  many people will conclude, with Trumps encouragement, that large media outlets (CNN and BuzzFeed) and anti-Trump factions inside the government (CIA) are deploying Fake News to destroy him. In the eyes of many people, that will forever discredit  render impotent  future journalistic exposs that are based on actual, corroborated wrongdoing.

Beyond that, the threat posed by submitting ourselves to the CIA and empowering it to reign supreme outside of the democratic process is  as Eisenhower warned  an even more severe danger. The threat of being ruled by unaccountable and unelected entities is self-evident and grave. Thats especially true when the entity behind which so many are rallying is one with a long and deliberate history of lying, propaganda, war crimes, torture, and the worst atrocities imaginable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cat Brooks, the author and head of Anti-Police Terror Project writes,

An *Express* reader also hinted that APTP  and I  condone physical violence. We not only emphatically condemn violence against the people, we regularly step into violent situations to protect the health and lives of people at our demonstrations.

This is true. I've seen it myself. Both during planning and at demonstrations.

As a result, sometimes the violence is perpetrated against us. Despite this, we know we cannot rely on police to keep us safe. *Far too often we've witnessed them standing in close proximity to violence (and vandalism)  and doing absolutely nothing. It is the protestors  every time  who intervene to protect the people.* This is yet another example of why APTP believes we must replace systems of policing with community-driven alternatives that restore power and security to the people themselves.

Every time I've seen vandals, they've been overwhelmingly younger (under thirties) and White. Arrest records show they're overwhelmingly from the suburbs, not Da Town. Without even getting into the *agent prevocateur* aspects.

So, point your online rage at the victimizers, not the victims, folks. 

And, if you prefer communities where no one protests and there are no mass, peaceful assemblies, ask yourself why you live here. It's been a part of Bay Area history longer than I've been alive. Perhaps longer than you, too. </TEXT>

First, the sheriff's office handed him over to ICE, then later claimed that it was [defendant] Chris Kim who had violated the terms of the custody alternative program. They said this was because Kim didn't check in with his sheriff's specialist. But that was only due to the fact that he was being held in jail by ICE 

There are others like Kim who have been lured to the sheriff's office in Martinez, under the pretense of a routine check-in, and then tricked and handed over to deportation officers. </TEXT>

Fast forward to 2016, and Tigas found himself living in New York City, working as a developer and investigative journalist at ProPublica, while earning upwards of $2,000 a month from the appand worrying that charging for it was keeping anonymous browsing out of the hands of people who needed it.

So a few weeks ago, he made the app free. Since then, its popularity has exploded, with thousands of downloads recorded every day. The results of the recent US presidential election might have had something to do with this decision, and its impressive results, Tigas told Ars.

If the iOS Onion Browser passes muster, it's great news that the author made it free. Pretty nice of him to walk away from the $2,000/mo he was getting for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At the time, nobody knew the company's repair technicians routinely searched customers' devices for files that could earn them $500 windfalls as FBI informants. This case produced that national revelation 

But the biggest issue remains whether Geek Squad technicians acted as secret law-enforcement agents and, thus, violated Fourth Amendment prohibitions against warrantless government searches. Riddet claims records show "FBI and Best Buy made sure that during the period from 2007 to the present, there was always at least one supervisor who was an active informant." He also said, "The FBI appears to be able to access data at [Best Buy's main repair facility in Brooks, Kentucky] whenever they want." Calling the relationship between the agency and the Geek Squad relevant to pretrial motions, Carney approved Riddet's request to question agents under oath.

The defense lawyer believes the case was built on a false premise that should frighten all Americans. "While it may be that 'Jenny' appears in other photos which are child pornography, *none of those photos were observed on [Rettenmaier's] hard drive,*" Riddet observed. 

"The critical point here is that the image which was viewed and described in the search warrant is not an image of child pornography."

So, $500 "windfalls", not bounties. 

And the defendant didn't have child porn, but FBI agents lied that he did, lied how they got it and lied *under oath* about whether the defendant knew he had the file in an area on his hard drive that required forensic, data-scraping software to access. All of which is material enough that the entire case is getting national coverage and will most likely result in the (non) case being dismissed.

Meanwhile, the FBI can't manage to prevent a shooter that walks into one of their offices from murdering a bunch of people in Texas. Because they're involved in this sort of behavior.

Thanks for the clarification. I'm *so* relieved!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He was apparently referring to the NBC News write-up of what was actually a leak to the Washington Post, which reported on Thursday about the contents of a new Obama administration report describing alleged efforts by the Russian government to influence the U.S. election.

Setting aside the issue of whether the search of Rettenmaier's computer constituted an illegal search by private individuals acting as government agents, the FBI undertook a series of dishonest measures in hopes of building a case, according to James D. Riddet, Rettenmaier's San Clemente-based defense attorney. *Riddet says agents conducted two additional searches of the computer without obtaining necessary warrants, lied to trick a federal magistrate judge into authorizing a search warrant, then tried to cover up their misdeeds by initially hiding records.*

So the bounty-seeking Geek Squad individual's "accidental" claim needs to be taken with a mountain of salt. 

Beyond which, once the bounty-claiming person (and his manager: hey, share the wealth!) phoned authorities and had them cart away the computer, they'd run it against hash collections.

The original article also points out the (yucky, for sure!) photo in question was in the database not because it was obscene, but it was part of a collection of (yucky!) photos entered into the database because *some* of those were obscene.

Face it: it's pretty damned skeevy. Our law enforcement has better ways of behaving, no? </TEXT>

Then there's "My HD crashed so please, *please* run super-low-level forensic carving techniques, including areas I don't even know exist since they're created autonomously without conscious thought."

Followed by, "Oh, and can you run all 400,000 files against an FBI database and forward any matches to them? Be sure to collect any bounties  in fact make sure your manager gets his cut, too! *Thanks,* Geek Squad!*" 

Another thing that's alarming about this is, it wasn't a photo that was flagged b/c it was obscene. It was a part of a collection of photos, some of which  but not this one  was. 

Another alarming thing? He's looking at tens of thousands in legal fees, plus whatever replacement costs for his computer(s) that he had, as well. All that's gone, regardless of how the case turns out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Schiller pushed back when I suggested that the iPhones great moment came when Apple threw open the gates to developers and we learned that for every imaginable activity, as well as some previously unimaginable ones, there was an app for that.

That undervalues how earth-shattering the iPhone was when it first came to market, and we all first got them and fell in love with them, he says. **iPhone made the idea of a smartphone real. It really was a computer in your pocket. The idea of real internet, real web browser, MultiTouch. There were so many things that are core to what is the smartphone today, that created a product that customers fell in love with, that then also demanded more stuff on them, more apps.**

So, simply because your CC transactions can be used to isolate an account doesn't mean everyone should give up all hope that all their information will be gathered by everyone concerning their entire family, regardless of how harmful it is to them. Your DOB, ZIP code and sex are another means of identification that is surprisingly effective (so, don't give those out willy-nilly if you're concerned).

Check out /r/Privacy for other tips and suggestions. There's no magic bullet but there are reasonable trade-offs to be made.

	<TEXT> The point of this article isn't to say that countries can't make rules for what's permissible within their borders (they can), or that Apple should refuse (they largely can't, at least solo).

But rather, that we should look beyond the headlines and see *many* tech companies do this. It's unfair to single out Apple. With the inference that if all the companies had a united front of minimal standards, nations might be more wary of making laws that work against their people.

Sort of like how many companies and sites switched to HTTPS. This change made it difficult to censor individual articles since authoritarian countries could either block the entire site or allow dissenting opinions to be heard. No more cherry-picking.

Then it goes into a database which can then be used by employers serving the public to see if they're hiring people who put their customers at risk. In fact, since: public safety, it's *really* cheap!

But your comment reminds me of a funny story. 

Uber had the chance to do this, but refused. Even though every other taxi service provider has done this for decades  required to, in fact. "Disruption", biyatches!

Then more than several assaults/rapes/robberies later, Uber was forced to do *something*. So they cheaped out with a vastly lower quality "security check". Then they charged each customer an extra $2.00 per ride as their "safety fee". 

LOL. What pranksters!

TL; DR: it's not about your safety as a customer, since there are better tools that Uber refuses to use already. Uber is building up a compelled biometric database for future commercialization. This is separate and apart from Uber's "security check" (which is largely, tack on an extra $2/ride and call it a day) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why have privacy online and where did the notion of Real Names as a palliative to reduce harassment come from? Did it work? Does it? What should we do with design going forward?

These an other questions are explored in this excellent academic paper. Its cites are also worth exploring.

People often say that online behavior would improve if every comment system forced people to use their real names. It sounds like it should be true  surely nobody would say mean things if they faced consequences for their actions?

Yet the balance of experimental evidence over the past thirty years suggests that this is not the case. Not only would removing anonymity fail to consistently improve online community behavior  forcing real names in online communities could also increase discrimination and worsen harassment.

We need to change our entire approach to the question. Our concerns about anonymity are overly-simplistic; system design cant solve social problems without actual social change. </TEXT>

I approved it then removed the post again after I checked your GitHub. 

I'll leave a note in the Mod queue for Lugh to scope out, but for now, for me, I'm not comfortable with this part. The rest seems pretty cool though!

Lugh: does the concept work? If you have a single VPN for one network (home), will this protect? I also leave this part to your excellent judgement. :) </TEXT>

This assumes, of course, that all software works flawlessly and no bugs ever exist. Ever.

And, you *really* want to avoid situations where you might have a legal case to begin with. Life is too short (and lawyers too expensive) to spend four years on proving. Let alone nuking your references. But, you *can* use that as an excuse for them to buy their own device if they want control over that device. Companies like to avoid legal landmines, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's a employer-demanded App for a phone used for work, then the employer needs to buy the phone and pay the coverage fees.

Then, use that phone with App, since both are their property. Shut if off (if you can) when not on the clock.

To be fair, as an ISP technician, you're a **very** tempting target for agencies, hackers, etc. So it's not unreasonable for them to want to make sure you haven't been compromised.

____

Fun fact: if your employer offers to pay for your personal phone's plan, they own the account. Thus anyone, including them, can peer into your digital soul. If offered, politely decline ~~(or take some form of general rebate/payment/comp time that's not as direct)~~

____

Ah, they are subsidizing you $50/mo. Technically, this means they can't force you to install an App on your phone that you're paying 50% of the service on. 

See how slippery slopes work, class? 

Loop back to step #1: Politely refuse their offer to subsidize your account and ask they buy you a cheap work phone and plan. Blame it on imaginary significant others laying down the law that *No strangers are going to be able to steal OUR CHILDRENS PHOTOS to gawk over  EVER!*, regardless of what you tell him/her. Or nieces. Or cats. Whatever. 

Thus for the sake of household peace and placating adorably ignorant (but insistent) SOs, you'd just as soon have them supply a work phone/plan of their choosing. </TEXT>

And, even those who know vaguely that Facebook is Satan may not be aware of the specifics. Or have friends that need to be convinced, so these kinds of articles help do that.

Same with Windows, especially Windows 10. But see, again, maybe some folks know about Windows 10 but not about FB. We **love** helping people connect the dots. Like vampires enjoying the sight of a long, unprotected neck (but with less scarring and probably more garlic).

I'd be cautious about ascribing Apple working with companies in sneaky ways that would compromise their users and their privacy. Their one "bad rep" among App developers   advertisers is they aren't "open" enough  that is, as middleman between 1st   3rd parties, they use tokens or refuse to hand over personally-identifiable information.

Bad for these developers but good for privacy and those using Apple's ecosystem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, all 

So, there are a couple Subs that focus on digital rights and privacy. 

* /r/Europrivacy

* /r/NSALeaks

* /r/Privacy

* /r/PrivacyToolsIO

* /r/Snowden

As an experiment, we're exploring if we could share talent and resources to create a shared FAQ that allows each group to start with a baseline version, that each Sub could then modify. Ideally this will provide easier updates, version control, extra features and all kinds of things we haven't thought of yet.

This is our workspace. We decided to open it up to everyone. More transparent. Educational if you're wondering how the sausage is made. A **great** way for you to volunteer your opinion and expertise, if you'd like (c'mon in, the volunteering water's just fine!)

We have an amazingly talented group of people working on our FAQs, so if you get a moment, please give them a round of applause (and perhaps a comment or two!) </TEXT>
