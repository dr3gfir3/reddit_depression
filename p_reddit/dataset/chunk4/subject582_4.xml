	<TEXT> TLDR; Mets met with American Indian Community House and NativeOne financial of wall street to host a "Native American Day" on June 25. The event was planned for months and was scheduled on the day the Mets played the Braves. Out of nowhere, the Mets decide that it's probably a bad idea to associate the Native American Day with the Braves, and feared it would strike backlash with people with the wrong idea. The Mets had the bright idea of canceling the main events, singing and dancing and a video before the game. HOWEVER, they still offered the charity funds to go through with and to keep the title of the day, but without the celebration, just to keep the deal in place. Therefore, the Native American Community drew back on the plans out of frustration, and the Mets screwed up a good business deal/charity event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can vouch for this! My current boyfriend was pretty direct with me, and he straight up told me he was attracted to me and that he wanted to get to know me when I came home from school. I was very flattered by this, and his whole brave approach (later on he admitted he was very shy and nervous to at first, thought I was going to reject him) really turned me onto him in the beginning. It shows you want it. Go for it! From the sounds of it, you will have her smiling like a fool at the request. Wishing the best!

	<TEXT> Just be the adult and tell her if she is going to manage living with others, she's going to have to find a way to be at peace with the others. She needs to grow up. You need to get ballsy and tell her to put up or shut up. Especially do it for the other three, if they are your close friends. </TEXT>
