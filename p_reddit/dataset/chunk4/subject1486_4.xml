	<TEXT> I heard of a house of stoners who had a game called "hide the poo", which is pretty self explanatory...
Anyway, one of them took out the entire contents of a spreadable butter tub, took a shit in it, and filled it back up with the butter. Weeks later after they'd reached the "brown butter" they finally realised...

You should have done that to her. </TEXT>

When in doubt, ask the internet.

EDIT: They actually look awful. But I'm a freak who prefers fruit and vegetables over just about everything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was actually "uncorrect", I like your sneaky editing there. If it was right in the first place, I wouldn't have corrected you, because I'm not an idiot. I notice you actually edited it to say "incorrect", now. Nice work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I personally have no idea why people have this fear of "sounding homosexual"... Having to add a disclaimer so people know you don't sway that way is just adding to the crazy misconception that any gay man, upon thinking another man is gay, is immediately going to want to crack on to them.
It's like, I'm a straight woman (most of the time), and yeah there are attractive men around, but having the same sexual orientation as a potential mate isn't enough of a reason for me to pursue or sleep with them. .
Gay people have standards just like everyone else :/

P.S. Not trying to be all personal I'm just venting what I think :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ^ Has clearly never had a healthy relationship with a woman .
Not all women are man-haters, not all men are mysogynists. It's people like you who are the reason there's still sexism around the place (both ways, not just towards ladies) </TEXT>
