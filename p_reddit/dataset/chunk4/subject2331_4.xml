I have seen a lot of my Facebook friends share things about presidential candidates that aren't necessarily true. Please correct them. Nicely, of course. Provide a link disproving their information. 

I'm tired of Bernie supporters getting called stupid. Don't be the reason. 

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think so. Aside from him wanting anal, he's never expressed the desire to do anything else. We're pretty vanilla, lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no problem with him watching anal porn, it's just not for me. As for getting with another woman, he will NEVER have my permission to do that. If he finds the need to seek it elsewhere, then he will lose out on a lot more than anal from me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I could never let my husband have sex with another person. I've made my own sacrifices for him as well. I'm bisexual, and would like to have sex with women, but my husband says he would want to join in. I could never watch him with another woman, and I'm sure it would be the same for him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually said that to him, "how would you like it if I stuck it in your ass?" And he's no opposed to trying it. But I am. I feel like it would make me see him as less of man if I dominate him like that. Plus, I just really don't want to go near his butt hole </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [anal] Husband wants anal and I don't </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Title stays it all. 

I have absolutely no desire to have anything in my ass. Not fingers. Not toys. Not dicks. If I'm watching porn and anal pops up, I immediately close that video and find another one. It actually makes me cringe. 

My husband really wants to do anal with me. He says he'll be gentle and slow, work his way up... I don't fucking care! He brings it up all the time and I constantly tell him no. 

I've talked to a few people about it and they say(as well as my husband) "if you've never tried it, how do you know you won't like it?" Does the fact that it makes me shiver and want to gag not mean a thing?

I'm kind of just ranting here, but I don't know how to handle this anymore. We've been married for 2 years and this has been the subject of many of our fights. I don't know how many other ways to say no.

TL:DR husband wants anal and I don't.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say try and continue to get to know her and ease into telling her. You shouldn't be ashamed of who you are. If she isn't willing to accept who you are, she's not really worth it.

Why would your life in grad school be over? If you've gone on for however long and no one has noticed or mentioned it, I'm sure it will remain the same, barring a few odd looks. Best of luck!  </TEXT>
