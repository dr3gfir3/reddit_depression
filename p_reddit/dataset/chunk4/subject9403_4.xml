	<TEXT> Awesome! Facts and evidence are what brought me to the light as well! (Former Never Trump) For some more ammo to defend your new position, check out these articles:  
  
First the NYT writes about Bill Clinton in scandal for golfing at Whites Only golf club:  
http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/21/us/the-1992-campaign-democrats-clinton-says-golfing-at-all-white-club-was-mistake.html  
  
Meanwhile, Trump is fighting to include Jews and Blacks at his own golf course:  
http://truthfeed.com/trump-insisted-on-including-jews-and-blacks-at-palm-beach-golf-course-in-1990s-when-others-didnt/10528/  
  
Finally, Trump was falsely accused of Mocking a disabled reporter, but the media spun the story. This article provides balance:

	<TEXT> For me it was a growing distrust of the MSM agenda.  
I was #NeverTrump for up until 2 weeks ago. I used to love seeing Trump get raked over the coals in popular leftist media shows, but after a while I got suspicious that they never called out Hillary on *anything*. So I decided to look into Trump and found out he made a ton of sense, more than Crooked does, and he is not the monster media paints him as. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 2 Things did it for me:  
One was when a good friend of mine was falsely accused of raping a girl in his freshman year of college. After a gruellingly long process, he was finally deemed innocent of all wrongdoing, but he still lost all his scholarships, was expelled from school, and had his name smeared all over town to the point that he went into deep depression and social anxiety for years.  
  
Second was when a church in my hometown fired a pastor for having an affair with a member of the worship team. He voluntarily came clean and confessed to his family and the church, and lost his job, friendships, and any chance of a future position. The female involved? Her identity was kept secret from the congregation, she was absolved of all wrong-doing, and allowed to continue leading music. </TEXT>
