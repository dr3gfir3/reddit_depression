	<TEXT> It's so frustrating to live outside NA and therefore be unable to get the red bull codes. They are going to be so useful when TK drops </TEXT>

	<TEXT> allegedly they are going to make the TTK collectors edition extras (3x Exotic class items, 3x shaders, emotes etc.) available to people who have the original game, TDB   HOW. I read somewhere about it being a $20/20 fee to get the extras. Sounds like it was just digital items though, nothing physical. 

Assuming this is correct that would mean you can get the normal TTK and this package for a total of $60/60 minus the physical items.

I'll see if I can find the article I read and link it.

	<TEXT> depends if you're bothered about collecting exotics. I personally would go BoE as you have less chances to drop them. Weapons are much more likely to drop IMO, you have the chest/atheon drops in VOG for weapons, the deathsinger/crota drops in CE, nightfalls, POE chest etc. </TEXT>
