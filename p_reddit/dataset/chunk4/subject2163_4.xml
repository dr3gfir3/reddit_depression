	<TITLE> Bad MOBO? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Woke up this morning and tried to turn on my PC just to find out I'm getting no power. PSU doesn't kick on, no fans, nothing. At first I thought it was the PSU until I took it out and tested it. First I jumped the green and a black wire and the fan kicked on. I then tested each lead coming off the 24 pin connector and my molex connectors and all the voltages were correct I hooked up my case fans to the PSU and they all started up fine. I think I've narrowed it down to the MOBO but I've never heard of a motherboard just dying like that which has me second guessing myself. Any thoughts would be extremely appreciated! </TEXT>
