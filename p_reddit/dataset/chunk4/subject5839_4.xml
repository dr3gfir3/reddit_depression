	<TEXT> damn, thanks for the elaborated answer dude. I love it ! and I'll make sure to ask you whenever I need some kind of help.. But the thing is, my end goal is to reach 99s EVENTUALLY! but I'd like to PVP alot sooner than that. so should I just level with a canon? or is that unecessary? 

once again. thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! So last time I played RS is when I was very young and now I'm 19 and felt the nostalgia which made me play again (but this time I know what I'm doing). I have started a pure and currently my stats are :

Attack: 41 (Goal: 60)
Strength: 42 ( Goal: 99)
Prayer: 18 (Goal : 52)
Defence: 1 (Goal: 1)
Ranged: 1 (Goal: 99)
Magic:1 (Goal 99)

But here's the problem!
I don't understand how to level up RANGE and MAGIC since so many people are telling me different things. People tell me that I made a mistake since I need to level up RANGE and MAGIC first because otherwise they will raise my combat level?

Can someone tell me just how I should do? Is there a special method I need to follow when leveling RANGE and MAGIC to not contribute to Combat level? Some people even tell me to level range with a Cannon so I don't get combat level.. but some people say that is  a bad method since I wont get any hitpoints. Some people even tell me that I shouldn't level RANGE and MAGIC at all because that is not a PURE. my head is spinning....

so please, can someone confirm for me how I can level magic and range the right way? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes. Thank you for the links!
I think I need to do both of these things. 
I need to stay in training mode for a while, because I feel like I'm geting matched with people that ARE much more competentet than Me. </TEXT>
