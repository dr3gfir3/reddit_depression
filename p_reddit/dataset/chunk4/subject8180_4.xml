	<TEXT> Hey there, and thanks for the warm welcome and advice on my first post!

I just wanted to reach out to any furries up in the UK, specifically towards the North, since I've looked all over the internet and there are barely any meets or communities for us up here and it makes me sad... I need furry friends :(
If any of you are up North (or anywhere else in the UK, I'm not too bothered) I would love to chat to you and get to know one another because whilst this is such a lovely community I feel like were lurking in the shadows over here and we need to expand a little more! :)

	<TEXT> Hey, 
Recently I have been incredibly interested in this community, but unlike most, I haven't been super interested in anthros pretty much at all until viewing some of the fantastic art you guys make. I really really like the atmosphere of this community, but I'm not sure that's because it makes me feel like I belong with some relatively like minded people (furries generally share common interests from what I've seen, eg games, art, Internet culture etc) or because I'm actually interested in the rest of the fandom. I'm not sure what I am classified as, as I can still really appreciate the art for what it is but I don't have this deep seeded desire to be an animal like a few others I've met seem to have. I can see the appeal of making an alternate version if yourself (I'm in the process of making my own :P) but that's about all I'm interested in save for the art and the general friendly vibe the community holds, and the feeling of being part of a lovely group of like minded people. 
If anyone could clarify, I'd be really appreciated, as I'm not too sure where to go from here :S </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have one, and I'm not the sharpest shot in the world since I recently switched to being a righty from being a lefty my whole life... Will this hinder my enjoyment of the game? For example, I can still enjoy Overwatch without having pinpoint accuracy because of the variety of roles and tactics that I can play, and Siege looked similar in that regard; Will sound awareness outplay a well placed shot?
Thanks for your reply! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard good things about both of these titles, although I'm on a relatively tight budget and I'm not sure which one to pick!
Mainly looking for replay value and fun factor, which I've heard both of these have.
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In regards to what u/J03130 said, I have enlarged my minimap, but I find it incredibly tough to plan routes and determine enemy locations simply because of how awful the terrain texture looks. I know this is subjective, but I rarely find myself using the minimap for anything other than objective directions. :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying out support and I love the playstyle, although like you pointed out, I dont tend to move too much... I also get a bad case of tunnel vision most of the time which ends with me being melee'd or sniped from an angle I wasnt expecting.
If you can offer any support-specific tips I would be incredibly grateful!
(its also nice to know im not the only one who doesnt mind so much about my k/d haha) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did think about movement being the issue, but no matter how much I duck and weave, I always end up getting killed. :( 
And that would be great :)

	<TEXT> The issue is I rank up too slowly to be able to 'try out' anything. I feel like I need to get 'the best' weapon for each class rather than the one that fits me simply because it takes me so long to rank, and I dont want to waste WBs. </TEXT>
