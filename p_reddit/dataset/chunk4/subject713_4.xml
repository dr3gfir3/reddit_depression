	<TEXT> It's the media bro. Galveston is in the Houston media market. Flesh eating bacteria makes great headlines. Look up the number of cases along the entire coastline. You'll be surprised by how many are not in Galveston.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Galvestonian here to call you and the other people assholes. Don't come to Galveston expecting it to be Destin and Cabo. Hell, not even South Padre. That's not what we're all about. We're a historic town that has developed a character unmatched anywhere in Texas. Yes we have our problems, not going to say we don't, but it's an amazing town with awesome people. Everyone is so nice, it is a way more accepting community than the surrounding mainland. It has the BEST children's burn unit in the WORLD. It also has the ability to deal with the highest classification of diseases. (I know that isn't brochure material) To continue, we have 5+ city wide festivals that bring over 1,000,000 visitors to the island each year!

The water isn't brown, it's clear. There is sediment from the Mississippi River. 

So if you don't like, get the fuck out, and please stop bashing my hometown. I've lived my whole life letting WASP from the burbs tell me how terrible my city is. 

Ps. Friday night it only cost 20$ to get you and your friend hammered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time a cop came to my house to ask me to move my vehicle because I parked it in a handicapped spot on the street that was so poorly marked he understood, when I opened the door the smell of pot went flying out the door. He gave me the look of "oh you're fucked." He then asked me if I had graduated college and had a job. I said yes, which is true. He then, very matter-of-factly, "There is the two different things, there is the law, and there is the spirit of the law. Please move your car and have a wonderful evening." And he left. 

What a wonderful man that gets it. 

I'm from Texas, ungodly anti-marijuana state (at the government level, most citizens want legalization, but you know... Texas)  </TEXT>
