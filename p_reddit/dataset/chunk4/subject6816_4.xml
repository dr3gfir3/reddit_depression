	<TEXT> I see this mentality time and time again. Cities are naturally a dynamic, constantly changing beast. You don't get to dictate what kind of "charm" you want to remain in the city. You don't get to dictate what kind of "feel" the neighborhood has. 

The only thing you have power over is your own property, and that's it. If a town/city changes and you don't like those changes, you have every right to move somewhere that better fits your preferences. 

This NIMBY mentality of trying to force the current locals' preferences and therefore jacking up prices and blocking transit that would improve traffic, is just colossally arrogant and selfish. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far Android Messages fits #1 and Hangouts Meet/Chat fits #3 from [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/5ra3sx/google_allo_drops_off_the_top_500_apps_chart_on/dd5uoaz/). Not sure how Allo is going to fit into this streamlined messaging direction they're going. I'd rather they just fold Allo into Android Messages and go headfirst into the RCS approach. </TEXT>
