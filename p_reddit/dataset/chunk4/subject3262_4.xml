	<TEXT> My neighbours are immigrants from the US and they're used to having a gun in their house for safety. The thing is that here we're not allowed to shoot another person even if its protecting yourself. So when my neighbour went to purchase a gun he and his family got interviewed. So they asked random questions like "Has there been any conflict between you and other people?" And stuff like that. When they asked him what he needs the gun for he answered with in case of an emergency he needs to protect his family. The stopped him and told him to say he needs it for hunting deer.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know if anybody else is experiencing this problem but i was hoping somebody here would be able to help. 
I'm running this on the latest version of ePSXe with all the plugins and BIN files that are needed. 
When I run the ROM everything runs fine; I get all the splashscreens, the 'Press start" screen comes up and everything. On the loading screens it'll say the text that says "and the adventure continues" or whatever, start menu and options show up fine and I can navigate through it all okay. 
However my HUD doesn't show up at all and the text in the atlas doesn't show up either. 
Does anybody know how to fix this? 

EDIT: A word </TEXT>

I had the phone on my lap and hid it under the table as i loaded up the picture (with shitty school internet it took some time). My 2 mates were sitting on both sides of me and were staring at the image slowly loading. When the image finally loaded they giggled and i giggled a little too. I look up to see the teacher staring right at us looking very confused, shocked and concerned. From he perspective, it looked like i was showing them something other than a funny image. </TEXT>
