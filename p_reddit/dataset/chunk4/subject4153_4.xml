	<TEXT> Would've posted more but I was running late before. My sister had a reoccurring incident that makes my hairs stand up recalling it. After we went through the trouble of dumping all of the water bottles and unpacking within the first week my sister brought something to my attention. She shared a wall with the garage and one night around 4am she made woke me up to something I still cannot right off now in my adult life. She shook me awake and took me to her room and asked me to be very quiet. In the mexican community it is very common for many to gather a week before a funeral after some one has died to take part in a catholic prayer. Among other prayers during a night of this tradition they say a Rosary worth of hail mary. And through the vent of my sisters room you could hear what sounded like several older woman chanting hail mary in unison in hushed tones. We did not share a building with anyone else, it was a three bedroom house. After a few minutes of listening and not being able to move I took my sister to my parents room and asked my mom and dad to come listen. When they knelt down to listen my sister said in an average speaking voice "Listen mom, they're in the garage" and I swear to this day my mom and dad heard a chorus of "Shhh.."  come from the vent. My dad was of course enraged and being that i was maybe 14 at the time it was up to us to brave the garage and see who was there. My dad flung open the garage door and found no one. Besides the large car port door there was only one door that led to the garage and no one was there. Like I said, I don't need validation from lying to you. i know it's what i saw, and that's enough for me. I have more if you'd like, to this day I call my self a skeptic because my parents validated my fears with their superstition and never got a clean cut answer as to what went on in that house.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can choose to believe me or not, I know what I heard, and no one can take away my truth from me. We did some moving around when i was in middle school, after a few places didn't work out we ended up in an average sized three bedroom in southern california. I had problems from day one, after spending all day helping my parents move in the last of our things i nestled into my room full of boxes and watched The Empire Strikes Back since there was no cable and I was having trouble sleeping. my tv was next to the open door and just as I began to doze off i saw a bottle tossed into the room at hip level from the pitch black hallway. I heard foot steps leading towards the living room which was opposite of the rest of the bedrooms. After calling out to my mother, father, and sister for a bit. I turned on the lights and found no one in the living room or kitchen. After waking up my parents who I assumed were being mean to me they told me that they'd been dead asleep, and neither of them can fake the snoring. my sister who was also dead asleep barely remembers being woken up that night. I showed my mom the bottle and she wrote it off as it being mine and falling from a box. The thing is, it was a gatorade bottle filled with water and it had what I call indito spanish scribbled on it.The day after next we began to put away the yard tools and make use of the shed. The backyard shed was full of all sorts of different bottles of all shapes and sizes filled to the brim with water and covered in scribbles. It looked like some one had lived there at some point. The stories keep coming right up until we moved, if you're interested in more let me know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought the fucker was dead for a while but later found out he pulled through. Some time ago I went to confront the person responsible for selling a good friend and ex-girlfriend a lethal amount of dirty heroine. After our break up we stayed in touch but she went back to using, begged her to stop but I heard from others in our circle that she was still buying, it wasn't long after that it took her. I pulled up to a neighborhood where some friends were expecting me and saw him dealing with low lives. He was laughing and having a good time just days after her passing selling the same poison that killed her. After his friends dipped back into their home and he made his way back to his car I went to confront him. I guess my stance or my gait was offensive because he barely caught a glimpse of me before taking a swing. I didn't even get a word in before he knocked my cheek sideways. He wasn't ready for my grief, he wasn't ready for my hate. Even though we were probably in the same weight class I threw him against the car like a rag doll, sat on him and beat his face till my broken nose carved into my hand. It snapped me out of it and I panicked, he was barely breathing and could barely make out any facial features. I used his cell phone to call for a paramedic and left.  I didn't think someone could survive what i did to him since the pavement had done a number on the back of his head. 

For several months I imagined that he was dead and it cost me an unhealthy amount of sleep. I lost weight and could barely function in my workplace. I can't tell you how to get over it because I never did. I found out that he pulled through with some surgery to his face. After finding enough heroine in his pockets to prove intent to sell in the hospital they searched his car and found half a pound. As far as I know he's still in jail, and I don't think he ever met me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not an officer, but as the boyfriend of an administrator for a campus I often get to talk to and shadow cops with the gf.

A while back this group of friends went to the beach for a small party.one of the girls got so drunk that they had to drag her to the car and apparently the seating situation had changed some point in the day ? Because one of these bright bulbs decided that since there weren't enough seats and she might throw up that they'd put her in the trunk. A unrelated beach goer say this and of course called the cops with a report of an abduction. They made it back to the university and obviously some people in the parking lot were off put by the sight of them taking out a less than coherent female out of the back of a car. They panicked and walked her into the first dorm room with an open door, propped her up in a corner so she wouldn't drown in her own vomit and scattered like roaches.

	<TEXT> Ive got two. 

On August 1st of last year there was a large airsoft game at a local airsoft field and I was too ready to join in the 40 v 40 meyhem. We had active vehicles in play and during one of our "demolition" styled objectives I noticed that a ford suv was headed our way from across the map. I called it out to my near by team mates and they dug in waiting for the fully loaded monster to come in and reinforce the players near us. I carried a thumper (single shot vietnam grenade launcher) on a sling as my secondary and knew that no one else near by had anything else that could do anything about it. The way that my grenade launcher works in airsoft is that the nerf projectile that it fires (at about the speed of a tear gas launcher) kills anyone within fifteen feet of where it lands. if it hits the side of the vehicle then it immobilizes it, and two will kill it. 

I propped myself up against a building and waited for it, the second I saw the driver I squeezed the trigger and the nerf rocket decked the guy in the passenger seat behind him dead in the cheek killing all of the passengers and giving us the edge we needed to take the "bomb" and plant it at the enemy's objective. Absolutely priceless moment. 

this is footage from that day, the camera drone flying around was at a bad angle for my kill but you can see the aftermath.

Dealing out the agony within,
Charging hard and no one's gonna give in

Inbred, our bodies work as one,
Bloody, but never cry submission,
Following our instinct not a trend,
Go against the grain until the end

	<TEXT> Not in the world friend, mostly in the US. this spawns from slavery and segregation I imagine. I mean, my mom is old enough to remember the signs and the beatings. The KKK gave Birmingham the nick name Bombingham for a period of time and were never really tried as a terrorist group and are still allowed to gather today. A good portion of folks that supported segregation are still alive today and have loosely taught their kids the same racial BS. 

Seems to me like this country is trying to squash out the last kinks in this whole racial squabble. Hopefully in my life time I will see racism swing into full taboo instead of it just being a common choice folks make.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was nine there was a girl who was kind to me and we played tether ball together every now and again. One day she got in a disagreement with a friend of mine and she knocked her down. She then proceeded to tease her while she was down and not let her get up. A few others and I joined in on the teasing. 

I saw her at a barns and noble a few years ago in my adult life and we talked about where our life had taken us since then. Somewhere in that conversation I brought it up and she didn't even remember that I was there. Sometimes I forget what where I put my keys but I remember the look on her face as we teased her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hold on to what is good and encourages progress. Strip away the toxic and holding you down. This could be a bad relationship, a bad job, a bad living situation. Reevaluate and move forward, some times this means coming to terms with lies you tell your self. And there is nothing wrong with that, we all do it. Just be honest for your own sake and progress in pure defiance of that which tares you down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some religions talk of the father, son, and holy ghost being the same thing. So god him self passed through her virgin poonani. I'm amusing the big man had love for Mama Mary being god's human host. So one can only imagine it was just as tight and undamaged as it was before. Yet little to no scripture is given by Joseph as to how dynamite dat meat flower was after Mr. Christ was done passing through it.
