	<TITLE> Line Closures In Japan </TITLE>

	<TEXT> In 2011, the Towada Railway Company Line closed. In 2014, the Iwaizumi Line of JR East closed due to prohibitively expensive costs of repair and low demand. In 2015, the Kikonai-Esashi section of the Esashi Line of JR Hokkaido closed due to low passenger numbers. Earlier this month, the Rumoi-Mashike section of the JR Hokkaido closed also to low passenger numbers. Several stations on the Sekisho and the Nemuro Lines have closed and some became signal grounds. JR Hokkaido have plans to consolidate its network.

JR East, Central, West, and Kyushu reported profits, while Hokkaido and Shikoku reported losses. The railways in the Honshu island have the best railway lines and the shinkansen. The is the island where most of the big cities are in. Kyushu have the shinkansen that goes to Kagoshima, with a future route to Nagasaki.

In Hokkaido, the biggest city is Sapporo. Other important cities include, but not limited to Asahikawa, Obihiro, and Hakodate. Between Hakodate and Otaru, the Hakodate Line is mostly single-tracked and unelectrified. Currently, there is a shinkansen line that goes to Hakodate.

In Shikoku, the only way to get there is via the Honshi-Bisan Line that runs on the Seto Bridge. The biggest city is Matsuyama. Other important cities include Kochi, Takamatsu, and Tokushima. The Iyo Railway in Matsuyama reports profits, while the Asa Kaigan Railway and the Tosa Electric Railway report losses. The Asa Kaigan Railway line consists of three stops. The Tosa Electric Railway merged with other companies in Kochi and is currently able to report profits from the tram operation but report losses from bus operation.

This situation is similar to the Beeching cuts in the UK. The policy causes a large number of railway lines to close down due to low ridership and competition with motor vehicles.

Will a lower railway coverage, these services will be replaced with regional buses. However, buses cannot replace what trains can offer.

Update: The Sanko Line of JR West will close next year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What I am thinking is that when Trump becomes president, he will likely be corrupt, benefiting himself and his cronies. That's when his supporters will regret. However, if Trump turns out to be another RINO like Bush, people might not care and think that he is not a true Republican.

It's likely that some of the GOP members are RINOs that true Republicans what them to be removed from the congress. That's when his supporters are unhappy that he isn't serious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lately, I am seeing articles about Trump voters having regrets. The regret is that Trump would fix the problems Obama caused. However, there are news articles that the GOP threatens to cut Medicare, Medicaid, and social security. Trump wanted to get rid of Obama are and replace it it with something that works. However, he will give Trumpcare that forces people to get private health care, causing premiums to raise.

Sanders was right. If it was him vs. Trump, he would have won, and America could have diverted from the regretful mistake. The next four years will be full of misery. There aren't enough senators to stop a filibuster, which is a good thing as Democrats will use it to voice the regrets.

I didn't regret not voting. Hillary and Trump were awful candidates. If Sanders was the Democratic nominee, I would have voted. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After Hillary lost 2016, I'm not going to vote for her anymore. She isn't the female president America wanted.

She was corrupt, just like Trump. She had systemic corruption, hubris, and incompetent just like Trump. By the time when people realize that Trump can't keep promises, like Berlusconi when he resigned, people will want him to give up and let Democrats deal with him.

Sanders is better, but Hillary and her team made propaganda that socialism is bad, thus rigging the election. In a recent special forum of Sanders in Kenosha, his message was right that Trump and Clinton weren't that favorable, but he would be better.

If Sanders win 2020, he will make America great and undo the damage that Trump and the GOP inflicted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today at 10:30 am, my flowerpot in the bedroom cracked, leaking water into my laptop. The screen starts to flash. I then shut down the laptop by holding the power button.

I wiped the laptop dry. When my dad came home from grocery shopping, he used a hairdryer to dry the laptop from the outside. The laptop couldn't turn on when it's dry.

I called the Apple Care Center and set up an appointment for repair at the Apple Store. I had to choose Wednesday because I have finals tomorrow and Tuesday. My dad have to work on Tuesday.

Speaking of the flowerpot, it is made of glass. My room is colder than my parent's. Last night, I refilled the flowerpot with lukewarm water. Possibility the water froze last night and thawed this morning, causing the flowerpot to crack.

Update: Found out all of the hardware have to be replaced and costs 755 to fix and takes a week to replace. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why I Don't Have a Driver's License </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am currently 20. I do not have a driver's license. Here are some of my reason I don't have one.

I am not a fan of owning a car. Before I often walk with my grandpa on the streets to go running errands. I look at the cars on the streets. I sometimes sit in my father's lap in the driver's seat. Nowadays, I am a fan of trains. Trains are more efficient and more eco-friendly that cars. If I happen to start my songwriting career in Japan, I would rather use railways that owning a car.

I don't go out much anymore. I used to run errands with my grandpa. Nowadays, I have a computer at home, I don't need to go outside much, except it I have to, i.e. visiting the dentist, visiting the doctor, going to college. For these, I can rely on my father or use public education.

I am not much of a traveler. Before I started high school, we would sometimes go to vacations in the Summers. The trips are usually 2 or 3-day long trips. The last time I went on vacation was in the Summer of 2011 when I returned to my hometown. Ever since then, I don't go to vacations much.

I don't like to drink alcohol. Alcohol is bad for the brain. Last month, I attended my cousin's wedding. By the end of the wedding, my cousin drank shots of tequila and got drunk. It took him 15 minutes to vomit.

Update: I got my non-driver ID fill out. I did 8 years because I don't want to drive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After hearing Sander's MSNBC special forum, it made me love Sanders more than Trump and Clinton. In the special forum, he made several points, i.e. working class paying for health care, election not based on racism but rather job opportunities, Obama was a good president.

During the presidential campaign, I gave my full support for Hillary. I realize that GradeAUnderA can't trust Hillary or Trump but rather Sanders. Both of them are corrupt, unreliable, and horrible. Right now, Trump is draining the swamp into the White House. Having billionaires in the Cabinet will likely to have crony capitalism, which will cause havoc to the ordinary people.

People on the forum say that the election was "too 'personally driven.'" Both Clinton and Trump are based off what they wanted.

Sanders is quite popular for 2020. I want him for president by then. He will likely undo Trump's damages and make America great. However, by then, he would be 79. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why's There's No Walmart in NYC </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-13 22:23:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in Queens. The nearest Walmart is in Valley Stream in Nassau County. You may be wondering, "Why isn't there a Walmart in NYC?" I'll tell you why.

Walmart is a hypermarket, a store consists of both a supermarket and a department store. These stores sell groceries and consumer goods. These stores are discounted stores. If there is one in NYC, it will kill off competition.

Walmart is like a monopoly. Any mom-and-pop stores will close down and people will have to depend on Walmart. We have seen the Family Guy episode "Hell Comes to Quahog" and the South Park episode "Something Wall-Mart This Way Comes." In these episodes the big-box stores parody Walmart. It causes a monopoly to occur in the town. The only way to stop them is by destroying it.

Walmart pays its workers minimum wage. It keeps them in poverty, making them dependent on social programs. Crimes in these stores are rampant.

	<TITLE> Rules to be a Favorable President </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-13 16:21:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Speaking of the last three presidents America had, Presidents Obama and Clinton were favorable while Presidents Bush was unfavorable. Here are my tips to be a favorable president.

Rule 1: Aggressive behavior, scaremongering and fear mongering doesn't work.
Aggressive behavior makes an impression of being erratic and a madman. Scaremongering and fear mongering will cause opponents get attacked.

Rule 2: Have a strong slogan.
Obama made a strong slogan of hope and change with the slogan "Yes we can." Trump's slogan was "Make America great again."

Rule 3: Corruption is bad.
Both Hillary and Trump aren't good candidates for 2016, but people have no choice other than Sanders. Hillary accepted bribes from people who supported her and gave them special interests. Trump will likely take money that is supposed to help the poor and give them to his cronies.

Rule 4: The Cabinet must be filled with people of merit, not wealth.
With people of merit, everyone will prosper. With people of wealth, only the selected will prosper.

Rule 5: Criticisms are good, but don't make it too obvious.
Everyone makes criticisms about anything. Presidents are allowed to do so but shouldn't make it obvious. They should keep it to themselves if prevent butthurt. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After The Simpsons predicted a Trump victory before a Clinton presidency in 2000 and reading news articles about Clinton vs. Trump 2.0 in 2020, it's likely possible.

In the episode, we see Homer inside Trump's head and see what the future looks like, i.e. deplorable. Currently, Trump drained the swamp into the White House, causing inequality to rise. I am seeing that 2018 might not favor senate Democrats.

In 2020, there will be the Olympics in Tokyo, and Japan is opening itself to the outside world, while in 2016, the Rio Olympics was deplorable, i.e. Lochtegate, poor construction work, zika, and polluted waters. We will see 2020 better than 2016, where Japan is a peaceful and beautiful country. By the time the 2020 Olympics starts, the affected railways in Tohoku will be reopened.

By the time 2020 approaches, Trump plans will likely backfire and people are protesting to voice their anger against Trump. Hillary and the Democrats will have already learned their mistakes in 2016 and people want Democrats back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Before Donald Trump, there was Silvio Berlusconi, who was just like Trump.

Silvio Berlusconi started from real estate, so was Trump. He is a broadcasting mogul, while Trump is a business mogul.

During Berlusconi tenure as prime minister, he appreciated Putin, was a racist, sexist, misogynist, and a narcissist. He made Italy deplorable.

Trump is becoming more and more like him. I am seeing that these two shouldn't be trusted.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why The Next Four Years Will Be Full of BS, Butthurt, Betryal, and Surprises </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-07 21:30:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now that Trump won 2016, there are legitimate reasons the next four years will be full of BS, Butthurt, Betryal, and Surprises.

Trump want to repeal Obamacare. Obamacare itself doesn't work well. Republicans want to appeal it without an alternative. This will cause the poorer Trump supporters to feel butthurt that there might not be an affordable and effective health care program.

House speaker Ryan Paul wants to repeal Medicare. Medicare is important and popular as it gives the elderly health insurance that they would otherwise couldn't afford. Replacing it with the voucher systems doesn't work as seniors would have to pay for some of the costs.

Eliminating the Common Core and implanting the voucher system doesn't work. The common core is useful in public schools. Not all students will get the high-quality education they want. Charter schools don't always accept every student who want to go there.

Banning immigration and building the wall doesn't work. Banning immigration will cause terrorism to rise. Building the wall is expensive and will take time for it to be completed. Bridges are better than walls but would require high-level security.

Since there aren't enough republicans to prevent a filibuster, some of Trump's policies might not go through. Democrats can be able to stop some of Trump's policies.

Update: Trump just elected an opponent of the EPA. Farmers be very! </TEXT>
