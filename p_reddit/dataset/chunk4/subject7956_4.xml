	<TEXT> You can't say that the bits of the Bible that support my idea are valid and meaningful.

That's pretty much the standard practice all around in biblical scholarship esp in study of so called 'historical Jesus', that's why we see so many conflicting views on who the peculiar figure of Jesus really was, some envisage him as a Wisdom teacher or a Miracle Healer or a Apocalyptic Preacher or a Jewish Revolutionary or a Exorcist or a Rabbi or a Cynic etc. all these different archetypes are possible because of selective reading of scriptures, so There's nothing wrong in doing same to disprove the existence of Historical Jesus.

	<TEXT> Yes secularism

Read the constitution of India, it is perhaps even more Secular than most European countries and religious Pluralism in India is just [massive](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=KdQysbvA6hoC pg=PA79).

Geneder equality, sexual equality and rape are all recognized and protected under law 

India isn't some lawless savage nation, Indian Penal code has one the most strictest punishment for Rape. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> new source that disputes the existence of Jesus.

There are no sources which dispute the existence of Moses or Romulus but that doesn't mean we should start accepting them as real historical figures.

Jesus and other similarly or worse attested characters like Hannibal and Alexander the Great.

Alexander is way better attested than Jesus, we even have more evidence of Pontius Pilate than Historical Jesus.

no respected expert in the field believe in it.

There are several, most prominent ones are Robert M. Price who holds double doctorate in NT studies and Thomas L Broody who's also a biblical scholar.

Neither Koresh or Jim Jones had a large following

At its peak Peoples temple had a following in upward of [20,000](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ypJzCQAAQBAJ pg=PA36) so i don't think its a right comparison but yeah Koresh or Marshal Applewhite kinda fits the bill.

but is more rickety than any of them. It doesn't explain why or how. There are no sources supporting it.

I suggest you read some works on Christ Myth theory because all those point were covered by many authors, here's a good introductory [article](http://www.rationalrevolution.net/articles/jesus_myth_history.htm) and as for books, Richard Carrier's [On the historicity of Jesus](https://www.amazon.com/Historicity-Jesus-Might-Reason-Doubt/dp/1909697494) is pretty comprehensive and there's also [The Christ Myth](https://archive.org/details/christmyth00drew) by Arthur Drews which you can download freely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consensus is ever changing thing, not long ago there was a widespread view that Moses and patriarchal fathers are real historical figures and before that people even believed in Mosaic Authorship but now its widely accepted that Moses is just a Legendary figure. So same can possibly happen to peculiar figure of historical Jesus, its just a matter of time.

And the scholars who study Historical Jesus agree the he was not a famed leader or had a large following in his lifetime like similar near contemporary messianic claimants such as John the Baptist or [The Egyptian](http://www.livius.org/men-mh/messiah/messianic_claimants09.html), A good example of such scholarly view would be Paul Maier's Magnum opus 'A Marginal Jew' series, which built around the idea that the HJ was a relatively obscure figure.

And even the earliest gospel ie. Mark itself give impression that Jesus was not a biggie, who just got crucified in his very first adventure. </TEXT>

**"Many of the people who carry out these honor killings and beatings are Modi supporters."**

Your links about dowries are totally irrelevant to my original comment which mentioned nothing about dowries.

If my memory serves right you mention about Dowry system and now it looks to me you edited it out, also many of the honor killing or Deaths happened because of Dowry system.

I was just pointing out that conservative Hinduism can be just as oppressive as conservative Islam.

Again those social evils are unrelated to religion, no Hindu Scripture speak of Dowries or Honor killing.

All your links about priests sexually abusing kids are not an India-specific problem as this happens all over the world.

If we play by your logic, then Priests raping little children is Christian-specific problem as its evident by humongous number of Child abuse cases we see in Catholic Churches.

I didn't claim anything is objectively wrong with arranged marriage, but it's wrong to kill someone who doesn't want an arranged marriage.

Lots of arranged marriages happen in Christian communities are forced/non-consensual and many times result in death of bride.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consensus is ever changing thing, not long ago there was a widespread view that Moses and patriarchal fathers are real historical figures and before that people even believed in Mosaic Authorship but now its widely accepted that Moses is just a Legendary figure. So same can possibly happen to peculiar figure of historical Jesus, its just a matter of time.

In-fact the process is already somewhat started just in last year's poll conduct by church of England found that [forty percent of people in England do not believe Jesus was a real person.](http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-34686993) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New Testament scriptures so utterly contradict to each other that even in ancient times people were aware of it, a late third century philosopher and fierce critic of Christianity Porphyry of Tyre summed up it quite well..

The evangelists were fiction writers-not observers or eyewitnesses to the life of Jesus. Each of the four contradicts the other in writing his account of the events of his suffering and crucifixion. Based on these contradictory and secondhand reports, one might think this describes not the suffering of a single individual but of several! Where one says "Into your hands I will deliver my spirit," another says "It is finished" and another "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me," It is clear that these addled legends are lifted from accounts of several crucifixions or based on the words of someone who died twice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Story of Gerasene swine. A third century philosopher and fierce critic of Christianity, Porphyry of Tyre summed up it quite well...

What a story! What nonsense! What an offense to reason! Two thousand swine splashing into the sea, choking and dying. 

Can anyone tell me what business a large herd of swine had roaming about the hills of Judah, given that the Jews had always regarded them as the vilest and most detested form of animal life? And how is it that those swine choked as they are supposed to have done, when they were cast-not into the ocean-into a mere lake? I leave it to infants to decide the truthfulness of such a tale.

In my judgment, it is best to regard such a story as fiction. If you regard the story as anything other than fiction then there is plenty even for a fool to laugh at. </TEXT>
