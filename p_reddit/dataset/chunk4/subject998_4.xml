	<TEXT> Oh that's a good point! Before I updated to macOS Sierra (which broke Karabiner), I used to use Karabiner's mousekeys feature. IIRC it was like D+HJKL to move the mouse, S+HJKL to scroll, D+V for left click, etc. Worked suprisingly nicely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, trackballs are the best. The thing they're really great at is letting you do both huge movements (e.g. when you have like 3 monitors side by side and want to go from one side all the way to the other in one movement), and small precise movements. Many computer users (gamers especially) turn off mouse acceleration for better control with a mouse, but a trackball actually benefits from really high acceleration. Plus, spinning a smooth, heavy ball feels really good compared to rubbing a trackpad.

If you have the cash, I'd go for the Tex Yoda, it's perfect for mobile use (depending on your definition of "mobile"). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Could you recommend any good mechanical keyboard for massive typing (cherry mx blue?) with an integrated touchpad?

Would you consider other pointing devices? There's the Tex Yoda with a built-in trackpoint (the old red "nipple mouse" that IBM/Lenovo laptops have): http://www.kbdist.com/shop/tex-yoda

There's also the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard which has a trackpoint module, and I think a trackball module too: https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/

I can vouch for trackballs, they're wonderful to use. I don't know if you have some kind of disability or other issue, but even if you don't have a hand I suspect a trackball might be great for you.

 I saw a few keyboards with touchpads, but they are mostly for gaming, not programming (that's what I do 95% of the time).

There's no difference (except that "gaming" brands are often more expensive than they should be due to bullshit like RGB lighting). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  So within the same feel of the switch (tactile /clicky/ linear) you should be able to change the acutation force with the spring.

Yes, but e.g. tactile switches actually use different stems. Browns and Clears do not have the same stems, so a Brown with a heavier spring doesn't get you a Clear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another shout-out for Warframe. The missions in that game are essentially like ME co-op matches, but longer and more fleshed out. Instead of 2 waves + objective, 2 waves + objective, extract, you have a more "quest-like" structure where your mission might be to, say, free some hostages and get them to extraction. Many different planets, amazingly convoluted   mysterious lore with a very unique flavour, and tons of weapons. And fashion.

Rhino   Saryn are my favourite frames. I will literally never tire of taking Rhino with a Galatine into survival missions and spin2win </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have the vocabulary to describe the genre properly, mostly because I don't listen to real jazz haha. So I'll post some example tracks:

* [Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah - Sunrise in Beijing](https://christianscott.bandcamp.com/track/sunrise-in-beijing-feat-elena-pinderhughes)
* [Christian Scott aTunde Adjuah - The Reckoning](https://christianscott.bandcamp.com/track/the-reckoning)
* [Matthew Stevens - Sparkle and Fade](https://matthewstevens.bandcamp.com/track/sparkle-and-fade)

The TL;DR here is: I'm looking for jazz (from the past decade) that a reasonable person could mistake for Radiohead. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the reason people want Blues is twofold. Firstly, they are the most tactile of the Cherry-style switches, by far. They have a little clicky noisemaker mechanism that just feels fantastic.

The second reason is the sound they make is really satisfying while typing.

Browns don't have the noisemaker (so the only noise they make is "natural", e.g. due to bottoming out the keycap), but they are also not as tactile-feeling.

So long story short, it's up to your completely subjective preference. :D

If your room doesn't have fantastic sound isolation, and you are going to be up late at night, then I would say go with Browns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suspect it has something to do with the lack of "buddy system" in Overwatch. In League, the support is tied to the bot lane, and is forced to babysit one player for the majority of the game - and that one player is usually the weakest for the majority of the game, only coming into their own after 3+ items. So not only do you have to sit and work with one player most of the time, but it's a boring lane too.

In Overwatch, the support has more freedom to affect the whole team, not just one player. And your job isn't to babysit, your job is to help in the fight. You're not trying to avoid fights, you're trying to win them. </TEXT>

Customs stuff for me was about R300, bringing the total to R2300. I don't think it matters where you import from, it matters what you import. Since we don't really manufacture computers in this country, there's no huge markup for something like a keyboard. Compare to textiles, where you easily end up paying R700 for a T-shirt that costs R300. </TEXT>

 If they just add what they would to base damage

The generally accepted terminology for these two types of combination are "multiplicative" and "additive" respectively. "Multiplicative" means all the boosts multiply each other - so two 50% damage boosts give you 1.5 * 1.5 = 2.25x damage.

"Additive" means the boosts add together - so two 50% damage boosts give you 1 (base) + 0.5 + 0.5 = 2x damage. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So both pre- and post-1.05, we have had this problem on our PS4 (two different EA accounts playing the same copy). We get frequent bluescreen crashes during multiplayer. It seems to happen at random. We've messaged other players from our team and they say their games didn't crash, so it must be localised. What on earth can we do?

Also, we get pretty atrocious latency (feels like 300ms+) being in South Africa. What can we do to improve it? With client-server games like Overwatch, League etc I usually get ~180ms pretty consistently playing on EU servers. Would it help to only queue up with players in Africa   EU? Any suggestions on how to find them? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Number pads are great for business documents. When doing my invoices, taxes, bills, etc. the number pad saves a lot of time. You just have to use it enough to get used to it.

This is a common argument, but it's misguided, and you give the reason away right at the end - it saves time _if you learn it_. If you spend that same time learning the number row, you can be just as fast. But because the numpad exists, people assume it must be faster/more efficient - so they take the time to learn it, and then end up in a self-fulfilling prophecy.

 I have an older laptop that has mechanical keys 

Whoah, are you sure? Laptops with mechanical keyboards are _incredibly_ rare.

 There are some awesome builds in here. I do wordworking so making a board out of wood interest me.

Yeah, a lot of people get wood cases! It can look quite lovely, especially if you have nice understated keycaps like DSA Granite or DSA Quartz. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For exactly the reason I gave. :) It makes no sense to assign an entire key to your two best fingers, so some of us have keyboards which assign a _bunch_ of keys to the thumbs, only one of which is Space. As you can guess, there's no electronic reason for the Space key to be so fucking huge. And because of reasons, we can't always get a keycap (the bit that the letter is printed on) that is small like a letter key but says "Space" on it, so often the keys are mislabelled. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Ha haa! You have activated my trap card!*

* The standard layout is _terrible_. Our fingers are not made to move side to side - why the staggered key rows? Why assign only one key to our _two_ strongest, most agile fingers (thumbs)? Why put Caps Lock in such a convenient position, yet put Ctrl so far away?
* The whole numpad thing. Numpads are useless, and they force bad ergonomics. At least put the damn thing on the left so it can be ergonomic!
* The switches. Mechanical keyboards feel good to type on. Going back to a standard keyboard feels _terrible_.
* Many keyboards only allow 2-key rollover - if you try any fancy combo in a fighting game, you are going to have a bad time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't have one, but I'm sure it's easy.

Do note that the Ergodox EZ I linked is just one iteration of the Ergodox - there's other people (like this guy http://shop.profetkeyboards.com/) who build Ergodoxes too, and they may offer more customisation.

My thoughts on the two:

* Many have complained that the Ergodox thumb cluster is a bit awkward. It's too far away from the home row, so you can only realistically reach the innermost thumb key without stretching. There have also been complaints that it's hard to pick out the key you want with the thumb because there's so many of them. By contrast, the Diverge only has three keys per thumb cluster, and they are arranged much more comfortably. (The original Diverge was actually designed specifically to address /u/blahlicus's grievances with the Ergodox design.)
* The Diverge can be kitted out with a normal keycap set; the Ergodox requires a special set due to its overuse of 1.5u (I think?) keycaps.
* The Ergodox EZ can be had with a tenting kit, allowing you to angle the sides for optimal comfort. No such option exists for the Diverge AFAIK.
* The Diverge is cheaper.

I've put a lot of thought into getting a split keyboard, and I'm confident a Diverge would sort me out nicely for work on macOS and Windows, and gaming on Windows. Protip: use the left thumb for Alt, Shift, and Space. Put Ctrl where Caps Lock would normally go. Put Super (Windows) where Shift would normally go. Caveat: untested. </TEXT>

I suppose the argument here is: Blizzard is like, say, the NFL. If the NFL found out someone was manufacturing a gadget that somehow specifically gave football players an unfair advantage, but was not applicable to any other sport, it would be fair for them to argue in court that the device was hurting their profits by circumventing rules of a game they administer.  </TEXT>

A person who does something illegal should face "full-on legal prosecution" because they are breaking the law.

An act being illegal doesn't require a further qualifier of, "Is this bad enough by my subjective measures?" The law *is* the guideline.  </TEXT>
