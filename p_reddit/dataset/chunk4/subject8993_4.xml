	<TEXT> If you have a business account stick to corporate locations. I would not mess with Costco or best buy and definitely not indirect retailers. 

Did you get your account set up online or in a store? I'd find a store rep you like and trust and go through them (for all things related to your business).


Businesses can do 2 yr contracts or DPP. 1 yr isn't really a thing anymore even though the option is there. I'd do DPP if your plan is to upgrade often. That's where you'll likely find the best promos too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The link to the promo does say 30 days but you're probably better off asking tmo about that..


Also, just prepare yourself for billing hell since everything you are doing is reliant on bill credits (see: every Tmobile reddit thread bitching about the bill credit system). Not that there is anything wrong with the deal you are getting but you may need to spend multiple hours each month calling and continually getting things adjusted based on what everyone says over in r/Tmobile.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So FYI, I opened a Tmobile line with a pixel right after black Friday because I wanted to try out their network 

This is when they were advertising heavily about the pixel promo. I took my phone in and not only did the employees not think it would work on their network, they also didn't know what a pixel was and had no idea about the promo until I had them look it up. So if there is a small print stipulation, I would not be surprised at all for them to not know it because I don't think they get a lot of people doing that promo (esp not now that's it's cooled down)  </TEXT>

The gist is, you port to Google voice. The port takes exactly 24 hours. So once you initiate it, during that 24 hour period you change your Verizon number. The port goes through and your number is in Google voice and Verizon service remains active with a new number.  </TEXT>
