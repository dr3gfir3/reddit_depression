	<TEXT> It's quite easy and the guys over at r/pcmasterrace and r/buildpc or whatever its called would be glad to help you out. I've had my alpha for about a year and its good but I really regret it. I got lucky and got mine cheap but for the retail price you can do a lot better yourself and be able to upgrade in the future. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey PCMR! So I picked up an old desktop from a friend's house that he was going to throw out. I can't decide what I want to do with it. I have quite a few steam keys laying arround and I figured ide give a few out to people who can give me some good ideas or advice. Thanks PCMR!

https://imgur.com/a/hvf4v

So I could just take it apart and use the HDD, not sure if I want to do that. I don't need media streaming because when I joined the PCMR recently I banished my xbone to the floor under the tv. All ideas are apreciated. Keys granted to a few I really like. Sorry I can't give all of you free games :(

EDIT: Thanks for all the advice guys! I wish I had more keys to give out but I dont. Peace.  </TEXT>
