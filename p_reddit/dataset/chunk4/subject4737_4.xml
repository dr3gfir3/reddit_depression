	<TEXT>  Therefore wouldnt fighting against equality be fighting against progress?

The phrasing of the issue as "fighting against equality" presupposes precisely what is in question, though:

If the pro-same sex marriage side are correct that marriage is between two people, then the law ought to be changed to reflect that ethical reality.

If the other side are correct that marriage is objectively between a man and a woman, then nobody is "fighting against equality" when they seek for that to ethical truth be upheld in the law.

	<TEXT> To briefly introduce this piece, Burke and Wills were two Australian explorers who mounted a famous expedition to travel from Melbourne (in the South of Australia) to the Gulf of Carpenteria in the North. 

Nardoo is an Aboriginal Australian name for a particular variety of fern which produces edible structures called "sporocarps". However, the sporocarps contain an enzyme called thiaminase which breaks down thiamin, causing malnutrition in those who eat it without properly preparing it.

The author of the article, Dave Phoenix, is a PhD candidate at James Cook University whose dissertation focuses on the expedition, and he has personally retraced their journey as part of his research. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Your scripture literally talks about people rising from the graves and walking around. Dead people walking. That's not bigotry, that's the term we use in North America for dead people rising from graves.

Resurrection in Scriptural terms is rising to a *glorified* body in which death is ultimately defeated and selfhood is retained, whereas, in folklore, the word zombie connotes a rotting body which has been reanimated to serve a necromancer and has lost its selfhood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all, these aren't merely pleasurable sensations. It causes people genuine discomfort and distress to see others in pain. 

If your description of humanity reduces to Humans experience various neurological phenomena. It has been of survival value for certain of them to be perceived as being more profound. then you dont really have any intellectual resources to say these arent *merely* pleasurable sensations: some of them are more profound than that. 

 This is a powerful motivator.

On naturalism, though, all this is a powerful motivator can be a description of the regularity of certain physical systems. i.e.  certain biochemical assemblages called humans often try to reduce intense feelings of distress be alleviating the pain of others.

Secondly, you seem to be hung up on objectivity when my claim is that no such objectivity exists. It doesn't need to exist to motivate us to engage in moral reasoning. 

Ive already tried to give an argument (the example about the rock with painted on eyes) why I think the objectivity of morality is a necessary precondition for justifiably engaging moral reasoning. How would you respond to it?

Saying Look, observe how there are plenty of people who say that morality is subjective and then they still go on to talk about what actions might promote the flourishing of human beings, or be beautiful, etc. misses the point: its whether one can do so **with any intellectual grounding**.

Person 1: Beliefs A and B are intellectually inconsistent

Person 2: Thats not true at all: I met a man who says that he believes in A and B

Surely you can see how this is a flawed argument?


I don't deny that "I and you possess selfhood" if by that you mean posessing a sense of identity.

But that is just to dodge the question: *everyone* acknowledges that humans have a *sense* of identity: what is in question whether that sense itself is illusory or a perception of the truth. 

I do reject your claim that "it is objectively good to seek the truth". There is no such thing as objective good. Some people might disagree and claim that it is better to accept a comforting lie. 

What those people are really saying is:

"There are some situations in which **it is true** that personal comfort ought to take precedence over intellectual curiosity"

 You really cant escape it.

your explanation for morality still requires us to believe in the existence of some additional something that hasn't been demonstrated. A theory that only makes reference to things that we know exist is more parsimonious.

I agree that if two explanations explain equally well, then Ockhams Razor applies.
I dont think that your explanation actually explains at all, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not quite correct.

To date, the only document directly addressing evolution thats widely regarded by Catholic theologians as infallible is the 1950 papal encyclical titled Humani Generis by Pope Pius XII. The sections concerning evolution read as follows:

...the Teaching Authority of the Church does not forbid that, in conformity with the present state of human sciences and sacred theology, research and discussions, on the part of men experienced in both fields, take place with regard to the doctrine of evolution, in as far as it inquires into the origin of the human body as coming from pre-existent and living matter - for the Catholic faith obliges us to hold that souls are immediately created by God...

...When, however, there is question of another conjectural opinion, namely polygenism, the children of the Church by no means enjoy such liberty. For the faithful cannot embrace that opinion which maintains that either after Adam there existed on this earth true men who did not take their origin through natural generation from him as from the first parent of all, or that Adam represents a certain number of first parents.

I think that synthesising this second paragraph with mainstream anthropological ideas would take the form of something like the following scenario sketched out by Kenneth Kemp:

...begin with a population of about 5,000 hominids, beings which are in many respects like human beings, but which lack the capacity for intellectual thought. Out of this population, God selects two and endows them with intellects by creating for them rational souls, giving them at the same time those preternatural gifts the possession of which constitutes original justice. Only beings with rational souls (with or without the preternatural gifts) are truly human. The first two theologically human beings misuse their free will, however, by choosing to commit a (the original) sin, thereby losing the preternatural gifts, though not the offer of divine friendship by virtue of which they remain theologically (not just philosophically) distinct from their merely biologically human ancestors and cousins. These first true human beings also have descendants, which continue, to some extent, to interbreed with the non-intellectual hominids among whom they live. If God endows each individual that has even a single human ancestor with an intellect of its own, a reasonable rate of reproductive success and a reasonable selective advantage would easily replace a non-intellectual hominid population of 5,000 individuals with a philosophically (and, if the two concepts are extensionally equivalent, theologically) human population within three centuries. Throughout this process, all theologically human beings would be descended from a single original human couple (in the sense of having that human couple among their ancestors) without there ever having been a population bottleneck in the human species.

TL;DR: As far as I am aware, evolution is not a de fide dogma of the Catholic Church but neither is it condemned. 

Catholic believers remain free to embrace either of the following opinions:

1. Some kind of evolutionary scenario such as that described by Kemp above.

2. God created a human couple with no non-human ancestors </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This isn't dancing around the issue: I've regularly seen people say "You can't just give arguments against evolution, you've got to give an argument *for* your position", so I think it's quite appropriate that this be addressed. 

That being said, here's [one example](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19208647). 

The authors write:

-----

"DNA topoisomerases (hereafter referred to as topoisomerases)
are molecular magicians that are **absolutely
essential** to solve topological problems arising from the
double-helical structure of DNA (1,2). Type I topoisomerases
(Topo I) introduce transient DNA single-stranded
breaks in order to change the topological linking number
of a double-stranded DNA molecule by steps of one, whereas type II topoisomerases (Topo II) introduce transient
double-stranded breaks and change the linking
number by steps of two. Although topological problems
are obvious with circular DNA genomes, they also occur
with linear DNA, as indicated by the requirement of
topoisomerases in eukaryotes, and in viruses with long
linear genomes (from around 100 kb to 1 Mb)."

"From such considerations, **one should have naively expected to find in all cells two homologous topoisomerases descendant
from two ancestral topoisomerases present in the
Last Universal Common Ancestor (LUCA)**, which was
usually assumed to contain a DNA genome (3). An intelligent
designer would have probably invented only one
ubiquitous Topo I and one ubiquitous Topo II to facilitate
the task of future biochemists. **The reality turned out to be
quite different, and more interesting**. As in the case of
other enzymes working with DNA, such as DNA polymerases,
the distribution of topoisomerases families and
sub-families among modern organisms is not congruent
with the universal tree of life based on 16S rRNA
sequence comparison (with the trinity Archaea, Bacteria
and Eukarya)."

-----------------

Its particularly ironic that the authors write that we would expect an *intelligent designer* to place the same topoisomerases in all forms of life: in reality, the conservation of essential cellular machinery is a prediction generated by *common descent* , which just isn't matched by the data in this case.

Forterre and Gadelle, in their analysis of the distribution of different types of topoisomerases, propose an auxiliary hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer which attempts to account for this phenomenon and preserve common descent.

*We will consider that a
topoisomerase was present in the last common ancestor of
a particular domain when it is present today in most members
of this domain (covering its phylogenetic diversity),
whereas we will conclude that there was lateral gene transfer
when the enzyme is only present in some members
of the domain and branches within another domain in
phylogenetic trees.*

Of course, the possibility that isnt discussed is that the non-conservation of essential cellular machinery might actually indicate genuine discontinuity in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a thought the other day: won't evidence *against* some hypothesis "a" be *support* for another hypothesis "b" in the case that a and b are known to be the only plausible hypotheses?

It seems to me that one case of this kind of bifurcation would be the question of common descent: either a given set of taxa share a common ancestor, or they do not. 

And so, evidence for common ancestry will, of necessity, be evidence against independent ancestry, and vice versa.

Does anybody disagree? </TEXT>
