If you think your video fits that, please [send us a message](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fyoutube subject=Please+approve+my+video. message=%5bLink+to+my+post%5d%28https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/6abscu/helth_is_wealth/%29) so that we can take a look!

	<TEXT> Your submission was removed automatically, because it looks like you're posting without a correct title. 

The correct format is:

**Artist Name - Song Title [genre]** [year] Director and additional notes

Everything in bold is required, the rest is optional.  Check your post now: Does it have spaces around the dash " - ", and does it have the [genre] using square brackets []?

Please include the [year] and director information if available, and put any additional comments at the end of your submission title.

Here are some examples of correct titles:

 The Buggles - Video Killed the Radio Star [New.Wave Synthpop] [1979] directed by Russell Mulcahy - First video ever shown on MTV!

 A$AP Rocky - PMW (All I Really Need) (feat. Schoolboy Q) [Rap Hip-Hop] [2013]

	<TEXT> Hello /u/AndrewKelley49! Unfortunately, your post has been removed. To protect the subreddit from spam, we no longer allow new/inactive users to make submissions until you've built up some comment karma and history. In the mean time, please be sure to familiarize yourself with our sidebar rules:
   
/r/dankmemes/about/rules
  
r/dankmemes/about/sidebar

We ask you to participate in the comment sections of our subreddit to build up the karma you need to post here and to learn the rules and standards of our community, then you won't be affected by this spam filter. Spend some time getting to know /r/dankmemes and then you'll be welcome to make submissions. 

Thanks for understanding!

#####NOTE: Do not message us asking how many points you need. We will not tell you. In fact we may mute you. You do not need many points. Just get out there and make some comments and you'll be all good in no time.

	<TEXT> Sorry, your submission was removed from /r/Music because your account is less than one day old. We have to take these measures to combat spammers - it's nothing personal. We'd like you to get to know the place better before contributing, so for now, just sit back and enjoy the content posted here. Please read this entire reply as we're trying to help you become successful on reddit.

**First time redditors** should be aware of [reddit's site-wide guidelines](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette). If you are planning to submit your own music, site, or channel in /r/music, you must read the guidelines for [self-promotion on reddit](http://reddit.com/wiki/selfpromotion). Violating these rules will result in a site-wide shadowban - that's just the way reddit operates, there's nothing we can do about it.

**New users** should take the time to read the [subreddit introduction](/r/music/wiki/introduction) to learn what this place is all about and how we operate. Tomorrow, you will be able to comment on threads but not submit posts to /r/music. Keep in mind that if you don't have anything positive or constructive to say in your comment, it's best to refrain from saying anything. 

New users must maintain a minimum positive karma score to submit posts in /r/music. Again, this is nothing personal, it's something we *have to do* to avoid spammers clogging up our feed to the tune of hundreds of submissions each day. We can't reveal what this score is, but we can tell you that anyone who actively uses reddit and is a *positive* part of the community will have no problem earning their way past this limit quickly.

**If you wish to promote in /r/music without participating in the community,** you can buy cheap ($5-$30) [sponsored links](http://www.reddit.com/advertising). These will place your music at the *top of the page* for a couple of days without the need to earn upvotes, so everyone will see them. These advertisements are *extremely effective.*

If you have any questions about reddit, please [read the reddit FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/faq).

**If you are just starting out on your career as a musician,** /r/music is not the place where you want to submit your works-in-progress or first musical creations. This is the place for *finished* tracks and albums that are for sale. There are many other active, knowledgeable music communities made up of people like you who will provide feedback, advice, and technical tips on how to improve your sound. Reddit will even help you to find new band members and learn to play an instrument. Some of the most well known communities are listed below.

* /r/wearethemusicmakers - reply to the feedback threads in their sidebar      
* /r/thisisourmusic - share your songs for feedback
* /r/theseareouralbums - share your albums for feedback
* /r/icoveredasong - share your covers for feedback
* /r/radioreddit - a radio station of redditor-made music hungry for your tracks  
* /r/mashups - share your new mashup creations
* /r/remix - share your remixes
* /r/ratemyaudio - get critical feedback on your music *production*

The **[music makers multireddit](/u/evilnight/m/musicmakers)** contains 80 communities, each dedicated to a different aspect of making music. There is no better place on the entire internet to get advice and feedback on your own music. Use these resources because they *will* help you become a better musician.

As you participate in these communities, you will quickly earn enough karma to submit your music in /r/music, and prove that you are an honest user making positive contributions. We apologize for all of these hoops, however there is no other way to protect this subreddit from spammers and users aiming to exploit it. Thank you for understanding, and good luck!

I regret to tell you that your post has been automatically removed because you did not include one of the required title tags. 
    
Please try to post again **using one of the tags from [this list](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3f0jmg/meta_list_of_valid_title_tags_and_their/)**. A correct title would look something like this: "[Tag] This is the title of my post". Make sure to use square brackets. 
    
For an explanation of this rule, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SkincareAddiction/comments/3f0jla/meta_weve_done_a_link_flair_overhaul_compulsory/).

	<TEXT> Hey there! Your post has been removed because you did not include a correct tag at the **beginning** of your title. Without this, I'm not able to assign the appropriate flair. Please re-submit your post with one of the following tags in the title.

Your post will also be removed if the title is in all caps or if there are less than 2 words in the title (not including the tag). Please be sure to use a descriptive title.

If you're unsure of what tag to use, then [Question] or [Discussion] would probably work for most borderline cases. Thanks!

Tag | Usage
:--|:--
[Release] | New tweaks that have just been released or submitted
[Update] | Existing tweaks that have just been updated
[Beta] | Tweaks currently in beta
[Upcoming] | Tweaks currently in development
[News] | Tweak and jailbreak related news
[Discussion] | Jailbreak related discussions where anyone can give their opinion. For example, favorite/recommended tweaks, tweak concepts, tweak configurations, etc.
[Question] or [Help]| Troubleshooting jailbreak or tweak related issues and questions
[Request] | Requests for a tweak to be made or updated
[Tutorial] | How-to posts
[Meta] | Posts about /r/jailbreak itself
[Giveaway] | Theme or tweak giveaways
[Tip] | Shorter how-to posts

**NOTE: ** If you wish to use multiple tags, please do not "split" your tags like this: `[Question/Discussion]`. They should be separate like this: `[Question] [Discussion]`.

For more information, please see [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/38uktc/meta_link_flair_system/)

	<TEXT> We're sorry, but the title of your post is incorrect in some way. Your title must appear *exactly* like this: [H] Item(s) you have [W] Item(s) wanted

Some common mistakes users tend to make with titles include:

1. Use of parentheses "()" or braces "{}" instead
2. The order of appearance was swapped
3. Having only "[W]" but not also "[H]" or vice versa - you must have both in your title

Please check to ensure that you didn't make one or more of these mistakes.

If you are selling more than 5 items, you can instead use the [Store] tag. Note that all relevant trade info still needs to be within the post without requiring the user to view an external site. Simply linking to a pricing spreadsheet site or a different trade site to sell your items is not sufficient by itself to meet the pricing rule.

You may also use the following tags for *non-trade* posts:

1. [PC] - Asking for a price check on an item.
2. [Q] - Asking a trading-related question.
3. [PSA] - Public service announcements of some value to the community.
4. [Raffle] - If you intend on doing a free raffle (raffles with any sort of buy-in are prohibited, however).
5. [Free], [Giveaway] - If you are giving something away for free, you can use either one of these tags.
6. [Discussion] - If you are asking the community to contribute and discuss something relevant to everybody.

Please also take this time to [examine our rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/GlobalOffensiveTrade/wiki/rules) for future reference.

If you intend to contact us about this action (or any other ones), please ensure that you have read this comment in its entirety (making sure to read through any relevant links) and make sure you grasp a full understanding of what it means *before* contacting us.

We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Welcome to Daily Updates! Feel free to share about your progress or setbacks, chit chat, or just let us know how you're doing today! 

Remember to be kind and respectful. We all know the struggles of working with a reactive dog firsthand; remember to show the same patience toward your fellow owners as you do your reactive dogs. 

Not sure what to chat about? We have some themed days you can use for inspiration: 

* Medication Monday - Is your dog on any supplements or medication to help with their reactivity? What has been your experience? What questions do you have for people currently using medications? Please work with a veterinarian or veterinary behaviorist if you would like to start your dogs on medication.

* Tuesday Tricks - Sometimes it's nice to be working on some tricks 'just for fun' to mix it up and take a break from all the hard reactivity training. What fun, silly tricks have you been working on with your dog? Show us your videos of any completed or in progress tricks!

* Wednesday Walks - What methods do you use to keep your dog's attention on walks? What kind of areas do you walk in? How did your latest walk go? Feel free to share pictures or videos of your walks or favorite places to go!

* Tracker Thursday - Creating a training or reactivity tracker is a helpful way to monitor your progress and can help keep things in perspective. Are you using a tracker? Have you seen any templates that look promising or do you have new ideas you want to try out? Feel free to share your own or ask questions!

* Friday Fun - Working with a reactive dog can be tough, so we like to remember the positive things. What fun moments did you have with your dog this week?

* Self Care Sunday - Taking care of yourself is an important part of the whole process! What have you done to relax this week? How do you like to unwind from a bad reactivity day? Any tips for putting things in perspective and turning your mood around?

	<TEXT> *Previously 'Winning Wednesday'*

Showcase Wednesday (we're not very good with names) is the place to share your community content with the /r/Paragon community. Are you a streamer and would like to get the word out for your stream? A youtuber or content creator that would like to share what you've been up to recently? Here's your chance. Everything in this post will be exempt from the usual self-promotional rule of the subreddit, this will not affect your ratio.

We do ask however that you limit top level posts to 1 per user, and do not simply link your stream or channel - write a little bit about yourself and why the community should check your content out!

This thread happens every **Wednesday**.

	<TEXT> **Pasca**: OK, so Im a healer and I can do a cheap tile change    
**Earhart**: Oh great! I boost the same tile you change to and I have a good leader skill~    
**Grassvalley**: Oh no, Earhart! Your leader skill doesnt boost Pascas type though. I can help out by leading if you two provide support!    
**Pasca**: Great! Ill be nice to have a active healer if we need it too!    
**Earhart**: Now lets get out there and make the rest of our team! Wait...who else should we use?    
**Grassvalley**: Hmm...Im not sure. Maybe we should ask for some help here?    

Remember to include as much as you can:

* Your goal. Different content requires different teams.
* Your team needs to adjust accordingly. No one team will fit best to all content.
* Your strongest damage dealer.
* This changes depending on the enemy. Elements and weapons like God Eater weapons come into play.
* Mystic Artes (if any)
* Please list your Arte Souls and their respective units that you own. Please indicate their elements and levels as well.
* Your heroes/units. A screenshot is best, but if not possible, please include at least a list of your best.
* When listing units, please include elements as well.
* Gear and guardians
* These are as much of a team as your heroes. Make sure to not leave out anything relevant.     </TEXT>

**Earhart**: It sure as heck couldnt hurt!

	<TEXT> **Pasca**: Hey Earhart, can I borrow your Warlock Cloak? I think my recovery is a little low    
**Earhart**: Sure! Ill take your Mystic Hydrangea. Its really pretty and I could use the lucky healing!    
**Grassvalley**: How nice that we have such great things to trade with each other! I bet the Saviors trade with each other all the time!    


If youre looking for a Japanese account, or looking to gift/trade a Japanese account, please add "**Japan**" or "**JP**" in bold to your account post. **Please be mindful of scammers. Scammers will be banned. 
Keep these tips in mind when dealing with anybody**:  

* Check their post history. If they have a small history, or no history, don't deal with them.
* If their only /r/TalesofLink history involves the gifting thread, don't deal with them.
* If most of their posts are in the /u/FireEmblemHeroes subreddit, and they try to offer a Fire Emblem account, don't deal with them.
* If you find their current account screenshot matches the screenshot given on a previous thread, don't deal with them.
* If you notice them asking for accounts on multiple occasions, or claiming to have lost their account on multiple occasions, don't deal with them.  

**Use this thread at your own risk.** Please report any suspicious activity to the /r/TalesofLink mod mail.

	<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :)

	<TITLE> Daily Updates/Pictures/Questions Thread </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 10:16:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone! In less than a day we've hit 1000 subscribers! That's amazing, I'm really glad to see this sub taking off. We're gonna try and run the daily thread a little differently this time, since the majority opinion was that questions and pictures should be separated. So here we go.
Pictures Thread![1]
Questions Thread![2]
This thread, at least for the early days of the sub, will be used for discussing things you guys want to see happen here! Rule changes, mod issues, what type of content should and shouldn't be allowed. Anything related to the running of the sub basically.
What I have planned for the near future
-  Wiki pages with info for beginners, including recommended starter kits and trustworthy vendors, as well as pages with info for more advanced users interested in rebuildables, mods, regulated devices, battery safety etc. - A banner design contest with prizes! - Contests - Possible sidebar overhaul. - Whatever else you guys want to see.
Some questions for you guys
How do you want to handle flair? Should everyone be able to pick their own, reserve flair for mods, or for users who hit a certain level of karma in the sub? It's up to you! Let us know your thoughts and as always feel free to post suggestions for anything else you want to see happen!
Also, how would you guys want to see giveaways in this sub? This was/is a very talked about issue back in the old country, and there are so many options with their pros and cons; we want to know what the community wants.
Thanks again for all the support here, I love seeing pages filled with upvotes and discussion instead of downvotes and hate.  If you guys like something, please upvote.  We've been seeing a lot of downvotes on content from people probably just coming in to downvote.
Also a reminder, make sure you mark things as spam when appropriate and message the mods to report trolls and rule breakers so that we can take action! It's hard to do anything if we don't see its happening. The sub is growing fast and it's likely stuff will slip through the cracks unless the community works with us to stay on top of it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Q A] Daily Questions and New User Introduction </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 10:08:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is the place to post your writing questions that fall short of starting discussion. Additionally, the daily Q A serves as a visible hub for new users to find what they're looking for.

[FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/faq) -- Questions asked frequently

[Wiki Index](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/index) -- Ever-evolving and woefully under-curated

[User Flair Guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/wiki/flairguide) -- Feel free to mark thyself


[Open Calls for Submissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/5gjxc3/open_calls_for_submission_122016)


**General Posting Guidelines** 

1. All submissions must be directly related to writing and contain enough information to start a discussion *on reddit*. Low-quality posts, especially those with only a link or title, obvious spam or site promotion, self-acknowledgement, and solicitations to do your work for you are more likely to get removed without warning. Off-topic and promotion may be posted in the Weekly Check-in sticky.

2. **Post all requests for feedback or critique partners in the Weekly Critique sticky.** If youre looking for help with homework, check out /r/homeworkhelp.

3. **Sharing for the sake of sharing is not allowed outside the Weekly Check-in sticky.** This includes your own writing (when not seeking feedback and especially when seeking views or sales), personal blogs, publication acceptance or rejection, stories you really like, or humorous images.

4. Calls for submissions (including posts inquiring about miscellaneous writing work, for pay or not) **must** include payment information, deadlines, rights requested, and any other relevant information.

5. Please report any rule-breaking posts, as well as abusive comments or harassment. Civility will be enforced, but spirited discourse can often blur the line between acceptable and unacceptable behavior. Keep general reddiquette in mind.

6. Moderators may, at their discretion and without warning, remove posts and ban accounts which they consider harmful to the community.

**Getting the Most out of /r/writing**

--While linked-posts are allowed, a quality self-post would be a summary of the content or a block of quoted content, possibly your own thoughts, and a link to the off-site content. Linked-posts are best for reputable sources and big news items. Self-posts are best for more nuanced and specific aspects of writing-related content as well as discussion-starters.

--This is not a critique-focused subreddit. In addition to the genre-specific subreddits, /r/destructivereaders is a great alternative if you're looking for a workshop-like community.

--While we celebrate publishing discussion, please keep all self-promotion to the Weekly Check-in sticky. Feel free to use your subreddit flair as an advertising space!

--Help keep the subreddit clean and on-topic by using the report feature to bring attention to rule-breaking posts. If you have any questions about these guidelines, please contact the moderators. </TEXT>
