	<TEXT> The Tesco near me is selling those "Share bags" of Cadbury's buttons, Nibbles, Wispa and Twirls. For the past 4 days, I've bought, ignored the share part, and eaten a bag.  
I feel disgusting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because this isn't BF2. Times have changed. The pace and feel of the gameplay is different now, and I personally see this as a good way of doing it. Not putting down your opinion, as I think both ways are valid, but this seems to work for the current state of gameplay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wanted to say how awestruck I am at Battlefield 4 so far. I was stunned and amazed when I saw that skyscraper go down for the first time, and the gameplay I've been obsessively watching has been phenomenal.  
Most of all, I just wanted to say thank you for being on the subreddits and listening! You guys are truly amazing - you've taken things we thought would never see the light of day and put them into what's looking to be the best FPS of the year.  
Huge amount of respect for you guys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that's how it works. You could just have the C control point, and have the gunship. It's not that you need the 3 centre bases to use any, you just need one of B, C or D to use the ability tied to that flag. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still confused about the extent of Levolution. I *really* want to see this feature shown off more. Is it all the things like bollards, elevators etc, or is there more large scale dynamic destruction? The skyscraper is awesome, but I would love to see more examples of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's quite different to vanilla WoW! I doubt I'd be able to play on your setup, but whatever floats your boat I guess :)  
I have a Cyborg RAT7 mouse, and I use button 5 (which sits under my thumb) as a mounting button. I should probably use more buttons on it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you're playing WoW, be it in a raid or PvP, how do you control your character? Are you a clicker, or have you bound every ability and macro'd those hard to use ones? Do you move with the keyboard, or only with the mouse? Do you do a bit of both? Post how you move, and then how you use abilities (include keybinds if you wish)  
  
For example: I move with a combination of the mouse and the numlock key (bound to middle mouse). I use a standard set of keybinds for all of my characters: QERF1234, with control and shift modifiers, giving me 24 usable keybinds in quick reach. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was it just me, or has the suppression been changed so that it just moves your sight around? When they're fighting on top of the destructible skyscraper, there seems to be a lot of scope movement when he's shooting the other team while under suppression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't really matter if the building goes down though - the control point moves to the rubble in the bay, so it's just a really nice piece of 'flavour' destruction to add something to the gameplay experience. I think that most skyscrapers won't be destructible to that extent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, is EU WoW down for everyone or is it just our party? We've been trying to log in for about 30 mins, keep getting error 2. I can log into Diablo 3 just fine, but WoW keeps throwing an error at me, and I can't access battle.net website either.   
EDIT: looks like it's sorted for me now, and the website's live again :)   
EDIT2: It's Virgin media (again). Looks like it's a waiting game then... </TEXT>

What I discovered in doing that was that I just needed to listen to them more, so I could understand what they talked about and therefore I could be more a part of the group. </TEXT>
