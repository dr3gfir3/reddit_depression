	<TEXT> "It shows you that there is one of the most gigantic skills mismatches out there across the country that we have ever seen in history," said Chris Rupkey, chief economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York.

The U.S. labor market is viewed as being near or at full employment. The unemployment rate is at a near 10-year low of 4.5 percent, below the most recent Federal Reserve median forecast for full employment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> San Bernardino Police Chief Jarrod Burguan said the shooting at Northpark Elementary School in San Bernardino, about 65 miles east of Los Angeles, appeared to a "murder-suicide," but details were sketchy.

"Two adults are deceased in a classroom," the chief said in a Twitter post, adding, "There are two wounded, possible students," who were taken to hospitals. He said their conditions were not immediately known.

"We believe the suspect is down, and there's no further threat," Burguan said.

	<TEXT> It's too early to say whether the new reward scheme will see crowds of would-be spy-busters prowling Beijing and stopping foreigners to make sure their bow ties aren't hiding cameras.
What it will do, though, is keep the sense of threat high in people's minds.
Under President Xi Jinping, China has grown increasingly suspicious of foreign influence and ideas. Foreign organisations, foreign academics and foreign companies are facing greater scrutiny and surveillance.
National security laws have also been beefed up, ostensibly to counter the actions of other governments but also, critics argue, in ways that allow the authorities to crack down further on dissent at home.
No-one doubts that China, like all major world powers, is a target for espionage. But however real that threat, raising the spectre of hostile foreign forces to rally domestic support can be a useful tool and it wouldn't be the first time that the Chinese authorities have reached for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Residents of the Chinese capital can earn up to 500,000 yuan (58,000; $72,000) by submitting tip-offs.
City officials said the public should help "to slowly construct an iron Great Wall in combating evil and guarding against spies".
Authorities launched an awareness campaign last year, including warnings against being seduced by foreign spies.
The new regulation was announced by the security branch of the Beijing municipal government. It said that residents could file tip-offs through the hotline launched last year in person or by post.
The cash rewards range from 10,000 to 500,000 yuan, depending on how useful the tip-offs are in "preventing or stopping espionage behaviour, or cracking espionage cases", according to several state media outlets including Beijing Daily. </TEXT>

"Tillerson said Russia had failed to honor an agreement to to guarantee the elimination of Syria's chemical weapons."Clearly, Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013, he said.
"So either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Clinton said Trump needs to come up with a strategy in Syria after the airstrikes. She also took the moment to address the change in Trump's tone when it came to Syria  and refugees.

Here's her full quote:

I am going to get to the meat of the matter but I wanted to say just a few words about Syria. Look, Syria has been a wicked problem for a very long time and the images of innocent people, of parents and especially of children suffering in the aftermath of that most recent deadly gas attack were more appalling than I certainly can put into words. As I said yesterday afternoon, I said it is essential that the world does more to deter Assad from committing future murderous atrocities. But the action taken last night needs to be followed by a broader strategy to end Syrias civil war.

And to eliminate ISIS strongholds on both side of the border, so I hope this administration will move forward in a way that is both strategic and consistent with our values and I also hope that they will recognize that we cannot in one breath speak of protecting Syrian babies and in the next close American doors to them. </TEXT>

The only reason this happened is the GOP has spent 4 years breaking every established rule and precedent on how to behave...shutdowns..downgrade..record filibusters..even opposing their own ideas. 
all because they can't win elections.

The tragedy of this is that Gorsuch, although too far right for my tastes, is clearly competent and deserved confirmation. A pity the GOP decided to go the way of the sewer.

	<TEXT> If at first you don't succeed, change the rules. It's worked so well for Republicans. Creatively draw congressional districts to neutralize the greater numbers of the other party. Creatively tweak voting rules to the same end. Now The McConnell Doctrine. Delay, and when even that doesn't work, upend a centuries old rule to get the SCOTUS result you want. History has its eyes on you. Kentucky? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the past four months, Gorsuch met with 78 senators and sat for three days of confirmation hearings last month, answering nearly 1,200 questions and submitting another 70 pages of written responses. But his repeated refusal to engage on specific Supreme Court cases or policy issues frustrated Democrats concerned that his lighter judicial record on matters, ranging from abortion rights to environmental protection and campaign finance law, coupled with his refusal to denounce Trump personally for his attacks on federal judges, made it difficult to determine his judicial philosophy and potential to be an independent check on the White House. </TEXT>
