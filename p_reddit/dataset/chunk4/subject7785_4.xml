	<TEXT> What version of Android are you running?

Do you have other apps running. Try closing those and only have Pokmon Go running.

How stong is your cell service when you're playing? Are you on 4G, 3G or is it bouncing back and forth?

I'd also recommend uninstalling Snapchat like the other people have mentioned. 

How high is your brightness when you're playing? 

Maybe turning AR off in the game?

I got at least 2 hours of Pokmon Go in the other day and I started with around 50 battery. </TEXT>

Netflix has them all in HD (well the ones that have been remastered) commercial free anytime you want to watch them.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm having an issue with a game on Steam. I've have been emailing the developer back and forth for a bit. They asked me

"Are you able to access output logs and send them to us? Seems to be Linux specific issue so we would need to take a closer look."

I'm not sure where those would be located at. I asked them what/where they are looking for but the turn around time for them getting back to me is about 24 hours. Was thinking maybe someone here could point me in the right direction so I could save a day of waiting. Getting conflicting info Googling where they would be located.

Thanks a lot!


EDIT:
And they were located at
