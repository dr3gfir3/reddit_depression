	<TEXT> [here is the list of 19 hospitals under threat](https://inews.co.uk/essentials/news/health/great-nhs-gamble-full-list-19-hospitals-facing-closure/) if they're in your area they likely have a campaign group you can join to save them. Either way google your local hospital or ask you doctor to see if they have any support groups. 

Also some speeches referred to the STP plan (Sustainability and Transformation) and how it'll downgrade and close hospitals. Hammersmith and Fulham council already refused to follow it. So they asked for people to contact thier councils to do the same.
