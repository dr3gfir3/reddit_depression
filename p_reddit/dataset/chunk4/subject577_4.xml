Depression is a real physical illness. It is not a defect in your character, and it doesn't mean you're weak or anything.

	<TEXT> Adam-God was taught in the Temple in the Endowment Ceremony. It's not just some silly one-off teaching by 'Backwards Brigham." The Adam-God Doctrine (and it was doctrine) [still informs](http://mormonthink.com/QUOTES/adamgod.htm) some [modern-day Mormon beliefs.](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/2riyqb/adamgod_is_still_vestigially_a_part_of_current/)

The First Vision accounts are not contradictory. No early member of the Church claimed that Joseph changed his story, or contradicted himself.

Oh come on. The are blatantly contradictory. "No early member of the Church" even **knew** about the 'First Vision," since in the early years Joseph didn't tell anyone.

RE: #9, it's a valid point. Absence of expected evidence is evidence of absence. The BoM anachronisms are called anachronisms for a reason.

RE: #16, luckily, I think the Bible is bullshit too, so I can still question the "4000 changes" made to the BoM. True, most changes were typos, but some were doctrine-changing in nature. They moved from a strictly Trinitarian to a distinct 3-member Godhead.

RE: #20, Grace v. Works, I'm just tickled that FAIR gives a [dead link](http://en.fairmormon.org/index.php?title=Grace action=edit redlink=1) to grace. Truly professional.

RE: #27, the BoM is [not in "perfect King James" English](http://www.mormonthink.com/backup/linguistic.htm). On the contrary, many basic grammatical mistakes are still in the BoM.

Martin Harris lost them, and in rebuke, God took Joseph's power of prophesy, the plates, and the interpreters. Eventually Smith got the former two back, but **not the interpreters**.

The BoM published by the church contains only material that was scryed after the 116 pages, using the rock-in-hat, no interpreters.  </TEXT>

Again, Smith only used the rock-in-hat method for the BoM most LDS people have. Nothing that can be read was translated via interpreters.

The Book of Mormon was scryed via the rock he had previously used to defraud farmers.  </TEXT>

This forum is, in my opinion, to talk about mormon things. I don't think it's here so people can be preached to. When a talk is posted with no comment, it feels like I'm being preached to. Here are some links to your comments; [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3psa90/the_holy_ghost_as_your_companion/cw9bhh5?context=3), [2](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3picfe/unless_i_believe_in_god_i_cannot_believe_in/cw9au0v?context=3), [3](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3picfe/unless_i_believe_in_god_i_cannot_believe_in/cw9abc1?context=3), [4](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3psa90/the_holy_ghost_as_your_companion/cw99q7p?context=3), [5](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3pkwcp/the_full_list_of_pres_monsonss_testimonies_from/cw8ytke?context=3), [6](https://www.reddit.com/r/mormon/comments/3picfe/unless_i_believe_in_god_i_cannot_believe_in/cw7b9jh?context=3).

It's insulting and patronizing. No one is here to be called to repentance, or rebuked, or whatever. They're here to ask, discuss, and question all aspects of mormonism or being a mormon. When you say things like "it is not my job to teach you if you are unwilling to learn," or "Great work quoting the article, now, use words to formulate a sentence that articulates your point of view on the subject of the Holy Ghost." or "If there ever was a need to point out the difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law it would be for this exact conversation. I will speak to you in the most plain words I can use," or "Don't you remember the warnings from the scriptures? Look you may not agree with the Book of Mormon or Joseph Smith, **but heed this wise counsel,** and notice too that today you have fulfilled this prophecy," you presume that you hold the absolute truth. There's no humility there! You have no authority over anyone in this forum, or in real life, frankly.

People downvote you because you're preachy and come across as self-righteous. I was frustrated when you completely ignored my points about how Smith was an adulterer. It felt and feels like you don't read to comprehend what the other person is saying, you read to figure out how to pull the other person back 'into the fold.' It's insulting, and of course you'll be downvoted for it. </TEXT>

Maybe contain the negative vibe of a lot of your comments?

mormbn keeps reminding me that we should refrain from personal attacks on this subreddit.

to then launch directly into a personal attack,

To answer you simply, I don't agree with your interpretation of the Joseph Smith quote. I believe that you have made an error in your understanding. However, it is not my job to teach you if you are unwilling to learn. I would ask you if you are an expert on the teachings of Joseph Smith, why don't you follow them? If you don't follow them then why do you know so much about him? If it is because you find Joseph Smith to be dishonest or untrustworthy and are therefore inclined to "educate" other's about his dishonesty? If your purpose is only to dissuade people from believing in the church, when then I think your own purpose speaks for itself.

My point it to persuade others to do good, if you will not contribute to this discussion then I would politely ask you to not say anything at all.

.

I honestly don't think we're talking about the same thing.

Great work quoting the article, now, use words to formulate a sentence that articulates your point of view on the subject of the Holy Ghost. Please avoid introducing topics that are completely unrelated to the church and it's doctrine.

.

This has got to be the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard on the internet. If there ever was a need to point out the difference between the letter of the law and the spirit of the law it would be for this exact conversation. I will speak to you in the most plain words I can use.

.

I guess it might be too hard if typing in "Book of Mormon and DNA" in the search bar is a difficult challenge.

.

I would review it with you but It appears you are more interested in silencing my "belief system" than actually finding answers.

.

Well I'm glad to hear your committed. In fact i wouldn't have it any other way.


.

Can you say the same? Are you willing to die believing that he was fraud? I didn't think so.

.

When you can come up with that evidence of a flawed revelation then we can start.

.

 3 Never has there been greater love than this, between the ponderizer and the, what do you call yourself? I want to say anti-mormon but then you might get offended.
.

Here we go I found the statement from Elder Durrant. For future reference when making an argument it's best to use the source. The claim you have made is too preposterous for the amount of evidence you have supplied. You have only found a lose connection, and that connection is only your assumption and belief that Durrant is deceiving you. Your logical fallacy is anecdotal, using an isolated example instead of a sound argument or compelling evidence. </TEXT>

How is the leaked text of the Heavenly Mother essay anti-mormon? Had /r/exmormon leaked the text to the Blacks and the Priesthood essay, would that essay be anti-mormon? Are all of the other essays on lds.org also anti-mormon?

The church **did** and *does* lie about it's history. If the historical truth is anti-mormon, then Mormonism is in for a rough ride.

In an open forum, the dominant voices will almost always drown out the rest. This is why /r/lds and /r/latterdaysaints are decidedly *not* open, because that's the only way that they can maintain any semblance of control. /r/mormon and /r/exmormon are much more open than either of the former.

One reason that I downvote anyone, exmo, TBM, or nevermo, is when they wholly disregard what the other person has said, and continue to push their own agenda. It's a conversation, and when the other person's point isn't even acknowledged, then I downvote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How can we be so caught up in our own pride to say that we don't need God anymore?

People can need to feel a part of something bigger. Religious feelings probably even have an evolutionary backing. This doesn't mean god is real, though.

How is saying that science doesn't need god the "pride of man"? Take the biochemical pathway of Glucose - ATP. We know every step. We know how the molecules change, we know the enzymes, we know the energy input and output. **There is no step that says**, "*INSERT GOD HERE*".

Science doesn't need god. None of our explanations for the workings of the Universe need "god" to explain how they work.

Again, so why add one? Do humans add "god" just because they can't fathom how things work without a deity? That's entirely fallacious. I don't understand quantum mechanics. I don't then go, "well my imaginary friend Zachary has little quantum fingers, that manipulate the higgs field." That's ridiculous!

Then, of course, there is the "why". Earlier, you said "Yes, because "why". Science does not, cannot answer why."

Religion can't answer the "why" of God. Why does God exist? In the Mormon framework, where did God come from? The pride of religion is, "we can't understand, so we can insert god without any good reason." </TEXT>

My advice is: Don't do it. The mormon church is sexist, misogynistic, homophobic, racist, and anti-science. The things unique to mormonism aren't good, and the things that are good about mormonsim can be found elsewhere in a less-damaging format.

Hop on over to /r/exmormon to explore the bad side of mormonism. Read the [CES letter](http://cesletter.com/) to explore things that the visitor's center and sister missionaries aren't telling you.

You've being pushed a sales pitch. They want your commitment and they want your money. Find second and third opinions at places that are neutral, and are not pro-mormon.

Patriarchal blessings are conditional. Since my cousin left, it's "obviously" the fathers fault, he must have not been righteous enough. 

I've seen families and friendships ripped apart, simply because they can't agree on what happens when we die. There's a reason that /r/exmormon is so large relative to, say, /r/excatholic. 

The Mormon faith is toxic. It's racist, sexist, misogynistic, nepotistic, and creepy as hell. If I can dissuade someone from joining, or convince someone to leave, then hallelujah.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Who said I was hiding it? And I was Mormon for a few decades and had my name removed. 

I frequent the board to keep up on Mormon things. I'm one of a very small group in my 50+ immediate family that has left. Mormonism is a major part of their lives, and if I want to have any sort of meaningful discussion with them, I need to be informed. 

Because I have to be so polite and deferential to my family, its nice to have a pseudo anonymous outlet to say what I really think.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, what is really disappointing is the mask you wear that invites in people that are legitimately curious about the Mormon faith, then doing all you can to remove them from that path.   

I don't know that anyone here is so nefarious or as well-organized as that.

However, you're right, in that I'd love to push people from the path of Mormonism. What's good about Mormonism isn't unique, and what's unique about Mormonism isn't good. There are better avenues for almost anyone out there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seer stone: no, no, he defrauded farmers by saying he could find buried treasure on their property. 

Kirkland bank: I never said that didn't make him a prophet, I said it means he defrauded people. The SEC would have indicted him for fraud. 

Adulterer: I **don't care** about his motives. He had sex with women who were not his wife. That is adultery. Joseph Smith was an adulterer.

	<TEXT> So you're just going to deflect and ignore the highly valid and well-sourced claims that Smith defrauded people through his seer stone, the anti-banking society, and serially cheated on his wife?

You're absolutely right, the BoM is delightfully falsifiable. And any test we can give it with real-world evidence points out just that: the BoM is false. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seer stone: fraudster

Kirkland anti-banking society: fraudster

Serial adulterer: He was only legally married to **one** woman. He slept with other women while married to Emma.

Are you willing to die believing that he was fraud? I didn't think so.

Seriously? Yes, absolutely. I'm perfectly content going to my grave knowing that there is no life after death, and God is a fairy tale.

	<TEXT> I don't feel that that answers the question, though.

Let's say someone comes to you and says, "I have a concern about Joseph Smith. Everything I've read points to him being a fraudster and serial adulterer. How can I resolve these concerns?"

Should the answer be "Well, just choose to have faith that he was a prophet, and choose to forget that he was a horrible human being"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any scholar of the Old Testament will tell you this. The Lord in the OT was used in reference to two beings. 

Compared to 

Since I believe they created the world together I agree with his comments regarding plurality those words. 

There are two ways god is referred to in the KJV, "the LORD" and God. 

The LORD is when YHWH is in the text. The tetragammatron, or Yahweh, is the true name of Judaism's god. Also referred to as Adonai. 

God is when Elohim is used. Elohim is indeed plural, but **nearly all** actual biblical academics will tell you it is because the ancient Jews believed in a panel of gods. El was one of the gods in charge. Later, the Jews became strict monotheists, and all the different gods were rolled into one. Elohim is plural because of that. 

The Bible, at least the first 5 books, are a hodgepodge of 4 main sources. One source used YWHW, the other used Elohim. 

This is reflected, for example, in the two distinctly different creation stories. It's also possible to tease apart the two different flood narratives. 

Leave preconceived notions at the door, and join us in /r/academicbiblical, where actual scholarly sources can be had, and decisions are based on real-world evidence and not modern doctrine.  </TEXT>
