	<TEXT> I love this time of the year. I start doing keto (High fat/Low carb) just to get extra trimmed up for the summer. I also LOVE this time of the year because the weather is better and I can do longer and longer bike rides. (Recently did a bike ride up Mount Diablo here in the bay.) BUT MY FAVORITE FAVORITE FAVORITE is getting home from a long bike ride, cooking up about 2 pounds of ground beef, throw some pizza sauce on it with cheese and pepperoni, TOKE up eat and relax.(which ussually getting so high I eat until I'm sick and pass out.) I love it :) </TEXT>

I'm currently cutting with keto and I bicycle sometimes for 3-4 hours once or twice a week.(aslo I commute via bike lol)P90x is pretty intense, so don't feel bad if you need to take a break (Seriously, if you feel like you're going to pass out or can't catch your breathe. Stop. Rest. and then continue.) </TEXT>
