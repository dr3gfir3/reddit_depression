	<TEXT> I remember reading about this back when it first happened. Man, the whole cannibal rats thing made me laugh; would have been cool if that was real though.

In the case of the Baychimo, makes sense that you might not have heard of it. It was more of a thing in the late 30's and faded into obscurity after that. It still pops up on lists of ghost ships on the Internet from time to time, though. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Where is the SS Baychimo? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-06 07:04:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> All right, heres the short version.


The SS Baychimo was a cargo steamer that disappeared off the northern coasts of Alaska in 1931 and was sighted and boarded multiple times between 1931 and 1969, though some sightings are debatable. Since its disappearance, it has been dubbed The Ghost Ship of the Arctic. (For more information, read Anthony Daltons Baychimo: Arctic Ghost Ship.)


In 2006, the Alaskan Government commissioned a project to search for the Baychimo, but their efforts turned up no results. To this day, it hasnt been found. It has been 10 years since the search for a ship that is now over 100 years old.


So, the big question: where is the SS Baychimo? Technology and oceanography has come quite a way in ten years, so how difficult would it be to find it? Lets be realistic: as well built as the Baychimo was, theres a snowballs chance in hell that its still afloat to this day, meaning that its sitting on the ocean floor somewhere. Im sure that theres a number of environmental and legal factors to consider, considering the amount of ice in the waters where it disappeared from and the jurisdiction of those waters, but persistence and perseverance have proved fruitful in the past; just look at the search for the HMS Erebus over history.


Isnt anyone else curious about this odd ships fate? Have people lost interest? Or are people just saying let it be regarding one of, if not the last of the legitimate ghost ships on the planet? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One: they're not actually mine. I saw them on DeviantArt and posted their links here for the Pokemon Reddit community to see.

Two: I don't think they had a choice. The Pokemon were already there across several eyecatches, so they just composited them onto one another. They cite the [Bulbapedia Location Previews](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Location_preview) as their source material.

Three: If you have a DA account, show them the love over on the pictures instead of here. We don't know if the artist frequents Reddit, so give praise at the source. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All right, here's the deal. When I started up Far Harbor on PS4, I didn't do quests immediately; I walked around the island, found locations and explored them as much as possible.

So, I come across the Vim! Pop Factory. More specifically, the KYE facility underneath the factory in the basement. I thought I had raided it of all its plunder and left to explore the island and complete quests.

I complete the main storyline and jump onto the Fallout and Fallout 4 reddit pages to see if there's anything I missed and, lo and behold, I missed the legendary weapon in the facility, so I went back to grab it...only to find the door was locked with no way to open it.

So, I search the internet for help and found that a combination of two methods would let me get it: the Power Armor clip glitch and the waste basket levitation glitch. I won't bore you with the details: [WATCH THIS VIDEO THAT I'M REALLY PROUD OF!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quXLuhjNlk0) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ginyu is a pun on gyny, the Japanese word for dairy milk.

Guldo's Japanese name is Gurudo, which is derived from yguruto, the Japanese word for yogurt.

Recoome's Japaense name is Rikmu, a rearranging of the word krimu, the Japanese word for cream.

Burter is indeed from butter. Top marks.

Jeice comes from Jisu, which in turn is a derivative of chizu, which is cheese.

So, the Ginyu Force is Dairy Milk, Yogurt, Cream, Butter and Cheese. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except Guldo doesn't have any attack with the name 'Green' in the title, nor does he have any attack (to my knowledge) that has a vivid green colour to it, unlike Jeice's Red Magma which combines with Burter's Blue Hurricane to create the Purple Comet Attack.

EDIT: Your theory is under the assumption that the colour mixing is additive, whereas my theory is under the assumption that the colour mixing is subtractive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think he's CLEVER enough to put him behind Recoome and Burter. Ginyu at the front in the centre, Guldo and Jeice behind him, Recoome and Burter behind them and the towering Jarto in the middle at the back, creating a choreographed hexagonal formation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure where you got those numbers from. Recoome, Burter and Jeice have power levels between 30,000 and 60,000 (stated in exterior material), Ginyu has a power level of 120,000 and no-one knows Guldo's. Considering the primary colour trinity, I'd say Jarto would have a power level comparable to Jeice and Burter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'ma make this short and sweet.


The three primary colours are Red, Blue and Yellow. The three secondary colours are Green, Orange and Purple.


Ginyu is purple. Recoome has orange hair. Guldo is green. Jeice is red. Burter is blue. No-one yellow is included.


Theory: there used to be a sixth yellow member of the Ginyu Force. I think he would have been bigger than Burter, have a nickname like Yellow Earthquake (to compliment Blue Hurricane and Red Magma) and be called something like Jarto (derived from "gerato", Japanese for "gelato").


Peace out, Earthlings. </TEXT>
