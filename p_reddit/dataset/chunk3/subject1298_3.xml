	<TITLE> Early Game tips thread </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-24 19:33:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT: Guys, remember this is supposed to be 'Early' Tips, half the fun of the game is discovery so try not to spoil 2nd/3rd tier stuff etc.

Thought I'd post some tips that I would've found useful for the early game. 

- To upgrade your workbenches, open them, then mouse over the top button that says UPGRADE to get a tooltip telling you what you need to upgrade it.

- Food goes off if left long enough, however wheat *never* goes off until you process it, so it's a good thing to stockpile early in the game until you can get refrigerators. 

- Farm lots of wood and plant material and craft lots of Wood Platforms for your excavation trips and make mine shafts with them as you dig.  You can't teleport out of the underground, and being able to get to the surface quick is REALLY handy. I find it works better than ropes because if you fall you won't take fall damage of you do it right. 

- You can remove the back panels of dirt underground and if you are high enough (highest background graphics only) you *can* teleport to your ship while underground. 

- Escort quests are a pain but really lucrative. MAKE SURE you remove any floor spikes you anything your charge can walk though and hurt themselves with, it's almost instant death for them. 

- Hunting spears are a great early game weapon, which also causes animals to have a much higher chance to drop meat, and are really easy to craft. 

- don't make a base on your ship, but instead make a small holding on your starter planet. You pretty much have to farm for food in this game, and having a place where you can grow potatoes and wheat is really helpful early on. 

- You can cook food at a station on the ground floor of the first Outpost town you come to. This was a life saver as eating cooked food reduced your hunger far more than eating raw food. 

- Be careful when looting random towns on other planets. Dismantling furniture and walls etc will make the local populace hostile to you although you can take things out of cupboards etc pretty freely. 

- Get your first tech upgrades ASAP. The professor looking guy in the middle of the middle floor in the Outpost can give you the quests to get them. They are really quick and being able to double jump is a god send. 

- Be sure to explore the surface of other planets too. You might find abandoned research stations, temples and other oddities. 

- Flags (Human Flag etc) allow you to teleport from your ship to whatever exact point you place it at. Use these to travel to your home base easily, or whenever you find somewhere you want to come back to (a settlement, etc).

Added by /u/ Zafis

- In early game you'll want to get Lantern Stick for back slot, or mining helmet as soon as possible. Easier to mine with portable light that's always on. Later on you can add light augment to your environment suit.

- Good to know thing about stats is that your armor also boosts your damage. So always get the highest when you can.

- Spike sphere for head slot tech should possibly be your first purchase. It makes climbing up mountain walls easy and fun. (and is also awesomely metroidesque!)

Added by /u/Sivuden

- For first time players, keep going past the second portal at the space station-- that's where the main quest progression lies.

Added by /u/Captain_Midnight

- Tungsten is actually not present on the starting planet. This is by design. You have to visit another planet to find it. Unfortunately, the game also doesn't do a great job of explaining stellar navigation. There are actually a number of other planets in your starting solar system. But you'll never see them unless you sit down in the captain's chair of your ship and click on the magnifying glass icon in the upper-left of the map.

Added by /u/24hsifyppols

- Holding Rightclick and release for bows secondary volley attack (and many other weapons!)

Added by /u/AbrahamsterLincoln

- Press 'x' to switch between your first and second hotbar. You can have up to 12 slots this way.

Added by /u/Ysida

- You don't have to make house at first planet just pickup campfire with you.

- Stack healing at begin 20 x salve would be enough.

- Get first workstations.

- Try to spam special attack if your weapon have one and kite your enemies if you have to.

- If you see big hole don't try to jump you will prob die by fall damage.

- Always have 75%+ your health shit happens.

- At boss fights try to not force damage when you are low. (escape kite get on safe zone whatever)

- Triple jump TECH is very good for people that don't like gravity

- One hand means that you can grab something else with your hand. 2x onehands | one hand + shield | one hand + with rope

- Don't be afraid to use torchs ( i know that flashlight is awesome)

- Later you upgrade your manipulator to scan objects act like flashlight.

-Remember to have rope/platforms |healing source at your hotbar

-Use each item at your inventory to survive. throws stimpacks everything.



I'll add more here as I think of them or if you have any tips I'll edit them into this one if you reply here.

	<TEXT> This. When I first bought the game at the beginning of EA, it really felt like Terraria in space. Now, after a break of like a year (I only racked up like 20 hours in EA anyway) this game now feels different enough to hopefully not be passed off as a copy/paste job. 

I just hope that they provide post release content updates. It's a REALLY effective way of extending your player base.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My opinion:

It was a below average movie, but a terrible *Ghostbusters* movie. I feel after the backlash and the accusations of sexism, this will get artificially high marks.

There was literally nothing in this film save the logo and a few references that connected it to the franchise in any meaningful way. It honestly felt like a Ghostbusters/Bridesmades cross over. Maybe due to the furor prior to this the female toilet jokes just seemed stupid and only to say 'LOOK!! WE'RE WOMEN', rather than being funny. I mean, the whole 'That was from the front' gag set the tone for the whole film. 

Not only that, but so many scenes reminded me of the famous spaceship roll scene in Prometheus. So many things happened that most people would just not do. The police not arresting them after the Bill Murray cameo for instance.

Anyway, there WERE some good jokes in there, and some solid action sequences. It just baffles me why they needed to put the Ghostbusters name to it, save for the name drop to get bums on seats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is poorly planned. You see how the planks don't line up with the hexagons properly? It's possible to minimise that effect by starting to fit from the middle of the floor outwards instead of from one side to the other.

	<TEXT> It's a shame really because they've made a mistake planning the job and thats why the floor doesn't line up, and even so, the discrepancy between the two types of plastic tiling could have been minimised to the eye had they started fitting the wood from the middle instead of the side under the kitchen plynth.

Had they done this, the floor would not visually seem to be so far out as it does. You notice how those grout lines in the wood effect floor don't line up properly? Not only is that fixable anyway, but even if it wasn't, starting the install from the center would have prevent it looking like it runs out so much overall. We can't see the left hand wall in the phot, but if the entire floor increasingly runs out form left to right, I bet it's pretty bad. However bad that is, starting in the middle would have made the worst part of that floor only 50% as bad as this floor.

If i've explained that right :P

Edit: wow downvotes because I'm pointing out that it's possible to fit the job better? I had no idea folks were that easily pleased by poor workmanship.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its a mistake in the planning of the tiles I believe. It looks like LVT to me (plastic tiling) which for this design is most likely custom cut by the manufacturer. Most likely that the imitation wood section having grout lines/feature strip was never mentioned to the manufacturer so thats why each line runs out 3-5mm.

Secondly, this could have been minimised had the fitters started from the middle of the floor and not from the side. Currently the floor runs out from right to left and we can't see how much of it runs out due to it, but had they started in the middle the absolute worst it could be would be 50% of however bad that left side is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the install was botched. Irrespective of it being LVT or ceramic, if the fitters installed the wood section starting from the middle like you should, the fact that the width of the wood   grout/strip is actually slightly bigger than the width of the tile   grout/strip could have been made less apparent. I guarantee this floor will continue running out the further left you go. You can't see the left hand wall, and common sense says that it will be worse there.

Had they started from the beginning in the middle, the maximum it would run out would only be 50% of however far it now runs out on the left side. </TEXT>

If you've been in the flooring trade you will know there are customers who want what they want and no amount of advice will dissuade them :P

Also where do ceramic tiles last forever? They crack and its a pain in the ass to replace them. LVT can be heated up and a single tile be replaced in minutes if need be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, but I discussed this with Neil from Karndean when I did the installation course with them some time back so it can be done, and re bevelling a cut tile is really simple to do. Karndean actually sell a small tool specifically designed for it, but I use a mouse plane (what you'd usually use for trimming weld rod on safety flooring). Resting one edge on the sub floor and one edge on the side of the tile you want to bevel you can very easily get a perfect edge in a few seconds.

If you've never done it, I highly recommend you do the installation courses. It's incredible what can be done with these kinds of floors.

	<TEXT> This looks like LVT to me (Luxury Vinyl Tiles) a product more widely known as Karndean or Amtico although I can't tell the brand that has been used here.

It's a shame really because they've made a mistake planning the job and thats why the floor doesn't line up, and even so, the discrepancy between the two types of plastic tiling could have been minimised to the eye had they started fitting the wood from the middle instead of the side under the kitchen plynth. I'm pretty confident that the design strip (the stuff that looks like grout on the wood) was either decided to be used after the floor was planned, or folks forgot that it would increase the size of the width of the plank making it run out. Most manufacturers such as Karndean can provide a custom cutting service for an additional cost so had it been discussed with the supplier this could have been sorted pretty easily.

Here's a similar hexagon floor on Karndeans blog, only without the strip and with less critical cuts meaning you can more easily put different designs next to it: http://www.karndean.com/en-gb/commercial-flooring/our-blog/2016/may/cdw-review

If you're not familiar with the product, have a flick through their website for a bit. It's a brilliant floor covering and very easy to live with, and incredibly easy to customise. Motifs and borderwork is all relatively easy to do once you grasp how to actually plan for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, I think you're both sort of wrong and right at the same time.

It looks like LVT or Karndean to me which put simply is vinyl tiles. You can see he's made a mistake laying it because they have started the wood portion from the side of the room instead of the center to minimise the fact that the wood strip is not designed to have design strip (plastic grout lines). This product is pre manufactured and designed to be put together a specific way, and had they fitted the wood without it, it would line up properly anyway.

Even if it had been custom cut by the manufacturer (companies like Karndean can, but they will do this for a premium), the end user probably put the wood strip next to it as an afterthought as if it had been discussed with the manufacturer how they were planning to do it, the hexagons could have been cut ever so slightly smaller to suit.

Here's a similar hexagon floor on Karndeans blog, only without the strip: http://www.karndean.com/en-gb/commercial-flooring/our-blog/2016/may/cdw-review </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Almost. It's LVT which is plastic tiling.

Edit: I stand corrected, it seems the hexagonal part is indeed a ceramic from Topps Tiles called Misty Fjord. Nobody seems to know what the wood floor is though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I regret buying the game. It isn't a massive mmo style shooter anymore. It isn't teh idea that was sold to me any more. Sure it's fun if you have a decent team but it kinda feels like Battlefield: WH40K right now, where I was expecting more of a planetside game where you could walk into different zones etc.

If I had bought the game after release, and had been expecting the game it currently is I probably wouldn't have taken any notice, but between this, Starbound and Star Citizen I doubt I will be greenlight/early access funding anything anymore

Many book readers (inc me) were pretty terrified in the episode where Ramsey marries then subsequently rapes Sansa. It sounds awful, but there was a sort of sigh of relief at that disturbing sight. It should have been doggedly worse if we were following book plots to the letter. Excuse the pun, I can't help myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> --Frodo Baggins-- *Grammostola pulchra* **Brazilian Black Tarantula**

Kind tempered, good looking and not afraid of feats of endurance, these guys are capable of fasting for months when the need calls for it.


--Samwise Gamgee-- *Grammostola rosea* **Chilean Rose Tarantula**

Basically the same as the Brazilian Black, only not as pretty, more lethargic and well, 'rounder'.


--Gimli, Son of Gloin-- *Sicarius hahni* **Six-Eyed Sand Spider**

This rather odd looking specimen hides underground ready to pounce with AND MY AXE like fangs on unsuspecting prey. Also, dirt and bits of sand seem to cling to it making it look dirty all the time and it has a terrible sense of direction.


--Boromir of Gondor-- *Portia fimbriata* **Fringed Jumping Spider**

This guy is a famous hunter to its peers, and happens to mimic movements of its prey, making it feel like the spider wants to be it's bro. SPOILERS It then takes the opportunity when it presents itself and stabs it's prey in the back and chows down on it's meal which happens to be other spiders. So yeah, this is the kind of spider you think is your mate who then really fucks up your day.


--Legolas, Son of Thranduil-- *Bagheera kiplingi* **Mexican Bagheera** (IIRC this name is correct)

This jumping spider is famed not just because of it's speed and lethality, but also because it actually doesn't want to kill stuff. It's quite happy munching on plant fibres normally used in the symbiotic relationship between the Acacia and Acacia Ants, resorting to predation only when it truly needs to. If there was such a thing as a vegan spider, this would be it.


--Gandalf the Grey-- *Maratus volans* **Peacock Spider**

What is there to say about this species, other than it is the coolest spider species i've ever seen and just looks amazeballs and every other spider wishes it was it. It doesn't come back from the dead though like the wizard unfortunately.


--Peregrin Took-- *Pholcus phalangioides* **Cellar Spider**

These guys are stupid looking, annoying and downright clumsy. Not to mention that they ALWAYS get in places where you don't want them. You could also say this is the cousin Eddy of spiders. It'll empty it's shitter right in front of people like it doesn't care either leaving lovely carcasses of its prey all underneath its web.


--Meriadoc Brandybuck-- *Isopeda villosa* **New South Wales Huntsman**

The NSW huntsman wants to be your bro. It'll take care of the things you want kept out of your house if you'll have it around, and if you throw it out it'll forgive you every time and keep coming back, usually with a gift of some kind of bug largely more irritating that itself. Ultimately though, it's got your back.


EDIT: I'm not a spider expert, I just wanted to accept the challenge :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks a lot like Zelotes Duplex to me, a pretty common ground spider and found in many places throughout the world. They usually hunt a bit like huntsmen and don't usually spin webs except for breeding purposes, instead being quick little blighters and physically stalking and chasing down their prey. If these guys were movie characters, these guys would be Strider from Lord of the Rings. Keeping itself to itself but more than capable of taking on nasty things when it needs to :)

Here's an American cousin for comparison although I am not certain that it is the same strain or not:

That's just it though. It's his channel and he can do what he likes with it.

From a business perspective I can understand why he's doing it, you tubing is most likely not going to be a long term business so he's getting as much money for the least expense as he can. Angry reviews cost a lot more to produce that a couple of cinema tickets for a film review, or when he's paid directly to showcase as specific product. 

SMart short term business to be honest, I just don't expect he'll be around in any major capacity in a few years which IMHO is a shame. Hopefully when YouTube goes tits up (it will eventually, no way Google will permanently host YouTube all the while it isn't profitable for them), he still has enough credibility to get hired by some other site or has enough money to start his own venture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

Anyone else get weird minor graphical glitches with the ingame HUD?

For instance, around the ultimate meter parts of the white circle that surrounds the icon may intermittently disappear and reappear and random points on the screen. I may be the little 'q' key symbol broken up around my crosshairs, or if i'm playing mercy I might get healing bars broken up all over the screen.

I've tried reinstalling the game, display drivers, changing resolutions and display qualities and nothing seems to alter it. When I first installed the game it was fine but ever since the McCree nerf I have had these graphical glitches.

I currently use a pretty decent rig (I can run the game at 4k at 60fps +) and never have any issues at all, let alone remotely like this in any other game. Does anyone else have a similar issue and know how to fix it?? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From minor things such as tapping R when no enemies are immediately in the vicinity or stopping to look at stuff at regular intervals, does anyone else find playing Doom to be like learning how to ride a bike for a second time? It's really weird it's nostalgic, but feels new also. 

I used to be amazing at old Doom 2, even on nightmare, but I really need to get my head around playing a game like this after a decade or more of more modern style shooters. I keep getting my ass handed to me, particularly when imps can take nearly half your life away in a single swipe :P

Anyone else pleasantly surprised? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey folks,

I'm from the UK and wanted to know if anyone else feels like the game lags a lot. I mean, it *looks* like you're connecting with shots, but it just doesn't seem to count. I really struggle trying to hit people with Bolters of any kind.

This goes for melee too, i've swung at an opponent three times before they spin around and one shot me, and then the death stat readout says the enemy has loads of health (last one I had was 86%) when I clearly hit the enemy at least twice (they started moving on the third swing).



Is this lag? Or do I just suck that badly and like making excuses :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apologies of this is not allowed (I didn't notice anything in the rules but some subs rule against this) but CDkeys.com is selling Doom preorders at 23.99 including DLC (not the season pass, just skins etc) and steam is 39.99. 

Seems like a very good deal and thought it'd interest you folks.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trying to remember a 1980's military arcade game </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hey guys,

I used to play a game in my local sports centre as a kid and wanted some help finding out what it was.

You could play two players simultaneously, and it was against each other, where each player would control a soldier in training. One stage would have your joystick moving a cursor around the screen shooting targets, another would have you spamming your buttons to crawl faster under barbed wire etc. The game could have had proper combat levels, but I don't think I ever got past the second stage.

It would have been late 80's (it was 1987 when I started Karate at the sports centre), as I seem to remember the game looking possibly 16-bit. If I remember rightly it was made by Bally Midway, but I could be wrong about that. I remember they had Xybots and Gauntlet next to it so again, that should give some indication of timeframe.

Does this spring to mind for anybody? I'd appreciate any help finding out what it was.

Thanks </TEXT>
