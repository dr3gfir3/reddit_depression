	<TEXT> The Tool Box Killers. Mostly from hearing a snippet of the tape they made killing their last victim. The FBI use the tape now to desensitize their agents to the sounds of torture. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Bittaker_and_Roy_Norris https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fY7hRCQaUw

Here is the transcript of the tape. Be warned. It is NSFL

	<TEXT> These documentaries don't always elaborate on the length of time these girls were held. These torture/rape sessions didn't last a couple of hours. Some of these girls were held for days, tortured non-stop. The 5th victim Lynette Ledford, the one who is on the audio tape, was physically destroyed. Norris wasn't even able to commit his rape because Bittaker inserted his pliers inside her vaginal and anal cavities and literally ripped her apart. He was doing that on the audio tape. I've never heard a human being scream in pain like I heard on that tape. For those who want to hear it, TRUST ME, you DON'T. I'm not squeamish, I've seen some terrible things. I've seen some of Maury Travis' videos of his murders. But the Ledford tape is in a category all its own.  I wish I never heard it. Of the 25 students in my criminology class only 3 of us stayed in the room. Many dropped the class. Others vomited. It's 18 minutes of the most unbelievably brutal acts imaginable. I don't have many regrets in my life. But I seriously regret listening to that tape. I wish I could get it out of my head. No matter how I try to describe the tape it's not really possible. The fact that a human being did this to another is too much. Bittaker not only LOVED what he did, he listened to the tape constantly and even let neighborhood kids hear it. They reportedly thought it was fake. That's what gets you, that it sounds like a fake "Hollywood" actress screaming. But it's real.  It makes perfect sense that the FBI uses the tape to train new agents.  It's the most heartbreaking thing I've ever experienced. I don't cry often but I don't mind saying I cried like a baby, almost uncontrollably. It's not an experience I'd wish on anyone. I bet Bittaker would enjoy hearing that this tape has caused 35 years of sadness and pain to anyone who hears it.  If anyone on Earth deserves the death penalty it's Bittaker. The only problem would be that he could only die once. There is a special place reserved for him in hell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This movie made me want to leave after one hour, and kill myself after 2 hours. I am a huge Bourne fan I was very exited for Matt Damons return to the Bourne franchise. Also there was fresh face of Alicia Vikander and not so fresh face of Tommy Lee Jones and Vincent Cassel as the bad guy so what can go wrong? Well it turns out if you have a horrible script, plot that only a person who wears helmet indoors can consider exiting you are left with the biggest disappointment in the cinema this year.

Spoiler alert everybody! Jason Bourne walks for 2 hours, sometimes he remembers things sometimes he doesn't - the end.

So to conclude : Do not see this movie! I had to watch the trilogy the next morning just to get over the disappointment of the new Jason Bourne. </TEXT>

I am sure there is a lot to the story and I just wrote a whole lot of blubber but that is all I remember.

	<TEXT> [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8F1wrDsUqYc)


I'm baffled by some of the reviews I've seen of this film. It is one of those movies you rewatch once in a while.  I saw it again this weekend and it reminded me of how strong it was. Clive Owen and Jason Statham are both excellent as... elite killers. The action is great, the story is intricate and watching the plot unfold is just fun. You've got a group of mercenaries on a dubious mission, a group of ex-SAS stumbles on to them and then both sides are trying to figure out who the other guys are and what they're up to. Maybe it throws some people that there are no clear cut good guys and bad guys here. Both sides are essentially bad guys acting out of a questionable sense of what is right. But that's what made it interesting to me.

The theme of this movie is "intrigue." There are layers of protagonists with mysterious agendas. Not all the t's are crossed, but the main story holds firm.

Which is the story of a reluctant band of experienced mercenaries plotting to kill, one by one, several British citizens as payback for something they did in a British skirmish somewhere in the Middle East. Each kill has to be cleverly disguised as an "accident," and evidence of each successful plot has to be provided to the "client." To top it off, another layer of protagonists senses what is going on, and plots to stop said plotting. Intriguing, indeed!


The film is at it's best when Owen and Statham are on screen together either coming after each other, fighting or staring each other down. Add a gun wielding, ass kicking De Niro into the mix and I'm happy sitting in a dark theater and munching popcorn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm curious as to why you are addressing Far Eastern Buddhists specifically as Burma/Myanmar is not even located in the Far East.

 The Far East also describes Southeast Asia, which includes such countries as Laos, Cambodia, Singapore, Burma and Vietnam
[source](https://www.reference.com/geography/countries-far-east-d47086edcb0eb869)

The reason of my inquiry is to understand why the budhists in burma are more violent than other budhist in the far east, considering other countries also have considerable religious and political ideology differences.
Islam has no qualm taking an eye for an eye you can ask any cleric, unlike the teaching of Buddhism that  professes kindness and compassion even  if you are wronged, which  makes their actions far more odious. </TEXT>
