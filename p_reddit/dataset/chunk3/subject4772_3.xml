	<TEXT> i'll never forget in a game at half time, the stats came up while one team was up 10-0... the stats were quite balanced apart from 1 linebreak and 3-4 missed tackles.

she says "well looking at the stats ___ have been dominating" and i'm at home going WTF while darren locker actually corrected her and said "no, you'll find its quite even just ___ has taken advantage of their opportunities".

Also pre grand final the team were talking about the sharks new recruits and the influence they've made, she comes in with "james maloney what a story he's been, to think he was unwanted at the roosters last year" and again got corrected that the sharks chased him hard.

I often find she regurgitates what the panel says, without actually adding to what they say or at least come up with her own analysis..

I hope allana ferguson or sammy bremner get a gig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i take records from pre NRL with a grain of salt, it's easy to win 91-6 when everyone from back in the day didn't have competition to steal their spot in the team and sides were thrown together at signups in the pub.

Because this is a reply to you, i'm not trying to be a dick or lecture everyone or anything don't take this as a shot at you. I'd wish though we could drop the records and stats from pre NRL, today even if your team is shit your 'usually' trying your best because contracts are huge and if your not having a go someone else will gladly take your spot and these NRL guys are never spotted again.

I doubt league was as cutthroat back in the day and losing sides didn't give a F if they let teams walk tries in when it was already over.

I think the sharks flogging of the knights and the big streak was largely glossed over TBH as "eh they couldn't beat the old record of 3 seasons undefeated by the eastern derp-dadurks, no big whoop" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our league guys all have good hands which means their best shot is on offense, the defense part of the NFL requires a ton of instinct that you cant teach in 2 years.

Lolo - TE as a pass catcher/blocker
       - FB  as mostly a blocker, power back on short yardage situations

Holmes - A returner only, if he makes it and commits long term he can eventually be a 3rd/4th WR...

Taumalolo has the best hope I reckon </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with most of what you said except for the entirety of giving union shit, it's a traditional yet boring rugby code but it's international scene takes a dump on league.

This is a big issue for me as I WANT to like test footy but ultimately don't give a F cause it's predictable. Also there's no investment with test footy. Cause I support the broncos seeing them get into the finals after a 26 week marathon yet the sprint is about to begin is thrilling.... that finals pressure is a whole different beast. Four nations however my team AUS will go into the tournament at WINX odds and either do as expected after four games or be disappointing and lose in the final. 

They should overhaul eligibility rules, give funding to the smaller nations so they attract the milford type players and re-structure the tournament events.

Until things change i'm happy just watching club footy, and origin when it rolls around.

	<TEXT> my take on the odds are:

- Broncos   Storm still genuine premiership contenders

- Raiders should have little origin rep players and beat up on teams at the midpoint of the season. Got them 3rd favourites.

- Cowboys   Sharks set to drop off while other teams will be improving...either one or both could fill 6-8th on ladder, not suprised if either just miss the 8. Sharks losing Ennis will hurt way more than Barba. He led the team for try assists in their 2015 season. Cowboys lose Tamou, still have a gun team but I feel they were the first genuine back to back premiers we've had in a while and it's no coincidence they dropped off part to Granville who was soo influential in 2015 having had a poor 2016 season... he and Cowboys could bounce back however.

- Panthers top 8 near certainties, but at that price you pretty much can only add the $1.40 to multi's you don't mind a later payout on. I do not consider them premiership contenders however due to the youth on stock especially at 6 7 whether its Cleary/Martin or Carty, they'll be able to muster wins during the season but finals pressure is a whole different beast for a young halves combination. Future is exciting though, they'll be contending from 2018 unless some kind of scandal or mass players exodus happen.

- Roosters, Warriors, Titans, Rabbitohs, Bulldogs top 8 hopes with Warriors, Titans and Rabbitohs most likely of the five to emerge as dark horses. I'm really keen on the warriors chances this year and at their price i'm going all in with Top 4, Top 8, Reach GF and win GF going in ALOT of multis. I totally feel they've gotten their shit together with the right coach, right players signed from other clubs, right players have been retained and Shaun Johnson coming of a career year in 2016.

- Eels, Dragons, Tigers, Knights are the no hopes. Can not even consider any fluke bets on them to pull out a 2016 Titans revival. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What recent song with female vocals has lyrics "you take me away" heard it in BWS </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I work at a BWS in brisbane aus and we have a pandora playlist running in the store, at night the tracks turn towards edm/house/chill... theres one song i'm after and when I finally decided to find out what it was they changed the playlist!

Google and running through tracks on youtube with you take me away has been no help.

This song would have to be recent from at least 2013 onward, house/tranceish with female vocals.

The only lyrics I can recall are "you take me away" from a soft female voice and the songs gets to a loop with this kind of beat in a rapid loop.

'ah.duh.duh.duh.duh.duh.ah.duh.duh.duh.duh.duh' and that goes on for quite a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They lockdown the ruck and always get three guys involved to smother the ball carrier in a tackle and will slow that shit right down. If you don't have good offloaders your pretty much going to be limited to possession in your own half.

Kick pressure from cam smith compounds this with munster/slater able to get to everything on the full and return it to the 30m line. They don't miss many tackles either.

With their goal line defence they mark up better than other teams, your best scoring opportunities usually will rely on the 1 on 1 situation and beating the storm guy. etc. hard to get an overlap against them of one of those shitty second man plays but when/if the ball gets to the fullback/centre/winger they need to beat their man rather than stroll into a gap.

Also they hand brown paper bags of cash to the referees as insurance to make sure the penalty count is in their favour.

	<TEXT> that's the joke everyone has been making the last two years but you guys are building towards a charge at a premiership. Some sides have no idea what they are doing when they sack a coach and enter a "rebuilding phase" that sets them back for the next few years.

But the warriors have been making the right moves with bringing up young players,retaining current and signing from other sides without sending out a new look team year in/out.

	<TEXT> lachlan maranta:

1) He was really slow, in the nines dale copley from an overlap gets him good ball and they create a break. Maranta gets dragged down from behind 15m downfield... wtf. This happened twice in the same nines game. 

2) Poor workrate/forwards have to do it tougher/his hitups were weak as fk and can't get the set on a roll from a kick return.

3) Can't break tackles, suffers from run 8m foward and get tackled back 5m syndrome. 

4) Not even a good finisher, hodges would throw him a sweet pass where maranta is on the outside of the winger with a wide open tryline and he can't back himself so he cuts back in.

5)I believe he only really played because of nepotism.

I'm not trying to completely crush the poor guy, but he was always a reserve grade player. Vidot got flack for being shaky under a high ball but he did all those other things excellently. But no-one bats an eye when Maranta dropped a few bombs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm ape shit over club footy and don't really care about origin, but origin is one hell of a spectacle and am totally in awe of the constant high quality it delivers. I WANT to love test footy but it's a boring mess. Test footy needs a complete overhaul of eligibility and tournament structures. Better we ignore it so they realize changes must be made. 

There's no underdogs to root for, when Fiji, Samoa, Tonga unearth some beasts AU   NZ will groom them like a internet pedophile. When Cronk   JT retire you'd expect Milford will be the next in line however I'm annoyed that:  

a) He has no incentive to play for Samoa, money talks and AU will get their man.

b) The standard of rosters nowdays is exceptional with tons of talent spread across the comp and AU can easily pick a great five eight who will do a great job but will instead step on Samoa's balls by picking Milford. (Same for the likes of Semi)

Also I feel there's no prestige in test footy, AU are always good every now and again NZ compete. While England might one day join them it's always a AU   NZ circle jerk whether its a tri nations or world cup victory. Winning a grand final is a 26 week marathon with a 4 week sprint where the winners are gladiators of the competition. A tri nations victory is pretty much, beat up on England play NZ in the final and sometimes win as if it's one mighty achievement anyone should care about. 

Test footy should be ignored until we get a better standard. </TEXT>
