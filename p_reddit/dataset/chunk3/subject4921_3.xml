	<TEXT> This season has been bruuuuuutal.   It took half a season to reveal what we've all been expecting a long time ago and that nothing about Tyrell has been revealed yet.  It has no direction.  Dom has gone to China, had her team wiped out, and nothing related since. She's been to fsociety, and is now at E Corp.  She's everywhere.  We all know the whole story revolves around ECorp and E-Coins, yet it's taken 7 episodes and will take more (apparently) to show how the entire banking system is toast and all money for the economy will now be digital.  During this latest episode I found myself checking my fantasybaseball team during it while half listening, something I've found myself doing a lot this season.  At some point, the show needs to stop trying to be super-smart, super philosophical, or whatever, and just develop a plot.   </TEXT>

I don't care what kind of potential he has and how much the Marlins are paying him to be constantly injured, he's never had 100 R in a season and has never had more than 40 HRs in a season.

	<TEXT> No, you will not be at a huge competitive disadvantage, you know why?  Because tons and tons and tons of fantasy pundits *already do use them*.  All you have to do is simply spend 10 minutes per week reading fantasy columns for free that are available all over.  Spend another 10 minutes reading reddit posts on this sub because everyone else has already done the work for you and wants to sound smart.  There are a lot of owners in our league that spend hours on fangraphs who think they'll get and advantage, but they don't really, the physician in our league is in first.  That's what happens when you have a tool like the internet.  Information is literally perfect.  The only way to gain the upperhand on your opponents is if somehow information becomes asymmetic or you do some sort of strategy that is completely off the wall.  That's the reason the physician in our league has stayed in for so long and has done so well while giving 0 craps about baseball or fantasy research.  You can literally assemble at least a .500 team by drafting from the top 300 lists places everywhere provide--they've already done the sabermetrics for you.  After the draft it is a coinflip with injuries, luck, .....and yes, there will be some breakouts so some teams might do a little bit better than .500 (and sleepers don't even exist anymore, because EVERYONE has already read sleepers/busts lists from a million different sources before the draft).  But we've analyzed nearly 2 decades worth of fantasy numbers from our league--  Almost everyone ends near .500, with a very small standard deviation above and below.  It's literally what'd you expect if everyone had perfect information.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fantasy. People tend to over think and love to think they're smarter than everyone else.  We've been running our league for nearly 20 years--since high school--and one owner hasn't given a shit about baseball for about the past 9 years and has become a physician (so he literally has 0 time to do research, follow players, or teams).  He made it a point to stay in the league just to show us all how much of a waste of time it is and how you can manage to put together an amazing team just by drafting according to the top 300 list that most sites give you for free and by playing baseball PS4 video games that update regularly.  He's in first place now and will probably win our league this year. 

Yeah, spouting advanced metrics gives people the the nice cushy feeling that they're smarter than everyone else, but the problem that gets overlooked is the fact that *everyone's* strategy changes when information becomes perfect due to the internet and everyone starts doing advanced metrics.  Shit just becomes a zero sum game and randomness takes over.  All you have to do is then draft the top 300 because all of the fantasy pundits have already done the work for you.  

Moneyball and advanced metrics only worked for the As in the early 00s *because they were the only ones doing it* at that time.  The whole league caught on immediately and what have the As ever done since?  Perfect information ruins any leg up you'll have on competition no matter how many advanced stats you use because 1.) you won't be the only person in the world who'll figure it out and 2.) it'll get disseminated quickly all over fantasyland because of the internet.   </TEXT>

Boatloads of antibiotics, fed human/pig/chicken waste, and not mention what's tantamount to slave labor when truckloads of women are forced to work for nothing and do things like peel shrimp.  US, Canadian, or European seafood only.

	<TEXT> I haven't owned a TV since about 2002.  I mean I do watch shit on my computer, but I really feel like I haven't missed anything at all.  The only thing you have to really commit to is not giving a shit about sports. I mean I might catch a game at the local bar or something once in a while, but as I get older, I keep giving less and less shits about things like the NFL etc.  Sports are a HUGE reason your cable bills are ridiculously expensive.  

It isn't like TV is bad either.  In fact, TV produces the best entertainment that far, far exceeds the bullshit that Hollywood produces.  For example, TV gave us The Sopranos, The Wire, Breaking Bad, Arrested Development, The Office, GOT, The Simpsons, ....the only thing that really needs to change is distribution.  Maybe allow consumers to pay and stream per episode or something, just like how you can now buy per song instead of buying a whole album.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These metrics are stupid.  Some states could simply be more aggressive with ticketing than others.  There is absolutely *no way in hell* that Maryland drivers are that much better than DE drivers.  NO WAY.  MD has the worst drivers I've ever, ever encountered--and that says a lot, because I've driven through NJ and outside of Philly for far too long during work commutes.  DE drivers are probably the most docile and slow driving drivers from VA all the way up to Boston.  MD is a farce of epic proportions.  Cops never enforce driving laws.  People speed 30-40 mph+ regularly over the speed limit.  People drive 65 mph on city streets in Baltimore; imagine seeing people regularly fly down Union Ave. in Wilmington doing 65.  Almost every single day I'll encounter at least 3-5 cars on the road in MD at night who drive around with their high beams on blinding everybody.  I've seen many cars simply decide to ignore red lights and blow them--and no, that's not trying to beat a light that's changing, this is almost 10 seconds after coming to a complete stop and drivers decide to simply go.  Tailgaiting and road rage are way, way off the charts in MD, but unfortunately that's something you simply can't quantify accurately.  You simply have to drive for years in these states to tell the difference.  Worst rankings in the Eastern Corridor:

1.) MD
2.) MA
3.) NJ
4.) CT
5.) NY
6.) PA
7.) VA
8.) RI
9.) DE

Lived in a lot of different places over the years, but was born and raised in DE.  DE doesn't have the worst drivers at all.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The major problem too is that many, many times in real world biology and medicine it can be flat out impossible to obtain a highly powered study.  What if you're studying a treatment for some rare disease that only 1000 people in the world have and you can only reasonably enroll 12 patients?  You might obtain a statistically significant result, but your results will be underpowered.  Other things like growing cells can take months and months of work just to get one measurement and there's absolutely no way it'd be humanly possible to obtain the 20-30 measurements you'd need for an adequately powered experiment that power of analysis says you need.  Mathematically you can talk about the flaws of biomedical research on a chalkboard, but in reality, it's much harder than doing what the mathematicians and statisticians recommend because it can inhumanly possible.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People have been speculating on this for a while.  Clearly E-corp is in cahoots w/ the Dark Army.  Speculation is that E-Corp and the Dark Army worked together to tank the US economy and make the banking system insolvent, and we have all sorts of evidence it worked--the deli is closing down because of a cash shortage and if you go onto mr. robot's website you can find images of cafes that say they're taking 'NO CASH' and another image of an ATM that says it has a limit for cash withdrawals.  What that means is that E Corp is now primed to become even more powerful than it ever was before 5/9 because they'll be offering E-coins as a matter of currency.  Whether or not the Dark Army was acting on the behalf of the Chinese government as a form of state sponsored hack to tank the US is a matter up for debate.  So what is fsociety's role?  The Dark Army and E-Corp needed someone to take the fall for 5/9 so they 'worked' with FSociety.  F Society got played like a fiddle and inadvertently helped E-Corp to become the most powerful entity on Earth.  


What might happen:  somehow Ray is key.  He's going to end up becoming insanely wealthy because it was hinted at that his 'merge' that Elliot was helping him with was about obtaining bitcoins.  Somehow Elliot is going to work or blackmail him into using his bitcoins and presence on the darknet to hire hitmen or whatever to kill the dark army and/or expose to the fbi the dark army/china/e-corp connection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lived in Philly for years.  Native to the area.  All of the fighting over cheesesteak is moronic--steaks are probably the crappiest sandwich in Philly.  For one, the cheesesteak isn't even the official sandwich of Philly anyway, it is the hoagie (which are far better in Philly).  Secondly, pork sandwiches in Philly are infinitely better (John's,  DiNics, etc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure why everyone is so high on Walker.  He had a good 8 games back in 2014 and that's about it.  Nothing is more maddening than constantly holding out for upside and getting burned by a blow up every other game with a few teaser gems between that keep you holding on.  He was demoted because he lacks competitiveness, which is a huge red flag since so much of being a successful SP is mound presence and mental.  You can have talent, but if you don't have what it mentally takes to be a SP, well, all the talent in the world won't save you.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shit, hiding known pedos is only the tip of the iceberg for the Church.  I have an uncle who was abused by a priest and who was involved in a huge lawsuit with regional diocese.  The details that emerged during the trial are far, far more shocking than the articles in the media.  For example, in order to limit or completely avoid paying damages  to victims the Church would shift money to banks all over the world in order to make it nearly impossible to track the true worth of the diocese down and also to make it appear that it was poorer than it really was.  Some of the abuse a lot of boys suffered through are simply not even allowed to be typed on here.  You also had fucked up priests in drugs sleeping with wives of parishioners as well as children, priests giving drugs and booze to minors, ....you get the idea.  The church is probably worse than even La Casa Nostra.   </TEXT>

Much more than they're often given credit for until you start to actually go through the list of what's  been invented here.  Test scores and innovation do not necessarily correlate.  Memorizing and regurgitating a whole bunch of shit doesn't make you innovative.  I see it all of the time when I have to TA a class full of undergrads who want to learn facts, try to ask you what's on the exam, and purge the information when they're taking the exam.  They then forget concepts and bomb questions that are more abstract, conceptual, or take a leap of thought.   You're also comparing a huge country like the US which has a much more heterogenous population to countries with nearly 100% the same types of people that don't face nearly the same socioeconomic issues.   </TEXT>

Somehow I think Ray will be key.  He wants to steal a whole bunch of bitcoins or E coins or something.   He and Elliott will partner or Elliott will steal a hhuuuuuge amount of E coins for him. Then Ray will help him to use that to fund hits on the Dark Army and Evil Corp leadership.  Ray has something to do w/ the dark web and knows how to hire hitmen.   </TEXT>

 Evil Corp has worked w/ the dark army to take down the whole economy all along, and F Society came around at the right time to allow The Dark Army to use as a pawn.  That way E Corp gets E coins as the major currency to rule the world once they tanked the economy, the Dark Army walks away insanely richer after being paid off by E Corp, and the Dark Army gets to blame F Society for the entire operation.   F Society is getting played like a fiddle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you run a huge company that has saturated the market and your company is worth $10 billion dollars, a $100 million dollar increase in company worth might seem small.  Meanwhile, a small company only worth $1 million might be able to easily increase the worth of a company by another $1 million so even though it had 100% growth, it is still peanuts to the $100 million dollar growth of the larger company.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Been to Brazil.  Rio and Sao Paulo *are fucking scary*, but this was before Brazil spent huge amounts of money on security. I am not an amateur traveler either, but there are certain countries in Latin/S. America that are simply not doable.  Brazil is OK in other cities, such as Florianopolis, but Jesus fucking Christ, you need to absolutely know where you're going at night in a city like Rio or Sao Paulo.  Going out at night is highly, highly inadvisable without a trustworthy local that knows what they're doing.  Our ride from the airport was going 95 MPH on the road and blew through all red lights after only slowing down a little bit so that we wouldn't get kidnapped.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely would.  Hitting in a LAD lineup, and FWIW, I think he's the best bat in a Dodgers' uniform for the rest of the season.  Yes, I didn't forget about Seager, but Turner hits deeper in the lineup.  He never gets talked about because he isn't a sexy pick or a prospect with a lot of hype.  Peoples' fears were also confirmed during the first two months of the season when he stunk hard, but he was probably still recuperating from knee surgery.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all know he had a an absolute brutal start to the season, but he was coming off of microfracture surgery.  Despite all of the youth that gets hyped up on the Dodgers, J. Turner has quietly been one of the better bats on the LAD for this season as well as last season.  We're talking about a guy that yeah, never got a lot of playing time, but when he did, consistently put up a great batting average, OBP, and good OPS as he got older.  Could he have a Joey Bats breakout next season if he remains healthy?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They said action against other countries will be possible, but for now, Russia is getting slammed probably because they turned things up to 11 and went wayyyyy beyond what most other countries have been accused of.  It is harder to take out a whole national team if you have so e players doping on their own accord vs *state sponsored* cheating.  Russia also bribed a crap ton of officials and basically corrupted the whole anti-doping system.  It is also damaging to Russian athletes, who were pressured into either choosing to dope or be forced not to make the team  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Parking in CV is extremely easy, even when JHU is in session.  You'll need the non-resident permit if you're keeping your TX tags.  Then just buy the Area #12 parking sticker for like $20-25 for the whole year.  If you spend another $20 or so you can get a temporary pass too for any guests that you might eventually have.  So easy.  Sometimes you might have to walk a couple of blocks buts that's about it.  

When you go to the parking office MAKE SURE THE TITLE OF THE CAR IS IN YOUR NAME or make sure you have the notarized letter or whatever is needed.  The PA will be a pain in the ass about it for students.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever heard of Triborough in NYC?  'Triborough' was a name given to a loosely affiliated confederation that consisted of 4 public authorities plus the New York City Park Department and the Long Island State Commission.  In essence, 'Triborough' was the REAL entity governing NYC all thorough the reformation era of the 1920s-60s that was practically its own sovereign state.   Triborough had its own flag and seal, its own license plates, a self contained communications network, and even had its own island-Randall's--on which it administered every structure and ever piece of land.  'Triborough' literally had its own 'army'--armed "Bridge and Tunnel Officers" who guarded toll booths and revolver carrying LI Parkway Police who patrolled roads and parks--responsible to no form of city government except 'Triborough' itself.  Triborough's army was actually run by senior officers of the US Army and Navy who were retired.  Triborough had its own constitution apart from the NYC that was completely unalterable by city, state, or federal government.   Triborough was also governed by its own laws.  Most importantly, Triborough had its own source of revenue, completely free from NYC politics:  it took in all of the quarters and dimes that poured in from toll booths.

How much land did Triborough control at its peak?  It controlled all of the parks in LI and NYC, the highways and highway bordering playgrounds in the city as well as the enclaves in which power dams were placed upstate.  All of that land totaled 103,071 acres, 161 sq. miles, and an area half as large as NYC.  Just how powerful was Triborough?  At its peak, it took in as high as $213,000,000 per year in toll booth fees (Almost $2bn in today's dollars).  

You can find some information on the web about Triborough, but a lot of the very fine historical details like what's listed above I've only ever found  in a book.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it'll probably get him on track for next year much faster than conservative treatment.  Took me ~13-20 months before I was OK again after a herniated L3/L4, L4/L5, L5/S1 discs. Would not wish that on my worst enemy. 


He'll probably be fine for now.  See Tony Romo.   </TEXT>
