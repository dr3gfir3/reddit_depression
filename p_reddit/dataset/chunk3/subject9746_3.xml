	<TEXT> Both of your recommendations have some promising artists and should be able to accommodate what I have in mind. I really liked Whispering Danny's work and there were multiple people from Mercy Seat that I was impressed with as well!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Reddit,

I just moved to Kansas City about 3 months ago for a job and I'm currently seeking a good tattoo parlor. If you have any artists that you would recommend at said parlor, I'm all ears. I'm specifically looking for an artist who is talented at human portraits. Any advice you have would be greatly appreciated!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would highly recommend The American Dollar (band). If you have Spotify, there is an ambient version of various songs they've produced that they consider soothing sleep music. </TEXT>
