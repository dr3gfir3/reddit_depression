	<TEXT> I waited about 6 hrs before searching. The confirmation would have went to my parents's address so it is beginning to seem obvious that they didn't confirm the posting haha.

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good advice, thank you. It's funny, I posted the vehicle yesterday afternoon, tried searching for it and could not locate it. Would there be a reason why it was removed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 100% agree. Bottom line is, SportsDevil will work, but do you want to go rooting through streams to find something that works when the game is about to start/has already started? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, my parents are snowbirds currently in the Tampa area. They are hoping to sell their vehicle that they keep at their home down there, but are unsure where to post it. I am aware of Craigslist but am wondering if there are any other popular sites in the Tampa/St Pete's/Clearwater area or whether just putting it on Criagslist will do?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, former user who had no luck streaming without pixelating and freezing. Signed up for a 1-day trial today and had a better experience, but wondering if there is anything I can do. So far, I set to random server (had it on Toronto but the program chose Montreal and it seemed to improve), turned off HQ streams, enabled InputStream Client for RTMP streams in Kodi. My speed is anywhere from 5-8 mbps download which ppl say is definitely good enough, I am just not having the success I feel I should be having. Any advice Re: anything else I can do, I'd appreciate it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, not happening. 5 min into a stream it pixelates and freezes. Any more comments would be appreciated. I turned off HQ video,  chose a server location nearest me (Toronto) and that's all I changed. 

Edit: Can someone tell me what "server type" is, RTMP vs HLS. I noticed I may have accidentally changed it to HLS, changed it to RTMP, it buffered a bit at first then it seemed to be OK.  
Edit2: now HLS seems way better. Obviously I have some exploring to do / decisions to make.  </TEXT>
