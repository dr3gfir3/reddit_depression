	<TEXT> Many people (like me) could not afford such a dramatic price hike. I am very suspicious of any claim that more people are insured now than before. Perhaps they are counting the number of new people added to insurance and failing to subtract the number who gave up insurance because of the price. </TEXT>

When a minority group of people feels it is being treated unequally, the legislators are unlikely to do anything about it because a small group of people is not significant. In this case many people had a prejudice too, so they were even less likely to discuss it. It has to be taken to the justices, who will look at the situation logically and decide if they are being treated equally as American citizens. If they are not, give them equal treatment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem isn't Islam, it's fundamentalism. There's a sizeable group, many millions of people, who believe that the Jews should be exterminated, that gays should be publicly executed to set an example, that their cultural system should be spread throughout the world replacing all inferior cultures, and that America should be destroyed because, in their words, it's 'run by Jews'.

That's exactly the same beliefs the Nazis had. I think the Nazis were a pretty big deal. We should be very concerned about another group of people which share those beliefs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The solution would be healthcare through the government, but it can't be a half-assed effort. You have to destroy the massive health insurance companies since they will be redundant, beat the medical suppliers into submission to get equipment at a fair price, cut doctor salaries by half, give the pharmaceutical companies an ultimatum to provide affordable drugs or else the drugs will be purchased from India in generic form, and many other steps to bring down costs. Whoever takes on such a challenge will also have a permanent target on their back and face constant slander in an attempt to alienate them, since politicians in both parties have a cosy and profitable relationship with the lobbyists. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Affordable" is a joke. Before Obamacare was forced upon us I could just about afford health insurance at $100 per month. Obamacare put an end to that and now the cheapest plans available are $300, way outside my price range. I seriously doubt that there are more people with insurance now than before. Sure, those with pre-existing conditions were finally able to buy insurance and that no doubt encompassed a sizeable number of people, but how many millions lost insurance because the cost of buying it doubled? Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. No way can they find the money to pay twice as much as before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is a legitimate reality. Quite a few countries have a birth rate below 2.0 (meaning 2 children for each couple) and without immigration their population will decline. Personally I think it's wonderful to have fewer people over time, but the annoying consequence is economic turmoil. The economy is like a pyramid scheme.

One or two men at the top used others to stir up resentment, and before long it became a feeling shared by millions. That is what Soros is doing. Consider if the hatred being expressed for those who support Trump is rational, or if it is something else which has been cleverly disguised as righteousness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a lot more complicated than that. Many countries in the world have proud histories of conquest, invention, innovation, arts, literature, philosophy. Thousands of years of uniqueness to take pride in, particularly if they've contributed things which have influenced the entire world, such as the philosophy of democracy. Immigration naturally begins to diversity a population and over time fewer and fewer people feel connected to their nation's history. It is like a species becoming endangered after having survived many eras on the Earth, only a shadow of its former glory. The nation remains but many of the people living there no longer have a connection to the past or feel the spirit that led to the great accomplishments. There are even attempts to make people feel shame for their nation's past triumphs, as if to discourage the thinking which allowed that culture to prosper and progress.

The United States is a nation of immigrants. That is what defines the American philosophy and what gives it its greatness. For other nations, however, immigration has almost the opposite impact. </TEXT>
