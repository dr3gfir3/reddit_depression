	<TEXT> I've had anxiety attacks from it and usually cried myself to sleep afterwards. It's hurting my life too much to continue playing.


Um do you get paid to play the game or something? Why is it giving you anxiety attacks?  That doesn't sound healthy man

	<TEXT> There are games where I do very well. In the last 4 days I've been able to reach MVP with 6+ kills a couple of times a day. But on average I find I'm making poor decisions. I guess my average game I go 4-2, or 1-2, or 2-4 seem to be very common. A couple of times a day (or even more) I go 1-4 or something like that. I find that I'm inconsistent. And when I do good sometimes I feel like I get lucky. 


My main Operators are: 

Defense:

Pulse

Jger

(Mostly use these for roaming)


Mute


Kapkan



On attack, I use:

Ash


Sledge



Twitch 



Honestly I find that sometimes I do pretty good (got a 8-0 yesterday with a 1 v 4 clutch) but other times I do so bad it's almost embarrassing. Is there any universal tip on how to do better? I feel like what I'm having the most trouble with is outsmarting my enemy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I asked him the other day what are his thoughts about the game. His response:

It's very good I like that the game is very realistic and the graphics are amazing I like how you actually have to think tactically and mold your style of gameplay according to the situation  However I wish more people would use their mics lol but I do admit that more people use them in this game than most I've played in xbox the only thing I don't like is how sometimes you get teamkilled over some bullshit however it makes it realistic becuese in real life you can't just spray like in cod An in all, very good game </TEXT>
