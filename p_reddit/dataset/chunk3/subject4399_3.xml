	<TITLE> Controller problem </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-30 00:42:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Firstly, I doubt that this is the correct section to post this , but I know you guys are super smart and maybe you could lend a hand. So, when I play bo3 or any other Cods for that matter, usually we press down the left thumbstick and hit forward the same time to sprint forward when playing. I've noticed recently that when I sprint forward recently, sometimes the character just walks instead of sprinting. It kinda sticks sometimes. Before I never had a problem with sprinting,  But idk, recently its just becoming a major issue and I'm loosing matches because of this. I bought a new controller and SOMETIMES I get the problem, sometimes I don't. Its weird. I'm usually laying down when I play. Maybe its because of the angle? Do you guys sometimes encounter this? Lastnight I took my controller apart and swapped thumbsticks. It worked for like an hour then reverted back to the same issue. I feel like i have to press down on the thumbstick harder for the character to start sprinting with no issues. Any help or suggestion would be appreciated. Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Season pass vs. Super pass </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-27 06:13:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Theres been alot of good ideas on how the way supplydrops should be delt with and other forms of new system that should be implemented for us as the consumer/customer can be happy with. That being said, essentially like it or not, they're all pay to win in some way, shape or form. But then again, I don't nessessarily believe that because I still shit on people that has the shadowclaw, garand and Marshall 16. Back in the days, season pass use to mean something. For being a loyal customer that wanted everything out of the game, we would purchase the season pass and it came with a ton of bonus content. Now, all u get is maps and a shitty remake. Pipeline remake was GARBAGE and I don't know who keeps telling treyarch to remake nuketown. Thats all the season the has to offer us now. If thats the case, just fucking take out supplydrops and add a super pass that guarantees us ALL DLC/EVERYTHING. season pass is maps only. And super pass, all camos, skins, maps, guns, mele, basically every item in the game. Lets face it everyone, this is what COD has come to. Atleast this way, we get what we want and these asshole gets their money. I wouldn't mind spending and extra $99 or $149.99 ontop of the base game if it means atleast ill get my hands of everything in the game from cradle to grave. Thank you all for listening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cryptokeys should work in conjunction  with SPM. If a person caps flags or confirm alot of tags or even pop them uavs and cuavs...it would raise spm and make teammates want to cap or hold hardpoint. Cryptokeys should be awarded...5 keys each guy if ur team wins and and atleast 6 keys depending on individual spm. Or they should do what AW did. Depending on SPM...earn a drop midgame or so. I use to get a drop for challenges and a second or sometimes 3 depending how good i do and of course every hour so.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-03-17 18:59:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, ever since bo2, they've been adding DLC weapons in the games. I've always been a season pass holder in almost all the cods and I STRONGLY believe we season pass holders should Get all dlc weapons...guns/meele included while non pass holders get em thru micro transactions or supplydrops. Now, Bo3 is just throwing every new weapon in supplydrops. Why not just up the season pass by $10 ($60) total value and get all dlc weapons or just have a weapons season pass for $19.99 ...and non pass holders get em thru supplydrops. Either way its a win/win for them and US. But this would be pay to win, right. You're right. Like it or not, cod has become pay to win. They need to remove suppydrops and put everything dlc in pass holders hands and aesthetics as microtransactions. If they want to bring back Cod points, fine. But supplydrops should be in a way that..each microtransactions should be something like...1.99 for a camo or 2000 cod points. And supply drops would give u random cods points only...1 drop...3..10..7....would be a total of 20 CP...towards that 2000 cp/1.99 microtransaction item. Cp shouldnt be bought. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure if you guys are aware, but Microsoft has announced that they're working on cross platform multi-player. Which means xbox guys and ps4 guys can now play together. What does this mean for cod? The player base will be huge. Maybe now, in future cod, we all can have all the modes in cod. Would this mean dedis will be a permanent thing? Or this does cross platform is only limited to certain titles? This is good for pc players because their community is very low. What do you guys think about this? I don't have a source available right now, but its all over the web. I believe it was announced a few days now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've made a thread on this previously, But as I said, Bo3 seems to be the only game that makes my ps4 fan spin loudly. My ps4 is clean, yet its still very loud when ONLY bo3 loads. I guess it uses alot of resources. Can anyone recommend a cooling usb device for me? I've seen a few , But not sure which one works best. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Sooo....what do guys think cod 2018 will be? Dare i say BO4? doubt it. Maybe WAW2? maybe something new? What about innovative stuff within the next 3 years for COD. we've already seen jetpacks and people want to go back to BOTG. has supply drops taken a permanent position? Will we travel from planet to planet for battles in the near cod? Could there possibly be a master modern warfare collection? Black ops master collection. Both collections with dedis and patched exploits with included dlc? Maybe, maybe not. I've heard that infinity ward will be using the same engine used to make COD AW....ugh..i didnt like the graphics too much on AW. speaking of which, imagine if the obsidian steed, speakeasy, insanity and silver bullet were in bo3. Omg!! ...Bo3 is down, I'm gonna kill some people with my steed. </TEXT>
