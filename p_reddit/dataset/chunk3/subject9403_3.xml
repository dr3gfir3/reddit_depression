	<TEXT> Was in college with a couple of friends who'd gotten back from Spring break in Flordia. One girl holds a seashell up to her ear and says, "It's the sound of the ocean!" I hold up my empty soda glass to my ear and say, "It's the sound of a refill!"  
  
Whenever I see someone get upset over something trivial or a minor mistake, like spilling coffee or something, I'll help them get over it by saying, "Well, if _________ is the worst thing that happens to you today, you could still have an awesome day!"  
  
I had a friend in high school who joked around with me a lot. One day he was really upset over asking a girl out who turned him down. I said to him, "Don't worry, it's not the end of the world..." and after a beat of silence I added, "Just yours." </TEXT>

A fun coop option that seems to fit your requirement would be **Forbidden Desert**, a game that goes 2-5 and is good at any player count, plays in 45-60 mins and has a lot of luck. It's a blast. </TEXT>

I watched for over a minute before I realize you could move the screen around. And it seemed that the first video with welcome to the dungeon had a whole lot of dead air space which is not what you want in a Let's Play especially a game like that which is right for banter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've occasionally forgotten the storage rule, but I don't think any of these rules are negative in any way. Rules by nature exist in every game to restrict certain actions while encouraging others, and I think they work very well in CoC. There is a lot to remember, yes, but I think if these restrictions didn't exist the game would be a lot less fun as the finely tuned balance would be thrown off. Just my 2 cents as a CoC fan boy though, you're free to have your own opinion. </TEXT>
