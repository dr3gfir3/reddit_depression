	<TEXT> Granted, I'm retired Navy and was a Cav Scout in the 80's with the Ohio National Guard...but it never made sense to me to have a tracked vehicle as a scout vehicle and we had the old M-113's. They are too damn noisy, spit out a shit ton of diesel fumes and if they break down or throw a track, it throws everything in disarray. 

At least with a Humvee or it's replacement, they are decently quiet and if they breakdown, easier to repair. </TEXT>

And there was nothing anyone could do to try to get the person because they were to far off the path or the shelling or rifle fire was to intense for them to stay in the open. As a result, that person would slowly sink over a weeks time going slowly mad and insane. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I did it. It's amazing because only 1 1/2 years ago, I could run 20 minutes without even thinking about it.  And I did this day and yes, it hurt; and yes, it was a challenge. But I did it and my pace was right around 11:45 minute/mile which makes me very happy!!  And My max heart rate was around 165 so although higher than I would have liked, also not horrible.

Not bad for a 49 year old who weighs around 300 pounds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked in Navy meteorology. When I was underway, we stood 12 hour watches, but it was either midwatch or day watch the entire cruise so I didn't have that fucked up schedule.

While on shore duty, we also stand a 12 on 12 off schedule (1700-0500 or 0500-1700) with a 2 week rotation like this:  Work: M, T / Off: W, TH  / Work: Fri, Sat, Sun / Off M, T / Work W, TH / Off Fri, Sat, Sun.

Although the 2 week rotation was better on the body than other shore based schedules I worked in my career, it was still pretty brutal. </TEXT>

But I finished the brief. That night I practiced in my room and practiced and practiced until my next brief. Was I nervous? Yep, but not nearly as bad and I was that day. But practice makes perfect. </TEXT>

While I was there, a guy comes into the hand clinic with the fleshy part of one of his hands splayed wide open. It was such a weird thing to see. Essentially he was cleaning his pistol and forgot it was loaded and BAM, he shot the meaty part of the hand.

	<TEXT> Well, the story goes that a 14 year old boy jumped from the Sioux City Plane crash right before it started tumbling and survived. Hell, even a representative from either the 82nd or 101st Airborne gave him jump wings and made him an honorary member.  From the [article](http://siouxcityjournal.com/news/a-story-of-ordinary-people-extraordinary-decency/article_7cb1529e-5458-5a2f-9970-38700534d384.html)

*Twenty years after the crash, I remember Tony Feeney, a 14-year-old Casper, Wyo., boy who was traveling alone to visit his grandmother in Chicago. During his recovery, he told me he remembered jumping from the plane just before it gouged the runway and cartwheeled.*

*His story seemed unlikely. But how could doctors explain friction burns that took the full thickness of skin from parts of his body?*

*I asked Tony what happened before he leapt from his seat and jumped.*

*The engine exploded and jolted him from this Walkman and heavy metal magazine, he told me. Terrified, he made the Sign of the Cross and started praying. When the captain told passengers to brace for landing, he started shaking. He wanted to hear his mother's voice.*

*When he had asthma attacks, his mother Mary Ellen's voice always calmed him and helped him breathe more easily. Now he wanted that "nice and soft" voice to hold him tight.*

*Whether or not Tony really jumped from the plane didn't matter. His story had truth nobody could ever question.*

*As he was falling from the sky to almost certain death, he reached inside for what he knew would always be there: his mother's love, his mother's voice. And it was there.* </TEXT>
