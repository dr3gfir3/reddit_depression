	<TITLE> Dave is hiking alone through very remote mountains when he comes upon a monastery. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-04 14:23:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The monks welcome him and invite him to stay the night and dine with them. Part way through dinner, one of the monks stands up and yells out 56    the whole room bursts into laughter, but eventually resume eating their meal. Dave thinks this is strange, but doesnt know what to do about it. 5 minutes later, a different monk stands and calls out, 341, and everyone laughs and laughs, even more than before. This pattern of calling out numbers and laughter continues throughout the meal. Eventually Dave can no longer contain himself, so he quietly asks the monk next to him what is going on. The monk explains that they have all been living in seclusion so long they know each others jokes by heart (a bit like reddit). The monk suggests Dave try it  So Dave thinks up a number, stands up and says 72  and a deadly silence falls over the room not one person so much as smiles

Dave meekly sat down, and whispered to the monk next to him, what did I do wrong, was that an inappropriate joke for mealtimes, or a joke invented by someone who has died?. The monk replied, oh there was nothing wrong with the joke, it was just the way you told it.

	<TEXT> 1. Drove across the El Paso border from Mexico in a Canadian Registered car and nobody checked our passports (all Australian and British nationals in car). When we got to the highway we turned around and had to argue with the border guards to issue us visas (visa waiver) - otherwiise we would technically have been illegals.

2. Flying into downtown seattle in a seaplane, shortly after 911,  with no pre-boarding baggage or passport checks.

3. Drive through bank ATMs.

4. Mall of America is one of the biggest malls in the known universe but doesn't have anywhere that serves decent coffee (no, Starbucks and Caribou are not decent coffee).

5. No roundabouts

6. Most of you don't understand "fortnight"

7. The number of houses with flagpoles/flags.

8. Went offroading with some friends in CO. There were a bunch of guys parked at the trailhead drinking beer and blasting away with rifles. The ground was a carpet of beer cans and shells. They were blasting across the track, and only stopped about 6' before the first car passed and started again as soon as the last car was 3' past them. As soon as we got to the first hill there was not a beer can or shell casing to be found.

Edited to add a couple more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry for the crappy pic. Took this a while ago so can't go back and take a better one. Lobster, Venison and Lamb all from Doubtful Sound region. 

Edit:
Wow, front page!  Never expected that. We whipped up this food after a day of kayaking and hiking when we were staying in Te Anau. 

Edit 2: Yes I realise this is a lot of food. We don't normally eat this much and are both very much in the healthy BMI range. I purchased all the ingredients on the spur of the moment after a day's hiking and kayaking. The next day we hiked 30+ km and 2000 m elevation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Australia we have a nifty program for elections that asks you your positions on policies and plots where you are on this graph compared to the major parties:

The bottom right corner would represent as right wing as possible vs the top left being as left wing as possible. But everything right of the centre would be considered right wing and vice versa.

	<TEXT> This. Most tafe or yr 12 level courses won't count after you are admitted to uni. Possibly even if you are transferring between courses, now that you have been admitted to uni. 
This may limit you to bridging courses or summer semester units at uni.
Talk to the engineering office (even if you are not enrolled yet), and get something in writing that it will count as credit/exemption.

	<TITLE> Perth LPT. Check the time on parking meters before you start feeding in coins. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title suggests, parking meters in Perth seem to have sensors that detect a car parking which then stops the clock. I have noticed this a few times now and I have started checking the time when I walk up to pay. e.g. today I walked up to one that had the time as 11:16, I pressed cancel twice and the time display jumped to 11:21.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are really talking about the lack of preservatives (i.e. "draft" beer). All beer sold in Germany is draft beer. How long it lasts depends on alcohol content. High ABV beers actually improve with age! (up to 12-18 months). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The filament, a nickel-chromium wire, was coupled to a thicker copper wire coated with silver. The silver coating was sometimes missing. Four tin solder joints attached the wires to each other and coupled the copper/silver wire to the air tube and mouthpiece. All cartomizers had evidence of use before packaging (burn spots on the fibers and electrophoretic movement of fluid in the fibers). Fibers in two cartomizers had green deposits that contained copper.
