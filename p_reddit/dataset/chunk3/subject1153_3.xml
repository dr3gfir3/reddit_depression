	<TEXT> Michael was a true investigative journalist in every sense of the word. He had balls of steel and wasn't afraid to uncover the secrets of the criminal Shadow Government which has operated above the law with impunity and caused untold misery, death, and destruction for many years. He was willing to go into uncharted territory. With the big story on CIA/Day Zero and the earth-shattering revelation of assassinations via hacked cars, I think we should all honor the great sacrifice Michael made to share the Truth with the world.

Michael, you put your colleagues in the MSM to shame. Where you showed great courage, they showed great cowardice and an eager willingness to mislead the public about the criminal Shadow Government. None of them have the integrity to even mention the Earth shattering revelation that conjures memories of your murder. For shame! You were a true hero and an American patriot. May you forever rest in peace. </TEXT>

He was quoted as saying "There is reason to believe that intelligence agencies for major powers  including the United States  know how to remotely seize control of a car. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, its far more likely that Obama is engaged in an attempted coup based on his proven track record of subversive and treasonous activity. People seem to forget that [Obama became the very danger the Constitution was designed to avoid.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2013/12/04/turley_obamas_become_the_very_danger_the_constitution_was_designed_to_avoid.html)

Obama is the one who consciously of his own free will [SWITCHED SIDES in the war on terror](http://www.centerforsecuritypolicy.org/2014/05/02/intel-brief-the-obama-administration-switched-sides-in-war-on-terror/) and [willfully gave rise to ISIS.](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2015/08/10/former_dia_chief_michael_flynn_says_rise_of_isis_was_willful_decision_of_us_government.html#!)

Obama is the one who persecuted the press like no POTUS before him. Obama is the one who used the IRS to persecute his political enemies. Obama is the one who paid the billion dollar ransom to Islamic state sponsors of terror. Obama is the one who installed a neo Nazi puppet government in Ukraine by allowing Nazi collaborator George Soros to dictate US foreign policy in Ukraine. Obama is the one who aligned himself with the terroristic BLM movement, inflaming racial hatred against whites and law enforcement.

Take a look at the top comments in the X-Post in /r/politics that was top of the front page a while ago. All of them completely overlook these facts. A great deception is afoot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, you don't have a clue! 

The game played today by many media outlets is to bury, or completely omit, the question Sessions was actually responding to in his exchange with Franken, and blithely assume he failed to disclose crucial information.
.
He did not reveal the communications at all, however. He did so knowing that Senator Franken was asking about communications with the Russians by anyone working for the Trump campaign, including people who, like Mr. Sessions, had other jobs while they volunteered for the Trump campaign.

The Times have mutated the subject of Sessions testimony to communications by people who had other jobs while they volunteered for the Trump campaign. But the question was about contacts between the campaign and the Russians, not every conversation, about anything, in any professional capacity, by everyone who helped with the campaign, with everyone born in Russia.

When will you people realise that people like Schumer, Franken, and Pelosi are taking advantage of your complete ignorance? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your interpretation of Session's words prove that you don't know wtf you're talking about on this matter. Clearly, the question was not an easy one to answer given his dual role on the SASC and as a part time surrogate of the Trump campaign, and the distinct duties that those two roles entail. Franken knew it was the perfect question to ask because he knew that Sessions duties on the SASC included talking to high level Russian govt officials - some of them spooks, on a regular basis. Franken understands that most on the Left simply can't intellectually grasp the significance of  it. He understands that they're dumb enough to buy into the false narrative that Trump is a secret Russian agent traitor. I mean, lets be honest. Taking advantage of ignorant people is what the Democratic party is famous for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The context changes everything, actually. 

This much should be painfully obvious and its a damn shame that so many people need this to be explained to them. 

Your level of ignorance makes me very pessimistic about the future of the human race because it seems so widespread.  Like stupidity gone viral or something.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mean perjured. And no, he didn't. Everything is being taken out of context because the Deep State is playing mind games with the unlearned, ignorant masses. He was member of the SASC when he "talked to the evil Russians." Talking to Russian spies is included in his job description. People in general have no clue how the world *really* works. I've decided to dedicate my time here on reddit to explaining how it really works, and all praise be to Jesus, I've been vindicated time and time again.

I mean, really. For fucks sake the stupidity and gullibility of the Left is truly mindblowing How can they not grasp what's going on here? Just consider who's leading the witch hunt. Career criminals like Chucky Schumer and Nancy Pelosi. The true scum of the Earth.  </TEXT>

There is simply no proof that Jeff Sessions committed perjury. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, *definitely* committed perjury. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She was pursuing a narrative with her questions,

An obviously FALSE narrative that attempts to delegitimize the duly elected POTUS. This alone proves Burnett is anti-American, but one can also point to the disparate treatment she gave to Hillary and Obama regarding their treasonous acts of aiding and abetting Al-Qaeda and giving rise to ISIS. Where was Burnett to ask the tough questions on that pink elephant? And before you go mouthing off about "partisan" statements, just realize that both Hillary and Obama did indeed aid and abet Al-Qaeda in Syria and Libya. You are clearly clueless on this matter. </TEXT>

TEPCO (or anybody else for that matter) simply can not extract the coriums that have melted through containment. They can't even send robots close enough to visualize them because the robots keep melting. And so the radioactive hemorrhaging into the Pacific is expected to continue for an eon barring some miracle. What is it about that you don't understand or agree with? </TEXT>
