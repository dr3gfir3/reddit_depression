	<TEXT> A few days before I officially came out about my disbelief, I was in the car with my little brother who is (and was at the time) 14 years old. He does the rehearsed testimony thing every month, with added nuggets of meaningless bullshit such as "I know that when you touch the temple, the temple touches you." So, being alone with him, I casually asked how he felt about the Church these days. He immediately responded "well I know the Church is true" like a fucking robot.

I asked, "But what does that actually mean to you?"

...No answer. He got this dumb look on his face like it had never occurred to him to think about even the most basic meaning of the phrase. Indoctrination is fun! </TEXT>

The whole family always looked miserable and I could never understand why everybody was so happy for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My trainer on my mission, who prided himself on letter-of-the-law things like always doing "a full 24-hour fast", said Game of Thrones was his favorite show. He also said Fight Club was his favorite movie, so I guess he didn't have much of an issue with adult-rated media in general.

I watched the first season and a half of Game of Thrones when I was still TBM. I didn't stop because I was bothered, I stopped because I felt like it was mostly boring. A few months ago I came around and watched the entire series from start to finish and now it's my favorite show under Breaking Bad (which I also watched as a TBM). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know there have been a million posts exactly like this in the past and I'm sure there will be a million more. And... I have nothing more to add to that statement. I'm not unique to the situation I'm in. Whatever, moving on.

I just had a conversation with my parents in which we discussed how much college is going to cost, and in the same conversation they revealed that they are choosing to withdraw most of the financial support they had originally promised--they were going to pay for half of my college and now it's down to one-seventh for reasons they're not telling me. Also in this conversation, they gave me the wonderful news that although my sister was allowed to use one of the family cars during all four years of college, they will not extend the same privilege to me (again, for reasons they refused to talk about).

I don't have a job right now. I've been looking all over for one but I'm at a bit of a disadvantage because there are very few things in this world I hate more than working in fast food and I'm too prideful to resign myself to it. I've done it in the past and it makes me want to die (huh, fitting). Recently I've come very close to getting jobs that I actually would have enjoyed doing, such as being a customer service rep, an overnight truck driver, and a few others; but I always get fucked out of it at the last second because it turns out I'm not old enough or something like that. Just today I was about to be hired for something great on the spot and then--"Oh, you're 19? I'm so sorry, come back when you're 21 and we'll give you the job." I keep hoping that I'll eventually find a job I don't hate if I look hard enough, but my parents (whom I live with at the moment because I'm completely broke) are tired of waiting. Could I walk into McDonald's tomorrow, hand a manager my resume and get the job instantly? Probably. But it's not that simple to me.

Bottom line is that the more I think about how my life is going to progress, the less I want to experience it. Now that I'm out of high school, I have to spend most of my time working shitty jobs so I can make enough money to do the most difficult schoolwork of my life for 4-8 years so I can work a slightly less shitty job for the rest of my life so that I can actually afford to spend any time at all doing what I want. I get it, that's how the world works, but that's not how I want MY life to go, and I'm really starting to feel like the only way I can avoid the way of the world is to leave it behind.

"Life's hard and sometimes you have to do things even when you really don't want to." Yada yada yeah, I know. To be able to do the things I want, I have to spend a lot of time doing the things I don't. I'm just not sure if I think it's worth it anymore.

I don't want to go to college. I don't want to work 40 hours a week for 40 years. I don't want to live in a world where I have no choice but to spend more time being miserable so I can spend less time being happy.

Any advice with a bit more substance than "forget yourself and go to work" would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I left the Church four months ago, I was still holding on to various tidbits of "evidence" that there is a god. But I'm finding that the more I rethink existence in general and my place in the universe, the less I think of those things as evidence. Any sort of connection I ever felt like I had to a higher power is completely gone and I'm realizing that it was all a misinterpretation of emotions in the first place.

It feels really good to think progressively. Huge thanks to all of you for helping me get to the point where I can do so. </TEXT>
