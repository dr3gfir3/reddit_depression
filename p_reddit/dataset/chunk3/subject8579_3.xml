She calls on little johnny "none they all fly away at the first gunshot" the teacher replies "the correct answer is 4 but I like your thinking" then little johnny replies "now I have a question for YOU. There are 3 women sitting on a bench eating ice cream. One is delicately liking the sides of a triple scoop ice cream, the second is gobbling down the top and sucking the cone and the third is biting of the top of the ice cream. Which one is married?" The teacher blushes and replies "well I guess the one that is gobbling down top and sucking the cone" "the correct answer is the one with the wedding ring on, but I like your thinking"

	<TEXT> I like this answer you have really made me think and made good points especially the high school mindset thing, he can be very immature. 

He's into the fake kind of girl I guess and I am anything but fake, I am totally against the whole fake thing. Stupid barbies. 

I think I am going to talk to him and apologise and lay off him, see how that turns out. At least then 'the ball will be in his court' :)  </TEXT>
