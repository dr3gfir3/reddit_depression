	<TEXT> Yeah, I was totally fine with the medication question, because obviously it could interact. His response was so not needed, you're right. And the two hour wait time would've been 100% okay if he hadn't been a horrible person throughout the consultation :( thanks for your advice!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Jake is a dick. My mom didn't go to university until she was 38 and there were tons of people around her age in her classes. 20 is a completely normal age to be starting university, you have nothing to feel bad about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he cared about you as deeply as you said, he wouldn't have dated another girl and then led you on. Please, save yourself the emotional turmoil and stop talking to this boy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honey, this boy doesn't care about you. He's using you and only pays attention to you when he's lonely and isn't getting attention from other girls. Please stop talking to him, it's only going to hurt you in the long run. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did she know there would be religious differences from the beginning? It seems like an odd thing to break up over a year in. She might have a different reason and is lying to spare your feelings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You need to stop talking to this girl. You're never going to heal if you keep cutting yourself open by talking to her. I know that it's really difficult, and it will hurt a lot at first, but after a couple weeks you won't think about her as much anymore. I'm actually going through this same thing right now. You can PM me if you need to talk. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not a healthy relationship. He wants your life to revolve around him, and that's not okay. You need to end things with him and focus on your self esteem and mental health before you bring somebody into your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should tell him. Being open and honest is key when dating a mentally ill person. Wait until you're feeling calm and relaxed, and explain your situation to him. I don't know the specifics of your mental illnesses, but I have depression, anxiety and OCD and sometimes I need my partner to be a little bit more patient with me than with a neurotypical partner. He can't understand some aspects of your life if you don't tell him why you do these things. If you need to be by yourself for a little because you're feeling depressed, it's way easier for you to be honest and say that you're having a bad depression day than it is for you to just say you don't want to talk to anybody. Good luck, OP. I hope that things work out between you two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She cheated on you, and then said she wanted radio silence for two weeks. If she wanted to be with you, she would be working on the relationship and trying to fix what she broke by kissing another boy. It's time to move on, OP. I'm sorry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm going through this same thing right now and you have to remember that if she was the perfect person for you, things would've worked out and you'd still be together. You ended the relationship for a reason. She was your first love, but your first love doesn't mean your only love. As for feeling like she's the only girl in the world, the breakup is still very fresh in your mind and it's normal to feel regret and that there's never going to be another person for you. You need to give yourself time to heal before you start thinking about somebody new. It's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen. I promise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once you lose someone, it's never exactly the same person that comes back. It sounds like you're just experiencing the normal anxiety that comes after a breakup, but you have to remember that you ended things for a reason. If you do decide to get back together, know that it's not going to be the same relationship you once had. A re-lit cigarette never tastes the same. </TEXT>
