	<TEXT> A friend and I were stranded in the South Australian country; having to walk 10 miles between a town of 1500 people to a town of less than 100 people.

4am and we are half way through our journey when a man in a milk van drives up to us. We never heard him coming.

"I'll give you a ride" he says, in a high pitched elongated yawn.

"Na, it's cool man, we're okay walking", we said.

"There was no way we were going with him", my friend exclaimed as he drove off.

2 weeks later, we are in the town bakery. As we shopped we discussed the 'weird milkman' incident.

Desperately, the woman working behind the counter asks: "when did this happen"?!

"2 weeks ago on Saturday", I replied.

She began crying and a lady doing some shopping told us not to be so insensitive. 

"What do you mean"? we asked.

"Her husband, the milkman', died 4 weeks ago.

He was described exactly as we remember him. Apart from one thing...

"A high pitched voice" I asked?

"No". She replied.

"A very deep voice".

"But he did hang himself"
