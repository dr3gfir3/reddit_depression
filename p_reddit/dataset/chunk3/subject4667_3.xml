	<TEXT> My dad went through the TSA checkpoint with a small self-inflateable mattress in his carry-on. When his bag was passing through the xray the agent saw the air pump and asked my dad what that was. He said "that's what blows it up." He missed his flight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My sex drive has been in overdrive for years (I'm 28) I love anything sexual. It's a release and for a brief moment I don't feel horrible, and I'm incredibly attracted to the female body. Even if there's no romantic interest, just playing with or seeing a female body drives me absolutely wild. I've only ever been with a few girls, and none have been able to keep up with my drive, so it makes for a frustrating life. But what else is new.

After being on antidepressants I'm feeling fairly stable. Just trying to get a consistent sleep schedule going. Seems like I can only sleep 4-5 hours at a time and at weird times. </TEXT>

Rotating 12 hour shifts every 2 weeks. Could never get a consistent sleep schedule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have bipolar disorder, and when I was first diagnosed and put on medication, I was feeling like it wasn't working to relieve my anxiety and aggression. So I decided to double my dose. Bad idea. I went into a mindless rage, screaming at my parents and breaking things. I'm 6'2" and 230lbs. My dad is 5'9" and 190lbs. He was nervous and knew he needed help to control me  so he called 911. That only made things worse for me, how dare my own father call 911 on me. I started screaming at him again and he started walking toward his bedroom. I know he keeps a gun under his bed, and I thought that was what he was going for, so I screamed "HES GOT A GUN" so the 911 operator could hear me. Within a minute I could hear sirens outside. This was my GTFO moment. 


It was dark outside, and I ran. I ran faster than I thought was possible for someone my size. I came across a neighborhood sign down the street that was front lit, about a 4' high brick sign, and I hid behind it. Seconds later 3 police cars with lights on and spotlights out lining up the woods around me came slowly rolling by. They never saw me. I was able to evade the police until we all calmed down and I was able to explain why that happened. Never again will I double a dose, and I flushed that particular medication and got something else immediately. </TEXT>
