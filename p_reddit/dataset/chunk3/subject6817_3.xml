	<TEXT> Proponents of Socialism love to tell everyone how the failed Socialist countries all over the world dont count as true examples of Socialism since they are all Totalitarian. What they dont understand is the simple fact that if citizens were allowed to think for a moment, many would come to the conclusion that they were living in a failed state. 

If Fidel Castro didnt kill everyone who breathed differently than him, people would have rebelled after the first few years. If Stalin and Mao didnt purge millions of forgotten men women and children who were innocent of everything except for thoughtcrimes, the people would have strung them up. 

There is a reason that the moment a country goes Communist every basic civil liberty goes out the window. There is a reason there is a blanket ban on any original art, poetry, music and film. They cant have anyone spreading the truth about how shitty everything really is. 

People who claim to be Socialist are monsters and they dont even know what they would end up having to do once in power.  </TEXT>

However, he does have strong positions that a lot of us don't necessarily like, specifically marijuana legalization, civil asset forfeiture and gay rights.

None of those things affect me personally, but I still think hes dead wrong. President Elect Trump knows what hes doing so I'm hoping this is for the best. </TEXT>
