Just because you don't regard something as sacred doesn't mean that we can't take it as sacred anymore. You should learn to be more tolerant of other people's beliefs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Peace be with you, bro.

I have personally studied Ahmadiyya literature myself to see if they sincerely were on the right path. I didn't focus so much on the final prophet issue, because they have written tons of literature to step around the simple fact that Muhammad (pbuh) truly is the seal of the prophets. Instead i read some of their other literature and found that they have a lot of different beliefs than mainstream Muslims. The Ahmadiyya group makes an effort to interpret Islam to appeal more to to opinions of modern society and fit with modern science. So far example, they will denounce all Jihad and commonly quote "Love for All, Hatred for None" even though Mirza Ghulam Ahmad wrote a lot of hateful stuff about the Christian community and in order to explain the great influence the Christian clergy had during his time, he would often refer to them as the 'Dajjal'.  Another example would be of  Adam (pbuh) not being allowed to go near the tree: ahmadis interpret that to mean that they weren't allowed to go near the entire family "tree" of not-yet evolved humans. 

[You should watch this video of one Muslim leaving the ahmadiyya community.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9QFFsHGXcUI)

Yes, but how exactly are they being oppressive? Just saying they are "oppressive" doesn't really mean anything. Were these regimes actively killing Sunnis? Were they united in their opposition against Sunni Muslims?

	<TEXT>  Do you honestly not understand the difference between want   condone?

There isn't much of a difference. 

Condone: accept and allow (behavior that is considered morally wrong or offensive) to continue.

 If that near-half of Indonesian Muslims who admitted to Pew Polling their desire for gay people to be torturously, publicly murdered had their way, the stonings would happen. 

Again, this is a misleading statement. Like i said before, they condemn gay marriage   penalize public sexual intercourse. They would NOT, if they had their way, go out and stone someone who has an abnormal sexual preference. 

And please stop with the straw mans. I never even mentioned Islamophobia. </TEXT>

If you read my comment again, i said that to say "they **condone** going out to stone Gays to death" would be a stretch and you did say according to your previous comment: "40% of Muslims want gay people stoned to death." So, yeah...

 I guess Islam is a religion of peace after all, I mean, apart from the sexism   anti-gay stuff,   how most Muslims want apostates to be murdered...   apart from the anti-free speech stuff... yep, just a good old religion, just like any other. Totally identical to all the others. I must just be a big racist bigot for standing up for the ethical treatment of others against Islamic principles which go against that.

Sure, Muslims in Indonesia don't recognize Gay marriage and they would probably penalize public gay/straight sexual intercourse and i understand that you disagree with this stance. But to say that they condone going out to stone Gays to death is a FOX-news type of stretch.  

Any public sexual act can be penalized. But some critics only like to point out the homosexual stuff to set an agenda.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome to r/islam! I hope you find suitable answers and resources here.

 What is Islam? What are the principal doctrines of Islam?

The word Islam means voluntary Submission or Surrender to the Will of God. It derives from the root word salam, meaning peace.
In the Quran, God defines that the only purpose for which He created mankind is to Worship Him. Islam recognizes that humankind has free choice in whether to obey or disobey God, but ultimately we will be held accountable to God in the next life for the choices that we make in this life.

God sent Prophets to teach mankind how to worship Him; starting with Adam, including Noah, Abraham, Moses, Jesus and the last of the messengers, Muhammad (peace be upon them all). The Islamic position is that all of these prophets came with the same message, that there is no deity worthy of worship except the One True God, known in Arabic as Allah.

Islam places great importance in the belief that the soul gives life to a human body. Likewise, in its absence, the human body dies and disintegrates. However, the soul is eternal and will be reunited with the body on the Day of Resurrection, when God will raise everyone to answer for their deeds on earth. Islam encourages the individual to focus on keeping the soul healthy, through the remembrance, obedience and worship of God. There should be a correct balance in strengthening the soul and not over-indulging with the pleasures of the body. Islam is a natural way of life that encourages one to give due attention to their relationship with God and His creation. Islam teaches that it is through the doing of good deeds and seeking the pleasure of God that souls find true happiness and peace. It is in this context that the word Islam derives from the root word salam, or peace.

	<TEXT> The Ahmadiyya group makes an effort to interpret Islam to appeal more to modern society and fit with modern science.  Someone with little knowledge of Islam, may end up falling for the ahmadiyya interpretation instead because their interpretation appeals more to the society they grew up in. But when you study more about Islam, and you study more of science, you'll realize insha'Allah, that their claims don't work.

So for example: Adam (pbuh) was told not to go near the tree. "O that must have been the entire human family tree - human evolution - that he wasn't supposed to go near".  -actual Ahmadiyya claim.

Any fighting is looked down upon in modern society. "Jihad doesn't mean physical fighting, it's only spiritual struggle. Muslims should never physically fight".  -Ahmadi's are against fighting in pretty much any context.

I have debated with the Ahmaddiya community before until they stopped talking to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you're new to Islam, then you don't really  have to bother with the shia sunni split. The split was due to a political difference that happened many years ago after Muhammad (pbuh).  They may pray slightly different, not a big deal really.  Its not like they split because of a creedal difference.

There are however splinter groups that formed overtime with different creeds, but they are always a minority and you really don't have to bother to learn about them.  Like i said, study from mainstream sources and if you wish, you can work your way then to other sources.

I could say more, but I don't want to confuse you.  Peace. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   So I am about to read the quran, and I saw that it was translated by ahmadiyya muslims (should I be wary about this translation?)

**DO NOT** read that translation that was sent by the person who sends spam messages.  It is very misleading.   I already refuted many of his claims in previous topics.

Go to Quran.com instead. 


 What hope is there for a muslim if it is a 1 in 73 chance of going to heaven?

That's not how it works. The spammer wants to convince you that Muslims are divided into 73 sects, and that he happens to be belong to the "saved" sect. Muslims are NOT divided to 73 sects as he portrays and Ahmaddiya are not even a sect.  

Study from mainstream sources (like the ones in the sidebar) and if you wish, you can then work your way down to other sources. The more you learn the more things will become clear to you.

There are several translations there so you can check if your friend is telling the truth. 
If you are certain that your friend is wrong about any particular argument, you can ask me about it.

Hadith criticism is hard.  You have to know the context of a particular hadith along with various other hadiths about that particular topic before arriving to a conclusion.
