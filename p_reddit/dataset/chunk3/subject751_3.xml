	<TEXT> Hi, all.

Tech: I have an android phone, my friend has an iphone

I recently exchanged numbers with someone and was patiently awaiting the confirmation text. The next day when I saw them we checked to see if the numbers had been put in correctly. She then called my phone to see if that would work. It did and right after the call, I got all of the text messages immediately after. Since then, I've not received any more messages.

I've tried searching for a solution ( google, /r/Android, and here ), but i can only find solutions for users who have switched from an iPhone to an Android. The solution was to turn off iMessage on the old iPhone. So I was wondering if having my friend turn their iMessage off will fix the issue, or if there is any other way to fix this I would be glad to hear it.

Thank you in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thud of the door behind me pierces the pre-existing and apparent silence in the apartment.

"Great," I mutter to myself, "this again."

Nothing. 

No sounds. 
No T.V. voices, no dishes clattering, no dishwasher running, nothing.

I maneuver myself to the kitchen, trying my best to avoid the garbage and miscellaneous clutter on the floor. I wish I could clean this up, but being out all day just drains any energy I had.

I try to remove some of the silence with the preparation of a simple sandwich. Though, theres little noise to be made with a bag of bread, a container meat, and a bottle of mustard.

I take my plate and melt into the couch. I reach for the remote and turn the T.V. on, hoping to kill some of the invasive silence. I must have flipped between every channel while eating my sandwich, then three more times before deciding there was nothing good on.

Nothing. Its always nothing, isnt it?

I set my plate on the ever present and always growing pile next to the couch, turn the T.V. off, and start making my way to the bedroom. One day, Ill pick them up, but for now I just want to sleep.

I wish I could afford to keep the T.V. on; it helps keep the silence out when Im trying to sleep. However, times are rough and its in my best interest to just deal with the silence.

As I shut the bedroom door behind me and stare at the always empty bed, I let out a pathetic, withering, awful sigh. Again.

Its always nothing, isnt it?

My eyes start to water and my throat starts to tighten as I flick off the lights and stumble towards the bed in the dark. I lift the covers and allow myself to be enveloped by the emptiness; by the silence. I try and hold the tears back as the silence berates me. 

Maybe one day I wont have to deal with the silence. Maybe Ill be able to rid myself of it.

But that wont be any time soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The resurrection thing reminds me of the opening of the movie Sync ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBftzMxDtIg)). I think it would definitley inspire either vigilante or gov. controlled "justice."

Also, i found [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/2pgnlw/wp_everyone_is_born_with_three_continues_which/) which, if you're up for reading, is about everyone having three lives.

Hope this give you some inspiration! </TEXT>
