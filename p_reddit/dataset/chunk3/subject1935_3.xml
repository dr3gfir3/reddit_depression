	<TEXT> BBC gets to make fringe television because it has compulsory purchase. Even something like Planet Earth would have never been made by commercial TV where they are beholden to advertisers.

AMC and HBO have the right idea. They never killed it in ratings, but they knew if they made compelling TV they could sell DVDs and merch. Breaking Bad was on the bubble for years but without ratings AMC made it the most celebrated TV show since The Sopranos. </TEXT>

Again, no video, no reports on Twitter or FB until almost two weeks after the fact. The weirdest thing is there is always someone in a comment section claiming they were there, yet no one is even doing that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It might be, but if some third party fails to fix the phone and infact makes it worse, why should the warranty be valid. You paid them an insurance so that if your phone is damaged, they will fix it for you. If you decided not to go that root, why are they responsible to redo someone elses damage? Especially at a later date. Say your repair guy 'fixed it' with shoddy components and unauthorizied 'hacks' that really just extended the life rather than an actual fix. Then you send it back under warranty and they see this mess.

That's why the warranty is invalidated, because they can't stand behind someone elses work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always here stuff like this when people talk about government certifications. In Ireland the big one is the NCT which is a test to make sure your car is still road worthy.

But how much money is the government really making from these things? To you it is give them 30 quid, take a test and they print a peice of paper. From your perspective that seems like a rip off. 

From the other end, they need an office, so they are paying rent or if they own it, maintainence. They probably have a lady at the front desk. She needs wages. The person to install the computers for the test needs to get paid too. And the cleaner who comes every night. And then there are other employees you don't see. There was the backend money spent to design a test so everything is up to code, that needs to be recouped. The computer systems too. Oh and do they use bespoke software? Because that needs to be paid for too. Then the test needs to be reviewed every few years to make sure it is still up to date.

If you think the government are setting up a scheme to scam labourers out of 30 dollars a year, you really have no idea how government spending works. Probably lucky if they break even. If they want more money it's probably easier just to put extra tax on the tools they use or just up income, sales or some other tax. Certification from a government perspective is a pretty inefficient way to raise coffers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It annoys me too but the Irish press practically do the same thing.

If an American with Irish ancestry is doing really well, the press has no problem describing them as Irish.
http://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/irish-author-emma-cline-i-grew-up-hearing-about-cults-and-communes-34823096.html

If someone from the North identifies as British or Northern Irish, you will still see papers here calling them Irish. Think of Ash, Stiff Little Fingers, Kenneth Brannagh and Rory McIllroy (although to be fair, McIllroy changes how he identifies himself every other day).

	<TEXT> Would you call it dystopian? Dystopia's usually mean that life is pretty bad for all but a few. In this movie, life is pretty similar, if not better for most people. Even the students of Hailsham have it better than most of the people like them.

It's not an ideal world, but a dystopia to me is usually post apocolyptic or has a top heavy abusive power structure. For the most part this isn't present in Never Let Me Go, so I think the moniker is unfitting. </TEXT>

No they are not. They are selling you a version of the game to work on new hardware, to people who owned it and people who have never played it before. They care about the cultural milestone that the first Mario Bros. game and understand they should make it easier for modern audeinces to play.

In the meantime try and play a copy an Xbox Microsoft title or a Playstation Sony title.

	<TEXT> When Max Payne was released on Steam, it was found to be the cracked version. I don't really see what the big deal is. Cracks are released for free with no license, so I don't see why they aren't fair game. Also it is more hypocritical of a pirate to call out a company for piracy than the other way round. The ROM in the article is all Nintendo's intellectual property, from the code to the visuals. I don't see the issue in them downloading their own IP.


Now if cracks had code in them that you needed to bypass to reverse engineer, then that would be against the DCMA and that would be hypocritical. </TEXT>

then how couldn't the majority of news companies who were pro democrats and Hillary get her in?

Until I actually play all I can suggest is that maybe it was an attempt to paint the future as where gender identity isn't controversial anymore and it's just day to day conversation.

In the podcast Welcome to Night Vale, they have several gay characters but in the Night Vale world, homosexuality is a non event. In the book there is a scene where a mother asks her son if he is having girl trouble and then immediatly asks after is it boy trouble. In that world those questions could be asked in any order and both would be considered norm.

But now I'm just speculating. I will play the game soon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the Chronicle games was set in 1914 and at the start of Unity they included upcoming Helix adventures that would post date the auto mobile. 

The in-game reason is that driving a car is too mundane to create genetic memories (this doesn't seem to apply to horseback riding carraiges or boats), so I guess it would be possible to have a game as long as it didn't involve driving. Which makes sense, because why would you want to drive around in a sandbox parkour game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The story is already written. Hitler, Churchill and FDR were all in chaoots. Hitler was given the Apple and was suppose to stage his suicide in his bunker with a body double. The Brotherhood infiltrated the bunker and killed the real Hitler. This is all Canon.

EDIT: [For people asking for proof](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/World_War_II). Hitler, FDR, Stalin and Churchill were all Templar puppets. The war was in effort to create a new world government. Hitler was to fake his death and abscond with the Apple and meet up with Churchill, but Hitler was killed by Assassin's before this could happen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TicketMaster don't usually pay tour support. That's either a label, or promoters. In a simplification of their model, Ticketmaster essentially went to every venue and said, hey, we'll buy all your tickets for the year at a discounted rate (great for the venue) and act as reseller. After they did that to pretty much every venue they started setting other terms, like sellback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the market doesn't set the price. What happens is a bunch of professionals buy tickets en masse. Then they control demand. They can pump up the price because they have created an artificial scarcity. They can hoodwink a few people people for the tickets priced above to recoup their costs. Once they recoup you will see the prices go jump up and down. Then just before the gig you will see the market flood with cheaper tickets from people who can't make the show and scalpers offloading the last of their stock.

There is no invisible hand here. It is pure market manipulation. Ticketmaster have made it worse by endorsing the practice with Seatwave. </TEXT>

Also the whole prophesy thing obviously doesn't happen in the first film. It is inspired by the Disney animated movie, but in no way a continuation. It's more in line with Hook. A sequel of sorts to a story most people know, with some details changed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are just listing movies at me and I don't know why.

Are these all movies that didn't recoup in 2016?

I didn't say that movies don't under perform. I am saying Hollywood used to make a lot of smaller personal projects if the actor / director would take on a big project in handshake deals. That doesn't happen as much anymore. If Liam Hemsworth wants to star in a biopic of Sir Edmund Barton, before you could agree to a sequel or some big blockbuster and then make a small passion project. Hollywood doesn't do deals like that any more. </TEXT>

This wasn't always the case. Used to be Hollywood was run like the mob. You'd do a big movie for a studio and then they would let you do your smaller personal movie in a back alley deal. Dino de Laurentiis would produce movies just for the pay check, then bankrupt the company and never even bother to release the movie. Bill and Ted was suppose to be one of those movies.

Now the only movies made that they don't think will gross big is movies that will win Oscars and the Assassin's Creed movie. </TEXT>

How does the analogy not fit. A piece of media that you don't like is being forced delivered to you (it auto downloaded). And when you try and get rid of it you can't (initially, eventually you had to download a separate tool to remove it). Ultimately you don't have to listen to it and you can just ignore it (like the Daily Mail in my analogy) but every time you see that thing, it is going to make you a little pissed.
