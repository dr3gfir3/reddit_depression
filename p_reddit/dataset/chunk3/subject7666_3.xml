I didn't get moved to a room for over 24 hours -- nurses were coming back for their next shift and were surprised to still see me there. Gonna bet a lot of the people he saw that day *were* on drugs. 

Two other patients I remember: an elderly woman who slipped getting off a bus who was in extreme pain when the nurses were around but was calmly discussing their potential lawsuit with her husband when they were not. And a guy who was in a motorcycle accident and was brought in on a backboard with a neckbrace who kept trying to get up. The nurse was yelling at him, "Stay down, you idiot! You want to be like Chris Reeves?"  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because anti-Semitic groups warned their followers in the early days of the 20th Century that the Jews were removing Christmas from popular culture and they used that, among many other things, as a rallying cry. Because every now and then some school function or city display would get challenged by someone who was not Christian and it would be a minor news story. Because about 12 years ago some department stores asked their employees to say "Happy holidays" instead of "Merry Christmas" to be more inclusive of their shoppers, and Bill O'Reilly blew it up into a war on Christmas that FOX pushed hard every year, blowing it well out of proportion because 24-hour cable news must keep you terrified of something or you might turn away.

	<TEXT> I had a mini-stroke. Does that count?

I had a headache that morning, and I rarely get headaches. I was typing an email and was getting frustrated that I kept mistyping the same words, over and over, no matter how carefully I typed. A coworker was putting herself down to another coworker near my desk, as she often did, and I blew up at her for doing it and left the office. (I do not lose my temper or my cool, ever. I'm known and mocked for it.)

I was walking around outside, realized I was getting really dizzy and called my wife, who called a friend in my company to come out, find me, and drive me to the hospital. 

Now at that point I still felt headachy and dizzy, but otherwise OK. When the nurse asked me my social security number I answered, and she stared at me and asked it again. I told her again. She told me, calmly, that I wasn't making any sense. I tried again. She called for people to get me into emergency. No idea what I was saying, but in my head it was right. 

The headache got a *lot* worse, blinding. A doc came in, examined me, and said I was on drugs. My brother-in-law physically stopped him from walking away and forced to keep checking. They finally found blockage in my carotid artery that was enough to be very dangerous but not enough to require immediate surgery. I was on cholesterol drugs for a few years after that and aspirin every since, and I modified my diet. No lasting damage from the mini-stroke, it was a warning shot. I was very lucky. </TEXT>

Doesn't matter if it's consistent with anything he's ever said before. Mr. Trump sees every encounter as a challenge, and he will win that challenge, whatever it takes. His only consistent stance is that he is the best there is. Everything else, everything, can be changed at a whim to suit his needs.

	<TEXT> Banning does reduce the rate, since it becomes more difficult to get, but it drastically raises the rate of dangerous abortions. One way to answer is to ask why so many of the same people fighting against abortion also fight against comprehensive sex ed and birth control, which are the two things proven to actually reduce abortions safely. 

Some people believe abortion is murder, and allowing any means condoning those murders. Some people do not like other people having sex and want them to suffer the penalties of it. Some people do not like women having control over their bodies. Some people just want control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - Donate to causes that can help fight the worst likely effects and help with others. There are a lot out there, but here's a few to start: [ACLU](http://www.aclu.org), [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/),  [Center for Reproductive Rights](https://www.reproductiverights.org/), [National Resources Defense Council](https://www.nrdc.org/),  [International Refugee Assistance Project](http://www.refugeerights.org/donate/), [The Trevor Project](http://www.thetrevorproject.org/),  [Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund](http://www.maldef.org/)

- Possibly the easiest way to donate is to go to [smile.amazon.com](http://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_aas_redirect?ie=UTF8 *Version*=1 *entries*=0) and set up your preferred charity, and from then on when you go to Amazon use that link so a portion of your sale goes to the charity.

- Facebook now [has a way to report fake news](https://www.buzzfeed.com/craigsilverman/heres-how-to-report-fake-news-on-facebook?utm_term=.apOdL1roPA#.flOvQwzPp2). Do that every time people send you easily-disproven propaganda. 

- Support newspapers and media who are actively working to report legitimate, investigative news. This administration will almost certainly be just as hostile towards the media as it was during his campaign, and Mr. Trump has already shown signs of wanting to control the narrative and stomp on critical news. Pay for subscriptions. 

- Get involved in local politics. The vast majority of people in office now started out in public service -- with the notable exception of the president-elect -- and it's a way to make a huge difference, especially in city/county councils and school boards.

-  Stand up against local hate. Don't let anyone harass someone in your presence. Keep yourself safe, but don't be a silent witness. If nothing else, Facebook Live it. 

- Call your local politicians and let them know exactly how you feel about the president-elect, his nominated cabinet members and his stated plans. Be polite and respectful when you do. [Here's how to find them](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials).  

- If you're using the ACA, take advantage of your healthcare while you can. Get checkups, get birth control, get screenings, get an IUD. If you're a pregnant woman, ask for a breast pump. It'll take some time for the GOP to dismantle the ACA but it's in their sights.

- If you are gay and married, your marriage cannot be removed even if the laws change. But religious freedom laws will almost certainly come along, of the sort that Mike Pence tried to push through in Indiana before national pushback finally forced him to back down, and they will make it easier for people who object to homosexuality to deny you service. This sounds silly when we're talking about wedding cakes and venues, but it becomes scary when you see that the same language allows denial of service from county clerks, pharmacies, hospitals... You may wish to get powers of attorney for each other, get living wills, get all the documents that you didn't think you'd need anymore.

- If you're gay and not married but planned to, might want to step that up.

- If you are trans and you have transitioned or are in the middle of it, get your documents updated immediately. 

- Make sure you have all the documents you need to register to vote. Voter ID laws are about to explode and you'll need to make sure your voice is heard. Get your Social Security card, get your birth certificate, make sure you are registered correctly in your county and check now to make sure your record wasn't "accidentally" purged.

- Stay alert and informed, but do what you need to do to relax sometimes. You won't help anyone if you're freaked out all the time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys? Please look up the etymology of the word "gender." It has never officially meant biological sex, although many people these days (and, apparently, everyone commenting here) use it interchangeably. Traditionally it has referred to masculine or feminine attributes. The American Heritage Dictionary explanation of the terms:

**The effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the sex (not gender) of the patient.
In peasant societies, gender (not sex) roles are likely to be more clearly defined.**

"Gender" refers to the range of characteristics, social constructs and, yes, DNA, pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. 

You still may think there are only two gender roles and that they must align with the biological sex of a person, but it is a valid question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At an Art in Odd Places exhibition in Orlando this weekend, one artist was asking strangers visiting her table to pair off and make eye contact with each other for a full, timed minute. If no one was available to match up with, she'd do it herself.

It was decidedly weird. I'm not a big eye contact person anyway -- my hearing isn't great and I tend to watch lips -- and the only person I'd held contact with for more than a few seconds at a time for many years was my wife and my kids.

But I stared into the eyes of a total stranger, a woman named Pamela whose friends walked up to the table with her and then bailed on her, for what seemed like a very long time. I could hear my wife and her newly-assigned stranger giggling a lot, but Pamela and I just looked and smiled. Very clear, light brown eyes, almost golden.

After, the artist handed us a plastic camera that spits out cheesy looking photos, and asked us to take pictures of each other and then write something about the other person on them. We could keep the pics, or hang them up by her table. Most people hung them, and took phone pics of the display for themselves. There were a lot of people hanging up there, and all of them were smiling.

Not a life-changing experience, but definitely one that changed our moods and left us smiling for a little while. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A German scientist decided to see if some colors were warmer or cooler than other colors, so he put a prism in sunlight to create a rainbow and put thermometers in each color to see what happened. He also wanted to measure the temperature of "normal" sunlight to compare them, and he set thermometers outside the rainbow for that. 

He found that all of the colors by themselves were warmer than just sunlight, starting from violet and getting warmer as you get closer to red. But the thermometer he set next to red, where there were no colors he could see, was the hottest. 

That's how he discovered infrared, by accident. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep. The big spectacle moments should amplify whatever's been happening all along. They should plunge you into despair or excitement and elation because they're happening to someone you've come to care about. 

Abrams tends to coast on that, especially in movies where he thinks audiences will come in the theater already caring about the characters before the movie even starts. Doesn't work that way.

	<TEXT> Abrams excels at fan-pleasing, hell-yeah scenes. You can tell, watching, that these are the scenes that were in his mind when he started writing.

He falls short at everything in between them that would give them meaning or weight, though. There's just whatever contrived sequence of events necessary to get the characters from one cool scene to another.

Deep meaning? Nope. Laws of physics? If they get in the way of a cool scene, dump 'em, no one cares that if you can see planets that big in the sky, their destruction would also take out the planet you're standing on. But that gives what happens a video game cutscene feel: shallow, shiny, doesn't really mean anything. (Except that these days video games often have more emotional depth than Abrams movies.)

I enjoy his stuff. I liked the first Star Trek movie and liked some of the third. I enjoyed the cotton-candy fansquee movie that was "The Force Awakens." But there's no point trying to analyze them, or look for anything deeper in them than "that looked cool." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For some of them, it's because they had already begun celebrating the idea of a woman president and the actual outcome seemed unthinkable. Dropping from elation to despair in a few hours leaves its mark.

For some, it's because they saw great strides in the acceptance of (or, rather the prohibition of discrimination against) multiple genders and sexual attractions, to the point where more people were comfortable coming out and living freely and planning their futures, and now they see that door potentially being slammed shut again.

For some, it's because they belong to a gender or a nationality or a religion that has been dismissed or openly threatened by our new president, and threatened by the rhetoric (and, already, the actions) of many of his followers. 

For some, it's because the removal of Obamacare, which our new president has promised, means death for themselves or a loved one.

For some, it's because a government which has already been fighting hard to pass every anti-abortion law they could possibly think of has just had its opposition removed.

For some, it's because they were already fighting uphill to get disproportionate numbers of black deaths by law enforcement addressed and they know now that not only will things likely get worse but they'll be blamed for it.

For some, it's because movement on climate change was agonizingly slow already and now even that is over, and our future may be sealed.

For some, it's because our new president's thoughts on NATO countries and his appreciation of Putin suggests he will not move to protect the Baltic states and Russia will sweep down into Europe.

For some, it's the hard realization how many people in the country hate and resent them, and no longer feel compelled to hide or disguise that fact.

For some, it's the despair that we are now and forever the country that elected Donald Trump president. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Trump thinks climate change is a hoax and reportedly plans to load his cabinet with people who agree. He said he has heard terrible things about the US National Institutes of Health. He wanted to eliminate the Department of Education and will almost certainly reduce it. He wants the EPA gone, or at least drastically reduced. He wants tech companies to provide ways for the government to break their encryption. His VP, Mike Pence, is a young-earth creationist who wants creationism taught in schools and has criticized President Obama for supporting embryonic stem-cell research. 

To be fair, Trump has not released many specific plans, but based on his previous statements and the stated opinions of people being considered for his cabinet, plus the hostile environment for non-white Americans we're already seeing and stricter immigrations laws sure to come, I am fully expecting to see fewer people pursuing scientific fields and many scientists uninterested in working for the government or a corporation leaving or avoiding the country.

I would love to be proven wrong.

Includes:

* THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated;

* FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars' worth of job-producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal.

* SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward

* SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America's water and environmental infrastructure

Trump is said to be favoring his friend [Harold Hamm](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/trumps-energy-whisperer-225877) for the Energy department. Both want to increase domestic oil production to reduce dependence on foreign oil.

Trump promised to junk the EPA back in March but [backed off that promise in September](http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/trump-backs-off-plan-to-eliminate-epa/article/2602581), saying he was going to reduce and refocus it instead, and "repeal major EPA environmental regulations such as the Clean Power Plan, the Waters of the United States rule and Obama's Climate Action Plan, which directed several Cabinet-level departments to start working on regulations to limit carbon pollution." Also said he wants to open up drilling on federal land.

Trump has said before he believes climate change to be a hoax, and is said by several news sources to be looking at noted climate-change mocker Myron Ebell as his EPA head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, that I would recognize. I've done NaNoWriMo for over a decade, won some, didn't win some. I don't need the event for motivation. 

I'm not blaming the election specifically, the same thing would happen if, say, there was a major scientific breakthrough or a war broke out or something else equally significant. It's hard to explain without describing the plot in detail, but real-world events may now be moving much faster -- or at least in a different direction -- than I had plotted for and my choices now are to either junk the last third of the book, or write it in an alternate universe where this didn't happen, and that would take a lot of the impact away, I think. Like if you were halfway through writing a book about people fighting to cure cancer in 2025 and then CNN tells you a cure was discovered Thursday. 

It's still workable, I think. I'll take a few days to process and see. </TEXT>

I have no idea how to write it now. I figured on a slower slide toward future ruin, and even if this presidency doesn't lead to that -- I'm trying to stay optimistic, who knows, it might work -- it's such a huge game-changer it won't fit in my story but will be conspicuously absent if I don't.

I've had this book in my head for six years now, and suddenly it's adrift. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OP said "White people are the only ones not allowed to be proud of the colour of their skin." I offered a reason why. Challenging what I said doesn't change what I said. Bringing in other examples doesn't change what I said. 

Over the past couple hundred years, various groups of people in the US used "white people" to mean, specifically, "better-than-black." (Also in Europe and in South Africa and other places where such a distinction seemed necessary to them.) This is provably true. Doesn't mean all or even most white people did the same, just that enough of them did so and did so loudly while they were stringing up black people or fighting to keep them out of the voting booth and out of white schools and out of white neighborhoods and away from white spouses. Doesn't mean that white people haven't done anything good, or that bad things have never happened to white people. 

Because of that, when someone brags now about their white heritage or talks about the white race -- as opposed to their regional or national or religious heritage -- whatever that person might have meant by it, what many people hear is "I'm racist and proud of it." 

That may not be fair, but that's how it is at the moment. If you form a group to clean up neighborhood trash and bring meals to poor people and you call yourselves the Klu Klux Klan, it doesn't matter what your intentions are. If you fly your swastika because you treasure its historic Indian symbolism of peace and continuity, you're going to get glares. Just how it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sigh.

I am not condemning all white people. I have not condemned all white people. I recognize the things people here have been eager to tell me about the history and abolition of slavery in Europe and the US. I am responding to the OP statement that white people are not allowed to be proud of their skin.

My answer, which none of the responses have paid much attention to, is that in the last couple of hundred years, when I read about people who are proud to be white, it has nearly always meant "proud not to be black." White pride. White power. White supremacy. The purity of the white race. Nothing anyone has said to me here has changed that. 

Africans were not proud to be black before they were enslaved. They never had to be. They were who they were, and they identified as whatever family or region or religion they were from. It was only after they were pushed into that position that they started wearing the description as a mark of pride and began using it to build a new culture. 

You can,. of course, be just as proud of being white as you want. Many people are. But I'm going to question why you feel the need to be. </TEXT>

My point, way back when, was that during those time periods some people defined themselves in opposition to a group of people they considered subhuman, and that description was pushed hard by more people through the years who were determined to keep that distinction alive. None of the responses to my argument seem to acknowledge history or the context of those times, as if everything must be explained solely based on what's happened in the last five minutes and nothing before then matters.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not unlike a [review I wrote six years ago, for "The DaVinci Code."](http://subject7666.com/no-cure-for-the-common-code/)

INT. SIR TEABINGS STUDY, NIGHT. Langdon, Teabing, and Sophie are studying the unrolled painting of the Mona Lisa.

LANGDON: There appear to be numbers under the paint, each one corresponding to a different color. What could it mean? Is it a hidden code?

SOPHIE: It must be. Hidden codes have followed me all my life.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: INT. LIBRARY. A teenage Sophie is frantically grabbing at book after book, body-checking other patrons over railings and through windows in the process.

SOPHIE (voiceover): For years I had considered syphilis preferable to the written word, preferring to have everything read to me by passersby. It was only after I developed a physical addiction to crossword puzzles that I discovered my knack for deciphering, which was carefully coaxed into life by my psychopathic cryptology teacher.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: INT. CLASSROOM. Surrounded by other children  some chained to their desks with intricately worked locks, some nailed to the wall in a binary pattern  the young Sophie looks fearfully at her teacher, Professor Allright, who is grimly carving the Atbash Cypher into an underclassman.

ALLRIGHT (voiceover): Woe to the student who couldnt solve the deviously difficult puzzle that opened the bathroom, or navigate the hidden traps and spring-loaded dangers of recess. I knew that one of these children would someday have to defy unstoppable, all-powerful enemies to crack an ancient code and expose the secret at the core of western religion itself, and it was up to me to craft them into twitching, neurotic, anal-retentive cryptographers, especially young Sophie to whom I was oddly drawn. Even my beloved sister, who did her best to brighten my days, came second to my destiny.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: EXT. SUNLIT PARK. Professor Allright is being dragged by the feet into a sunny glen by his sister, a laughing young woman named Giselle. We focus on her, ignoring Allright who will never be mentioned again. She stops suddenly, terrified, staring at something we wont learn about for at least six more flashbacks, and then runs away.

GISELLE (voiceover): I kept trying to draw my brother away from the enclosed scholastic life and constant child abuse allegations and into the bright sunlight of Paris to live and breathe and experience. This was difficult because of his fierce dedication and because we lived in Chicago. Yet I could never forget what I saw on that fateful day. I never forgot it. Never, not even for a little bit, it was just that bad. Really, really bad. I moved to Washington and got a job creating celebrity crossword puzzles.

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: INT. TEABINGS STUDY. Teabing is snoring on the couch. Langdon is ripping apart another priceless painting with a claw hammer.

LANGDON: See? This dog doesnt belong with the others! Hes holding Go Fish cards, not poker cards! It all fits!

SOPHIE: So all this time those crossword puzzles were connected through a bizarre series of coincidences that make little sense and advance the plot not at all!

LANGDON: Were close, weve very close. All we need is one more attack by masked assailants and Ill have it!

SOPHIE: What?

LANGDON: Another Oscar. If I dont get one every few years, I break out.

TEABING (jerking awake): Sorry, I was suddenly remembering the Palazzo Ducale in Venice, residence of the Doge and decorated with frescoes and paintings (including Tintorettos Paradise, the worlds largest oil canvas) that conceal the hidden chambers where the Council of Ten met, the tribunal where three judges condemned the guilty and hanged them from the rafters, and the cramped leads cells under the roof from which Casanova famously escaped. Which is odd, because Ive never been there.

SOPHIE: Aha! I can see words when I hold this brass and cherry wood Flintstone Secret Decoder Device over Langdons body! Chicken Doses Viaduct. What could it be?

LANGDON: Heh, yeah, never mind that, I was filming Turner and Hooch and I was drunk and there was this tattoo place no, dont!

FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: EXT. ALLEYWAY, NIGHT. Langdon is sitting in a police car on a movie set. A large dog is next to him, licking his face with a tongue the size of a porterhouse steak.

LANGDON: Nooooooo!

	<TEXT> It really was. Plus there was the massive slave trade through the Caribbean. It was a worldwide issue that was not restricted solely to white slavers or black slaves.

But the southern U.S.'s determination to keep their peculiar institution years after so many other countries were condemning it was part of what led to the KKK's concept of the "white" race. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First we were English, and Saxons, and Swiss, and French, and Spanish, and more and more. Some of us fought to become Americans. You defined yourself by your nationality, or perhaps your faith. No one defined themselves by skin color. 

Then we began enslaving Africans and we called them black. We talked about how dangerous they were and how lazy and how violent and sexual and beastlike and stupid, and to differentiate ourselves from them we started calling ourselves white. 

Once slavery was ended, and we got through the long Reconstruction period where former slaveowners and disgruntled Confederates did their very best to continue painting blacks as animals that did not deserve freedom and certainly not jobs or land, some of us in the early 20th century banded together to promote the superiority of the white man by harassing and sometimes lynching black people. When we argued in Congress to keep black people away from the voting booth, or out of the white schools and white neighborhoods, or from marrying white people, to be white became a mark of pride and community. To be white meant you were not black, it meant you knew you were better. To want white power and white pride meant that you wanted to keep blacks (and Jews, and other marginalized peoples) in their place.

See, black people weren't blacks before. They had their own names for themselves and their own heritages and histories. We made them black by taking them away from their homes and forcing them to make a new community here. We made them black by calling them that and worse, and they took that name and others back to use themselves out of pride and a need to redefine themselves as strong and capable and equal.

So, no. I am very proud of being an American, and to a lesser degree I'm proud of my English roots, but I will not go around saying I am proud of being white because the only reason it ever became a thing in the first place was to help keep down the people who were not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And totally forgot, /u/GEARHEADGus . But I remembered this morning on the way out the door.

[Here's the pics.](http://imgur.com/gallery/W8OXt) 

I use it most often when I'll be walking a lot or moving through crowds. I can fit my camera with lens attached, and two or three other lenses as needed in the main, padded pocket. I [use this insert](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001120WQ8/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8 psc=1), with a folded t-shirt underneath it for more padding. I can usually slip a speedlite between the insert and the side of the bag.

In front of that is a second zippered compartment, which takes my lighting stuff (diffusers, etc) and a folding bracket I use to get my flash off the body. A snap pocket is in front, keeps my business cards, gray card, charging cables, remote trigger, whatever's small and easily lost.

There's another zippered compartment behind the main one. I don't put anything bulky there, it gets uncomfortable to carry, but my iPad fits nicely. The rear document pocket (Velcroed) is for any papers I need, and for a folded plastic rain cover. The flap pocket is where I put extra camera batteries, cleaning supplies, AA batteries, whatever I need to grab quickly.

That's the most loaded I keep it. Most often I have a much smaller selection of stuff in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not Reddit. I am me. Here's what I believe.

Policies based on supply-side economics do not work. Policies based solely on demand-side economics don't work either. A mix is required to deal with the back and forth of the market without breaking things. Since the 1980s the GOP's emphasis has been on supply-side policies, and we've seen, we've very visibly seen the effects.  I'm not saying the rich hole up in their mansions and dive into their money, but you can't deny that since then there has been a sharp upward curve in the income of the upper percentages versus the middle and lower classes. State governments that push hard for supply-side policies and tax cuts that primarily benefit the wealthy see their budgets tank. Enough of the rich take their profits and invest in things that benefit them personally instead of the intended goal of using it to create more jobs or pay their workers enough to reinforce the middle class.

Instead of picking at my word choices, perhaps you could point to some states whose supply-side policies have worked? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So perhaps you should have mentioned the law in your original question? You asked why other races aren't allowed to say it, and I responded. You didn't ask why the UK made it illegal.

But again, I'm going to stress that when someone in a group uses a term commonly used against the group, it's understood that they mean no harm by it, an assumption that cannot be made about someone outside the group saying it. 

That said, I think the law as you've posted it is there for a couple reasons. One, to allow officers to add charges onto someone committing a hate crime. Two, to inform British society that calling someone a historic slur is wrong for the reasons I've discussed above. That said, First Amendment considerations would probably prevent such a law from going into effect in the US. The UK has always been tougher on what can be written or said in public.

I'd also like to point out a problem in your OP.

"We all know that it's derived from a racial slur in which black people originally didn't like."

More accurately, "We all know that it's derived from a racial slur that white people used against black people during a period when many white people considered black people less than human and treated them accordingly, and that many racists continue to use the same way today."

"Didn't like" makes it sound like they were annoyed by a neighbor letting his trash cans roll into their yards.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People in a marginalized group often take the slurs used against them and repurpose them as terms of pride and self-identification, to take back their personal identities and define themselves rather than let themselves be defined by others. Women can call themselves bitches, blacks use the n-word, homosexuals have taken the many terms against them and use them now with pride.

Here's the difference: *you're not in that group*. When someone in the group says it, everyone else knows they mean it ironically or as a way to self-identify as part of the group and further their bond in that society. When someone outside the group says it, it is impossible to tell without context if they are friendly or hostile to people in that group, and since the group is already accustomed to being marginalized they're probably going to assume the outsider is hostile.

To put it in a more immediate way, say you have a brother who was a little slow in school and heartless kids called him a moron. You cared for him, and protected him, and worked with him, and one day when he said he didn't understand something in his homework you said, joking,  "Well, of course not, you're a moron," and he cracked up because it was so unexpected but he knew you were saying it to make him laugh and shake him out of his mood because there was no question in his mind that you didn't really mean it. And then it became a thing where you called each other morons and laughed together and it was you two recapturing the word and making it yours. But if a stranger saw him in a store and called him a moron, that person would still be wrong and hateful.

Same word. But context always, *always* matters. </TEXT>

It's really not that difficult. If you own a company that makes boats, giving the owner tax cuts to reinvest in his company will give him  a prettier building and no more customers. Tax cuts that benefit the middle class means more people with money to spend on boats, and the owner benefits from the increased profit.

If you're going to reduce taxes, give the money to the people who will spend it.  </TEXT>
