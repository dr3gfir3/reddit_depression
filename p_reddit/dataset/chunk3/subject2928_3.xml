It's 32 tablet box for three day use and has addiction warning on the box. Legally shouldn't this be brought with prescription? Kinda shocked how easy he got it

	<TEXT> For me **Swiss Army Man** is the soundtrack I've listened to the most outside the film. **Hunt for the Wilder People** and **The Neon Demon** also had strong tracks in their films. Haven't seen it yet but I'm sure **Moana** is on the list for the musical end. Suicide Squad tried too hard though to make any kind of list.

	<TEXT> Thought it was quite bad and it's not like working on a bank holiday. 

Does anyone who work there know how they've got the staff to come in on a major family holiday? Is it just lot of short shifts. 

Still pretty depressing to think people are working on Christmas Day in non emergency work.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I booked foxtons cleaning service (since i didn't trust they'd approve of any i'd book even with landlord being happy)

The Landlord told me he asked them to return my deposit and he also signed paper saying he is happy with the professional clean and no further work is required. Which they have and I have a copy. 

I called up last week asking and they said they needed landlord confirmation. I told them about paperwork they have and landlords chat with them. Then it was 'oh we're waiting to hear back from head office. Call us back next week.' They also said they'd send an email to confirm but haven't.

It's now Monday and I'm planning on calling back for update. I'm worried this all just purposeful delays and I've just read online other tenants having similar issues with them withholding deposits for months. I have pictures of the flat and all inventory accounted for and Landlord is happy with me, so I should be okay. Any legal means to get round delay tactics? I've never known estate agents to be this slow  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Over the years being left wing and anti-fascists you get to see tactics they use often to spread all the hatred and fear, which tends to spill into violence. 

Far rights groups are very territorial. They like to 'claim' areas or target areas of left wing, immigration, jewish/muslim citizens places of prayer, LGBT areas. 

They do this with lone wolf attacks, group harassment, leafleting, rallies. 

With the alt-right and the far right members of the Donald sub they have used the same tactics online. 

- They are using all the dirty tricks and rule bending they can to claim Front end of reddit as their own. They are a sub obsessed with being on the front page. 

- Stromfront and far right always moan reddit was 'too leftie' and it meant the site has become a target for winning territory. I've seen subs with good balance of left and right get overwhelmed with far right. like world news and europe subs. 

- They are obsessed with being seen as superior. 'alpha', 'beta', 'cuck' nonsense is a form of this.  

- On and Off site they harass dissenters and opposition voices.  

- They feed on fear of the other and spread lies in news and statistics to prove their world view to convert others. Even if the news is not fake they will try to use it to recruit. Like taking advantage of tragedies. 

- They are now trying to spread further with same dirty tricks to elections in other country. This anti-globalist movement is looking to claim international territory and expand their businesses overseas. 

- You've got your thugs and you got those who hide behind political language. Political language lot like to claim left wing speech like 'equality' or 'racism' to dog whistle white supremacy language. 

There must always be a counter movement to the far right. You have a voice and rules to oppose any rise of hatred, and show that it is not acceptable in society. You can't stand back and let far right rally un-opposed in areas they want to harass people in.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-28 18:44:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Posted this elsewhere but you guys might like to know too. 

I've heard it can take to the second island for you to get Abra evolved to Kadabra but it's not till level 21 where you can learn your first attacking move. Otherwise you're stuck with teleport and kinesis.

I'm still early game myself but might have found a way to get at least one TM move into Abra before the second island. Though if you're further than me, let me know if it worked.


Spoilers...Mostly about first island challenges. 

In the WIki is says at Hau'oli City you can pick up TM48 Round which the wiki also says Abra can learn (hopefully true in this game). However, you need to be able to talk so someone in the mall which can only be reached after completing the island Grand Trial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> https://www.buzzfeed.com/lesterfeder/this-is-how-steve-bannon-sees-the-entire-world?bffbmain ref=bffbmain utm_term=.asPwOkXV5#.gyvR9NVJx

Buzzfeed article with a transcript of Bannons Vatican speech. 

Bannon praises the tea party and likes groups like UKIP and see's the establishment GOP as his enemies. So this is why it'll be interesting to see who purges who first out of the government. 

Bannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, were the third-largest conservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox. And thats why were expanding so much internationally.

Look, we believe  strongly  that there is a global tea party movement. Weve seen that. We were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front National and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring  and trust me, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially  but we think that will all be worked through with time.

[...]

One is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and thats the big thing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea partys biggest fight is not with the left, because were not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is just like UKIP. UKIPs biggest fight is with the Conservative Party.
The tea party in the United States biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment, which is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of rules of how theyre going to comport themselves and how theyre going to run things. And, quite frankly, its the reason that the United States financial situation is so dire, particularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded liabilities. That is all because youve had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC. The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And, quite frankly, were winning many, many victories. 

Some say this speech is intellectual, he sounds dumb or trying to pretend FN and UKIP can be mentioned in same grouping as the center-right or can be changed on their ethical/racial issues. They are the political arm of the far right. </TEXT>

Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States. How did we get to this point? And what do we do now?

If you can afford the time or money, here are some organizations that are worth supporting

To support womens health, donate to Planned Parenthood (plannedparenthood.org) or the Center for Reproductive Rights (reproductiverights.org).

If you dont believe manmade global warming is a silly issue, give to the Natural Resources Defense Council (nrdc.org).

If you dont think refugees are a terrorist army in disguise, donate to the International Refugee Assistance Project (refugeerights.org).

You may also want to donate to the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund (naacpldf.org), the Trevor Project for LGBT youth (thetrevorproject.org), or the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (maldef.org).

And to support journalism, subscribe to a newspaper and donate to ProPublica (propublica.org). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If anyone say they don't think white supremacist or even far right dont talk like that then this must be their first rodeo with these guys. 

Most of the political guys in far right don't dirty thier hands by walking around like thugs. Yet they do struggle to keep thier bigotry inside because they are aware of public image. This guy has some tell tell signs and even Trump fans if they truly believe in unifying all Americans no matter religion or race. This guy should at the very least raise an eyebrow over that red hat. If not for those comments then maybe for being former Walk Street guy (you know the people Trump is meant to be against to make America great again) 

If a guy who did hostile take overs in Wall Street and clearly judges entire group as a negative. I don't see how he can help strategies which will only target 'bad ones'.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> White supremacist is now in Trumps team. I've always had the view you know things are bad if anarchists are silenced first because when it comes to authoritarian states that's who they go for first. So I'm worrying for people in the US. 

So stay safe out there. Uncertainty but damn the scary stuff is already rumbling. I'd argue (for just in case) organise a safe house and back up plans to dodge and resist any authoritarian stuff about to hit. 

Lot of this is rising in Europe too so we got to help each other out  </TEXT>
