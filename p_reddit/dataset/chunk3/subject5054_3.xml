	<TEXT> In part, you're not incorrect. Much of climate science denial (example: [the Koch brothers](http://drexel.edu/now/archive/2013/December/Climate-Change/)) stems from an unhealthy fear of socialism (libertarianism and ultra conservatism), remnants of another era that often dismisses any hint of environmentalism as a socialist movement in disguise  hence the term "red greens" or "watermelons" (green on the outside but red on the inside). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for sharing. I was hoping they might discuss other interpretations of the data showing a decrease in CO2 uptake. For example, the Mauna Loa Observatory is, for all intents and purposes of this study, a single data point that is assumed to be representative of the entire northern hemisphere. Provided its location, could this be a result of seasonally varying atmospheric circulation between Eurasian and North American airmasses rather than a decline in CO2 uptake? If so, it seems that the underlying assumption that the Mauna Loa Observatory is representative of the northern hemisphere in relation to CO2 uptake by biomass cannot be reasonably justified. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In 1998 a digital acoustic model was generated from a nearly intact hadrosaur (P. tubicen) skull: [A digital acoustic model of the lambeosaurine hadrosaur Parasaurolophus tubicen](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/264554729_A_digital_acoustic_model_of_the_lambeosaurine_hadrosaur_Parasaurolophus_tubicen)

Computer modeling of a well-preserved specimen of P. tubicen, with more complex air passages than those of P. walkeri, has allowed the reconstruction of the possible sound its crest produced. The main path resonates at around 30 Hz, but the complicated sinus anatomy causes peaks and valleys in the sound.^[1](http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~rwest/link-suggestion/wpcd_2008-09_augmented/wp/p/Parasaurolophus.htm)

	<TEXT> Study: [Comparing tropospheric warming in climate models and satellite data](http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JCLI-D-16-0333.1)
___

**Abstract**:

We use updated and improved satellite retrievals of the temperature of the mid- to upper troposphere (TMT) to address key questions about the size and significance of TMT trends, agreement with model-derived TMT values, and whether models and satellite data show similar vertical profiles of warming. A recent study claimed that TMT trends over 1979 and 2015 are three times larger in climate models than in satellite data, but did not correct for the contribution TMT trends receive from stratospheric cooling. Here we show that the average ratio of modeled and observed TMT trends is sensitive to both satellite data uncertainties and to model-data differences in stratospheric cooling. When the impact of lower stratospheric cooling on TMT is accounted for, and when the most recent versions of satellite datasets are used, the previously claimed ratio of three between simulated and observed near-global TMT trends is reduced to  1.7. Next, we assess the validity of the statement that satellite data show no significant tropospheric warming over the last 18 years. This claim is not supported by our analysis: in five out of six corrected satellite TMT records, significant global-scale tropospheric warming has occurred within the last 18 years. Finally, we address long-standing concerns regarding discrepancies in modeled and observed vertical profiles of warming in the tropical atmosphere. We show that amplification of tropical warming between the lower and mid- to upper troposphere is now in close agreement in the average of 37 climate models and in one updated satellite record. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [An estimate of the climate change significance of the decline in the Northern Hemisphere's uptake of carbon dioxide in biomass](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wea.2762/full)
___

**Abstract**:

The declining ability of the Northern Hemisphere biosphere to sequester carbon from the atmosphere is shown to be having an impact on the current rate of increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations equivalent to adding the annual man-made emissions from China. If this trend continues, then global emissions will have to decline even faster than previously thought.

	<TEXT> Study: [Emissions of nitrogen-containing organic compounds from the burning of herbaceous and arboraceous biomass: Fuel composition dependence and the variability of commonly used nitrile tracers](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016GL070562/abstract)
___

**Abstract**:

Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emitted from residential wood and crop residue burning were measured in Colorado, U.S. When compared to the emissions from crop burning, residential wood burning exhibited markedly lower concentrations of acetonitrile, a commonly used biomass burning tracer. For both herbaceous and arboraceous fuels, the emissions of nitrogen-containing VOCs (NVOCs) strongly depend on the fuel nitrogen content; therefore, low NVOC emissions from residential wood burning result from the combustion of low-nitrogen fuel. Consequently, the emissions of compounds hazardous to human health, such as HNCO and HCN, and the formation of secondary pollutants, such as ozone generated by NOx, are likely to depend on fuel nitrogen. These results also demonstrate that acetonitrile may not be a suitable tracer for domestic burning in urban areas. Wood burning emissions may be best identified through analysis of the emissions profile rather than reliance on a single tracer species. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Simulating the Earth system response to negative emissions](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/11/9/095012)
___

**Abstract**:

Natural carbon sinks currently absorb approximately half of the anthropogenic CO2 emitted by fossil fuel burning, cement production and land-use change. However, this airborne fraction may change in the future depending on the emissions scenario. An important issue in developing carbon budgets to achieve climate stabilisation targets is the behaviour of natural carbon sinks, particularly under low emissions mitigation scenarios as required to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. A key requirement for low carbon pathways is to quantify the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies which will be strongly affected by carbon cycle feedbacks. Here we find that Earth system models suggest significant weakening, even potential reversal, of the ocean and land sinks under future low emission scenarios. For the RCP2.6 concentration pathway, models project land and ocean sinks to weaken to 0.8  0.9 and 1.1  0.3 GtC yr^1 respectively for the second half of the 21st century and to 0.4  0.4 and 0.1  0.2 GtC yr^1 respectively for the second half of the 23rd century. Weakening of natural carbon sinks will hinder the effectiveness of negative emissions technologies and therefore increase their required deployment to achieve a given climate stabilisation target. We introduce a new metric, the perturbation airborne fraction, to measure and assess the effectiveness of negative emissions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Palaeoclimate and palaeoceanographic conditions in the westernmost Mediterranean over the last millennium: an integrated organic and inorganic approach](http://jgs.geoscienceworld.org/content/172/2/264)
___

**Abstract**:

Previous studies have revealed the excellence of the westernmost Mediterranean records for reconstructing climate conditions over the last two millennia. In particular, inorganic and organic proxies have revealed a coherent signal of climate and oceanographic responses during this time. Here we compare and integrate both proxy records for reconstructing climate and oceanographic conditions with focus on the last millennium. The higher temperatures indicated by lipid-based proxies during the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) are coincident with drier conditions indicated by inorganic proxies. In contrast, lower temperatures and humid conditions are indicated during the Little Ice Age (LIA). The industrial period was characterized by increasing humidity in comparison with the previous LIA. However, a progressive aridification occurred since the second half of the twentieth century, coexisting with a warming trend and higher contribution of C3 grasses. Proxy records are also interpreted to show Atlantic water inflow at AD 1450 and 1950 and an intensification of the upwelling conditions coinciding with a prolonged positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase in the intervals AD 10001450 and 19601990. Large-scale oceanicatmospheric circulation patterns (the NAO and the Atlantic meridional circulation) and solar irradiance variations seem to have played the major key role during the last millennium, together with anthropogenic contributions in the more recent record. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> About a year go now the Zwally et al. (NASA) paper came out. Polar ice refers to ice within the polar regions, both in the northern hemisphere and the southern hemisphere. There is no question regarding the decline of the Greenland Ice Sheet, glaciers, or Arctic Sea Ice. When it comes to the southern hemisphere, glacial mass is in decline, as is the Antarctic Ice Sheet (land ice); however, Antarctic Sea Ice has shown limited growth.

The picture gets somewhat complicated because some regions of Antarctica are gaining mass while others are losing mass. In general, the ice shelves and outlet glaciers in western Antarctica are losing mass while those in eastern Antarctica have been gaining   losing mass (see [map](https://i.imgur.com/hQEU9kS.jpg))^[1](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/348/6232/327).

When it comes to the interior of Antarctica; however, the NASA study (Zwally et al.) argued for an increase in ice mass within the western interior of Antarctica which is at odds with a plethora of other studies that find the opposite trend (see [figure](http://www.realclimate.org/images//Antarctic_MassBalance_.png)).

While the data Zwally used only extended to 2008 he did have the following to say: 

Were essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica, said Jay Zwally... Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica  there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.

The Zwally et al. study is [heavily disputed](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/energy-environment/wp/2015/11/05/a-controversial-nasa-study-says-antarctica-is-gaining-ice-heres-why-you-should-stay-skeptical/?utm_term=.acf49c62d653) and one should always be skeptical of a single study that contradicts countless others. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

A rise in atmospheric CO2 is believed to be necessary for the termination of large-scale glaciations. Although the Antarctic Ice Sheet is estimated to have melted from 125% to 50% its modern size, there is thus far no evidence for an increase in atmospheric CO2 associated with the Mi-1 glacial termination in the earliest Miocene. Here, we present evidence from a high-resolution terrestrial record of leaf physiological change in southern New Zealand for an abrupt increase in atmospheric CO2 coincident with the termination of the Mi-1 glaciation and lasting approximately 20 kyr. Quantitative pCO2 estimates, made using a leaf gas exchange model, suggest that atmospheric CO2 levels may have doubled during this period, from 516111ppm to 1144410ppm, and subsequently returned back to 42553ppm. The 20-kyr interval with high pCO2 estimates is also associated with a period of increased moisture supply to southern New Zealand, inferred from carbon and hydrogen isotopes of terrestrial leaf waxes. The results provide the first high-resolution record of terrestrial environmental change at the Oligocene/Miocene boundary, document a 20 kyr interval of elevated pCO2 and increased local moisture availability, and provide insight into ecosystem response to a major orbitally driven climatic transition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Cosmic radiation exposure and persistent cognitive dysfunction](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep34774)
___

**Abstract**:

The Mars mission will result in an inevitable exposure to cosmic radiation that has been shown to cause cognitive impairments in rodent models, and possibly in astronauts engaged in deep space travel. Of particular concern is the potential for cosmic radiation exposure to compromise critical decision making during normal operations or under emergency conditions in deep space. Rodents exposed to cosmic radiation exhibit persistent hippocampal and cortical based performance decrements using six independent behavioral tasks administered between separate cohorts 12 and 24 weeks after irradiation. Radiation-induced impairments in spatial, episodic and recognition memory were temporally coincident with deficits in executive function and reduced rates of fear extinction and elevated anxiety. Irradiation caused significant reductions in dendritic complexity, spine density and altered spine morphology along medial prefrontal cortical neurons known to mediate neurotransmission interrogated by our behavioral tasks. Cosmic radiation also disrupted synaptic integrity and increased neuroinflammation that persisted more than 6 months after exposure. Behavioral deficits for individual animals correlated significantly with reduced spine density and increased synaptic puncta, providing quantitative measures of risk for developing cognitive impairment. Our data provide additional evidence that deep space travel poses a real and unique threat to the integrity of neural circuits in the brain. </TEXT>

___

**Significance**:

This study demonstrates quantitatively that the frequency of Hurricane Sandy-like extreme flood events has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century, due to the compound effects of sea level rise and storm climatology change.

**Abstract**:

Coastal flood hazard varies in response to changes in storm surge climatology and the sea level. Here we combine probabilistic projections of the sea level and storm surge climatology to estimate the temporal evolution of flood hazard. We find that New York Citys flood hazard has increased significantly over the past two centuries and is very likely to increase more sharply over the 21st century. Due to the effect of sea level rise, the return period of Hurricane Sandys flood height decreased by a factor of 3 from year 1800 to 2000 and is estimated to decrease by a further 4.4 from 2000 to 2100 under a moderate-emissions pathway. When potential storm climatology change over the 21st century is also accounted for, Sandys return period is estimated to decrease by 3 to 17 from 2000 to 2100. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Impact of anthropogenic climate change on wildfire across western US forests](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2016/10/05/1607171113.abstract)
___


**Significance**:

Increased forest fire activity across the western United States in recent decades has contributed to widespread forest mortality, carbon emissions, periods of degraded air quality, and substantial fire suppression expenditures. Although numerous factors aided the recent rise in fire activity, observed warming and drying have significantly increased fire-season fuel aridity, fostering a more favorable fire environment across forested systems. We demonstrate that human-caused climate change caused over half of the documented increases in fuel aridity since the 1970s and doubled the cumulative forest fire area since 1984. This analysis suggests that anthropogenic climate change will continue to chronically enhance the potential for western US forest fire activity while fuels are not limiting.

**Abstract**:

Increased forest fire activity across the western continental United States (US) in recent decades has likely been enabled by a number of factors, including the legacy of fire suppression and human settlement, natural climate variability, and human-caused climate change. We use modeled climate projections to estimate the contribution of anthropogenic climate change to observed increases in eight fuel aridity metrics and forest fire area across the western United States. Anthropogenic increases in temperature and vapor pressure deficit significantly enhanced fuel aridity across western US forests over the past several decades and, during 20002015, contributed to 75% more forested area experiencing high (1 ) fire-season fuel aridity and an average of nine additional days per year of high fire potential. Anthropogenic climate change accounted for 55% of observed increases in fuel aridity from 1979 to 2015 across western US forests, highlighting both anthropogenic climate change and natural climate variability as important contributors to increased wildfire potential in recent decades. We estimate that human-caused climate change contributed to an additional 4.2 million ha of forest fire area during 19842015, nearly doubling the forest fire area expected in its absence. Natural climate variability will continue to alternate between modulating and compounding anthropogenic increases in fuel aridity, but anthropogenic climate change has emerged as a driver of increased forest fire activity and should continue to do so while fuels are not limiting.

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Hadley circulation and precipitation changes controling black shale deposition in the Late Jurassic Boreal Seaway](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015PA002911/full)
___

**Abstract**

New climate simulations using the HadCM3L model with a paleogeography of the Late Jurassic (155.5Ma) and proxy-data corroborate that warm and wet tropical-like conditions reached as far north as the UK sector of the Jurassic Boreal Seaway (~35N). This is associated with a northern hemisphere Jurassic Hadley cell and an intensified subtropical jet which both extend significantly poleward than in the modern (JulySeptember). Deposition of the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF) occurred in the shallow, storm-dominated, epeiric Boreal Seaway. High-resolution paleo-environmental proxy data from the Kimmeridge Clay Formation (KCF; ~155150Ma), UK, are used to test for the role of tropical atmospheric circulation on meter-scale heterogeneities in black shale deposition. Proxy and model data show that the most organic-rich section (eudoxus to mid-hudlestoni zones) is characterized by a positive 13Corg excursion and up to 37wt % total organic carbon (%TOC). Orbital modulation of organic carbon burial primarily in the long eccentricity power band combined with a clear positive correlation between %TOC carbonate-free and the kaolinite/illite ratio supports peak organic carbon burial under the influence of very humid climate conditions, similar to the modern tropics. This reinterpretation of large-scale climate relationships, supported by independent modeling and geological data, has profound implications for atmospheric circulation patterns and processes affecting marine productivity and organic carbon burial further north along the Boreal Seaway, including the Arctic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Climate change is advancing spring onset across the U.S. 
national park system](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/ecs2.1465/full)
___

**Abstract**

Many U.S. national parks are already at the extreme warm end of their historical temperature distributions. With rapidly warming conditions, park resource management will be enhanced by information on seasonality of climate that supports adjustments in the timing of activities such as treating invasive species, operating visitor facilities, and scheduling climate-related events (e.g., flower festivals and fall leaf-viewing). Seasonal changes in vegetation, such as pollen, seed, and fruit production, are important drivers of ecological processes in parks, and phenology has thus been identified as a key indicator for park monitoring. Phenology is also one of the most proximate biological responses to climate change. Here, we use estimates of start of spring based on climatically modeled dates of first leaf and first bloom derived from indicator plant species to evaluate the recent timing of spring onset (past 1030 yr) in each U.S. natural resource park relative to its historical range of variability across the past 112 yr (19012012). Of the 276 high latitude to subtropical parks examined, spring is advancing in approximately three-quarters of parks (76%), and 53% of parks are experiencing extreme early springs that exceed 95% of historical conditions. Our results demonstrate how changes in climate seasonality are important for understanding ecological responses to climate change, and further how spatial variability in effects of climate change necessitates different approaches to management. We discuss how our results inform climate change adaptation challenges and opportunities facing parks, with implications for other protected areas, by exploring consequences for resource management and planning. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

We demonstrate the slow rise to fast acceleration of an arched plasma-filled magnetic flux rope. The flux rope expansion is inhibited by an externally applied customizable strapping field. When the strapping field is not too strong and not too weak, expansion forces build up while the flux rope is in the strapping field region. When the flux rope moves to a critical height beyond the peak strapping field region, the plasma accelerates quickly corresponding to the observed slow rise to fast acceleration of solar eruptions. This behavior is in agreement with the predictions of the torus instability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That article is crap, and is easily debunked on many fronts (far too many for me to invest in time wise). Essentially, however, it relates to [ECS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_sensitivity) values which are commonly reported to be likely from 1.5C to 4.5C for a doubling of CO2, with general agreement on the most likely value being 3C.

For starters, I would recommend the following by [Dr. Andrew Dessler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Dessler)

	<TEXT> Study: [Upward revision of global fossil fuel methane emissions based on isotope database](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7623/full/nature19797.html)
___

**Abstract**

Methane has the second-largest global radiative forcing impact of anthropogenic greenhouse gases after carbon dioxide, but our understanding of the global atmospheric methane budget is incomplete. The global fossil fuel industry (production and usage of natural gas, oil and coal) is thought to contribute 15 to 22 per cent of methane emissions to the total atmospheric methane budget. However, questions remain regarding methane emission trends as a result of fossil fuel industrial activity and the contribution to total methane emissions of sources from the fossil fuel industry and from natural geological seepage, which are often co-located. Here we re-evaluate the global methane budget and the contribution of the fossil fuel industry to methane emissions based on long-term global methane and methane carbon isotope records. We compile the largest isotopic methane source signature database so far, including fossil fuel, microbial and biomass-burning methane emission sources. We find that total fossil fuel methane emissions (fossil fuel industry plus natural geological seepage) are not increasing over time, but are 60 to 110 per cent greater than current estimates owing to large revisions in isotope source signatures. We show that this is consistent with the observed global latitudinal methane gradient. After accounting for natural geological methane seepage, we find that methane emissions from natural gas, oil and coal production and their usage are 20 to 60 per cent greater than inventories. Our findings imply a greater potential for the fossil fuel industry to mitigate anthropogenic climate forcing, but we also find that methane emissions from natural gas as a fraction of production have declined from approximately 8 per cent to approximately 2 per cent over the past three decades. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Driven by technological progress, human life expectancy has increased greatly since the nineteenth century. Demographic evidence has revealed an ongoing reduction in old-age mortality and a rise of the maximum age at death, which may gradually extend human longevity. Together with observations that lifespan in various animal species is flexible and can be increased by genetic or pharmaceutical intervention, these results have led to suggestions that longevity may not be subject to strict, species-specific genetic constraints. Here, by analysing global demographic data, we show that improvements in survival with age tend to decline after age 100, and that the age at death of the worlds oldest person has not increased since the 1990s. Our results strongly suggest that the maximum lifespan of humans is fixed and subject to natural constraints. </TEXT>

Combining satellite observations of active fire, burned area, and atmospheric concentrations of combustion tracers with a Bayesian inversion, we estimated the amount and variability of fire carbon emissions in Equatorial Asia over the period 1997-2015. Emissions in 2015 were of 0.51  0.17 Pg carbon  less than half of the emissions from the previous 1997 extreme El Nio, explained by a less acute water deficit. Fire severity could be empirically hindcasted from the cumulative water deficit with a lead time of 1 to 2 months. Based on future climate projections and an exponential empirical relationship found between fire carbon emissions and water deficit, we infer a total fire carbon loss ranging from 12 to 25 Pg by 2100 in the coming decades, a significant positive feedback to future climate warming. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Ocean dynamics, land motion, and changes in Earths gravitational and rotational fields cause local sea level change to deviate from the rate of global mean sea level rise. Here, we use observations and simulations of spatial structure in sea level change to estimate the likelihood that these processes cause sea level trends in the longest and highest-quality tide gauge records to be systematically biased relative to the true global mean rate. The analyzed records have an average 20th century rate of approximately 1.6 mm/yr, but based on the locations of these gauges, we show the simple average underestimates the 20th century global mean rate by 0.1     0.2 mm/yr. Given the distribution of potential sampling biases, we find   1% probability that observed trends from the longest and highest-quality TG records are consistent with global mean rates less than 1.4 mm/yr. </TEXT>

___


**Abstract**:

Enceladus' gravity and shape have been explained in terms of a thick isostatic ice shell floating on a global ocean, in contradiction of the thin shell implied by librations. Here we propose a new isostatic model minimizing crustal deviatoric stress, and demonstrate that gravity and shape data predict a 38  4km-thick ocean beneath a 23  4km-thick shell agreeing with  but independent from  libration data. Isostatic and tidal stresses are comparable in magnitude. South polar crust is only 7  4km thick, facilitating the opening of water conduits and enhancing tidal dissipation through stress concentration. Enceladus' resonant companion, Dione, is in a similar state of minimum stress isostasy. Its gravity and shape can be explained in terms of a 99  23km-thick isostatic shell overlying a 65  30km-thick global ocean, thus providing the first clear evidence for a present-day ocean within Dione. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

We find that summer methane (CH4) release from seabed sediments west of Svalbard substantially increases CH4 concentrations in the ocean but has limited influence on the atmospheric CH4 levels. Our conclusion stems from complementary measurements at the seafloor, in the ocean, and in the atmosphere from land-based, ship and aircraft platforms during a summer campaign in 2014. We detected high concentrations of dissolved CH4 in the ocean above the seafloor with a sharp decrease above the pycnocline. Model approaches taking potential CH4 emissions from both dissolved and bubble-released CH4 from a larger region into account reveal a maximum flux compatible with the observed atmospheric CH4 mixing ratios of 2.43.8nmolm^2 s^1. This is too low to have an impact on the atmospheric summer CH4 budget in the year 2014. Long-term ocean observatories may shed light on the complex variations of Arctic CH4 cycles throughout the year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This particular study (feel free to read it at length, it's open access) states:

The range of plastic microfibres found ingested/internalised by organisms studied here included modified acrylic, polypropylene, viscose, polyester, and acrylic. Polypropylene has been found to adsorb PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls), nonylphenol and DDE, an organochlorine pesticide. Polyethylene, a type of polyolefin fibre whose chemical composition in part is the basis of some polyester fibres (e.g. polyethylene terephthalate), has been found to adsorb four times more PCBs than polypropylene. Polypropylene has also been found to adsorb a range of metals in a marine environment; the concentrations of most of these metals did not saturate over a year period suggesting plastics in the oceans for long time periods accumulate greater concentrations of metals.

Chemical contamination experiments are rare in the marine environment, and often present unrealistic experimental scenarios. Yet with the chemical ingredients in 50% of plastics listed as hazardous (United Nations Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals) such issues maybe just the start of long-term ecological and health problems associated with waste plastics in the environment; impacts that have not been looked at in many marine animals and no deep-sea animals as yet.

Other studies, looking at zooplankton and microplastics^[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00244-015-0172-5), ^[2](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es400663f) have shown a number of similar concerns speculating that they could block the guts or marine organisms, leach into their bodies, deteriorate the overall health of the marine organism, effects on reproduction, and accumulate as they are transferred to higher trophic levels (salmon, whales, etc).

Which reminds me of an older Bill Burr joke:

All the fads, you remember rollerblading? Remember that? Everybody had them. We set up cones; we did little tricks, right? One little homophobic joke killed that entire fad. Whats the hardest part about rollerblading? Telling your parents youre gay. Full grown adults, dude, Im not gay. I dont have the cooties. These things mean I suck dick. And they just threw them out. They end up in the ocean. Theyre made of plastic, they dont biodegrade. They just break down into little cubes. Fish will breath them in. Six months later, youre going out, youre getting sushi. You think youre being healthy. Youre eating your old roller-blades. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

All of the cations currently used in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) abide by the tolerance factor for incorporation into the lattice. We show that the small and oxidation-stable Rb+ can be embedded into a cation cascade to create perovskite materials with excellent material properties. We achieved stabilized efficiencies of up to 21.6% (average value: 20.2%) on small areas (and a stabilized 19.0% on a 0.5 cm^2 cell) as well as an electroluminescence of 3.8%. The open-circuit voltage of 1.24 volts at a band gap of 1.63 electron volts leads to loss-in-potential of 0.39 V, versus 0.4 V for commercial silicon cells. Polymer-coated cells maintained 95% of their initial performance at 85C for 500 hours under full solar illumination and maximum power point tracking. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Theory and climate modelling suggest that the sensitivity of Earths climate to changes in radiative forcing could depend on the background climate. However, palaeoclimate data have thus far been insufficient to provide a conclusive test of this prediction. Here we present atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) reconstructions based on multi-site boron-isotope records from the late Pliocene epoch (3.3 to 2.3 million years ago). We find that Earths climate sensitivity to CO2-based radiative forcing (Earth system sensitivity) was half as strong during the warm Pliocene as during the cold late Pleistocene epoch (0.8 to 0.01 million years ago). We attribute this difference to the radiative impacts of continental ice-volume changes (the icealbedo feedback) during the late Pleistocene, because equilibrium climate sensitivity is identical for the two intervals when we account for such impacts using sea-level reconstructions. We conclude that, on a global scale, no unexpected climate feedbacks operated during the warm Pliocene, and that predictions of equilibrium climate sensitivity (excluding long-term ice-albedo feedbacks) for our Pliocene-like future (with CO2 levels up to maximum Pliocene levels of 450 parts per million) are well described by the currently accepted range of an increase of 1.5 K to 4.5 K per doubling of CO2.

___

**Abstract**:

Whether invertebrates exhibit positive emotionlike states and what mechanisms underlie such states remain poorly understood. We demonstrate that bumblebees exhibit dopamine-dependent positive emotionlike states across behavioral contexts. After training with one rewarding and one unrewarding cue, bees that received pretest sucrose responded in a positive manner toward ambiguous cues. In a second experiment, pretest consumption of sucrose solution resulted in a shorter time to reinitiate foraging after a simulated predator attack. These behavioral changes were abolished with topical application of the dopamine antagonist fluphenazine. Further experiments established that pretest sucrose does not simply cause bees to become more exploratory. Our findings present a new opportunity for understanding the fundamental neural elements of emotions and may alter the view of how emotion states affect decision-making in animals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's definitely an interesting question, with plenty of factors to consider (what is the source of energy production, improved efficiency in electronics, etc.), however, it could rightly be considered a single component of what has been studied under the umbrella term, the '[urban heat island effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pidRKmq2iGI).' The IPCC has the following to say: 

Clearly, the urban heat island effect is a real climate change in urban areas, but is not representative of larger areas. Extensive tests have shown that the urban heat island effects are no more than about 0.05C up to 1990 in the global temperature records used in this chapter to depict climate change. Thus we have assumed an uncertainty of zero in global land-surface air temperature in 1900 due to urbanisation, linearly increasing to 0.06C (two standard deviations 0.12C) in 2000.^[1](https://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/tar/wg1/052.htm)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Projected land photosynthesis constrained by changes in the seasonal cycle of atmospheric CO2](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19772.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Uncertainties in the response of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations contribute to the large spread in projections of future climate change. Climatecarbon cycle models generally agree that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will enhance terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the magnitude of this CO2 fertilization effect varies from a 20 per cent to a 60 per cent increase in GPP for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in model studies. Here we demonstrate emergent constraints on large-scale CO2 fertilization using observed changes in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle that are thought to be the result of increasing terrestrial GPP. Our comparison of atmospheric CO2 measurements from Point Barrow in Alaska and Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii with historical simulations of the latest climatecarbon cycle models demonstrates that the increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle at both measurement sites is consistent with increasing annual mean GPP, driven in part by climate warming, but with differences in CO2 fertilization controlling the spread among the model trends. As a result, the relationship between the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle and the magnitude of CO2 fertilization of GPP is almost linear across the entire ensemble of models. When combined with the observed trends in the seasonal CO2 amplitude, these relationships lead to consistent emergent constraints on the CO2 fertilization of GPP. Overall, we estimate a GPP increase of 37  9 per cent for high-latitude ecosystems and 32  9 per cent for extratropical ecosystems under a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the basis of the Point Barrow and Cape Kumukahi records, respectively. </TEXT>

**Abstract**:

Uncertainties in the response of vegetation to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations contribute to the large spread in projections of future climate change. Climatecarbon cycle models generally agree that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations will enhance terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, the magnitude of this CO2 fertilization effect varies from a 20 per cent to a 60 per cent increase in GPP for a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations in model studies. Here we demonstrate emergent constraints on large-scale CO2 fertilization using observed changes in the amplitude of the atmospheric CO2 seasonal cycle that are thought to be the result of increasing terrestrial GPP. Our comparison of atmospheric CO2 measurements from Point Barrow in Alaska and Cape Kumukahi in Hawaii with historical simulations of the latest climatecarbon cycle models demonstrates that the increase in the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle at both measurement sites is consistent with increasing annual mean GPP, driven in part by climate warming, but with differences in CO2 fertilization controlling the spread among the model trends. As a result, the relationship between the amplitude of the CO2 seasonal cycle and the magnitude of CO2 fertilization of GPP is almost linear across the entire ensemble of models. When combined with the observed trends in the seasonal CO2 amplitude, these relationships lead to consistent emergent constraints on the CO2 fertilization of GPP. Overall, we estimate a GPP increase of 379 per cent for high-latitude ecosystems and 329 per cent for extratropical ecosystems under a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations on the basis of the Point Barrow and Cape Kumukahi records, respectively. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Personal Vehicles Evaluated against Climate Change Mitigation Targets](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.est.6b00177)
___

**Abstract**:

Meeting global climate change mitigation goals will likely require that transportation-related greenhouse gas emissions begin to decline within the next two decades and then continue to fall. A variety of vehicle technologies and fuels are commercially available to consumers today that can reduce the emissions of the transportation sector. Yet what are the best options, and do any suffice to meet climate policy targets? Here, we examine the costs and carbon intensities of 125 light-duty vehicle models on the U.S. market today and evaluate these models against U.S. emission-reduction targets for 2030, 2040, and 2050 that are compatible with the goal of limiting mean global temperature rise to 2 C above preindustrial levels. Our results show that consumers are not required to pay more for a low-carbon-emitting vehicle. Across the diverse set of vehicle models and powertrain technologies examined, a clean vehicle is usually a low-cost vehicle. Although the average carbon intensity of vehicles sold in 2014 exceeds the climate target for 2030 by more than 50%, we find that most hybrid and battery electric vehicles available today meet this target. By 2050, only electric vehicles supplied with almost completely carbon-free electric power are expected to meet climate-policy targets. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Current intended nationally determined contributions (INDCs) are insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement goal of limiting temperature change to between 1.5 and 2.0C above pre-industrial levels, so the effectiveness of existing INDCs will be crucial to further progress. Here we assess the likely range of US greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in 2025 and whether the USs INDC can be met, on the basis of updated historical and projected estimates. We group US INDC policies into three categories reflecting potential future policies, and model 17 policies across these categories. With all modelled policies included, the upper end of the uncertainty range overlaps with the 2025 INDC target, but the required reductions are not achieved using reference values. Even if all modelled policies are implemented, additional GHG reduction is probably required; we discuss several potential policies. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Reconstructions of Earths past climate strongly influence our understanding of the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet global temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of time, and continuous reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially weighted proxy reconstruction of global temperature over the past 2 million years estimated from a multi-proxy database of over 20,000 sea surface temperature point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled until roughly 1.2 million years ago and cooling then stalled until the present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the beginning of the mid-Pleistocene transition, and pre-dated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around 0.9 million years ago. Thus, global cooling may have been a pre-condition for, but probably is not the sole causal mechanism of, the shift to quasi-100,000-year glacial cycles at the mid-Pleistocene transition. Over the past 800,000 years, polar amplification (the amplification of temperature change at the poles relative to global temperature change) has been stable over time, and global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been closely coupled across glacial cycles. A comparison of the new temperature reconstruction with radiative forcing from greenhouse gases estimates an Earth system sensitivity of 9 degrees Celsius (range 7 to 13 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) change in global average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at todays greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of 5 degrees Celsius (range 3 to 7 degrees Celsius, 95 per cent credible interval) over the next few millennia as ice sheets, vegetation and atmospheric dust continue to respond to global warming.

	<TEXT> I'll take a stab at it (anyone who knows, please feel free to correct me if I'm wrong).

Ignoring a number of major specific details (such as Earth's secondary atmosphere, carbon cycle, etc.) let's look at only two. 

1) Venus has less gravity than Earth, 8.87ms^-2 and 9.81ms^-2 respectively (90.4% of Earth's gravity). This is important because this means that lighter gasses can escape more easily (due to a lower escape velocity - 10.36 kms^-1 compared to Earth's 11.186 kms^-1 ). 

2) Venus is located closer to the Sun, on average 108 million km away (.722 AU), with the Earth on average 152 million km away from the Sun (1.01 AU); a difference of 44 million km. This means the amount of energy reaching Venus from the Sun is greater (due to the inverse square law) than the amount of energy reaching Earth. 

Combing (1) and (2) we can see that any lighter elements would escape from Venus that may not escape from the Earth quite so easily. Any water vapor in its atmosphere would split apart into hydrogen, and oxygen. While the hydrogen could escape into space, the oxygen would recombine with carbon to form a thick atmosphere of carbon dioxide. If you were to move Earth in the orbit of Venus today you could achieve a run away greenhouse effect. Interestingly this also presents us with one of the unsolved mysteries in Earth's geological past... 
The Sun wasn't always so luminous - so while Venus may have been habitable early on the Earth would have been too cold. This paradox is known as the 'faint young sun' paradox. 

Because the Earth is much, much cooler it can retain a number of molecules in liquid and solid form rather than gaseous. Should you increase the temperature and turn much of Earth's liquids and solids (water ice, clathrates, carbon in soils, etc.) to gaseous phases you could increase Earth's atmospheric pressure (ie. run away greenhouse effect).

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Geodetic measurements reveal similarities between postLast Glacial Maximum and present-day mass loss from the Greenland ice sheet](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/9/e1600931.full)
___

**Abstract**:

Accurate quantification of the millennial-scale mass balance of the Greenland ice sheet (GrIS) and its contribution to global sea-level rise remain challenging because of sparse in situ observations in key regions. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) is the ongoing response of the solid Earth to ice and ocean load changes occurring since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~21 thousand years ago) and may be used to constrain the GrIS deglaciation history. We use data from the Greenland Global Positioning System network to directly measure GIA and estimate basin-wide mass changes since the LGM. Unpredicted, large GIA uplift rates of +12 mm/year are found in southeast Greenland. These rates are due to low upper mantle viscosity in the region, from when Greenland passed over the Iceland hot spot about 40 million years ago. This region of concentrated soft rheology has a profound influence on reconstructing the deglaciation history of Greenland. We reevaluate the evolution of the GrIS since LGM and obtain a loss of 1.5-m sea-level equivalent from the northwest and southeast. These same sectors are dominating modern mass loss. We suggest that the present destabilization of these marine-based sectors may increase sea level for centuries to come. Our new deglaciation history and GIA uplift estimates suggest that studies that use the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellite mission to infer present-day changes in the GrIS may have erroneously corrected for GIA and underestimated the mass loss by about 20 gigatons/year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Report: [The Skys Limit: Why the Paris Climate Goals Require a Managed Decline of Fossil Fuel Production](http://priceofoil.org/2016/09/22/the-skys-limit-report/)
___

A new study released by Oil Change International, in partnership with 14 organizations from around the world, scientifically grounds the growing movement to keep carbon in the ground by revealing the need to stop all new fossil fuel infrastructure and industry expansion. It focuses on the potential carbon emissions from developed reserves  where the wells are already drilled, the pits dug, and the pipelines, processing facilities, railways, and export terminals constructed.

**Key Findings**:

- The potential carbon emissions from the oil, gas, and coal in the worlds currently operating fields and mines would take us beyond 2C of warming.

- The reserves in currently operating oil and gas fields alone, even with no coal, would take the world beyond 1.5C.

- With the necessary decline in production over the coming decades to meet climate goals, clean energy can be scaled up at a corresponding pace, expanding the total number of energy jobs.

**Key Recommendations**:

- No new fossil fuel extraction or transportation infrastructure should be built, and governments should grant no new permits for them.

- Some fields and mines  primarily in rich countries  should be closed before fully exploiting their resources, and financial support should be provided for non-carbon development in poorer countries.

- This does not mean stopping using all fossil fuels overnight. Governments and companies should conduct a managed decline of the fossil fuel industry and ensure a just transition for the workers and communities that depend on it.

	<TEXT> Study: [Radiocarbon constraints imply reduced carbon uptake by soils during the 21st century](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/353/6306/1419)
___


**Abstract**:

Soil is the largest terrestrial carbon reservoir and may influence the sign and magnitude of carbon cycleclimate feedbacks. Many Earth system models (ESMs) estimate a significant soil carbon sink by 2100, yet the underlying carbon dynamics determining this response have not been systematically tested against observations. We used 14C data from 157 globally distributed soil profiles sampled to 1-meter depth to show that ESMs underestimated the mean age of soil carbon by a factor of more than six (430  50 years versus 3100  1800 years). Consequently, ESMs overestimated the carbon sequestration potential of soils by a factor of nearly two (40  27%). These inconsistencies suggest that ESMs must better represent carbon stabilization processes and the turnover time of slow and passive reservoirs when simulating future atmospheric carbon dioxide dynamics. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study: [Rising plant-mediated methane emissions from arctic wetlands](https://eos.org/articles/aquatic-plants-may-accelerate-arctic-methane-emissions)
___

**Abstract**:

Plant-mediated CH4 flux is an important pathway for landatmosphere CH4 emissions, but the magnitude, timing, and environmental controls, spanning scales of space and time, remain poorly understood in arctic tundra wetlands, particularly under the long-term effects of climate change. CH4 fluxes were measured in situ during peak growing season for the dominant aquatic emergent plants in the Alaskan arctic coastal plain, Carex aquatilis and Arctophila fulva, to assess the magnitude and species-specific controls on CH4 flux. Plant biomass was a strong predictor of A. fulva CH4 flux while water depth and thaw depth were copredictors for C. aquatilis CH4 flux. We used plant and environmental data from 1971 to 1972 from the historic International Biological Program (IBP) research site near Barrow, Alaska, which we resampled in 20102013, to quantify changes in plant biomass and thaw depth, and used these to estimate species-specific decadal-scale changes in CH4 fluxes. A ~60% increase in CH4 flux was estimated from the observed plant biomass and thaw depth increases in tundra ponds over the past 40 years. Despite covering only ~5% of the landscape, we estimate that aquatic C. aquatilis and A. fulva account for two-thirds of the total regional CH4 flux of the Barrow Peninsula. The regionally observed increases in plant biomass and active layer thickening over the past 40 years not only have major implications for energy and water balance, but also have significantly altered landatmosphere CH4 emissions for this region, potentially acting as a positive feedback to climate warming. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [The role of sea ice for vascular plant dispersal in the Arctic](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160264)

**Abstract**:

Sea ice has been suggested to be an important factor for dispersal of vascular plants in the Arctic. To assess its role for postglacial colonization in the North Atlantic region, we compiled data on the first Late Glacial to Holocene occurrence of vascular plant species in East Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands and Svalbard. For each record, we reconstructed likely past dispersal events using data on species distributions and genetics. We compared these data to sea-ice reconstructions to evaluate the potential role of sea ice in these past colonization events and finally evaluated these results using a compilation of driftwood records as an independent source of evidence that sea ice can disperse biological material. Our results show that sea ice was, in general, more prevalent along the most likely dispersal routes at times of assumed first colonization than along other possible routes. Also, driftwood is frequently dispersed in regions that have sea ice today. Thus, sea ice may act as an important dispersal agent. Melting sea ice may hamper future dispersal of Arctic plants and thereby cause more genetic differentiation. It may also limit the northwards expansion of competing boreal species, and hence favour the persistence of Arctic species.

Study: [Timing of ice retreat alters seabird abundances and distributions in the southeast Bering Sea](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160276)

**Abstract**:

Timing of spring sea-ice retreat shapes the southeast Bering Sea food web. We compared summer seabird densities and average bathymetry depth distributions between years with early (typically warm) and late (typically cold) ice retreat. Averaged over all seabird species, densities in early-ice-retreat-years were 10.1% (95% CI: 1.147.9%) of that in late-ice-retreat-years. In early-ice-retreat-years, surface-foraging species had increased numbers over the middle shelf (50150 m) and reduced numbers over the shelf slope (200500 m). Pursuit-diving seabirds showed a less clear trend. Euphausiids and the copepod Calanus marshallae/glacialis were 2.4 and 18.1 times less abundant in early-ice-retreat-years, respectively, whereas age-0 walleye pollock Gadus chalcogrammus near-surface densities were 51 higher in early-ice-retreat-years. Our results suggest a mechanistic understanding of how present and future changes in sea-ice-retreat timing may affect top predators like seabirds in the southeastern Bering Sea.

Study: [Loss of connectivity among island-dwelling Peary caribou following sea ice decline](http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/12/9/20160235)

**Abstract**:

Global warming threatens to reduce population connectivity for terrestrial wildlife through significant and rapid changes to sea ice. Using genetic fingerprinting, we contrasted extant connectivity in island-dwelling Peary caribou in northern Canada with continental-migratory caribou. We next examined if sea-ice contractions in the last decades modulated population connectivity and explored the possible impact of future climate change on long-term connectivity among island caribou. We found a strong correlation between genetic and geodesic distances for both continental and Peary caribou, even after accounting for the possible effect of sea surface. Sea ice has thus been an effective corridor for Peary caribou, promoting inter-island connectivity and population mixing. Using a time series of remote sensing sea-ice data, we show that landscape resistance in the Canadian Arctic Archipelago has increased by approximately 15% since 1979 and may further increase by 2077% by 2086 under a high-emission scenario (RCP8.5). Under the persistent increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, reduced connectivity may isolate island-dwelling caribou with potentially significant consequences for population viability. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**:

Marine diatoms in tillites along the Transantarctic Mountains (TAMs) have been used to suggest a diminished East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) during Pliocene warm periods. Updated ice-sheet modelling shows significant Pliocene EAIS retreat, creating marine embayments into the Wilkes and Aurora basins that were conducive to high diatom productivity and rapid accumulation of diatomaceous sediments. Here we show that subsequent isostatic uplift exposed accumulated unconsolidated marine deposits to wind erosion. We report new atmospheric modelling utilizing Pliocene climate and derived Antarctic landscapes indicating that prevailing mid-altitude winds transported diatoms towards the TAMs, dominantly from extensive emerged coastal deposits of the Aurora Basin. This result unifies leading ideas from competing sides of a contentious debate about the origin of the diatoms in the TAMs and their link to EAIS history, supporting the view that parts of the EAIS are vulnerable to relatively modest warming, with possible implications for future sea-level rise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Study (open access): [Recent amplification of the North American winter temperature dipole](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016JD025116/full)
___

**Abstract**:

During the winters of 20132014 and 20142015, anomalously warm temperatures in western North America and anomalously cool temperatures in eastern North America resulted in substantial human and environmental impacts. Motivated by the impacts of these concurrent temperature extremes and the intrinsic atmospheric linkage between weather conditions in the western and eastern United States, we investigate the occurrence of concurrent warm-West/cool-East surface temperature anomalies, which we call the North American winter temperature dipole. We find that, historically, warm-West/cool-East dipole conditions have been associated with anomalous mid-tropospheric ridging over western North America and downstream troughing over eastern North America. We also find that the occurrence and severity of warm-West/cool-East events have increased significantly between 1980 and 2015, driven largely by an increase in the frequency with which high-amplitude ridge-trough wave patterns result in simultaneous severe temperature conditions in both the West and East. Using a large single-model ensemble of climate simulations, we show that the observed positive trend in the warm-West/cool-East events is attributable to historical anthropogenic emissions including greenhouse gases, but that the co-occurrence of extreme western warmth and eastern cold will likely decrease in the future as winter temperatures warm dramatically across the continent, thereby reducing the occurrence of severely cold conditions in the East. Although our analysis is focused on one particular region, our analysis framework is generally transferable to the physical conditions shaping different types of extreme events around the globe. </TEXT>

___

**Abstract**: 

In SeptemberOctober 2015, El Nio and positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions set the stage for massive fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), leading to persistently hazardous levels of smoke pollution across much of Equatorial Asia. Here we quantify the emission sources and health impacts of this haze episode and compare the sources and impacts to an event of similar magnitude occurring under similar meteorological conditions in SeptemberOctober 2006. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we first calculate the influence of potential fire emissions across the domain on smoke concentrations in three receptor areas downwindIndonesia, Malaysia, and Singaporeduring the 2006 event. This step maps the sensitivity of each receptor to fire emissions in each grid cell upwind. We then combine these sensitivities with 2006 and 2015 fire emission inventories from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) to estimate the resulting population-weighted smoke exposure. This method, which assumes similar smoke transport pathways in 2006 and 2015, allows near real-time assessment of smoke pollution exposure, and therefore the consequent morbidity and premature mortality, due to severe haze. Our approach also provides rapid assessment of the relative contribution of fire emissions generated in a specific province to smoke-related health impacts in the receptor areas. We estimate that haze in 2015 resulted in 100 300 excess deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, more than double those of the 2006 event, with much of the increase due to fires in Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. The model framework we introduce in this study can rapidly identify those areas where land use management to reduce and/or avoid fires would yield the greatest benefit to human health, both nationally and regionally. </TEXT>

Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we first calculate the influence of potential fire emissions across the domain on smoke concentrations in three receptor areas downwindIndonesia, Malaysia, and Singaporeduring the 2006 event. This step maps the sensitivity of each receptor to fire emissions in each grid cell upwind. We then combine these sensitivities with 2006 and 2015 fire emission inventories from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) to estimate the resulting population-weighted smoke exposure. This method, which assumes similar smoke transport pathways in 2006 and 2015, allows near real-time assessment of smoke pollution exposure, and therefore the consequent morbidity and premature mortality, due to severe haze. Our approach also provides rapid assessment of the relative contribution of fire emissions generated in a specific province to smoke-related health impacts in the receptor areas. We estimate that haze in 2015 resulted in 100 300 excess deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, more than double those of the 2006 event, with much of the increase due to fires in Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. The model framework we introduce in this study can rapidly identify those areas where land use management to reduce and/or avoid fires would yield the greatest benefit to human health, both nationally and regionally. </TEXT>

**Abstract**: 

In SeptemberOctober 2015, El Nio and positive Indian Ocean Dipole conditions set the stage for massive fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesian Borneo), leading to persistently hazardous levels of smoke pollution across much of Equatorial Asia. Here we quantify the emission sources and health impacts of this haze episode and compare the sources and impacts to an event of similar magnitude occurring under similar meteorological conditions in SeptemberOctober 2006. Using the adjoint of the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we first calculate the influence of potential fire emissions across the domain on smoke concentrations in three receptor areas downwindIndonesia, Malaysia, and Singaporeduring the 2006 event. This step maps the sensitivity of each receptor to fire emissions in each grid cell upwind. We then combine these sensitivities with 2006 and 2015 fire emission inventories from the Global Fire Assimilation System (GFAS) to estimate the resulting population-weighted smoke exposure. This method, which assumes similar smoke transport pathways in 2006 and 2015, allows near real-time assessment of smoke pollution exposure, and therefore the consequent morbidity and premature mortality, due to severe haze. Our approach also provides rapid assessment of the relative contribution of fire emissions generated in a specific province to smoke-related health impacts in the receptor areas. We estimate that haze in 2015 resulted in 100 300 excess deaths across Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore, more than double those of the 2006 event, with much of the increase due to fires in Indonesia's South Sumatra Province. The model framework we introduce in this study can rapidly identify those areas where land use management to reduce and/or avoid fires would yield the greatest benefit to human health, both nationally and regionally. </TEXT>
