	<TEXT> It's not a question of "deserving" it more, it's a question of socializing losses for those who can least afford them...vendors are making absurd profit margins unless they're doing something majorly wrong, so they CAN afford to absorb some additional losses given the inherent need for trust between two parties implied by the DNM escrow system, more than the average user can afford to make an additional buy ... I get that people on both sides are getting fucked by others (LE, exit-scammers, etc.) but there is a departure from what you're calling baseline ethical behavior when a vendor cancels orders knowing that those who placed their faith in him to deliver a product for the money they put up will now possibly get neither. 

It's sort of like the argument that rich people should pay more in taxes because, well, they should because they have more of it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel for you but there has to be some level of trust implicit in the "deal", no? What you're doing is just dumping users who actually did put their hard earned money into coins  (which they can't access either despite the cancelation) into the same boat that you're in -- being unable to do anything until AG sorts itself out. Is it fair for you to lose more by sending out product that you might not get paid for... I'm not sure. The ethics of it all break down at a certain point but when looking at the profit margins, I have to say that there are, or at least should be, a level of acceptable losses inherent to the game for those of you vending. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading comprehension fail. Meth, cocaine, amphetamines, heroin, etc. are all drugs, which if the US had any sensible policy, would be available for purchase by consenting adults, leaving cartels with violent/dangerous things to pursue, like weapons, humans, etc. Of course, without a BS drug policy initiative to prosecute, a lot more law enforcement and military resources could be brought to bear on the surviving business of the cartels, but that would be too simple and make too much sense. So let's just continue trying Prohibition 2.0 because it's been working so well.  </TEXT>
