	<TEXT> 7575. Thanks op! My favorite game of all time would probably have to be saints row 3. I found it at a time in my life when I really needed something to keep my mind of my troubles. It was hilarious and dramatically engaging and re kindled my love for gaming.

If I happen to be chosen I would love a Sades headset. I don't have a gaming headset so, well, yea. Or if a saints row 3 key is less trouble that would be really nice. I dont own it on PC. Stay cool OP! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello there. So long story short, gaming is a huge part of my life and I love it. I recently (Early this business year) bought a gaming PC. However, though I have been gaming since I was very young, I have found my love for gaming is dying. I need to buy a new videogame, but I dont know what to get! Thats where you come in. I know what I want but I dont know where to find it. I used to play a lot of COD and such but I need something a bit different, as I got bored of COD a few months ago. I need something epic and fun. A bit more RPG. Grand Scale.

I tried BF4 and found that it was close to what I need but to big of a map for the amount of people. I tried CS:GO but simply didnt like it. I need more fast pace. I also was really into Titanfall for a bit, that fit my fancy. Maybe Star Wars Battlefront is good for me?

Also maybe something like Saints Row. Used to love that. Or something like AC Black-flag with more pirate stuff and less AC stuff. I dont know. Im lost! Please help. Any suggestion is a good suggestion, unless its a bad suggestion.

Thanks yall! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there fellow android lovers. So I have what I believe to be a great idea for an app but I do not have the knowledge or skills to make it, so I present to you my idea. I use Google play a ton. Music movies apps books and news. I also like productivity and sexy looking apps. So I think it would be cool if someone managed to make a app that compiled your Google library (music and movies and such) into one app in the style of the play store. Hope yall don't think this is a waste of time, thankses! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there! My name is fox, in highschool right now, in the u.s. Spend a good fraction of my time on my alienware alpha, that I got a ripped apart. Put some new parts in it. My rig is all about saving money because I have none xD. Currently don't own any sort of good headset, would love one though. Don't have any means of listening to game sound and I loveee music. Regardless of whether or not you decide to send it to me I genuinely think giveaways like this are awesome and slowly are restoring my faith in humanity. Viva la masterrace. </TEXT>
