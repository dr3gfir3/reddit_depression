	<TEXT> I think you see McDavid as #1 because of him playing in the OHL. He gets so much more coverage than Eichel. Plus every since like 13 he has been hyped up as the next generational player, while Eichel has really only hit the main stream in the last couple years.

Both will be elite, impact players though if all goes according to plan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Redshirting means that you sit out a year of playing. But it does not take off a year of eligibility.

You can still fully practice but cannot play in games. If you truly believe that you won't get much PT talk to your coach.

Just cause you redshirt doesn't mean you can skip practice. Tell your coach about school and everything and he may let you skip a day of practice here and there to help with your schoolwork </TEXT>
