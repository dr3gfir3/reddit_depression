	<TEXT> The story has updated a few times, and I feel like the "in the back" line was more directly referenced in initial versions of the text, though my bad if it wasn't. I may have translated the passage about officers "trying to put his hands or arms behind his back" as meaning they were behind the individual when he was shot. Cops don't put people's hands behind their back while face-to-face with a suspect.

Lots of moving parts here, hed now read "Events leading up to LAPD shooting of man with skateboard remain unclear," which is not very helpful.

A reminder that a witness' recounting shouldn't be accepted as fact, no matter what he said. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Convenient and fucked-up paradox:

1.) Police refuse reforms for the sort of transparency that might be able prevent these so-called "bogus charges." (body cameras, etc.)

2.) Adjudicators opt for settlements to avoid jury trials. While perhaps more costly, trials would also allow the public to see any evidence that said charges were not, in fact, bogus.

3.) Taxpayers gets saddled with the financial burden of settlements, while cops walk away with administrative presumption of innocence (nothing was proven!).

4.) Cops are sent the message that they're free to continue acting in a way that repeats the cycle, knowing that nothing will change. </TEXT>

Either way, for the family to note such abnormal behavior and to decide to leave him unaccompanied knowing there was a firearm in the house seems irresponsible. As I've said before, would they have done the same for a blackout drunk person who seemed like a hazard to himself? </TEXT>
