	<TEXT> I'm good at things in the realm of visual arts (drawing, photography, illustration, glassblowing, graphic design) and in the realm of music (singing, trumpet, piano). I also would like to think that I'm a great mediator. I've been told by one of my housemates that I am the glue that keeps the four of us together. I'm good at expressing my feelings through writing (much better than in person, in fact), and I am good at systematic, detail-oriented subjects such as linguistics and geography. But above everything else the best thing I am at is wasting time. :P </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Me [21/M] and my friend [21/F] are potentially in the midst of a fallout because of a start-up company we're helping to run. I'm depressed and struggling with suicidal thoughts, and she is furious with me for being indirect and rude to her. I don't know what to do so I thought I would come here. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My best friend / roommate just lost a great deal of respect for me. We are in the midst of starting a business, for which I am the graphic designer. Since it's a start-up, none of us are getting paid for any of the work that we do, yet I have been spending two-three hours daily working on designs for the company. I put all of my personal art/design projects on hold and my grades have been starting to suffer. She hasn't been the most understanding, using "this is a business, sometimes things aren't fair" as a reason to drastically shorten due dates for big projects last minute and telling clients that I will do free work for them, as well, without my consent. Regardless, I did not feel very respected, and tried to bring this up, but she reacted negatively every time I did. Being terrified of direct conflict, I internalized all of the negativity I had built up, acting very passive aggressively with her and sometimes ignoring her when she would try to talk to me about projects. This went on for a couple of days until I asked to talk with her earlier this evening. I tried to express my issues with her but she (being a very forward extrovert) conveyed the problems she had with me much more easily. She told me that she didn't deserve the way I have been treating her and that it was childish and that I should have been more direct. I recognized all of this and quietly apologized; I also choked and was pretty silent for most of the conversation. In any case, I plan on leaving the company and trying to fix the mess I have made of my academic semester.

The problem is that although we are terrible doing business together, we live together so well and get along amazingly. Before this, we didn't have any problems with one another. It feels really awful to be afraid to talk to the person I consider my best friend, and I hate myself for having hurt her.

I've been dealing with depression for a bit over a year now, and this has definitely triggered a lot for me. I feel like a failure as a friend for not being able to effectively talk about my problems, instead acting extremely rude without explanation. I am very severely shaming myself for having hurt a person that I care about, and I have self-harmed and had suicidal thoughts for the first time in a while. If I am failing my classes, have tarnished my living situation and closest friendship, and can't keep a start-up going for less than half a year, then why am I even bothering anymore? </TEXT>
