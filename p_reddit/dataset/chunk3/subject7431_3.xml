	<TEXT> It totally depends what kind of things you like. Personally I would forget about dubai after you've seen the sparkly lights on the burj Khalifa. Having travelled to many many countries, of all the places I would recommend visiting, Dubai would be near the bottom of the list. (And actually, I love Flanders). So I'm probably the last person you should seek advice from! :)  
That said, if I could recommend anything, I would say to drive out of the city and see the desert. Forget the desert safaris. It's a bunch of tacky fake touristy crap! Do you like camping? I just take my 4x4 out on the weekends.  
Yas Marina would be good if there's something on (like last week!). If you like fancy cars, check out "city walk" on a Thursday evening.  
Check out Box Park too.

Forget shopping in the malls; Europe is way cheaper.  
As for locals, you are unlikely to ever interact with them. They only make up less than 15% of the population. If you want a more authentic middle eastern experience, forget Dubai, it doesn't exist here. Try Oman (which I would HIGHLY recommend over Dubai) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had all those things on my list of things to do too! Except not a desert "safari" (ie an organised tacky tourist thing), just take my 4x4 out.  
With regards to shooting range, Dubai is crazy expensive. I was planning to go to Al Ain (coupled with off roading) as it's SO much cheaper there. I hear there's a place in Sharjah too but not sure of the prices.  
For the karting, was contemplating the one in Jebel Ali </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really? So you mean to say that every single rape claim is genuine? I'm trying to belittle the crime, God knows it's horrific.  
However, you have also shown your tyre colours. A westerner is imprisoned in the Middle East, media cries foul, and somehow everyone instantly knows all the intricacies of the case. Have you seen evidence either way? Could it be possible that she wasn't actually raped and she's trying to destroy someone's life? My point was, we get our news through unreliable media outlets, which can hardly constitute a fair trial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They're far better off in a (true) Islamic society. Check out the exploitation of women, number of rape cases, lack of rights of women in the US and Europe. It's terrible. Get off your high horse, look at your own faults, and start addressing the issues in your own country before criticising others'. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see where this is going and quite frankly, it's a long debate. Based on your choice of words I'm inclined to believe you already have your stance and are unlikely to want to be educated. So I'm going to simply take the easy way out (yes, shame on me) and wish you a good day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. That's my point. The treatment of a rape victim in Islam/sharia law is good, and the punishment of the rapist severe. So all this malarkey isn't Islamic as much as it isn't medieval. All this is assuming that the girl in Dubai was actually raped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There may appear the be a correlation, but look at countries like Malaysia, Oman, Turkey, then compare them with certain Christian countries in Africa, or India and you realise there's less of a link to Muslims. That said, as a nation, Muslims have much to improve; sticking more to the teachings of Islam would go a long way to improve things. </TEXT>
