	<TEXT> Hmm interesting, how about read before commenting? Ideologies fascism springs from, such as racism, nationalism, chauvinism, religious fanaticism - all staples of the political right. Fascism originated historically as a political movement of conservatives. Its goals and rhetorics speak to conservatism, and fascist politicians have generally been supported by the traditionally conservative elements in society - nobility, church and the wealthy property owners.

	<TEXT> We as Americans should be embarrassed about Donald Trump, said Michael DeLuise, 66, a retired university vice president and registered Republican who lives in Eugene, Oregon. We as Americans have always been able to look at the wacky leaders of other countries and say, Phew, thats not us. We couldnt if Trump wins. Its like putting P.T. Barnum in charge. And its getting dangerous.

To be sure, the nation is sour on Clinton, too. Only 39 percent of voters have a favorable view of the Democratic nominee, compared to the 56 percent who view her unfavorably. Less than a third say they would be excited or proud should she move into the White House.


Question. Why as Americans would choose to  be voting for leaders who are clearly unfit to run a country, with all the lies been told, what does that say about wanting to be led by dishonesty.In a right mind people wouldnt chose a spouse who was dishonest, so why a president who is running a country?

	<TEXT> Errr maybe at least give them some kind of appropriate medication? From the article 

 In 2012, 77 per cent of treatments using the drugs were described as excessive and lasting for longer than the recommended six weeks, the report found.
Its shocking that the evidence continues to be flatly ignored George McNamara, Alzheimers Society Older antipsychotics such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine are still being used extensively, with no significant shift towards newer and safer types of drug.
Antipsychotics were originally developed for patients with schizophrenia or psychosis, but they are regularly prescribed off label for people with dementia who are behaving in a challenging way.

Now if care homes are there to look after people 24hrs they need to look after them and try at least to implement standards such as employing more staf at night. Facilitating patients needs so individual patients are in an environment where  specialised care is available for them.Drugging individuals is not the way. </TEXT>

I like how you remember your friend mentioning that how capable you are. It has stuck with you, and it sounds like your not to arrogant about it. Bonus points for the change from English teaching to the resort. I must say it appears that you want to give something back to the world . Have  you done personality tests/ self assessments  before to figure this out ? ( pm if you need be ) i realise its a personal question so if you dont reply i undestand. Yeah im still admiring the hotel you linked me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This in my opinion is speculating what an article  title should contain and is impossible to understand when posting.The title of this piece is taken from the article itself and hasnt been made up. Its a shame  ( again from my point of view ) that articles and links are taken down when they reach high upvotes and scanned for  unnecessary errors. Regarding the article been Russian and not fitting the requirement ? I know you work hard to moderate comments, however this article generated positive comments and discussion. I would consider the above comments from other users to about this removal  been heavy handed . </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can anyone explain that if we have just  learnt that dolphins are communicating ( conversations ) can we not rule out that other animals are possibly doing the same?  Weird question to ask , however do we know for sure that  other animals are not communicating and maybe even trying to communicate with us. A bad comparison to use possibly, but  just because species communicate differently, who are we ( humans )  to rule out that other beings are not communicating  complexly. We just havent figured that out ? </TEXT>
