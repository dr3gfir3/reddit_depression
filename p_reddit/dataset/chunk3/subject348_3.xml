	<TEXT> Wow, i'd much rather distance myself from that subreddit

My issue with this situation is less about gendered biases but rather the exploitation of personal issues for a better story, and the tv station playing a role (right or wrong) in matters where they otherwise had no right to do so

Also just to be clear i dont mean to suddenly jump down your throat, whether you were simply making an observation or simply hold different beliefs is totally cool. i just felt the need to justify where i was coming from with my point. we both seem to agree on the fact that there wasn't enough information available for anyone to intervene let alone a third party tv station with their own intentions. so yeah i agree, fuck those tv station guys!! </TEXT>
