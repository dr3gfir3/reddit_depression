	<TEXT> I do understand these things....but I must say, that in the desert or in the jungle, a structure covered with mirrors would hide very well, but not be invisible or cloaked in a science fiction kind of way, but in a literal obstruction/obfuscation from view kind of way.
But, in fairness, even the best camouflage is eventually seen by one close enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A sunny, Sunday afternoon, stuck in gridlock. I have one friend with me.  It is not a usual gridlock location, so it is an out of the ordinary thing...traffic not moving.  I look into my rearview mirror and see what you never want to see, a car coming upon me w/ no indication of braking at all.  He hits me, I hit the car in front of me. Bang, bang, bang.  We all pull over into a parking lot that is conveniently located next to us.  None of us have driver's licenses (lol) and decide to jump back into traffic and act natural, before some good Samaritan calls the po-po.  Here is where I mention the car I slammed into:  It was a champagne colored brand new Lexus.  Driven by two kids, I swear to God, children, of about 14 or 15 years old.  Illegals, Mexican.  Dressed in the finest threads I've seen.  You know them when you see them.  Expensive af clothes, brand new Lexus...no English.  The girl was giving me a universal look amongst females, a look that said "Thanks.  You have any idea the shit I have to listen to now? And for how long?  You just fucked my day up."  She's barely old enough to have had a period.
   Back in traffic, still not moving an inch, my friend and I become aware of the lack of any Lexus, anywhere.  Of any color.  It was simply gone.  There was nowhere to pull off to, nowhere to go to quick paint the car.  Into a what?  A Chevy van?  There was just no Lexus anywhere.  Immediately.  
wtf I will take the question of to my grave.... </TEXT>

She said of this: (loose verbatim puns intended I guess) " What? Its two grown people expressing love for each other!"  
I think I kind of understand what she meant now, twenty years later.  I think.  Still, it started young, she had to have been manipulated into this relationship.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Back in the day when I used  cocaine (freebase)  I lost consciousness once....after a big hit....the  next  thing i knew my husband (ex)  had a handful  of my hair, tight, in the back.  He and my friend were just  looking at me, really spooked.  No memory of being down for the count.  I was down for a full minute or so, or so they tell me.   It's  not scary until  its  scary,  and you  go from zero--full bore terror in a heartbeat.  Literally.  Glad everything worked out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> they knew this (the money part) the moment the pregnancy test told them it was a positive. All kids are. We have them anyway. Gotta come up with something better than that.  
I noticed the 'probably' part.  I've never even heard of that, parents happy their kid dead. Unless they are The Wests, Fred n Rose.  They don't count. They were awful.(serial killers) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been driven, in my past, to thinking about 'revenge' suicide, during a fight or two with my mother. Giving the asshole the last word kind of thing. Which one of us is the asshole? Both.  Anyway....when talking it out later, a family member pointed out that it wouldn't have put suffering and any kind of light shed onto anything; all I would have done would have been to fuel future drunken pity parties. She would've felt a slight victory. So the punishment being meted out, are you certain they will react to your death in a way that would satisfy? </TEXT>
