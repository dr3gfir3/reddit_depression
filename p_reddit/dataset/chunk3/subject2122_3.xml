	<TEXT> Lawrence of Arabia

I cleared my Saturday night just to see this epic. Those 3 hours and 40 minutes just flew by. And with a film of that magnitude, you need a charismatic and interesting actor at the center of it. It doesn't get any better than Peter O'Toole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very preliminary, almost cocky, Oscar nominations:

The sure bets

Best Picture

Best Director

Best Adapted Screenplay

The good-shots-but-we'll-have-to-wait-and-see

Best Supporting Actor for Steve Martin or Vin Diesel

Best Cinematography

Best Sound Editing

Best Sound Mixing

Best Film Editing

The longshots 

Best Actor for Joe Alwyn (this is his first movie, but Barkhad Abdi and Lupita N'yongo got nominated for their debuts so this could happen)

Best Supporting Actress for K-Stew (I get the feeling they're not crazy about her.)

	<TEXT> The Spectacular Now has my vote for the 2010s. I thought it was a pretty realistic story with a fresh take. For example, Brie Larson's character in that could've easily been the catty, slithery ex-girlfriend who tries to ruin Sutter's life. But she genuinely cares for him after the breakup. I really liked seeing that. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Now that Leo has his long-desired Oscar, what directors would you like to see him work with? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-30 23:46:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's a few I'd like to see him work with:

David Fincher: His movies seem like the type Leo would be interested in doing. Also, as much as I like Scorsese, Shutter Island would've been even better if Finch was at the helm for that one instead of Marty. Finch also has a good track record with A-listers (Pitt, Blanchett, Affleck).

Paul Thomas Anderson: They almost collaborated for Boogie Nights, and maybe Leo would work with him now that he's more accomplished. His last two movies have both been with Joaquin Phoenix, so maybe those two have THEIR own Scorsese-Leo relationship going on.

The Coens: Yes, they are more keen to work with character actors (Brolin, Turturro, Lee Jones, Goodman) rather than movie stars (apart from Clooney, Pitt, and Nic Cage). However, the brothers have proven time and again that they know how to write memorable characters, which I'm guessing is one of the things Leo takes in consideration. Plus, it'd be refreshing to see Leo do something a little lighter in tone and production after The Revenant. </TEXT>
