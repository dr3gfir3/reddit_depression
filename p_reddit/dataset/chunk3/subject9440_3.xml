	<TITLE> Is Eobard Back? [Spoilers] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-04 20:02:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Eobard Thawne got his powers from recreating the accident that created The Flash.  He got the information from his time, years after Barry Allen was dead and gone.  Last night, Wells talked in a normal voice which was almost a first for the entire season.  He also knew that Barry was exposed to chemicals, something that nobody would know.  As far as Team Flash is concerned he's a Meta just like everyone else.  So what gives?  Was this nothing more than a flashpoint reference or is Wellsobard back and pretending to be Harry again?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Barry went back in time last year, didn't see a time wraith.  He went back this year and did see a Time Wraith.  People think it might be a dead speedster based on the fact hes wearing a [Flash Mask](http://i.imgur.com/EYYJgUV.jpg).  Could it be Eobard Thawne?  Maybe thats why Barry didn't encounter one last year, because none of the speedster's have died / phased out of existence yet.  This also might be why Eobard was able to drastically alter the timeline without interference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just wondering if anyone else is playing Stick of Truth through the Backwards Compatibility?  I've been noticing some sound issues towards middle / end of the game.  Sometimes a cutscreen will start with delayed dialog and sort itself out.  Other times the cutscreen will be devoid of dialog and will just feature the music. Im also playing Mirrors Edge and just beat Shadow Complex, didn't notice a similar issue on either of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I built my buddy a PC about five years ago.  Hes wanting to upgrade his video card and I've been doing some looking.  His price range is around $150 and I came across this GPU.  It seemed like a great deal, but on nVidia's site they show these [performance stats](http://www.geforce.com/hardware/desktop-gpus/geforce-gtx-960/performance).  His old system could handle Tomb Raider at 60fps / 1080p and he was using a GTS 450.  Why on earth does a card thats five generations higher seem to be worse?

	<DATE> 2015-11-18 21:52:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From Stephen Amell : *"But I will say that I do very much think that episode 407 is our strongest episode to date this year. James Bamford directed it, and he was one of the first guys that I met in Vancouver when I arrived for the pilot. On our second day of filming, I actually snapped his neck on the show, which was one of the first clips that was released. He's a wonderful guy, and after 70-plus episodes choreographing the fights and coordinating the stunts, he got an opportunity to direct. All of the things that he has wanted to see on the show, from an action perspective, he puts into this episode."*

They can't be unchecked.  I believe the third one is the "Share" settings for windows 10.  My boss needs it to default to Outlook instead of Mail.  I made Outlook the default for everything but Mail is still taking these settings.  I can't seem to find on a google a way to change the setting in the registry.
