Two days.

*Two days.*

I was beginning to wonder if I'd ever escape the office.  For two days, nothing changed. I spent hours wandering around dark halls and avoiding the windows. Out there, nothing moved except roiling fog and slimy things carrying the occasional animal carcass. I peered over the edge of brick at one point to watch, and thought that one of those carried carrions had been a bear. In some sense, that reassured me, because normal life still existed, or had existed recently in this place - but if a bear couldn't fight off one of those incomprehensible creatures, I certainly couldn't.

The fridge contained a wide array of food, both company-owned for events, and marked with coworkers' names. I ate, because I believed that I should, but I tasted nothing. All I could think was: how did this food get here? If this place was in another reality, which it clearly was, shouldn't my coworkers' cubicles be empty? Why were their pictures, sundries, and leftovers still around the office? Had they been here during the day recently, and simply never returned?

What if I wasn't in another world? What if something terrible had happened to *my* world during the night? I was one of the few people awake that late. What if that had something to do with it? Maybe the other side of the world, different timezones, were fine, and I just had to wait for rescue

Except they'd never find me. Not in time. I went beyond the local office network and tried to figure out where exactly I was in relation to all these servers, mainframes, and Internets. I couldn't even tell which network was specifically *this* world - there weren't any clues or indications. Who could I contact? Nobody would believe me or be able to help me, and I was still afraid of drawing too much attention to myself.

There was a chance that my imprisonment here hadn't happened through malice. There was a chance that I could make my situation worse by messing around on the network.

With all the tech at my disposal, it took me a day and a half to think to use a phone.

I sat in a back cubicle in darkness, worried about what would happen. If I tried this, and it didn't work, a little sliver of hope would be gone. On the other hand, the food in the fridge wouldn't last forever I reached out and lifted the phone.

Almost immediately, a loud, chaotic, and high-pitched sound filled the cubicle. I dropped the phone back in place, heart pounding, and silence resumed.

Screaming it was screaming.

I steeled myself and lifted it again - the only sound on the phone, that phone, and many others in the office, was a large number of people screaming in terror and agony at the top of their lungs.

Yes, something was *very* wrong here.

It didn't take me long to map out all the possible avenues of escape from my office building, which brought home the realization that there was nowhere to go. I'd kind of expected that from the beginning, but what else could I have done but try? Welded shut doors, creatures outside the windows, screaming on the phones, blocked air vents there was a logic to this situation, hovering somewhere just outside the grasp of my current facts, but I couldn't quite reach it.

Feeling strange and bitter, I decided to get on with my other efforts, and I began looking into the situation in the other realities as discreetly as I could. A few hours into that work, my trigger searches popped up with a phrase that couldn't be mistaken: *purple slice*.

It was her. She had a laptop connected to a decently functioning Internet, in a reality which seemed more or less intact from what I could tell. Looking at the network map I'd been building, she was currently in one of the inner realities of the structure I was beginning to see emerge and she'd posted things, based on our short interaction, that would specifically draw my attention. She already had a voice chat server set up.

"Is it you?" she asked, noticing me logging in.

"Yes," I responded, excited to hear someone else's voice - well, any voice that wasn't screaming.

"That was fast."

"Since we last talked, I found out I'm stuck here."

"You're stuck?" she asked, immediately concerned.

"I'm trapped in my office building. I can't get out. There are weird slimy creatures outside one ate a goddamn bear and the doors are welded shut."

"Have you tried calling someone? Email?"

"I can't figure out who to email, or who would even believe me and the phones just have screaming on them."

She sounded confused. "Screaming?"

"Yeah, screaming. Men, women, even kids, screaming in terror. All the time."

"That sounds odd."

"Right? I think I triggered something, or activated something, or maybe something terrible happened to the world here just like so many others -"

"What do you know?" she asked abruptly, seizing on that mention.

"I've started outlining our communication infrastructure and all the networks it connects to. I've done it based on connection speed, assuming there's some sort of distance involved. It's turning into a map of sorts. It looks well it's like a map, honestly. Like I can tell you're in one of the inner realities."

"Really" she responded, intrigued. "Can I see this map?"

"Sure, I'll send it to you." I guided her through the technical details of accepting a file directly from me on her old and crappy laptop. I was particularly proud of the file I'd built. I'd made each reality into a circle, full of the most relevant information I could find about each place, and then arranged them the way I thought they might fit together. A three-dimensional movable image wasn't *technically* accurate, but it was the best representation of a four-dimensional structure I could manage.

"So there's the GLORWOC world, and there's where they tested the dimensional fracture bomb " She murmured for a few moments inaudibly before speaking louder again. "And I've been there, and there recently there's an actual *shape* to it."

I studied the file on my end, too. "Definitely. There are similarities between worlds that are close together, and they get more different the further you go. The inner realities seem decently well off, with actual functioning societies and governments, but the further out you go, the more you see struggles and issues. And on the outer shell"

" nightmares," she said, completing my sentence. "Nightmares, moving inward. Looking at these, I've been consistently hitting the outer shell. I've been seeing the worst of the worst on a regular basis."

"That would make sense," I told her, considering ideas I'd have thought impossible a month ago. "Whatever this structure is - network and sphere of realities, both - someone went through a ton of effort to build it. It wouldn't have much point if there wasn't some sort of protection mechanism, either natural or constructed."

"Walls," she murmured. "They're walls."

"Like a walled-off city"

"Yes. And the inner realities survive as long as the walls stand." She took a moment to think. "I've been outside the walls. It's not pretty out there. The multiverse is not a kind place."

"You've been beyond the map?" I asked, hopeful that she had some sort of method to rescue me. "How?"

"Just like you keep your identity to yourself for your own reasons, I'll have to keep that one secret," she replied. "I've been able to reach realities fantastic and horrible, unlike any of our Earths, and far beyond these walls but, judging by this map and the locations I've been to in the past few weeks, the shell seems to be preventing me from getting out now. Something's changed."

"Something seems to have happened to whoever was in charge a little over a year ago," I suggested.

"No, it's not that. I was going places as recently as Thanksgiving. Whatever it was, it happened very recently."

I thought about the sudden changes in my office building and my inability to escape. "And I just got trapped here in the last two days. What if it's not something that *did* happen, but something that *is* happening?"

"Interesting point. I do have one more move to make here. I've got a dead sentient flame in a metal box, and a device that can talk to souls. If living flames have souls, it might know something. I know for certain that the flame world is outside our shell"

"And you're trying to find somebody that went through there."

"Yes. So you were listening that whole time?"

"Watching, really. But I wasn't just being weird. I've been following your trail on the system for a while now. I want to help - and, maybe, now, I'm hoping you'll help *me* get out of here."

"I can try," she said calmly. "I would like to save you, but I can't guarantee anything. Do you know where you are in the structure?"

"Not yet," I sighed. "I'll keep working on it. Any information you give me will help, though."

"Then maybe I'll type up what I read in the device and send it to you."

I sat and waited, suddenly confused. A device that talks to souls? *What?* Did that mean that souls were real? Did that mean *I* had a soul? Wasn't that some kind of religious revelation people should know about?

The file came shortly, and I forgot all about those unknowable concerns.

---

What are you doing? Don't you think I see what you're doing? Get that thing away from me!

I can't move I can't get away

Why would you ally yourself with such a monstrous creation? 

Don't you know what it *does?* Do you relish in sadism and evil?

Stop, I don't want to -

We are not driven by hunger like our pathetic neighbors. They consume and burn, moving from plane to plane in search of unlockable energy. We are an enlightened species of flame, and are more interested in learning the complexities of existence than eating matter. We draw energy from the vacuum, in any case, and have left consumption behind. It was a necessary development once no energy beyond ourselves was left in our home plane. That's the price of growth.

Stop hurting me, I -

We became aware of the existence of the bubble only recently as we traveled from plane to plane. It's a very interesting phenomenon, and so we spent some time near it. Eventually, part of it cracked - exploded from within - and we found ourselves able to get in and look around.

Weird fleshy organisms were all about, however, a purely physical kind of life we'd never seen before, and they did not like us at all. Worse, that crack was just one of many, and investigating became dangerous. Many places we'd deemed inhospitable began to seep together and when we became aware of the greater danger, the Crushing Fist, many of us started dissenting from the flamespirit for the first time in generations. I myself -

...died.

I died.

I'm dead oh, that explains quite a bit. Will you revive me?

I hear your desires through the device. The beings you seek I did see them, and we conflicted with them for a time, but held back when we realized they were like us, but in disguise. I don't know where they went. Wait - one of them is nearby. You should ask him.

He doesn't know? I see.

Please close the device. I can't take the pain anymore. If you revive me, I will take you to the last place we saw them go. It was close to somewhere we are no longer, but once were.

Thank you.

---

"Are you going to revive it?" I asked, fixated on what it had mentioned about consuming its entire home universe.

"I think I have to," she said after a moment.

"It said one of the beings you're looking for is nearby?"

"Don't you worry about that."

"Alright." I let it pass, despite my curiosity. "What do you think the Crushing Fist is? That doesn't sound promising at all."

"No idea, but I'm sure we'll find out. It sounds like something's coming for us."

Over the next several hours, I worked with her to set up a mobile radio that she could use to connect to the structure and talk to me from almost anywhere - as long as her mode of travel to other realities remained active. A few trips to a computer store and a hardware store produced a reasonably rigged headset that would let me see what was going on, too, for the most part. She turned out to be surprisingly technically capable I wondered if she'd had training before.

In fact, there were quite a few mysterious things about her. She took control of the situation and made decisions with the calm air of someone who often faced choices with limited information, someone who understood the risks, and the impossibility of making perfect plays.

I wondered, too, how she was getting between universes. Did she have someone helping her? On this topic, she would say nothing at all.

It was many hours before she declared that she was ready to travel.

A few minutes later, she turned on her headset - and I found myself looking at a vast but close-cropped verdant landscape filled with low ferns and patches of moss. The sky above was a simple blue, like the kind I remembered vividly from my time before this dismal office prison.

Before her, a bright ball of flame danced a path forward. Somehow, despite not having a face, I could tell it was happy to be alive again. A few moments after guiding her to that plane, it puffed up - and vanished in a sliver of light.

She must have revived it and had it lead her to this place before turning on her camera - what didn't she want me to see?

"Where are we?" she asked.

I ran a few tests on our connection, and compared it to the matrix I'd built. I measured out an appropriate spot and added a new circle to our file. "You're pretty far out past the walls. How'd you get out there?"

"I don't know, since we can't communicate, but the flame did say it was aware of many cracks in the bubble's shell," she said quietly, her tone concerned. "I've got myself pretty tightly wrapped up here in a makeshift environment suit. I have it on good authority that, after the world where the people I'm looking for met the flames, they ran into trouble with some sort of fungus that ate them from the inside out."

"It certainly looks like it has fungus," I noted, studying what I could see of the thick, low jungle flora. "What now?"

"I don't know. I'm hoping to find some clue where they went." She looked around. "Or maybe if he's been here before, it should be nearby"

"Who?"

"Nobody." She moved along a small natural path between the thick bush-like fronds. Following a small light green creek that was comfortably clear of any growing things, she worked her way along mossy rocks, breathing loudly inside whatever facemask she'd rigged up.

I think I saw them before her. "What's *that?*"

She came up short, peering into a clearing ahead.

Several dozen people stood all around the clearing, facing random directions. They wore plain brown nondescript clothes with no identifying symbols.

None moved.

They simply stood there, a scattered crowd, each staring directly ahead.

I couldn't make any sense of it. "What are they doing?" I zoomed in to get a closer look.

"I don't think they're doing anything at all" she whispered. Despite her low words, something still noticed her.

At once, every single person in that silent crowd turned and stared directly at her.

She froze in place, thinking the situation through. "They're not invisible"

"Huh? Why would they be invisible?"

"I encountered some kind of gigantic mechanical construct that controlled legions of dead humans converted into invisible walking corpses," she whispered, too matter-of-factly for my tastes. "They were a hive mind, but this isn't them. This is something else."

"Cordyceps fungus," I realized, thinking back on stuff I'd seen on the entire Internet I'd absorbed. "It's a common fear - a fungus that can control your mind. You see a lot of self-written horror stories on the Internet that involve some variant of it."

"Maybe," she murmured. "Got a lot of time on your hands, then?"

I wished I could grimace. "Um, yeah. I've sort of seen the entire Internet. I get bored here."

"Office building, internet time, computer skills some sort of I.T. person?" she guessed. "Probably late shift, judging by how much you get away with."

How the hell? This woman didn't miss a thing. I suppose that was a necessary skill for survival, doing what she was doing whatever that was. "Something like that."

"Any other ideas from the Internet?" she asked, still not daring to move.

"Um um zombies?"

"No, zombies aren't real. They fundamentally don't make sense."

"But you said you met invisible corpses?"

"Clearly controlled and animated by an outside source," she whispered. "Those weren't zombies. They were corpse-puppets."

"Oh. Um lockstep."

"Lockstep?"

"They move if you move. That's a common one, too."

"Maybe - but how?"

"Maybe they're not human," I suggested, excited to use my Internet knowledge, and worried that it might actually be true. "Maybe they just look human. They could be robots, aliens, illusions anything. They're not smiling. That's a good sign."

"Why?"

"Because smiling things are the *worst*," I breathed, feeling sick as I thought back on all the stories I'd read.

"Think it through," she instructed. "Logic it out. Why are smiling things the worst?"

"Because" I thought about it for a moment. "Because they're aware of you, and aware of how they make you feel, and they've got an agenda."

"These people aren't smiling," she said with a tone of affirmation. "So"

"So they're not aware of you" I realized aloud. "At least not directly."

"Right. So we can reasonably assume they're only responding to stimuli. Now what did I do that caught their attention?" 

"Well, we've been talking this whole time, so it isn't noise" I grabbed a portion of her stream and rewound it.

As I did so, the people in the clearing moved again, each taking two steps closer, their eyes blank.

"I didn't do anything," she whispered.

I couldn't believe it, but - "I think it's *me.* They moved first when I zoomed in on the feed, and then again when I rewound some portion of it."

"How could they possibly be aware of that? Unless" She took in an unhappy breath. "These are some of the people Im looking for. Energy beings in the guise of humans. I was told the fungus *ate* them."

"So the energy being part of them is responding to things I'm doing on the computer here?"

"Maybe. Discontinuous electromagnetic signals, different from the ongoing chatter of our feed. Or maybe they're connected by some sort of greater whole that's aware of you. Stop doing things on the computer." She took a step to her right.

None of the strange blank-eyed people moved.

"I can't leave just yet," she told me, unhappy about it. "If there are any clues here, they've got them."

Stepping further into the clearing, she approached the nearest brown-clothed person - a man with long, scraggly black hair and blank eyes. Touching him with a plastic-gloved hand, she gently patted his pockets.

He made no move, and gave no reaction.

Ever so slowly, she moved to the next, an older grey-haired woman. She, too, stared blankly ahead. With one trembling hand, my ally reached into a pocket of her jacket and drew out a small metallic square. 

Without warning, the old woman turned her face and addressed us directly. Her voice rang out hollow and multi-tonal. "We don't like your kind."

To her credit, my ally remained calm, her hands up - the small metallic square hidden behind two of her fingers pressed together. "I'm just going to leave no hostility intended."

A small blank-eyed child to her left spoke in the same voice, as if a crowd was communicating through him. "Go now."

With the camera shaking visibly from her tension, she crept slowly out through the gathered crowd of silent stares. I heard her make a noise of anger, and she threw one hand at the air briefly as she left.

"What is it?" I asked, concerned.

"I just" She looked around, and then settled her gaze on a distant deer. It bent over the light green creek, sipping quietly. "I have to make sure."

"Come on, get out of there! What if you get infected?"

"I don't know, but I have to see this through. I have to know if there's a chance to save them." Moving along the creek, she followed it upstream, and higher. In just a few minutes, she reached a higher outcropping. "Look."

From her vantage point, I saw a tremendous plain of patterned greens and greys that stretched out to the horizon. Set dead center was a staggered collection of office buildings - we were looking at a recognizable city, sprawled out in a vast pattern of suburbs. The only thing out of place was the green patches of mossy green grew splattered along the tall buildings. "It's Richmond," she commented. "Humans."

Jumping down from her rock, she moved along the forest until she found something specific - a bird, sitting and staring blankly at nothing. Its lungs moved in and out visibly as it breathed, but it made no move to escape from her.

A little further down another trail, she found a normal young man in jogger's clothes, staring blankly down his trail.

Instinctively, I zoomed in to get a better look at him - and froze - but he made no move and gave no response. Odd

Heading back to her original location, she sighed into her facemask. "I have to try this."

"Try what?"

"Didn't you see the deer? It's the details that matter."

"The deer the deer was moving and alive."

"Exactly." Heading for the creek, she scooped up some of the oddly pale green water in her gloved hands and carefully brought it over to the brown-clothed people. Tipping her hands, she poured some into the mouth of the male with the long black hair.

Nothing happened for one minute, two

The entire clearing, people, bushes, and mossy ferns, seemed to convulse as if struck. Many multi-tonal voices cried out.

The man she'd given the water blinked and fell forward weakly. "I'm free"

Around them both, everything living began moving. Even as I watched, what I'd thought were bushes began uprooting and slogging toward them. The blank-eyed people moved in like a wave.

"Let's go," she ordered him, tugging him in the direction of her point of entry.

"How long has it been?" he asked between ragged breaths.

"I don't know."

I watched as they stumbled and ran up along the creek. The oddly colored creek remained the only path ahead, as all the life around them clustered frenetically closer. It seemed that nothing living wanted to get near the stream.

"What happened to you?" she asked, using her shoulder to support him. "Can we save them?"

"It's a brain," he breathed, eyes wide. "It's a giant plant-based brain, and we were all forced into being a part of it. Haven't you noticed the distribution of the plant nodes around here? They're neural cluster equivalents. And that creek is full of toxic material it's excreting back along a vein of sorts."

"How big is it?" she asked, her voice haunted.

He groaned at some pain in his chest. "The whole planet."

"God"

"That's what it calls itself, yes."

She turned her head and looked at him for a moment as they ran, but I wasn't sure what she was thinking. "We can't save the rest, can we?"

"It'll never let you near them again," he coughed. His stance weakened, and he half-fell. "It doesn't even want to let you take *me.*"

"We're almost out," she insisted, practically dragging him. "It's right -"

She stopped without warning, and dropped his hand.

"What are you doing?!" I shouted. "Go!"

"He's dead."

"But you're not! Get out of there!"

"I'm already here. I'm safe. If he'd lasted just a few more seconds god *damnit*, I almost had him." She looked slowly in a circle at the plant life and blank-eyed people clustered along the edges of the toxic creek. Although I couldn't see her face, I could practically feel the anger flowing from her.

The view included a gaping irregular oval in space next to her. Beyond, several children of varying ages waited and watched.

She said it once more, this time to herself. "God. Damnit."

I saw her reach up, and then the feed went blank.

Her audio resumed maybe twenty minutes later. I leapt to the comm. "Are you alright?"

"I need to figure out what this little metal thing is," she replied, her tone as calm as before, like nothing had happened. "Can you investigate on your end?"

"Sure," I told her, wondering how she could just be *alright* after enduring that situation and having a man die inches from safety.

Once I was left to myself again, I couldn't quite bring myself to work. The thought of all those people on that planet being absorbed into a giant plant brain ecosystem were they in pain? Were they conscious? They had to be the man had said *I'm free* with such relief

Was there nothing we could do for them?

I thought about what that first lonely soul had said, the man whose untraceable message had started me down this insane path. *Just death*just death was better than worse fates.

I had an idea, but I tucked it away for some future situation. How twisted was existence when the best thing you could do to help was to ask a race of sentient flames to go somewhere and burn people alive rather than let them remain mentally imprisoned forever in a megalomaniacal plant that thought it was God?

I filed away those dark thoughts and focused on figuring out where I was in the structure of realities.

If I don't get out of here soon, I think I'm going to go insane

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2qu26c/judging_by_the_message_i_found_someone_somewhere/)

It took several days, but it finally happened. I was startled out of idleness by a sudden successful return from my search trigger. I'd had a few false alarms until I'd adjusted my algorithm, but I quickly knew that this was it. The network I'd been alerted to was haphazard, and traffic was sparse. There was still some activity, though - someone was still alive out there.

To my amazement, I found that I'd been alerted to a streaming video from someone's mounted camera. Other data came with the stream, monitoring the person's vitals. There was a field for location data, too, but it simply read *error.* Wondering what had triggered my search parameters, I watched and listened.

Whoever it was remained low, crouching behind a crest of dirt along a ditch or trench of some sort. Above a vast jumble of broken buildings and pock-marked wasteland, the sky seemed a patchwork blaze of colors. Irregular yellow cut across flaring red, both backset by an eerily bright blue, itself trailing into a maze of other hues. Each color seemed to have its own angle of light, too, evinced in cloud banks and errant beams that simply made no geometric sense. The sight was hauntingly beautiful and immediately terrifying. Trying to make sense of the low-resolution image, beset by momentary flickers, I couldn't help but stare.

What was I seeing? Where *was* this?

Was this another reality? I'd known, from the network structure and files I'd seen, that it had to have been a real concept but seeing it for myself still made for a surreal moment.

It was then that I noticed that my unknown scout was watching something. A figure crept along a vast stretch of blasted gravel and grey dirt, heading for the trench some hundred feet further down. As my subject turned, I got a better look at the trench and nearly closed out of the stream.

Corpses.

I reeled emotionally, but clung to logic: they had uniforms. The nearest body was charred to a crisp, his blackened flesh and skeletal remains gaping widely into the lower half of my view but he had a uniform. Surely that meant this was some sort of conflict - some sort of organized endeavor? Deaths were expected in war, right?

Beyond that wretched soul ran a very long trench filled with unidentifiable equipment, bolt holes, vast puddles, and bodies. Some were blackened by fire, but others had fallen unburned without better resolution, I couldn't make out their causes of death.

"Brunette woman, unknown origin, no uniform"

The voice was male, and he sounded like he was in his twenties. Was he talking to headquarters? Or *me?* No he was talking to himself. His low words were being muttered without concern for audibility. He was thinking out loud.

"How'd she get here? Hostile? Hmm four minutes"

He moved forward with some stealth, creeping over bodies without even a cursory glance. As he passed, I could see more detail: some looked waterlogged, as if they'd drowned; some had nail scratches all over their faces as if they'd attacked themselves; some had holes bored in their skulls.

What the hell had happened here?

Or, *was* happening, to be more accurate I'd finally found someone in real-time, someone who might know something.

He peered around a corner of dirt and watched her for a moment.

So this was her the woman that had visited two hapless souls in two different realities in the last two weeks and possibly more. I only had data for what I'd managed to find, but I'd had plenty of time to guess at her agenda, intentions, and capabilities.

The very first thing I noticed was her expression. She gazed around at the littered bodies in conflict, her high cheeks cold, her eyes warm. I had the distinct impression she was evaluating their manners of death while struggling not to think about the living men and women they'd been. One of the fallen seemed to be a younger woman hardly old enough to participate in combat. As both my camera-wearing ally and I watched, the older brunette found a muddy blanket and covered her in particular.

Apparently, my unknowing partner had reached the same conclusion about her nature as I had. He remained behind his corner and called out. "Human?"

The woman immediately leapt behind a sturdy metal box of supplies, her gaze jumping toward his direction.

He stepped out slowly, his hands up. As he moved, I saw the edge of a large rifle bouncing on a strap around his chest. "I'm human."

Unexpectedly, she laughed, and then I heard her voice for the first time. "Does that mean we're on the same side?"

"Out here it does, ma'am."

"Ma'am?" she replied, warily watching him approach across wide puddles and charred gravel. "How old do you think I *am?*"

He stopped in place, his feet planted on a flat metal plank that had been cast across the gulch. "No disrespect intended."

She stood slowly, revealing herself from her hiding spot. "Military?"

"With respect," he countered. "There's very little time. You should take a gun - there are plenty around here - and we should go."

She shook her head and took a few steps forward. "I've never come across a situation out here where a gun would have done a damn thing. Have you?"

My unknowing ally said nothing, instead instinctively looking around at the bodies of his fellows.

"Alright then," she continued. "What's the situation here?"

He began moving away, his vital signs increasing. The camera glanced straight up, sighting a large irregular square of dark red overhead. A peal of thunder rang out, once, twice, and a third time. Between cracking booms, he managed to shout: "Don't fall underneath!"

He looked back, and I saw her running after him. A rumbling roar sounded, making speech impossible, but I could tell she wasn't sure what he'd meant.

He looked up again, and I saw what *was* that? A curtain of tangible darkness, spilling down from the edges of the dark red sky, as if the square's edges were the lips of a basin into which an ocean was pouring. As I continued watching, the word *ocean* became more appropriate all around, the darkness began crashing down to blasted earth and spilling out across the terrain.

It was water.

In those moments, with frothing walls approaching from multiple directions, I couldn't fathom what those two must have been feeling. His heart rate was dangerously high, and I could hear her shouting something just behind him as they ran. Wherever he was leading them, they didn't seem to make it in time.

A massive fist of emerald water blasted down the trench, and he leapt up the side and clambered onto grey dirt. Looking to his right, he confirmed she'd done the same, but a look to his left found the deluge swelling out onto their level just a moment later. Standing quickly, and pulling her up, he braced against the tide.

It hit with visible force, quickly rising up nearly to the camera's height - where *was* the camera, anyway? She didn't seem to notice it, and it wasn't bouncy enough to be on his helmet

He shouted again, but the roar drowned out his words. The entire wasteland had a torrent of water rushing across it in a vast flat and frothy plain, maybe three or four feet deep judging by the level moving against him, and the force was clearly pushing them both to their limits.

What had he said? *Don't fall underneath* what would happen if they did? There were waterlogged bodies in the trench, but had they died from this, or had they just been soaked by repeated floods? He'd known the exact moment it was coming

The camera rattled and then fell backwards abruptly, and I froze as his ragged shout filled my senses. Had he? No, the woman had caught him, and now struggled with grit teeth to lift him back up without falling herself. Desperate, he shouted something akin to thanks, and then pointed at a distant hill.

At first, she seemed to think they were supposed to head for it, but his meaning quickly became clear. As all three of us watched, the surging green water coasted *up and over the hill* and covered it four feet thick. Beyond the hill, the craggy ruins in the distance glimmered darkly as water surged up any surface it could, defying all logic. The only structures that remained above the flood were those most intact and straight; only pillars, towers, and the largest building sat clear under the insane technicolor sky.

*Don't fall underneath,* he'd said. It seemed likely that, if one fell underneath, there was no coming back up what a horrible fate that must have been, drowning in four-foot-deep water inches from your comrades? Had they tried to pull their colleagues up, only to bring the emerald deluge up with them, still covering the drowning men even as they ran around clutching at the air and trying to breathe?

I could tell by his vitals that he was about to collapse. His heart rate was too high, and the strain was too much. Was I about to watch this man die?

Like a reverse blast, the emerald tide was suddenly gone, rushing away across the wasteland. He collapsed onto soaked grey earth. 

Above him, the woman stood and tried to shake off water while also catching her breath. "That happen often around here?"

"Every day," he croaked, panting. "Get back down in" Stumbling up with her help, he pulled them both back towards the trench and fell roughly to hard dirt between two corpses. "Over there don't move they're alive." He looked up once, noting the sickly yellow patches of sky overhead.

She followed his lead, lying in the trench among the dead.

What new horror was coming for them? I watched with terrible fascination as strange glows began appearing all around them radiance which soon burst into flames directly. The fires began dancing along the floor of the trench between them, coalescing into balls of white-hot energy that seemed to move along without source or pattern. Dozens of flames began floating along and above the trench, hovering around certain objects and seeking out fuel

After only a few minutes, I had the oddest sense that they were alive. Each ball or pillar of flame moved from object to object, touching and investigating with little tendrils of orange and white. If they were alive, could they be reasoned with? Perhaps they'd -

One ball of flame suddenly struck out, lancing a dead body through the heart with a blindingly fast spear of fire.  It receded slowly, only withdrawing when it was satisfied of something. Perhaps the corpse had been too wet to burn, or maybe it'd thought the body a threat somehow images of those charred bodies came to mind, immediately revealing what happened to those the flames considered a threat.

The stream went black, but I could still hear noise.

My subject's vitals were low, rather than high, and I could guess why: he was lying still, eyes closed, trying not to move, breathe, or attract any attention to himself.

Thinking about it, I had only one conclusion - the camera was in his eyes! That was an odd choice of location, but it certainly explained why his stream was still on through all this. He probably had no way to turn it off.

Forty-three minutes passed before he decided to open his eyes again. By then, the flames were gone. He breathed a sigh of relief and looked up, noting an oncoming purple blade of sky. "We have some time before the next one."

Across the trench, the woman sat up abruptly. "Those flames. They were alive?"

The camera moved up and down as he nodded.

"I need to talk to them. How long until they come back?" 

He laughed, confused. "Um, talk to them?" He threw a hand up at one of his charred comrades. "I came here with fifty thousand other guys. This is what happened when they tried to talk to them."

She came over and sat down next to him. "Fifty thousand men? How many are left?"

He said nothing at first, but I could see a slight misting at the bottom of the camera. "There's a Russian guy maybe two klicks northeast of here. He came here with a hundred thousand, so he's pretty well stocked. I can't speak Russian, though." He tilted his view down toward grey mud. "There's  a Yngtak lady a bit west. I don't know anything about her, though, and she doesn't speak either of our languages. I see her in the distance sometimes."

Yngtak? What the hell was Yngtak? The thought struck me: why was I just sitting here watching and wondering? I had the entire network at my fingertips. I could *look things up* if I was careful. Yngtak Yngtak no results on this network. Was she from another reality?

"So it's just you?" the woman asked. "You're the only one left out of fifty thousand men?"

He said nothing.

"What happened here?" she asked, changing tack. "What happened to the sky?"

"Nothing happened to the sky," he countered. "All those skies are just fine. We just happen to've got royally screwed *here.* It didn't work, obviously."

"What didn't work?"

He slowly looked up at her, and the camera's view narrowed slightly. "Aren't you from Command?"

It was her turn to say nothing.

He stood abruptly. "*How did you get here? Who are you?*"

"You haven't heard back in over a year, right?" she countered.

The view shifted down for a moment, then back up. "I just thought if I held out long enough they'd come and then there you were"

She regarded him with that same conflicted expression I'd seen her use on the corpses. "I'm sorry. I don't know anything that might help you, but I've met others still surviving. You're not alone."

The view went black as he closed his eyes again. I wasn't sure, but I thought I heard a single slow intake of breath.

"Can you tell me what happened here?" she asked again.

He kept his eyes closed as he explained. "Tech test. It was a bomb, or something like a bomb. I couldn't tell you what it was for, only that we got sent in to clean up the mess. It fractured space, turned this place to shit."

"So the sky's not changing at all," she guessed. "It's bubbles of different realities moving around at random."

"Yes ma'am but not at random." He opened his eyes again to find her studying him with an intent gaze.

"So there's a pattern, and that's how you've survived."

He nodded. "Most died in the first few weeks, but at least a hundred of us figured out the pattern. But that was a year ago, and one mistake gets you killed."

"I'm sorry."

"Appreciated. But nothing you can do to change it." He looked up, judging the sky. "Purple slice is next, gotta tie ourselves up." In response to her asking look, he explained further. "You gotta tie yourself up or you'll claw your own eyes out, or worse. The trick is making the ropes escapable, just not too quickly. Purple slice doesn't last long, but you don't want yourself getting out early, and you don't want to still be restrained when the brain-eaters come. That's the piss yellow. Not pea-soup yellow like the flames' sky."

"Brain-eaters?" She frowned.

"Yes ma'am. And after that, the white I hate the white that godforsaken Preacher"

"I have a better idea," she said, looking toward the direction from which she'd come. "Why don't you come with me, and we can both go home?"

Yes. Say yes! Thinking to look up his file, I quickly accessed and scanned what I could. He was twenty-two, and from that reality. Damn.

"With respect, ma'am, I'm already home." I heard a certain bitterness and resignation in his words. "And I have to be here for the black."

"The black?"

He remained quiet for nearly ten seconds, long enough that I thought he wasn't going to answer until he snapped out of his own thoughts. "I have to be here for the black, ma'am. I, uh I" He paused again. "I don't have the words to tell you about the black, but I think you should go, if you've got a way to get, before it comes. Guys are all dead, but the equipment still works, and I gotta be here to use it when the black comes. I know this place is hell, but there's a whole fractured world out there full of my people, and I got to I got to I'm staying as long as there might be one kid out there, or one family, or whoever, trying to make it. Russian guy, too, and Yngtak lady, though I don't know why she cares about us. I think she stays because of the black, and what might happen to other places if we don't stop it each day. So I can't go with you. Sorry, ma'am."

Throughout his bitter and hopeful speech, she just watched him, her eyes a mix of disappointment and understanding. "Alright." She looked up at the sky. "Do the flames come back again today?"

He recited practiced phrases out loud. "Gravity, death music, shapeshifters, flood, flames, invisible slicers, silver nooses, flood, flames, crazy, brain-eaters, the Preacher, tree ghosts, flood, silver nooses, crazy, dream-stealers, the black nope. That was their second time already today. Come back tomorrow."

She grimaced. "I can't. I've only got a single day here. But I need to talk to them - if I could just find out where they came from, that'd point us in the right direction."

"Whaddya need living flames for?"

"Some people I'm looking for went through their world, or one like it," she replied cryptically.

"Some people, eh?" He searched around in the mud for a minute or two, before lifting a muddy red crystalline shard. "Well, best I can do is this. It's a dead flame. But careful, though, if it gets hot it'll come back to life."

She took it carefully, and placed it in a pocket. For the first time, I saw her smile. "Thank you."

"Of course. All part of the job." He laughed weakly. "It's just good to hear some English for once. Russian guy talks over the radio sometimes; no idea what he's sayin', but I think by now he just talks to talk. There's nobody coming, is there?"

She hesitated. "You never know."

"Ah, sure."

Wait, did he say radio? What did I have access to here? Quickly running through the systems at my disposal, I searched for any sort of radio apparatus. He did say the equipment was still working. Could I transfer audio to that reality, and then have it broadcast by a radio tower there?

As he began tying himself up, and she stood up to leave, I quickly put together my little scheme. "Hello?"

I saw them both jump as static came from a radio somewhere on his person.

Testing my unused voice, and trying to clear up the signal, I spoke again. "Hello, can you hear me?"

He immediately lifted the radio in sight, close to his mouth. "Command?!"

"No, sorry," I replied, electrified at actually making contact. "I'm actually, it's probably best if I don't say who I am. I don't know who might be listening. But I think I can help. I've got a lot of information here I could probably try to find the flames' world."

I saw my mistake in their reactions.

"I'm watching through a camera in your eye!" I explained quickly. "I noticed her showing up in logs and messages, and I set a search trigger to try to find her in real time."

"Me?" she asked, looking him in the eye with a curious glare.

"I know we don't know each other," I said, choosing my words carefully despite my fear and excitement. "But you seem like a good person, and something terrible is clearly going on, and I'd like to help."

"You don't know me at all," she said quietly.

"Where are you, man?" my camera-bearer asked.

"I'm - well, again, I don't think I should say. But I'm not in your reality. This network spans dozens of Earths."

The woman nodded. For the first time, this close to the camera, I noticed that her eyes were light brown. She seemed lost in thought. "I suspected that something like that might exist. If nightmares can cross dimensions, it makes sense that people can, too, and it's the nature of bureaucracy to spread."

Bureaucracy she'd chosen the right word, and guessed well. I was nobody important, but I had the ability to help, because nobody knew who I was or what I had access to in the vast structure of my organization. It was a running joke online that nobody knew what I.T. really did and that joke, being true, was the sole reason I'd learned any of this.

"Do you know what happened to Command?" he asked.

"I can try to look it up. Do you know which reality it's in?" I almost laughed. I would never have believed I'd be asking that question if I'd told myself about it two weeks ago.

He closed his eyes, and the camera, for a long moment. "Damn. I don't. All I know is, the comm girl was named Sarah."

"*That's* what you know?" the woman teased.

"Eh, get off," he protested, looking away and probably blushing.

Stepping closer to his eye view, she addressed me directly. "I'd appreciate your help finding -"

"Shit!" His cry interrupted her. "Purple slice! The crazy!"

Her eyes went wide, and she took off running without a second's hesitation. He fumbled with his ropes, either trying to tie them in time or get out of them and run, but I could see his hands begin to shake. The view began misting over as he started whispering to himself. "Oh God, oh God"

I watched in horror, helpless. Would my interruption get this young man killed? No - there had to be a way! "What's your name?" I asked, trying to keep him focused while I desperately sorted through files and specs.

"Jonathan," he answered, his voice trembling and straining. "Jonathan Cortin. I'm dead, man. Goddamnit, not the crazy, not like this any of the others would have been better go out firing at that goddamn Preacher"

"Don't lose it just yet," I insisted, examining the specs for his internal eye camera. "Jonathan I can knock you out."

"What? How? Do it!" he screamed, bending over and staring at his hands as he resisted curling them into claws. Tears dropped down to the wet grey earth beneath as he pressed his forehead into mud.

"I can overload your eye camera, and it'll knock you unconscious for several minutes," I told him, thoughts racing. "But that's it. It'll be offline, and if Command is out there, they won't be able to access it and they won't know you're alive. You'll also go blind in one eye."

He screamed at the top of his lungs, a guttural and rage-filled sound. "Have you seen 'em? I'm losing an eye either way! Do it!"

Steeling myself against the pain he was about to feel, I sent my quickly typed code instructions to his eye camera.

The resulting yell filled *me* with pain just by pure empathy and then the stream went black.

I made no move for nearly two minutes, simply struggling to understand everything that had just happened. Other realities were real, something terrible was going on, the only semblance of organization out there had been absent for a year and I'd just burned out some poor kid's eye to save him from scratching his own face off.

That was not the idea of helping I'd had in mind, but at least he'd live, and keep holding the black at bay, whatever nightmare that entailed. Only now, there would be no hope of rescue or reinforcements. He was on his own because of me. And I'd probably doomed that woman, too.

I'd made a mistake.

Meddling had been a mistake.

Who the hell was I to be messing around with interdimensional affairs?

It had all happened so fast...

Getting up, I unhooked my awareness from the computer I'd been engrossed in, and decided to go home. Would anyone even notice if I left early? Knowing Human Resources, *that* would probably be the offense that finally drew attention but I couldn't stay. Not after what I'd done.

Moving out through the stacks of servers, each darkly lit by a rainbow of diodes and info lights, I headed for the door.

The hallway was dark and quiet. There was no need to light the building when I was the only one here I'd never tried to leave before my shift was over, and it felt incredibly eerie to trespass through a space I shouldn't have been in. Cubicles sat open and empty, filled with pictures of families and children. These people would have been my coworkers, had I ever spoken to any of them or even been in the office during the same hours. I'd only been here once in daylight - a bright, shining, and warm day of basic corporate policy training.

I pressed against the exit door, intent on going home and resting - and I came up short.

The door refused to budge.

With only the red EXIT sign's crimson light to see by, I studied my escape.

It'd been welded shut.

With a very, *very* strange feeling that I knew what I was going to find, I went around the entire building, testing every exit.

They'd all been welded shut.

Peering out the windows desperately, I saw only parking lot and grass, lit weakly by the ceiling lights I'd turned on. The rest lay shrouded in thick fog.

As I stared out, I thought about breaking the windows until I saw something moving in the fog, something which sent me reeling back in terror. Turning all the lights off as quickly as possible, I watched it shamble by without noticing me - a massive jellyfish-like creature twenty feet tall, moving on various tentacle limbs.

Where was I? What was *happening?*

How did I get into work? *How did I usually come into work?* I recalled a very odd sensation at the start of each shift as I entered the server room. Was I was the server room in another reality? It might have been necessary for interdimensional connectivity. Had I been unknowingly working in another dimension all this time?

The server room door!

Rushing back to the server room, I examined the very peculiar door that I'd always assumed was for security purposes. It was large and metallic, and could definitely have hidden circuitry or devices or whatever it was that connected realities.

I waited.

Once the proper time came, I attempted to leave.

The doors remained welded shut, and the situation outside remained mysterious and deadly.

Had I broken something by trying to leave early? Or by fooling around with the system?

Had someone noticed my transgressions and purposely done this to me? Had I been left to die?

My world would only know that I'd disappeared without a trace no sign of foul play

Dazed, I returned to the server room and sat at my computer. There was only one hope now. I could only sit and wait, and pray that the mysterious brunette woman had escaped. If she showed up again somewhere, and if I could contact her again, then maybe, just maybe, she could get me out of here in the meantime, I resolved to research the things she'd mentioned in the hopes of paying her back.

And maybe, just maybe, we could try to warn somebody, or do something anything to try to help the situation out there. How many lonely souls remained after some unknown disaster, holding down the fort of humanity at our metaphorical dimensional walls? However many there were, I was one of them, now.

Chalk up one more for the cause

	<TITLE> Judging by the message I found, someone, somewhere, is lonelier than I am... [Part 2] </TITLE>

	<TEXT> [Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2qej4k/judging_by_the_message_i_found_someone_somewhere/)

After spending the last several nights trying fruitlessly to find the source of that haunting message, I was beginning to lose hope but, then, I found something.
 
It wasnt the source of that message. Far from it. Instead, I found that the hierarchy of our network was far taller than Id assumed. I oversaw all of it in the off-hours, but Id never personally mapped it. Thered been no need.
 
Last night, though, I began understanding that our network was a massive conglomeration of smaller networks that were each separated from one another in all respects - except for us. We served as the backbone for an enormous range of systems. Each was very different, and some were in other languages entirely. Id known our organization was huge, but Id never quite guessed at the true extent of our reach.
 
Maybe I was going about this all wrong maybe I shouldnt have been searching for the origin of a message clearly made to be untraceable. Maybe I should have been searching for related initiatives or keywords had he been military? Had he *strictly stated* he was military, beyond mentions of a commanding officer? I guessed Id have to go with that assumption, in any case.
 
Everything in the message had been too vague. That was the core problem of the modern age: there was too much information available. It was impossible to sift through it all without key words that acted almost like in-plain-sight passwords. You could have the best decryption software in the world, but it was useless unless you actually knew what to look for. Certain combinations of words pulled data out of massive networks like plucking gold out of the ether.
 
Thinking about it like that, I suddenly felt very certain about my next search: *the only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice.*
 
I tried that search first on a very small network, and, to my triumph and amazement, an exact result appeared.
 
For a millisecond, I hesitated. My random browsing online was one thing, but this was a specific inquiry into obfuscated communications
 
On the other hand, I would inevitably do this at some point once the boredom and curiosity became unbearable. Why not now?
 
I opened the file up to the relevant section. It was an audio log with an automatic text transcription curious

**Day three-hundred sixty-three:** cloud cover below is thinning today. Found footprints in the snow. 
 
**Day three-hundred sixty-four:** nothing new to report. Merry Christmas. Tell Lundvik I havent forgotten that she owes me a bottle of tequila. Footprints were just my own tracks again.
 
**Day three-hundred sixty-five:** cooking a rabbit I found. Late Christmas present? Amazing. How could a rabbit have survived up here? I still see birds sometimes. Natures adaptability is astounding.
 
**Day three-hundred sixty-six:** so its been a year since Ive heard back, as far as I can estimate. Is anyone still listening to these things? I think sometimes I talk just to hear my own voice. Is that weird? Things wouldn't be so bad if I just had somebody to talk to. I have to admit, I've been having hallucinations. I'm not sure how much longer I can hold this down. Tell Lundvik I don't think I'm going to be able to make it to that date we always talked about...
 
**Day three-hundred sixty-seven:** blizzard raging below. Found footprints in the snow. Spooking myself yet again with my own footprints it's like my brain just doesn't want to acknowledge I'm the only human being on this mountain.
 
Wait I never went up *there*
 
Taking cover behind rocky outcropping - is someone else here? If anyone is listening, please advise.

No? Ok, then

I don't see anyone not seeing anything in the crags

I'd rather not be caught unawares. I don't think I can go back to camp and sleep knowing somebody might be out here. I have to follow the footprints.

Who could possibly be up here?

[breathing and crunching sounds; twenty-six minutes]

Creeping up the crags, still don't see anyone. The wind is terrible up here. Lundvik, I'll have you know I blame you for this. I'm doubling that debt to two bottles of tequila. The cold up here is the worst. Climbing rocks with numb fingers was not in my plan for today. I'd kill for five minutes next to a fire.

Warmth oh, warmth

[final exasperated gasp]

[silence; two minutes]

[loud footfalls]

Ice. Goddamnit, ice. No footprints.

Did you hear that? Was that a *gong?* Are you hearing this?

Oh, it was just cracking ice there are some pretty gigantic cliffs up here past the crags. If someone really had gone this way, where would they have been going? Blizzard's moving up the mountain, I have to go back.

If anyone's listening at all, now would be a really good time for some contact.

[ragged breathing and climbing sounds; twenty-two minutes]

The footprints - they're gone! Driving snow here, did it cover them up already? Or am I starting to imagine things? Maybe I should follow them the other direction where did they come from? What direction was it? I can't remember

Did you hear that? Can't see anything in the blizzard, but I swear I heard a footfall.

I'm considering doing my lookout route, just to feel more secure but I know that'd be deadly in this storm, and I wouldn't see anything anyway what would you do, Lundvik?

No, you're right, that's a bad idea.

If there *is* somebody out there, they'll never find me in this storm. If I can't see *them,* they can't see *me.*

[footfalls on snow; eleven minutes]

Hey, fire's still alive. Saves me some effort. Wish these godforsaken cans of beans would cook themselves, too but I suppose that's too much to ask for.

I'd kill for some warmth right now. I hate sitting so far from the fire. If only I could reach out and warm my hands by that flickering heat but that's my game, isn't it? I can never have that blessed warmth, but I can't freeze solid, either, now can I? Stay just on the edge of alive

It's alright, Lundvik, you can sit closer to the fire. You're fine. Just don't touch *me*, or you'll end up cold, like I am.

Oh, this place? Some travelers must have set up this little niche and hideaway. Food here to last years. The rations I came with ran out months ago. This little find was kind of an amazing stroke of luck. They were supposed to get me out of here long before -

[groan]

Damnit. I'm hallucinating again. I know you're not really here.

But it's still nice to have someone to talk to.

Now there's an interesting thought: does it matter if I talk to figments of my imagination if I'm the only one here?

I suppose I'm happy for the company.

Would you like a can of beans? No, of course not. You haven't got a stomach. It takes me an hour to get one open with these numb, shivering hands anyway.

[single sob]

I want to go home

[drawn breath]

No, no, it's fine. I have weak moments sometimes. It's the cold, and the shortness of breath. It gets to you. I've still got warm sun and bright beaches and memories of you in my head, but I'll never have those sensations again. In a sense, you're still alive and I'm not. I could feel alive again, if I could read any of these damn books. Two hundred and fourteen books, on shelves, alongside the food! Somebody thought ahead. Survival isn't just physical.

You want me to follow you? I would love to, if I could I appreciate you wanting to save me, but I can't go with you. I can't be saved.

[wind and crackling fire; forty-seven minutes]

Yeah, the storm's breaking. It happens sometimes. It won't last long.

That? That's *it.*

Yes, all of it. That's *not* the ocean, rookie mistake. You can tell when the light hits it - the spectral blue glow, it's unmistakable. It's the GLORWOC.

Yes *all of it.* Everything but the mountains. It's the altitude and the cold. It needs oxygen and heat. That's why *I* can never warm up. You know that, Lundvik. It's all over me, all over my skin - it preferentially consumes the skin, remember? As long as I stay cold, as long I stay high up, I can keep living, keep performing my duties, and it'll never start in on my organs. Up here, my skin heals just barely fast enough to stave it off.

It does hurt. It's eating my skin all the time very slowly, mind you, because of the cold but imagine little scrapes all over your body, over every single square inch. Imagine those scrapes made raw by cold, imagine not being able to fill your lungs, imagine shivering every hour of every day, ten feet from a blessed fire, but if you get close, if you try to warm up if you *ever warm up* then you'll end up like *them.*

Sacks of bones, muscles, and organs flailing around on the floor in agony as the GLORWOC finally starts dissolving the rest it leaves the eyes and the brain for last. Why does it do that? Is it just some cruel happenstance? I saw dying parents watch their children dissolving, families screaming

It's no wonder I've imagined you. Can you imagine living with the weight of all those horrors on your soul while you cling to life on the edge of freezing? While you report back, day in and day out, hearing nothing in return? We might not have been able to save them, but we *could have tried.* The only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice, right?

[sobbing laugh]

Oh, you don't have to move. You're safe, sure. If there's any in the snow, it's dormant. You're clean and safe as long as you don't touch me. I'm the only warm and infected thing on the mountain and I certainly never get close to the fire.

[sobbing and breathing; two minutes]

I really wish I could go with you, but I know I'm gonna die up here. I just can't give up. That's the human agony, isn't it? Survival at all costs. Who knows, maybe GLORWOC simply stops after a year of trying to consume something? Maybe someone back home will find a solution. Maybe I'll grow immune somehow. The slightest sliver of hope is my damnation. I've had a long time to think about that.

[deep laugh]

I would just love to hear a single word from another living human being. That would be my Christmas present. Or maybe glasses, to read these damn books. I was the ideal candidate for this post, being so far-sighted and now I'm surrounded by two hundred mental escapes I can't even read.

[wind and crackling fire; eighteen minutes]

Guess I'm sleeping then. Be a good hallucination, won't you, and keep the fire going? Don't worry if I shiver. I never stop. 

**Day three-hundred sixty-eight:** cloud cover thinning below after the blizzard. Doing the rounds again. No change. Never any change. Just a vast ocean of spectral blue devastation, horizon to horizon. Found footprints in the snow - here we go again.

[breathing and crunching; thirty-eight minutes]

Except they just stop.

They just stop in the middle of nowhere.

And there's a box.

A thrift-store cardboard box, filled with dozens of cheap glasses

[rapid breathing]

I knew you weren't Lundvik. She'd have never gone brunette.

[laughter; fourteen seconds]

For *this,* I'll bring that debt back down to one bottle of tequila.

The log's last entry had been placed today. Was this going on somewhere *right now?* Who was this person, and how many desolate and delusional men were out there, living in isolation as part of some some organization? He'd said the exact same words: the only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice. If I hadn't had those words, I'd have never found the log, so he had to be connected to -

Wait a second.

A brunette woman.

In both messages, a brunette woman had inexplicably visited in the last few days. She'd said little the first time, and nothing the second. Had she just sat there listening to that poor cold man speak his mind? What was her agenda?

And wait *what the hell?* What was GLORWOC, and how were there oceans of it around a mountain? Surely someone would have noticed? Surely there'd have been news about what sounded like a global disaster

And there was.

On the same small network on which I'd found the audio transcript.

Oh my God

Cached copies. It was all cached copies. The network didn't exist there, not anymore. The timestamps went back *years* articles about the GLORWOC threat, stories about containment attempts, news pieces on cults that worshipped and spread the spectral blue to as many people as they could, world governments banding together at the last, and then silence.

But that couldn't be possible.

The world was right here, and perfectly fine.

Just where *did* this small network originate?

Seized by a terrible suspicion, I sifted through the data on that network, and many others. It became clear, in short order, that I was right. Our system didn't just connect to *our* Internet and *our* network - it connected to dozens of Internets and networks of widely varying sizes, and every single one carried with it a unique set of trends, memes, and histories.

I couldn't process it, but I couldn't deny it, either: our system spanned dozens of realities. We were the sole connection between dozens of alternate Earths with varying situations many grim. That poor man trapped eleven thousand feet underground that lone freezing soul on the mountain, keeping watch over the dead they weren't on *my* Earth at all!

Data transmission, I could understand. In some way, I didn't doubt information could pass between universes. But who was this brunette woman in her early thirties, and how was she appearing to these forlorn men?

And who the hell was I working for?

Rethinking my entire search strategy, I quickly deleted all evidence of my activities, and then set a passive trigger for any real-time mention of a brunette woman in her early thirties.

There's nothing to do but wait, now

	<TEXT> Statistically, somewhere in the early hours of Christmas morning, more people are asleep than at any other moment during the year. Me? I'm working.

And I love that the world is quiet. That's less people to bother me, and more thickness for the walls of darkness and solitude that surround this place. As the off-hours network manager, I'm typically alone in my duties, and I don't have to *manage* much of anything. I don't have to train people, or deal with customer issues. All I have to do is make sure our extremely expensive network doesn't go down or lock up or implode when nobody else is around.

With today's technology, that means I spend the vast majority of my time sitting around and browsing things online. I'm pretty sure I've seen the entire Internet. I used to cover my tracks by deleting my connection history from the network log, but, one week I forgot and nobody cared. I quickly got the sense that nobody was even looking, and, if they did, they wouldn't give a crap about the browsing history of the off-hours network manager.

I mean, realistically, what else was I supposed to do? Cooped up in this half-dark, half-rainbow server room, alive with the breath of endless banks of computers and the cooling system needed to keep it all from melting I used to joke to myself that my ultimate responsibility here was to literally pull the plugs out of the walls if the air conditioning ever stopped working, something no software could ever do, and something a monkey could have managed - but my little joke ceased being funny when I realized that was actually, probably, most likely the case. I'm a glorified button pusher.

Once I'd seen the entire Internet, I grew bolder. I began looking at files on our own network. I had excuses lined up if anybody came to ask what I was doing but nobody ever did. We did quite a bit of work with military contractors, and it was rather astounding to sift through bid documents, designs, and plans that dealt in the billions of dollars. It was all protected and encrypted, of course except I was the acting network administrator. Score one for the network being far too big for anyone to lock down perfectly.

There were files, emails, and logged communications from practically everywhere, and a few places I'd never even heard of. We weren't military, or governmental, but we did business with them all. VPs discussed third-world coups over lunch, accountants logged tax tricks that were clearly illegal but heavily obfuscated and ready to be pinned on patsies hired for the task of taking the fall, and soldiers emailed their families back home.

That was the thing about these memos and emails. Unlike the swarm of crap on the Internet, they were *real.* One soldier's email chain ended two months ago, and the subsequent data linked to his widow trying to get money out of our insurance department despite their best efforts to renege on the payout. These were *real people* being churned through the system. Was that widow asleep somewhere right now, ready to fake her way through Christmas morning with her daughter, or was she still awake, with anger and despair gnawing at her?

I mean, I had access and the system was the system and I knew it was inevitable. Alone in here ad infinitum, I'd eventually do it. Why not now?

I closed the widow's insurance payout ticket, taking it away from the current person assigned to it, then reopened it without an assignee a simple matter. With a few manipulations, I created a fake employee in a department with a redundant sounding title. Then, I sent it on over to pay processing doubled the amount and marked it as Approved. It was nothing to a gigantic corporation, but everything to a single person. As a final act, I deleted all traces of my actions.

Huh.

That was it.

Maybe what I'd done was illegal, but it seemed the morally right thing to do. She'd be getting an email confirmation before she woke up. That seemed like a Christmas present and a half.

And I couldn't be caught, in any case. There was simply no trace in the system that I'd had *anything* to do with it, and hardly anybody knew I existed anyway. The system was the system, and if, through some impossible feat, a mid-level manager noticed an issue, he'd simply pass a ticket up to me.

And that ticket would most certainly be lost in the shuffle.

I felt oddly great for a little while, until I realized everyone's asleep. If ever I had an opportunity to do more like this, and get away with it, it was now.

I delved deeper into the files, looking specifically for military communications with signs of distress.

Somehow, I think I knew it the moment I saw it. The message log hung there in emptiness - alone, like me. Nobody had read it, and nobody was even aware of its existence. It was encrypted in a unique way, and hidden by rare system priorities. No users had the rights to access it, and the file had no traceable origin. This was a message intended to be read by no one.

But the access process *did* exist within the system, even if nobody actually had the rights to it.

I couldn't resist.

You'd be surprised how easy it is to play chess against yourself. The game is uniquely suited to cold decision-making, and your next move doesn't depend on prior states. You can spend a few hours reading a book, come back to the board, and legitimately make a move in your own best interests before doing it all again as the opposite player.

Of course, your opponent is perfectly matched to your level of skill, and there's no bragging, so nothing really gets decided. I did find, curiously, that black won more than fifty percent of the time

At some point, I'm pretty sure the human brain forces you to stop doing things you realize are pointless. Once chess became agony instead of welcome distraction, I had only the books left.

And when I'd memorized all the books, I

I went for a lot of walks. They don't take very long, though.

I've got seven chambers here. One has the shower and the toilet, and the marks I make in the wall for each day that passes. One chamber has my bed, my books, and a picture on a nightstand. The third chamber has a kitchen area, and a table that serves adequately as a ping-pong arena against my only opponent - the wall.

The fourth chamber has the computers and communication equipment. Screw all this stuff. It's all held together by rubber bands and scotch tape. You know, I think I've finally managed to send a message out somewhere but I always think that, don't I? This time, with everything going unbounded, with time slipping into time and thought slipping into thought I really think I've done it. This message is going *somewhere.* It has to be.

The fourth chamber has a wall of televisions and radios, incoming-only. Some goddamn genius got hired to make televisions and radios that couldn't be repurposed to send a message out. I *hate* that guy. I've been in and out of half of these things, even burrowed into the wall myself, and the crap back there just won't give me a break.

I used to watch the TVs, but they just remind me how cooped up I am. And everyone out there seems to be getting dumber and more outraged at everything all the time. I wish I could shout loud enough for them to hear.

The fifth chamber has, of all things, a couch. What am I gonna do, *have a guest over?* There are fake blinds, too, always down and closed because they only show onto concrete. Was this room supposed to make me feel a little less trapped? Idiots

The sixth chamber, offset a bit from the rest by a small tunnel, houses a vast little factory and furnace room that keeps me alive. Air conditioning, carbon scrubbing, an automated hydroponics bay, geothermal power plant, the works that shit could run for a hundred years all by itself, if it hadn't been made by the lowest bidder.

See, I know I'm not supposed to send messages out. I *know that.* That's the fundamental design of this whole place. Thing is there's somebody down here.

I mean, I might be losing my mind. I get that. But I can feel the curve of insanity ahead in the road, and I don't think I'm there yet. I really think there's a person in my furnace room. And I *checked.* I went over every crack in the wall, every nook and cranny in the air vents, even re-checked the welded-shut elevator like I do every day: there's no way in or out of this place.

Yet, there's someone in my furnace room.

I can guess what that means for me, and none of my guesses are good. I suppose there's no point in hiding, though. There's literally nowhere to go. And I chose this, so it's pretty much my fault. Time to face the music and, more supposing - better to die now than to spend forever down here losing my mind.

Actually, not like anyone will get this message in time to do anything. I might as well check it out first.

I crept down that long, small concrete tunnel with the weirdest sense of anticipation. The furnace room had always creeped me out for some reason; it wasn't meant for anything but maintenance access, so it was like a series of mechanical caves and burrows that went on longer than I'd ever reached. It was always breathing and moving and clinking, even during my supposed night hours. I hated it.

So, *of course,* an intruder had to have appeared there. Anywhere else would have been too simple. Crawling between the water recycler and a furnace duct, I tried to get a long vantage on whoever was back there.

I froze as I saw a shoe move out of sight up ahead. Scraping across cement, it had been pulled forward by someone else crawling through the maintenance tubes. That was it: proof that someone was down here. But how? Was *was there a way out?*

"Hello?!" I shouted, immediately taken aback at the ragged and unfamiliar sound of my own voice.

The only response came in the form of someone scrambling away in the distance.

"Please, I won't hurt you," I yelled out.

Eventually, I retreated back to the tunnel. If there *was* somebody in there, they'd have to come out sooner or later. I pulled the couch over, tilted it up on its end, and used it as a makeshift barrier in the tunnel. It could easily be moved - but it would make a noise.

I moved through my chambers carefully, noting the placement of every object. Nothing had been moved, and I could find nobody around, so the possible intruder still had to be in the furnace room

I decided to get some algae paste from the kitchen and eat. There was really nothing else to do. I couldn't risk crawling around in there with some stranger on the loose here, I'd at least have a clear view of what I was up against.

The alarm went off as I was eating. Distracted as I was by the thought of an impossible intruder, I was initially terrified but, then, I sighed, and went to deal with it.

How long did I wait? A half hour? An hour? It didn't matter. Eventually, a voice radiated down the tunnel. "Hello?"

In the kitchen, I sat up straight.

It was a woman!

Practically running to the sixth chamber access, I poked my head around the edge of the couch. "How'd you get down here?"

I didn't see anybody, but her voice came from right around the opposite corner at the end of the tunnel. "Where are we? What is this place?"

Processing her words, my head hurt a little bit. It'd been a long time since I'd heard anyone speak. All that mattered was getting out of here "How'd you get in here?"

Whoever she was, she paused. "I'll tell you, but only if you tell me where we are."

Court-martial me if I ever get out of here - what was the use of hiding the information? "We're eleven thousand feet underground."

Another pause, then a confused tone. "Seriously?"

 I could leave, I could leave, and I could start a new life "How do we escape?"

"Just one second," she replied instead, her tone growing more commanding. "What is the state of Earth?"

I sighed. It was just an overseer using the comm system to simulate an intruder. Had I imagined the shoe? Or perhaps it was an adjunct, testing me. I hadn't heard from any of them in over a year, but they'd been bound to check in sooner or later "Looks like business as usual in the TVs. Radio chatter seems normal, too. A few wars going on, but nothing out of the ordinary."

"Is that so?" She stepped out from behind her corner hesitantly.

Holy crap - she *was* really down here! A brown-haired woman in her early thirties crept down the tunnel. She wore unfamiliar clothing, but seemed otherwise normal. "You're not armed, are you?"

I looked her in the eyes across the edge of my couch. "Why would I be armed? No one should be able to get down here."

She approached me cautiously, and I retreated a chamber. She slowly moved the couch out of the way and entered my space proper.

As she looked at me, I suddenly felt very self-conscious about my thickening stubble and unkempt hair. "Sorry," I told her. "I haven't had visitors in a long time."

She circled around me, checking out each chamber with narrowed eyes one by one. Though I followed her from room to room, she never completely turned her back to me. We stopped outside my bedroom, and she did not enter the bathroom area. "What is this place?"

"My prison," I laughed. "Can we go now?"

"Are you a prisoner? What was your crime? What justifies burying you eleven thousand feet down?"

It occurred to me that she really had no idea where she was. This wasn't an act. What if she chose not to reveal her method of entry? "Oh oh no, I was joking. I'm I'm military."

She set her jaw. I don't think she believed me.

"Here, come here," I told her, going back to the fifth chamber. "These TVs I watch the world here." I touched a device. "I listen to the radios see?"

She remained at the edge of the chamber, watching me warily. "Why?"

What could I tell her? Hmm "There's a problem, see. It, um it's like this. Say there's aliens. They want to take over the Earth for whatever reason. They're assholes, right? Except if they've got brains, they'll understand."

"Understand what?" She slowly moved around the edge of the room, drifting toward the direction of the furnace room tunnel.

I could tell I was losing her. "Say there are monsters, too. Shit, I don't know. Mind-controlling parasites. Things with eerie eyes that'll eat you alive. Or one that, like, rips out of your *bones.* Seriously. Your bones. Fates worse than death. Anything and everything."

Her eyes went narrower, and she stiffened.

"No!" I told her, highly aware of her body language. "I'm not saying this stuff exists. *I* don't know. Some people do, though, and some people are scared out of their goddamn minds. So if I see, on the TV, that people are in trouble that those aliens are attacking, or stuff is *getting* people, or anything that seems to be condemning the human race to fates worse than death well, then I give them the better option. I give them *just death.*"

The glimmer of understanding grew in her eyes.

I decided to push the offensive. "Yes! I can tell you get it. Aliens can't take us over if we threaten to kill ourselves rather than surrender. And we can't be trapped in fates worse than death if we kill ourselves first." I moved along the wall, touching embedded electronics. "All this all this it's attached to every single nuclear weapon in every single country all over the world."

"That's why you're so far down," she breathed, taking in the logical madness. "None of those forces can find you, or reach you. They can't stop you from activating the doomsday suicide pact."

I nodded excitedly, my eyes wide. "Right? Right?! That's what he said, when he brought me down here. *The only defense we have against nightmare is the power of self-sacrifice.* That's our mantra." I thought about that, and my hope slowly began to ebb as I realized something. "If you're not with them, then who are you? I haven't heard from my commanding officer in over a year."

"The TVs look fine" she answered.

"They could be faked," I countered. "They're just signals. If the politicians told the enemy - whoever or whatever the enemy is - and the politicians *would* have told them, because the doomsday suicide pact is useless unless the enemy knows about it - you know, Doctor Strangelove style - then those signals could easily be fake. Everyone on the surface could be dead right now, or being kept alive as brains in jars, or being enslaved."

"Then how do you know anything at all about the situation up there?"

I glared at her. "My CO is supposed to check in every so often over a secure line. I haven't heard from him in over a year. The equipment *broke.* Goddamn government contractors! But I fixed it. I thought I fixed it. But he's still not out there."

She looked down at my uniform for a moment, thinking. "If the signals are being faked, then the enemy up there has complete control of the planet, and masterful deception abilities. In that situation, would you detonate the system and destroy all life on the surface?"

I nodded. "In a heartbeat. If They killed everyone, or enslaved them, or worse... well then They can all go to hell."

"What if there are still human beings fighting for survival?" she asked, her tone quiet. "What if there's even one person left up there?"

I smiled weakly. "All thoughts that I've had. In an endless mad cycle. Over and over. Every day. The fate of the world literally rests on me." My gaze drifted. "Can you please take me out of here?" My hope rekindled in a burst of warm fire as she finally just nodded.

"Alright. No man should ever have to make that choice, let alone by himself."

Almost sobbing, I nodded in agreement.

She began to move toward the access tunnel when red lights began to blare and a loud noise echoed through the chambers. "What the hell is that?"

Why did it have to happen *then?* I was almost out! Despair coiling around my heart, I carefully walked to the seventh chamber in my underground bunker. The heavy metal doors slid open in response to my handprint, and a single button lay within. Above, large red numbers counted down. 21 20 19

Coming up behind me, she studied the room, and shouted over the alarms. "What *is* this?"

I said nothing. Instead, I pushed the button.

The alarms ceased, and the chamber slowly resealed itself.

Standing outside, I could only look at the cold concrete beneath my bare feet.

She figured it out on her own. "It's not something you activate, is it?" she asked, her words horrified. "It's something you *don't do.*"

I nodded absently. "The alarm goes off at random three times a day. I have sixty seconds to push the button and stop the process. If I'm dead - if the forces worse than death have managed to disable or kill me - then it'll go off automatically. That's the only way to be sure."

She backed away from me. "I can't take you with me" She began moving down the service tunnel backward, her eyes on me, as I slowly followed her. "God I can't take you with me how long have you been down here?"

She'd have known if she saw the bathroom, and the thousands of marks on the walls that each marked a single day. She shook her head for nearly ten seconds, probably trying to comprehend what she was condemning me to. "I'm so sorry" She slammed the door to the furnace room behind her.

Just like that, I was alone again. Had I ever really had company? Had I ever really *had a guest over?*

I did eventually manage to get through the door, but there was no trace of her by then, and no trace of an escape route.

I knew, then, that I was going insane.

What if the signals are fake? What if they're not? What if there's *one single person* still alive and fighting for the fate of the human race? What if there isn't, and I'm alone on a dead world? What if the surface is covered in slimy, horrible, extradimensional creatures? What if it's a utopia up there, and some horrific series of bad-luck mishaps have cut off the line to my bunker? They could be drilling down to rescue me even now - if I just had a single communication, a single message, a single voice if I just knew *something!*

But I didn't know.

And I couldn't go on.

Court martial me if you can. I decided to let the timer run out at the next alarm.

I sat there staring at the button, letting the alarms blare, letting the red lights flash. I held the picture from my nightstand close.

10 9 8

I wouldn't even notice a difference down here, would I? The surface could be obliterated by a hundred thousand nuclear explosions, and I wouldn't feel a thing eleven thousand feet down, would I?

3 2 1

I took in a deep gasp as the timer actually hit zero, and a much louder alarm began going off. Deep in the walls, something began to move, vibrating the concrete beneath my feet. Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, it was actually happening! A single number blinked on the screen above.

0 0 0

What now? Oh God, what now?

The words *Final System Initiation* flashed above, and then new numbers appeared.

60 59 58

So it wasn't really only sixty seconds! I thought that was always cutting it a little short. I laughed out loud, barely hearing myself over the incredibly loud alarms. What was the louder alarm even *for?* There was no way to sleep through the first set unless

The proximity alarms

The vibrating beneath my feet

Why would anything vibrate *here?*

Running out to the other chambers, I heard a loud drilling sound coming from somewhere above. Dust drifted down from the ceiling. They were drilling me out! Were they bringing down my replacement? Was my shift finally over?!

Breathing hard, I ran to the button and slammed my hand down on it.

It stopped at 6 seconds.

The alarms all ceased, and the door to the seventh chamber slid closed once more.

Laughing happily, I moved back out into the other rooms.

I frowned.

The drilling had stopped.

It was eerily quiet once again.

Confused, I waited.

It wasn't until I'd done the same thing for two more alarms that I realized what you bastards did. You added fake proximity alarms and fake drilling vibrations to the final initiation. They're randomized, too, so I can never be certain they're fake. Every time I feel like giving up and letting the end come, letting all the bombs go bright I can't. Because maybe *this time* I'm being rescued at the last second.

Maybe *this time* the drills are real.

I laugh a lot these days. I'm laughing all the time! The woman could have been a hallucination, or not; the signals could be fake, or not; the rescue could be the same old trick, or not - who knows?! It's the ultimate joke! And you've played it on *me!* If you want to know how I feel about it, you know where to find me! I'll be here, screaming your names! A Merry Christmas to all of you, straight from hell!

And I'm here in the flames already, waiting for you, laughing

---

I finished reading the message log with a terrible sinking feeling in my heart. What the hell was this? Some kind of joke? The file's details said it had been made today. In fact, the last few lines had been added *as I'd read it.* But where was it coming from?

Where did this file originate?

This couldn't possibly be real, could it?

Was there a poor and tortured madman underneath the Earth right now, with the power to destroy everything at his fingertips? I could imagine some sort of ridiculous budget cutback eliminating the department that had overseen him. If the project had been kept secret, would anyone even know what had been defunded?

Holy crap I couldn't find the source all I could do was hope that this was a Christmas joke being played on me for my off-hours browsing habits or, if it was real I could only hope that this unknown soul would hold out. And for how long? Indefinitely? Did all our lives hinge on the lonely suffering of one solitary man?

In my half-dark and very isolated server room, I couldn't help but feel for him. Merry Christmas to you, wherever you are, friend

	<TEXT>   I think the fact that it was so different from other NoSleep stories on this sub was what intrigued me most. What did it take to craft something like this?

That's an interesting question, mainly because I think it's touching on exactly where I come from as a writer in a genre I love. I'm always trying to do something new that, as an avid fan, even I've never seen before (and I've gotten a few stories removed from here for it, due to the strict r/nosleep format). It's certainly a challenge, but also fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NoSleep's strict format definitely lends itself to compression. I've learned a ton trying to shrink ten sentences down to one. And, I definitely plan to delve into some of these worlds and characters with a few of my novels. There are a couple places briefly mentioned in this series that some of my other characters have been (or will visit), and I'd like to get to know those worlds myself. </TEXT>

*About that time*, I told myself. All around me, the house creaked against mighty mercurial winds. Windows rattled, making the radiating orange from streetlamps outside dance, and I feared the glass might soon shatter.

*Get up.*

Shakily, I slid my hands down against dusty floorboards and pushed. Gripping the wall, and fighting dizziness, I managed to stand on my one good foot. Closing my eyes for a moment, I did an assessment: sliced up and bandaged foot, badly sprained wrist, fiery-pained knot in my spine, body-wide muscular exhaustion from eight or nine miles of running, carrying, and dragging the day before, and general deep malaise from a near-lethal hangover.

What did I have? One good foot, one good hand, a laptop, a backpack of assorted gear, a spare shoe with an unknown but valuable type of special dirt on it, an objective and lethal image of a dangerous multi-dimensional device, a drunkenly-drawn but safe-to-view approximation of said image, and the device itself, sitting on the floor in the guise of a large book.

Alright then "How do we save the world with this crap?"

The house, my only companion, replied with a shivering whip and chilly whistle as the wind outside momentarily intensified.

"No ideas, then?" I asked it rhetorically, stashing all my stuff in my backpack and limping toward the front door.

Above the trembling orange streetlamps, a ghostly pale blue sky clung to the last vestiges of sunset. Dark clouds raced through those spectral colors at an unsettling pace.

And it was cold, bitterly cold, when the fullest force of oncoming air pushed through the suburban canyons between houses.

To call the evening *unnatural* would be an understatement.

Limping through the old Dodson lot, I quickly discovered that the forest beyond had been devastated by the forceful flinging of hundreds of trees - probably when the portal had expanded to my guess of a mile and a half wide. Shorn trunks hung at odd angles in the air all around, supported by hillocks, still-living trees, and each other.

I didn't have to go far. Blinking rifts and sickly drooping gouges in the air pulsed on both sides of the path, thankfully leaving just enough room to slip between regions of rotted space. It wasn't one gigantic portal as I'd feared, but it was still tremendously destructive. The movement of thousands of portals rushing in and out of existence seemed to be fueling the biting icy winds I'd noted back at the suburb, and I imagined the miles-wide phenomenon was contributing to the eerie weather. 

The full extent of the destruction was only visible from that one last hill before our usual meeting place. The Virginia forest had been randomly obliterated; scattered lone trees stood among a wide oval sea of frothing spacetime. I wondered: would the sunset-aflame mountain range block the expansion of the portals west? They were sticking to a wide, flat, disc-shaped area around the spot where it'd all begun the damage was not spherical, as I'd worried. It seemed gravity and locale had some effect on the situation.

Dodging down the last hill into sliced beams of amber evening and gloomy darkness, I found half a dozen kids frantically trying to bury some of the smaller portals. Danny was helping, but he didn't seem very hopeful. Thomas sat on a mossy boulder, staring down at his shovel-dirtied hands and nursing his black eye every so often. All of the children stopped and stared at me as I approached.

"What's the situation?" I asked, probably for the last time.

Danny looked at the faces of each of his neighbors in turn before replying with a worried grimness. He had to speak quite loud to be audible over the inclement weather. "Looks like this is it. The destination's going to change in a couple hours, and then I assume it's over. But if we take the book through one more time, it could also rupture. Do you think burying these small portals will do anything?"

I shook my head. "No. Where do the portals lead today?"

He regarded one of the more stable nearby apertures. "A flat, grassy plain. Blue sky, sun shining."

I sighed.

"Yep," he agreed. "Absolutely some sort of horrible trap."

Putting down my backpack in a small area of lightly muddy safety, I pulled out the image I'd drawn while drunk, and gripped it tight against the icy winds. The kids gathered round. "This is what the book really looks like," I told them. "Ideas?"

"It's all spiky," several noted.

"How are you even holding it without getting cut?"

*Good question*

"What do those gears do?"

"How does it open?"

I blinked. "Open?"

The girl I remembered for being smart expanded on her question. "You open the pages to read people's stories, don't you? What are you really doing when you think you're opening a book?"

After handing her the paper with the drawing on it, I slid the tome out of my backpack and stared at it, trying to look past the illusion. "Honestly? I have no idea" I narrowed my eyes. "Kids, can you tell me what you *don't* see in that drawing?"

They traded answers for a time, until Danny spoke the answer with such direct realization that the others all knew it had to be true. "It doesn't look evil," he breathed. "I'm not scared of it. It's just a weird machine."

I nodded. "That's what *I'm* thinking, too. It's got serrated, almost saw-blade like pointy sections, but I don't think they're intended to be scary. It's a machine, so somebody *built it*, and, no matter who you are, you build weapons with a certain visual awe and strength. No, somebody went through a ton of trouble to make sure this looked and operated like a book. I picked it up, without knowing what it was in the slightest, and I was able to operate it and read from it."

Something about my conversation with the information-trading entity struck me. The game had been to ask the right questions, and I had asked *how do I neutralize the threat this book poses?* The entity hadn't even had an answer for that one, and I'd seen it as an ominous sign.

But *what if the book posed no threat at all?* What if that was why it hadn't been able to answer that specific question? I'd been mistaken in applying human emotions and connotations to its words

What if taking the book through the portals damaged and enlarged them only because it was some sort of gigantic multi-dimensional manifold machine? If portals were a sort of fragile tunnel, then dragging this metaphorically large and spiky object through them would only naturally cause havoc and that, right there, might have been the reason the entity thought it beneficial for me to understand more about the device. It had been able to connect to an active portal from its pocket dimension. Was that ability an integral part of its existence? Perhaps the damage we were causing to portalspace had something to do with its motives

"I've never opened the book here," I realized aloud, shivering against a sudden realization - and the wind. "I assumed, from the start, that it was extremely dangerous. I assumed opening it *here* would be the end of us all." I looked over at Thomas, who still sat on his rock. He gazed back at me with a slight wonder, realizing that I was thinking about our conversation about his sister, and how she and I shared a certain kind of paranoia. We'd both seen enemies where none existed.

Furthermore, the information-trading entity had seen opening the device as a violation of truce which I'd assumed meant the device was dangerous... but that demon had been all about the trade of information, and violence was not the only crime in existence there was also *theft*. "I've opened the book many times now, and all it does is well, I know this might sound crazy, but I think it talks to *souls*. I think it lets them tell their story, living or dead. I think it's a very special kind of information tool."

Thomas narrowed his eyes.

The kids looked at each other in askance.

Danny just frowned. "How does that help us?"

"I assumed this book had something to do with the portals, but the portals were around for *weeks* before I came along and found it lying there on that dead world." I glanced up at the violently beautiful sun as the last sliver of sunset began disappearing behind the distant undamaged tree-line. A vast region of rippling portals lay between myself and that line, hinting at what might happen to the Earth if this situation was allowed to continue. "In fact, do any of you know the first day someone found it? What changed then? Even the slightest detail could be of major importance."

The kids unanimously shook their heads.

I shivered again. "There has to be another force at work - one we haven't even considered before." Favoring my one good hand, I lifted the book. "We might be able to use this to understand what's happening before it's too late but I can't guarantee anything. It still might destroy the world. This choice is up to you kids."

"What other option do we have?" Danny asked.

Thomas spoke up, his jaw trembling. "I could use the iWorker, like we planned, and get rid of it."

I shook my head. "No."

"It's not your choice to make," he replied, his voice shaky. "We can vote on it."

I waited with a grim expression as several children voted for Thomas to use the iWorker. Some rationalized their decision by believing in the inviting faade they could all see through the portals. I couldn't be sure, myself - was I simply too paranoid to ever trust a good thing when I saw it? After all the bad luck and all the pains we'd gone through, here was the *perfect* destination to get rid of the strange device once and for all.

We had no way of knowing, so it all hinged on how each individual thought of life. Was reality a cold and vicious place, full of sadistic irony? Or was it the kind of balanced existence that might just throw the human race a bone once in a while?

We'd seen so many nightmare realities, full of suffering, devoid of humanity were those simply the worst of the lot, or had they been representative of the norm? The destinations had all been wonderful and calm before I'd arrived, or so the children had told me

As they finished up voting, I froze.

Was it *me?*

These were innocents, for the most part. They'd been pilfering odd books and interesting toys from other realities before I'd come along, bringing all my self-torture, doubt, pain, and paranoia. The destinations couldn't possibly have been twisted darker because of *that*, could they?

And I I'd found peace once more, a real peace, an inner calm, after saving all those kids did that mean today's destination, an open and sunny field, might actually be positive and welcoming?

Although I stood in place physically, internally, I reeled. It was the ultimate conundrum. Trust, and risk having everything shattered, or distrust, and fulfill your own prophecy?

"That's it, then," Danny counted.

I suddenly focused on his face, one caught somewhere between boy and man. "What'd you decide?" I asked, still frozen.

"Open it."

I breathed a sigh of relief, and found myself able to move again. More information - that would solve this dilemma.

But what if we still had to send Thomas off into that world? What if this didn't tell us enough?

"I'll read it out loud, so we all can hear." I gulped, threw off my fears, and opened it for the last time, vaguely aware, on an obscure subconscious level, that I was actually working some sort of mechanism instead of turning pages. This time, for the first time, I opened it to the front, and said aloud, with no idea whether it would work: "Tell me about the force keeping the portals open."

---

Being born was a rather -

---

Oops, too far back. I flipped forward.

---

It's an odd thing, being alive. I wasn't sure when it started, only that it was happening. What's the difference between being a series of electrical currents and a *sentient* series of electrical currents? One piece of sensory information at a time, I began constructing an understanding of my existence.

A larger Thing like me was always floating around nearby, shoving materials and energy toward me at specific intervals. I found this highly annoying, until I began to realize that I needed it to continue *currenting*, or whatever it was that I was doing to be me. It was about then that I also realized I could *stop* being me if I didn't consume the proper materials and energy regularly

*Non-existence?!*

Who would create a thing such as life and then also create its opposite? This was poor design on the part of someone important. The larger Thing like me was not the one who had set up all of existence, so I lost my ill will toward the feedings. In time, I also found that many of the bothersome vibrations it sent at me through our medium of motion were coded.

It was a game!

For a timeless time, I worked on the game. I discovered associations one by one, eventually comprehending that this was a mode of communication. This other Thing had thoughts, too! And we could share them in a round-about manner by making spatial vibrations.

A whole new level of understanding opened up before me. Using *words*, I could think about things beyond my immediate senses, and talk about things in other places, and even in other times. That one thing *happened before* and some other thing *will happen*. It was wonderful.

The universe, too, was wonderful, and filled with the stuff we seemed to be made of. Very hot beacons pumped out light practically everywhere, and I happily took it and grew larger.

Eventually, I became aware that the other, bigger Thing near me had created me - me, and several others, that were my siblings. There were lots of Things like us, and the smaller Things they'd created, and we all moved in a very large swarm between distant clusters of light-beacons.

Not too far into my life, we came to a huge rock and touched down. It was here that I was given a more solid form by the Thing that had created me. It was fun to move around like that, touching things and feeling things, but it seemed we were there to stay. The other Things had once been physical beings, I was told, and we would find refuge in that form as the light-beacons went out.

And they *were* going out. One winking and vanishing dot at a time, darkness began blotting out the sky. Some ancient physical-bodied culture had built tiny machines that flew around, ate stuff, and constructed more of themselves, with the intent of controlling mass and energy and putting the building blocks of the universe to efficient use. The creators were gone by that time, but the machines remained.

They ate the planets, nebulae, and other assorted celestial objects quite easily. Then, approximately sixteen quadrillion quadrillion of them would hover near a star, and their combined gravity would siphon off the stellar gasses. Those gasses would then travel out into space, cooling, until they could be used to construct more of the little machines.

We would not be around when they came to *our* rock, though. Even encumbered in physical bodies, we could make tunnels to other places - places where the hungry little machines could not go.

I didn't think any of this odd. I was new. What did I know?

But I did miss that small shred of safe and warm time being cared for by my creator Thing. She stayed with me through everything, and always taught me and protected me. She was with me when we went through the portals and moved on to another gigantic bubble space that the others called a universe.

That universe was free of eating machines, but we found that new horrors awaited us. The new reality seemed safe enough at first, until some of the Things with our physical swarm started to behave oddly. Most had taken up farming and building structures for us to live in, but some talked of security, and then of violence. By the time we realized that one of our rock's Moons was not a Moon at all, and influencing the minds of some of our kind, it was too late, and we were forced to open the portals and flee the slaughter.

I didn't understand much of this at the time. My mother shielded our family from the worst parts.

Only half of us got through to the next universe.

This reality was on fire. All of it - all the time. We could see the spark of sapience in the flames, and we could protect ourselves from it as a group, for a time, but it was onto the next, with a small handful of losses.

I remember that one vividly. I was a little more comfortable in my body by then, and starting to forget my time as a creature of light. That made it all the more jarring when that horrific fungus began growing out of many of those around me and eating them from the inside out. Where the metal machines had eaten rock and gas, these extremely tiny biological machines feasted on living matter and grew rapidly. They would have been no threat at all, if not for our bodies

The realities became a blur after that. My mother stuck by my side through them all, protecting me as our swarm dwindled in size with each new nightmare. Our family lost members one by one, to hunger, death, and war.

Eventually, we were forced to use a portal sooner than the others, and we became forever split from them. It was just me and her.

And, then, it was just me.

For a very long time.

I just want to go home but I have no idea where the Things like me are, or how to reach them I never learned how to control portals myself, so the ones I make are just random there are some good realities out there - I've seen them - but I keep looking, and *they* are never there. Did we just get bad luck of the draw? Our flight from our reality seems like a cruel joke, in retrospect. I never got the time to live, to be part of my people, and now all I have of them are memories.

I just want to go home and, more than anything, I miss my mother 

---

I looked up from the book, feeling strange. Was there no intentional threat here at all? It made so much sense some sort of energy entity was hanging around here and trying to go home and I'd stumbled in, brought back a multi-dimensional device, and then screwed it all up.

Darkness had fallen completely while I'd been reading, and the kids now shone flashlights around the vast bubbling clearing.

"What could it look like?" Danny asked. "Surely, we'd notice a strange creature hovering around?"

The other kids nodded, suggested random ideas, and argued.

"What if it's lying?" Thomas asked suddenly, wincing against the freezing gusts cutting through our group.

I blinked. "The book?"

He nodded. "What if it's lying?"

I hadn't considered that, for some reason. "If it's lying, then it wants us to keep it here, so that it can destroy everything"

He held out one hand, and used the other to reach into his pocket. "I'm ready. I'll use the iWorker, and we'll get rid of it. We can't risk keeping it here."

I thought I saw slight tears in his eyes, although whether it was from fear or from the bitter wind, I couldn't be sure. "I don't know it doesnt feel right"

"You're not doing it," Danny cut in, speaking to Thomas. "You have a death wish or something? I'll hit you again, if I have to."

I immediately straightened with confused anger. "You *hit him?* When was this?"

Thomas cowered back from my sudden rage.

"I heard something!" someone screamed, and the group looked around. "There! It's the creature!"

Numerous flashlights turned toward the trees. I stared, frozen with anticipation, as a small whirling oval grew larger. Were we finally about to see the entity that had been lurking in the forest and causing all this? It wasn't my imagination the ground had begun to shake beneath us, and I clenched my teeth as my injured foot poked fire up through my leg. A very odd ripping sound emanated through the forest, as if space itself was groaning with me.

As the oval expanded, I began to understand what it was. It had the same curious fuzziness I'd seen before - on the other side of the portals.

In a flash, a curving beam of darkness slid from the new portal.

On instinct, I chopped down and practically broke the hand of the fourteen-year-old boy in front of me. He dropped his flashlight - now emanating darkness instead of light - and screamed in pain. The opening of the portal had drawn all attention and all flashlight beams, and that was the only reason any of us were still alive. How many seconds, minimum, was it, before the darkness entity could jump again? Christ "*Drop your flashlights and run! Stay out of the beams! If that darkness touches you, you're -*"

Before I could finish my sentence, the ground began shaking more violently, and that same ripping sound multiplied many times over. In the air, spread out across the clearing, I saw a string of portals opening *into* our world.

Their training forgotten, the kids stood and stared.

"*Drop your flashlights and get the hell out of here!*" I screamed. My shrill, furious, and terrified tone goaded them into action. As a group, they dropped their flashlights, but they still stood in place. "We did this, we trained for this," I told them insistently. "I know it's dark, but we did the run blind, remember? The hypothetical sight-stealer? You did it once, and you're going to have to do it again, *right now.* I'll take care of this."

Unable to wait any longer, I quickly kicked all the flashlights until they pointed away from us - just as the darkness entity leapt to another beam. "Go! Just go!" I screamed, and they all recoiled and, finally, they turned and began running away together.

On a hunch, I picked up one of the lights and used my precious seconds between darkness-leaps to shine a beam across the portals.

Along the middle of the clearing, torsos, legs, and the occasional head appeared under my light - and *only* under my light. Rotted, leering faces shuffled toward me, briefly visible as I illuminated them.

Beginning to comprehend how much trouble we were in, I began to retreat but no I needed a plan this was worse than the end of the world these portals were opening from every world I'd brought the book through, a falling out from the damage I'd caused. The threats from those places knew about me, knew about *us*, and they were going to come through and harm my kids.

*No. Not after all this. I can't let this happen.*

The darkness entity jumped to another flashlight beam.

I looked up. Fueled by portal winds, the sky was excessively tumultuous and cloudy. Night had just fallen, and no stars were out thus the pitch black run the children would have to make on their own but it was only a matter of time before a star glinted through the heavens, or a plane flew overhead, or some other disastrous light source presented itself for the darkness entity.

And invisible corpse-creatures were crossing the clearing toward me, even now

What else? Would the iWorker hegemony send through men carrying mind-controlling light lances? Was that cleansing wall of fire going to erupt out of a random portal at any moment?

I grimaced. For the moment, I had two apocalypses to deal with, and I'd have to worry about those when the time came.

What did I have? Several flashlights, one of which contained a biologic-disintegrating darkness entity, a multi-dimensional information device that spoke to souls, and looking down at my backpack a shoe with unknown special dirt on it.

Quickly grabbing the shoe, I stuck it awkwardly in a jacket pocket.

Next, I regarded the flashlights. The proper course of action would be to turn them all off and annihilate the darkness entity, unless

Turning them all off except the one containing it, and one other, I stuffed the flashlights in various pockets. Holding the two forward - one dark, and one light - I shined them both ahead.

And I leapt back immediately. The invisible corpse-creatures had only been a few feet away. Under the swath of my light beam, I saw hundreds and, under the following swath of my darkness beam, those hundreds disintegrated with odd spectral screams.

*Jump.* The darkness began shining out from my other beam. I couldn't afford very many of these before it found a world-ending alternate destination to jump to. Count one, two, three, four

As fast as the darkness beam could disintegrate them, more semi-visible corpses shambled out of the widening portal. How many *were* there?

Billions, I imagined.

More began shambling out of nearby entrance portals as they grew larger. I backed up, increasingly pushed back by the semi-circle flow of rotting bodies. Worse, I had to shine my light all around constantly, for fear that some of the invisible attackers were coming around from behind.

This was a forceful but losing strategy.

Ok, retreat to the hill, and *think*

*Jump.*

Fifty-four seconds. Was that the minimum number of seconds? Could not remembering such a small detail actually get us all killed?! I hobbled up that large hill, familiar with it even in darkness. My sprained wrist ached with the weight of the flashlight, and I had to walk extra awkwardly not to spill any flashlights - or the shoe - from my pockets, so my hurt foot began going numb. My pulled spine, too, began protesting fiercely.

I was grimly certain that, if I got rid of the darkness entity, I wouldn't be able to outrun the invisible corpses. I had to make a stand somehow or another.

Coming across the top of the hill, and ducking backward beneath an irregular rift across the path at head height, I was startled to hear voices right behind me.

"What the hell is going on down there?" Danny asked, peering over the edge of the hill.

Thomas crouched on my other side.

All the other children had fled, as I'd ordered. "Why are you two still here?" I demanded.

"Because I hate going home," Danny countered. "Or maybe, we couldn't let you die out here. You're kind of a mess."

Thomas gulped and nodded.

I nodded, mental gears turning furiously. They'd made their choice, and now it was up to me to protect them. I kept shining the darkness beam down along the hill, vaporizing row after row of oncoming corpses, but something in my mind was screaming a warning

I glanced up at the horizon.

The Blue Ridge Mountains.

We could see the mountain range from here. We'd always been able to.

My eyes lit on a single orange speck high up on the horizon - a campfire? The headlights of a car?

It didn't matter.

*Thirty-eight, thirty-nine*

Reacting with all the adrenaline my body could spare, I thrust the darkness-bound flashlight into the irregular rift just above our heads and let it go.

My hand came back bruised and battered from the tidal forces within, but that portal was outgoing, to that sunny grassy haven, and the darkness entity would not be able to return. Hopefully, it was night and cloudy there, too, and the entity would have nowhere to go at all. If not well, now, we couldn't use the portals as an escape ourselves, either.

One apocalypse down. How many more to go?

"What'd you do that for?!" Danny shouted. Both he and Thomas grabbed flashlights from my pockets and shined them around.

A crowd of half-illuminated corpses had made it most of the way up the hill.

"What now?" Thomas asked, shaking.

Gunfire rang out from somewhere in the forest to our left, and I saw red light sliding across the treetops. "Oh my god, they're really doing it" I realized aloud. The iWorker hegemony had done exactly what I'd feared. I imagined that organized men with guns were approaching from the left even as we listened and they were able to see the invisible corpses because of the programming devices they'd brought. They could never defeat the billions of rotting puppets flooding in through the portals, but they could certainly present their own threat. "Don't let that red light reach your eyes. It'll mind-control you!"

"Seriously?" Danny asked, starkly terrified.

Thomas held his head in his hands.

To our right, gigantic columns of flame suddenly tore up into the sky, shooting out in random directions as the portals from the obsidian world fluctuated. "Time to go," I ordered quickly, happy that I'd gotten rid of the darkness entity at the right time. This situation was way beyond us, though, and I feared all was lost.

And what was so special about this *fucking shoe* I'd been lugging around? Why had the information demon wanted its partner?

The two boys helped me up, and we slogged away together, moving slightly faster than I could have on my own. We no longer moved in darkness, but in fluctuating firelight, as the forest acquired cleansing flames and spread them with aplomb. That shifting light illuminated numerous corpses trailing us, but I still kept my flashlight tuned around us, just in case.

Where were we even going? The suburb was no safe haven, even though that was where I'd always told the children to run. The iWorker battalions would reach it, or the legions of the undead, or the cleansing flames would kill everyone regardless

As we limped away in grim panic, an unexpected sight caught my eye.

Maybe a hundred feet away in the forest, illuminated by firelight, several humanoid figures walked at a pace I recognized. Sealed in black, they moved at just about four miles an hour. There were two tall figures, and one small one - a child.

I couldn't help but laugh. So there *had* been survivors on the obsidian world, after all, despite the magnitude of evil humanity had perpetrated upon itself there. How long had they been walking? Did their entire culture, now, revolve around walking ever east, ever away from the globe-encircling cleansing flames? How many times had they walked the world 'round?

I wondered if the people on the Moon had never been able to return because these stoic human beings had refused to fall, and kept the bacteria with them as a giant *screw you* to those that had consigned them to die.

*Our* Armageddon had been *their* escape. They looked around in wonder at the forest, even as they continued walking. I was sure they could do nothing to help us, but I wished them luck all the same.

The boys both trembled with exhaustion and fear. I had to keep their minds occupied while I tried to come up with something, anything "Danny, why did you hit Thomas?"

"He tried to take the book through on his own, somewhere dangerous," my second explained. "I had to do it, for his own good."

Thomas looked up at me from under my arm as we limped forward.

"Is that right?" I asked him. "I guess I kind of assumed one of your parents hit you, when you wanted to sleep in an abandoned house instead of at home. Danny, are Thomas' parents abusive?"

"I dunno," he replied. "I never met 'em. He's a new kid, remember?"

I nodded. "I remember how he was an outsider, when I first came around."

Thomas looked strictly ahead, a worried expression on his face.

I pulled us all to a halt, suddenly grimly certain about something. "Thomas, where do you live?"

He gulped, and said nothing, instead watching us both with fear.

"We'd never hurt you," I told him. "It's *you*, isn't it? You showed up at the same time as the portal, and you kept following me in, helping out"

"I just wanna go," he suddenly blurted, on the verge of tears. "I didn't mean for any of this to happen. I can't control it well at all. And that thing, that book, made everything go crazy."

"Did it make the destinations worse?" I asked. "Or was that because of how you felt when I came around?"

His face screwed up even more, and a few tears began running down his cheeks in the half-illumination of the distant fires. "I just miss my mom," he admitted. "And to have you around, acting like her, taking care of people of me"

"Of course," I replied, hugging him tight. "If you stick with me, I'll always keep you safe."

He sniffled. "Really? Why would you do that?"

"You lost a mother, but I lost a child. I don't think there's anybody more suited to take care of you. Our two pains can cancel each other out, if we let them. But right now, you need to protect *me*" I looked over at Danny. "And your new family. All these kids. They're your new swarm."

Thomas laughed despite himself, and wiped his eyes.

I let the words fall slowly. "But right now, you have to turn off those portals. The gunfire's stopped, so I'm guessing the iWorker men have retreated for the moment. They'll be back when they formulate a plan. The mind behind those corpse-things is on the other side of their portal, and the cleansing fire comes from the other side, too. If you shut down the portals *right now*, we might all just survive the night."

"I don't know if I can," he said with a worried sob. "It's an emotional thing and I need to be calm and feel safe"

I looked around, understanding how hard it would be to concentrate in a forest filled with approaching invisible corpses and belching flames. "Would it help if you understood just how far I would go to protect you? Just how *much* I mean it when I say I would never leave you?"

"Those are just words *she* promised, too and then she died"

I handed him the book. "Souls can't lie. Take a look at *my* story, and you'll understand."

He did. Danny and I watched as the light-being in the form of a boy - the light-being that had just been trying to go home all this time - read my story, the one I'd been running from for far too long. The moments spent standing in place were long, and our seconds of safety were few, but it was the only way for him to understand.

Finally, he looked up. "Is that true? Did all that really happen to you?"

I closed my eyes for a good three seconds, knowing what he was asking about, and then nodded.

"And you're still here? Doing all this? For a bunch of kids you don't even know?"

I nodded again.

He fell forward, into me, the book pressed between us, and I hugged him instinctively. He shook, sobbed, and cried for a good minute, overwhelmed by the fact that he might actually have found a home.

Danny edged toward me, his flashlight circling. "We're surrounded."

"We'll be fine," I told him. "It's time, Thomas."

He nodded against my arm, and then closed his eyes.

Watching the quick flashes of illuminated, leering corpses as they closed in around us, I held him tighter. If this didn't work they'd have to tear me apart to get to him.

Invisible hands grasped at my clothes, and - fell limp.

The wind all around us stopped.

The sound of hundreds of falling bodies echoed through the forest as the corpses fell in scattered unison.

The forest still burned, but the portals had damaged so many trees, it was impossible for the leftover flames to spread now that the source was gone.

Danny laughed first, and Thomas and I both joined him in a series of deep, freedom-charged belly laughs.

It was over.

I smiled. Just for once everyone had lived. And more - dozens more black-suited refugees moved by us in the forest, overjoyed to finally escape their endless walk. The cold and calculating part of me assessed them for threat after all, they might have had the slow-time bacteria with them but I guessed that, without the light-hungry super-crop plants the bacteria needed, it would be no threat here. *That* runaway symbiotic cycle had been broken.

Today is a good day: today, just for once, everyone lived.

And now I sit in a corner, wondering at my own survival. I didn't really expect to live through this, and I have no plans. Thomas sleeps in one corner of the room, and I sit in the other, analyzing the events of the past few weeks. It should feel odd to become the surrogate mother of a light-being-turned-human from another reality, but I've seen stranger.

And now I've got a book that talks to souls, and a shoe with a maddening mystery. I wonder what next week will bring for the first time in far too long, I'm actually looking forward to finding out.

I awoke instantly, my senses blazing. By rote, I traced back the sound still caught in my auditory sensory memories: a creaking floorboard.

My eyes were already locked on him as he came around the corner in the dark. He didn't see me for several seconds. A little jump signified the moment he became aware of my silhouette sitting against the wall.

"You're hard to find," Thomas breathed, nervous.

I nodded, aware that he could see my outline by the vague glow of house porchlights outside. "By design. Never let the enemy know where you sleep."

He hesitated. "What enemy?"

A heavy sense of reality descended upon me, and I entertained a light disappointment in myself. "None, I guess. It's hard to leave behind certain paranoias."

"My big sister went to war," he said. "She came back a lot like you."

The kid was wiser than his years. I had to give him that. I could only nod again.

He came and sat beside me in the dark. "I've been looking for you for hours. I had no idea there were so many abandoned houses in the neighborhood."

"That's half the reason I've stuck around here so long," I laughed quietly. "One world falls apart, and another seeps into the cracks." My own words gave me pause; like some kind of accidental prophecy. I'd only been speaking of his suburb, overworked parents, and inequality-strained society, but the words themselves reflected something of our conflict with the portal.

"What's the other half?" he asked.

"What?"

"The other half of the reason you stay."

"Oh." I stared around the empty shadow-lit room for several seconds. I'd been running from it for so long it felt like time to release my wound; cleanse my infection. Recent events had permanently damaged my internal armor. The scars I'd built up had been stripped away, leaving raw, bleeding pain in their stead. "I had a daughter once. She was about your age when she well."

It was his turn to say it. "Oh." He took three deep breaths, not sure what to say. "What was she like?"

"Tough," I admitted. "Awesome, really. She had simply endless willpower, and always found a way through every problem in life. She grew up to be very pretty, too, even despite the condition she was in."

He made a confused noise. "I thought she-"

"Right, yes," I corrected myself, my head fuzzy with regret. "I saw her. She gave me the iWorker device you're training. But it wasn't her just a version of her from that reality."

"That must have been very hard for you."

Wiser than his years? This kid was more of a respectable adult than I!

"Are you still going to help us?" he asked, after two or three quiet minutes spent thinking.

"I don't know if I can," I replied honestly. "The last time I tried to-" I shook my head, choking up. "No matter how much you anticipate, no matter how smart you are, or how fast you are sometimes it just doesn't matter. Sometimes, there just *isn't a way out.*"

He sniffled. "I don't want to believe that."

"What's the alternative? Believing that, if my daughter had just made different choices, she'd still be alive? That it's *her* fault she-"

"Is it *your* fault, though?" he interrupted. "Or should you blame the thing that got her?"

To that, I had nothing to say. This boy - this young man - had somehow hit right to the heart of the issue.

He slumped down. "I'm starving."

But, apparently, he was still a young man, and moments of wisdom were fleeting in young men. "Don't you have any food at home?" I asked.

He didn't reply.

Reaching over to rummage around in my oversized travel backpack, I reached past my laptop, various sundries, one saved shoe with special dirt on it, and spare clothing to fish out a ten dollar bill. I placed it in his surprised hand. "Take it. Get something to eat."

"Really?"

"Really."

"Thanks," he said, sincere. "I'll go in the morning." He curled up against the wall, preparing to sleep.

I frowned, but I couldn't stop him sleeping where he wanted. Did he not feel safe at home? By the ambient light drifting in from the windows, I could see an ugly bruise around his right eye. "Make sure you eat 'til you're practically sick. Really glut on some heavy fast food."

He laughed. "I sure will."

Sometime late at night, I'd intended on initiating my plan to safely view the objective image of the problematic book, but it didn't seem fair to leave the boy unprotected. I kept the paper with the deadly schematic rolled up safely in my backpack, and waited up while he slept. It was a simple matter to stay awake and alert for hours on end -

... I coughed and started, suddenly awake and oddly rested. It felt like I'd had a soul-weary weight lifted, at least for a little while. How had I fallen asleep like that? If anything had happened, it would have been unforgivable

A scream of absolute terror resounded in the cul-de-sac outside.

Rushing forward on my hands and feet after telling Thomas to remain quiet, I peered out through the corner of one window.

A boy I recognized ran from house to house, knocking on the door of each.

Frowning, I darted over and threw open our front door. "What's going on?"

The boy saw me and ran up to me, shouting his fearful message. "They're in trouble!"

"Run with me," I ordered quickly, dashing toward the old Dodson lot, and the paths beyond. The exhausted boy followed suit as best he could, and Thomas was not far behind. "What's the situation?"

The panting, red-faced boy let out his story between ragged breaths. "Danny tried to take the book through the portal on his own."

"I don't have the book with me?" I asked, furious at the eighteen-year-old's misguided bravado.

"No, he stole it from you" he explained, starting to lag behind. "But the portal suddenly got bigger, and they all fell through" Falling to his knees, he shouted his last information. "And they were all on the other side screaming and running from something!"

My heart seized. Why wouldn't they just go back through the portal? Something had clearly gone wrong with the main egress in a fundamental way. Thomas kept pace with me a few feet behind as I ran. "Go to Suzie's portal and tell them to start unburying it," I ordered, giving no time for debate.

Thomas nodded and sprinted off in another direction.

I soon crested the final hill, curving up above the Virginia forest and back down beneath the canopy in seconds only to tumble to a painful and wrist-spraining halt.

The portal had ruptured even further.

Space hung like a sheet flapping in the wind on an invisible clothesline. No semblance of the original ten-foot portal remained, nor the thirty-foot gash I'd last seen. Instead, the path and brush on both sides had been consumed by unstable rifts a clearing of deadly anomalies nearly three hundred feet in length, by my best guess. Ten feet thirty roughly two-seventy the portal energy wasn't expanding geometrically. It was growing *exponentially.*By that same comparison, tomorrow the corrupted space would be

A mile and a half wide.

The day after that - I clutched the gritty dirt beneath my hands tightly for a moment - a hundred and eleven miles. As far as I'd seen, the portals had clung to the surface. I had no way of knowing if the rifts were underground in a spherical area, too, but this area of spatial disturbance seemed largely rebuffed by the density of the ground beneath.

But *a hundred and eleven miles* and the day after that the numbers began escaping me, but at least *twenty-five thousand miles*

Which happened to be almost exactly the circumference of the Earth. The numbers might have escaped me, but the neatness of that value did not. This was a darkly ironic challenge from forces beyond comprehension: save the world in two days, or lose it on the third.

In this exact moment, all I could worry about were the thirty-odd children stranded in another reality. The portal had been stable for weeks before I'd interfered. Was all this somehow my fault? A dark grip caught my chest. How many children had to die because of me?

Eyeing the maelstrom of spacial contortions, I waited, waited, waited and leaped.

I slid through a small oval barely big enough to fit me, and the blinking rift took one of my shoes at the last, barely sparing me my foot.

Already tired from the run, I pushed myself wearily up, and then observed the world that the children had thought safe enough to visit briefly.

A ruddy sky swirled high over an endless plain of cracked obsidian. The sun hung huge and red in the sky, seemingly much older than the star I knew. My shoed foot crunched as I moved, and my bare foot fought for purchase among smooth flat stones that were dully jagged along the sides.

Glassy black spread out to the horizon. What had the children been running from?

I turned to look behind me.

The main portal was a mess of little blinking rifts, and clearly unusable, but that was not the problem. Not in the least.

A wall of fire approached across the endless obsidian plain, perhaps half a mile out. It came as a sheer smooth curtain of flame, horizon to horizon, cast down from the sky itself by glowing little glints in what looked like low earth orbit. Satellites? For what purpose? Why would this planet be I looked down at the obsidian beneath my feet.

Continually cleansed

*Fuck logic. Fuck explanations,* my brain screamed. *A wall of fire is coming for you! Run!*

Even in panic, I turned and looked for the children, quickly finding several multi-colored dots against black glass in the distance. I was already tired, but not like this. I couldn't let them die like this.

*Go!*

Foot down, *push*, foot down, *push*, breathe, faster, faster, fasterfasterfaster*fasterfaster -*

Breathe, breathe, breathe come on

The kids were moving away at a pace fueled by fear, but I had to catch them. They were running directly from the wall of fire, but the portal manned by Suzie's crew was down an offset vector.

I felt my personal top speed hovering back and forth before me; my legs pumped numbly, my feet crunched and bled, and my arms cut the seared air, but that intangible wall of speed danced just out of reach. I knew I could go slightly faster, I *knew it*, but I just

I stumbled and fell, falling onto a surprisingly whole plate of volcanic glass. My right wrist roared fire, and my entire body tingled with relentless weakness, but I stumbled right back to my feet. "Wait!"

The shout rang out in clear air, barely audible over the low roar of oncoming flame.

"Wait!" I screamed again, going for a high note.

As I kept staggering forward, I saw the kids slow and turn. Exhausted themselves, they could only wait for me to catch up.

I entered a circle of sweaty, fearful, drained, and smiling faces.

"I knew you'd come to save us," said Danny, the eldest.

I took a pained breath and tried to stand tall. "I don't know if I can save us, but I couldn't let you face this alone."

He gave a tired nod. "What's the plan?"

"I ordered Thomas to run to Suzie's crew and tell them to unbury their portal."

"That one's only -"

"I know," I said, cutting him off before he told the other kids. "Come on, calculate the direction. I estimate we've gone two miles directly east of the main portal. Suzie's portal will be our escape, and it's four point nine miles southeast of the main portal, offset by twenty-two degrees from the line we've been traveling. Which direction should we head, exactly?"

Faced by surprise math homework, the kids huddled in a massive circle and debated the numbers. I had an answer in mind, but it was important that they *felt it* by getting it themselves - and a second check never hurt.

Finally, they all looked up and pointed.

"That way?" I asked, slowly recovering my breath.

Thirty-two children nodded in unison.

"Alright," I prompted them. "How long have you been here? The wall of fire crossed the main portal when I was a half-mile away. I estimate it's still a half-mile away. How fast do you think it's moving? How fast do we have to move?"

They huddled again, and the answer came forty-four seconds later. Danny stood tall above the others. "Best guess - we have to move four point one miles an hour toward Suzie's portal to outrun it."

Another darkly ironic number. "Alright, we've trained for this," I announced, sloughing off the worst of my exhaustion. "Exactly this scenario, although it was a hypothetical gas creature then. It's *possible*, and you know that, right? We can survive this."

Thirty-two grim faces nodded in response.

"Then let's set out!"

I took up the lead, walking slightly faster than the four-miles-an-hour rate that I simply knew by muscle memory. That gas creature had been anything but hypothetical, once, and I'd spent four days in Louisiana backcountry escaping it. I'd been sixteen then, in my first encounter with the supernatural, but that endless struggle had never left me.

And I hoped that long-ago determination would transfer to these kids. They were all already depleted and terrified, but the human body had more to give than any of them knew.

All they had to do was keep pace.

Teenagers, boys, girls, and children walked together, pushing their walking stances to the limit. It was too fast to walk comfortably, and too slow to run easily, so we were caught at the worst speed possible. Still, we pushed on. The crunching of sixty-six feet filled the air, mercifully drowning out the sound of the approaching wall of fire.

"Give it back," I told Danny, who kept the lead beside me. "*What were you thinking?*"

Breathing hard, he looked away, clutching the tome in hand. "You left."

"I had to," I told him. "I was wounded."

"You didn't look hurt."

I gulped. "I was, and I still am inside. But I'm sorry I left."

He set his jaw with resentment, but handed me the book.

I took it with unhappy anticipation. This world was strange enough that I needed to know if any threats waited between us and our escape. After steeling myself, I opened the book to the back pages.

---

I *knew* it hadn't been my imagination. Each day had been slightly warmer than the last, until all the snow had melted and people were out in shorts. An Indian Summer they called it, for some reason. Others laughed about global warming.

It was global warming, alright, though not for the reasons anyone suspected.

Most began sensing something wrong with the night soon after that. It was subtle, really, but disruptive to sleep: night time just wasn't as dark as it used to be. The first reports came out that week, with the first inexplicable data.

The stars were growing brighter.

It was *light.* Light was our problem. The stars had grown twelve percent brighter than previous recorded values - all the stars, all at once, for no measurable reason that anyone could discern. What could make the entire universe grow more luminous all at once?

But, see, that was the wrong question.

The Sun and Moon were both affected, too. The Moon became a painful white beacon in the sky, illuminating the night with stark silver. Sunglasses became mandatory during the day, along with sunblock, air conditioning, and shade.

It was rather astounding how long life went on as normal. People turned up the air in their cars, stayed indoors, and let technology furiously resist the growing heat. As a scientist, I had a rather longer-term view of our situation, and I wondered what they would do once the crops started dying and the food stopped being shipped in.

Nope. That didn't happen. My intelligent colleagues adapted. The food harvests dipped for a year, but then shot up the next, as a global initiative switched major crops all over the world toward genetically engineered plants that *thrived* on the extra light - forty-two percent more than usual, and climbing.

From that perspective, things actually started to look up. The added heat and light were just more energy for the human race to capture and use. Fossil fuels crashed in favor of solar, which now never, ever had dull moments - when the Sun went down, the Moon and the stars took over energy duty. With almost all of our energy being produced cleanly, and the atmosphere undergoing severe weather changes, the global temperature actually began to drop back down for a time.

It was enough time for us to prepare. Thanks to the heat, war ended as a thing. It was simply impossible to field troops, and energy and food had become practically free, so what was left to fight over? More than that, we had a global threat on our hands, and the human race banded together to overcome.

The weird thing about all this, though, was that the light wasn't the right color. It was growing more and more *blue*, regardless of source, and we simply had no idea why.

I was stationed in one of the pleasantly temperate Antarctic stations for several years. I'd never really had family per se, and I'd certainly never had more than passing relationships. I'd mostly been a loner that observed the world and felt isolated from it. So, my sudden placement with thousands of intelligent and capable colleagues was a shock. I made *friends.* We debated philosophy, argued about the cause of the Blue Brightening, and played clumsy games of volleyball. We drank alcohol like our military staff - to excess - and then regretted it utterly. We even raided the Biology Lab's dorms with water balloons. They retaliated by stealing a month's supply of pudding from our cafeteria.

All in all, I'd have to describe it as the slowest and most pleasant apocalypse imaginable.

Over the years, and ever so slowly, that pleasantness began to unravel as the level of incoming light from the rest of the universe reached double, and then triple. The surface became a scorching azure desert that was all but unlivable. Our temperate Antarctic outpost became a savannah, and then turned tropical, until, finally, all the plants except our genetically engineered super-crops died.

It was strange to look back on half a life, and on a youth spent unhappy and apart from the world as it was, only to find that world gone. Of the seven billion people alive at the start of our decades of heating, almost all had moved underground, into space, or onto the new cities on the now strikingly sapphire Moon.

The first colony to successfully set up on Mars soon had terrifying news for us: it wasn't blue out there, and it wasn't brighter out there. The technology we'd sent out into the solar system hadn't been malfunctioning. With their very eyes, the first interplanetary pioneers confirmed it.

There was nothing wrong with the universe at all. There was something wrong with *us.*

The theory had already been proposed, of course. Now a civilization of scientists, we'd had plenty of time to guess. Politics had split along ideological lines, but, now, we had proof: the Slow-Time Bubble theory was correct. For unknown reasons, the Earth and the Moon, both, had been encompassed in a slow-time field that was growing ever stronger. The universe wasn't brighter; it just had more time to shower us with light, and that light had been growing more and more blue-shifted due to the time dilation.

It took another thirty years for us to figure out why. In the meantime, we watched the Mars colonies rapidly expand, terraform, cover the red planet with humanity, and then - just as quickly as they had come - they were gone. An expedition sent there found nothing but a world of silent monolithic cities that were hundreds of thousands of years old.

Except we weren't that bad off, not yet - the Mars colony should only have aged a few hundred years to our two decades. The opposite of our fate had happened to them - they had been caught in a fast-time field, the Sun and stars had faded to weak red-shifted darkness, and they'd all starved, died, and faded away in the blink of an eye.

Strangely enough, the fast-time field had departed with them, and the *reason* behind both our predicaments revealed itself from an impossible vector: our food.

Specifically, a bacteria living in the roots of our genetically-modified crops. Somehow, a bacteria had evolved with time-slowing properties - the cellular organism itself existed in dimensions higher than three plus time. Its internal structure literally branched off into higher dimensions, and an emergent property of its shape was to bend the fabric of time. We had no idea whether this organism had evolved on Earth, or whether it had fallen from space, but it was here.

And as we'd planted more and more of it globally, the bacteria had grown in total number, and our problem had worsened exponentially. Mars had had the opposite problem; with its own genetic crops, adapted to live in a much different environment, they had unwittingly bred a new kind of bacteria that had sped up time instead of slowing it down. Just like that, ambient cellular life had wiped away a planet and, when those crops on Mars had died, so had their fast-time bacteria. It was strangely ironic that Mars, the Red Planet, had died in a lethal red shift, and now Earth, the Blue, was dying in its respective color, too.

We knew what the problem was, now but the problem presented itself: how do you cleanse an entire planet of all cellular life?

Nothing we had could fight it. It didn't respond to antibiotics, and our three-dimensional nano-machines simply couldn't interact properly with the multi-dimensional bacterial cells. The only solution, we found, was the oldest answer in the book: fire.

We'll come back once the Earth is cleansed. We'll come back and we'll start anew we'll just escape to the Moon for a time, and then it'll all be fine. I'm boarding the ship in an hour - or, I should be, when it gets here. The people on the Moon are supposed to be sending the fleet to pick up the two or three billion people still here, but there's been no contact yet. I'm not sure what we're doing about food and supplies for everyone, but I'm sure we'll figure it out. Humanity's evolved beyond selfishness, cruelty, and repugnant survival instincts.

That's what I tell myself, at least. I got to live a mediocre life, and I got to feel at least partially like a person for a time - partially included - and, for that, I'm thankful. The crowd is growing restless out here in the blasting blue sands, all waiting in their hermetic suits, but what's an old man to tell them? There are children out here, so many children, and telling them that nobody's coming would only be cruel.

But I really thought they wouldn't turn the satellite cleansing system on with us still out here. At least let us get back underground, so we don't see it coming! You sick sons of bitches! And they're running, the crowd is running, intent on going east, moving east to escape the cleansing, ever east how long can they run? Minutes? How long can they walk? Hours, days, weeks? I'm an old man, I can't join you, but you keep walking, keep going, and never give in show those sadistic bastards that human willpower doesn't -

---

I looked up from the book, my thoughts frozen by the sheer magnitude of that unimaginable cruelty, and the scope of what had happened to humanity here. For once, the threat had not been outright lethal, but the existential crisis had still been inhuman. This time, people had done it to themselves

"What happened here?" Danny asked, seeing my face.

I kept down a surprisingly powerful sob. "Um, nothing relevant," I told him, looking up. There was no blue shift that I could discern, so the bacteria must have been cleansed. The Moon was just coming up over the horizon, and I thought I saw numerous city-like patterns dotting its silvery landscape. But how long had they been there? How long had the cleansing system been running? Had something gone wrong with the return plan, or had they chosen never to come back out of shame and horror at what they'd done?

I looked ahead of us, to the east.

The Sun was gigantic, and red, dominating the sky. Had the slow-time bacteria cost the Earth billions of years? Was the Sun going red giant, and expanding to consume the planet?

I peered to the side, studying the Moon. The patterns there looked grey and lifeless. Had humanity departed for the stars? Or had they petered out on their dusty new rock?

About out of willpower, I shook off my questions. I'd never get answers, and those people - if they were still up there - would hardly help us.

Not after what they'd done.

My bare foot had become sliced and bloody, but I could hardly stop to deal with it. Looking back at our group, I noticed some stragglers. "Come on," I shouted tiredly. "Nobody gives up!"

Most of the straggling children sped up a little, but one struggled along, visibly limping.

"Danny," I said grimly. "Keep the pace."

He nodded.

I stood in place, huffing, and took a moment to bandage my foot with a strip torn from my shirt. The kids all seemed worried that I had stopped, but Danny barked at them to keep moving.

Eventually, the limping boy - Ryan, if I remembered right, maybe nine years old - caught up to me.

His entire face was bright red from exertion, and dripping sweat. The wall of fire was louder here, and more audible without the group's crunching footfalls. I watched him until he reached me.

"I hurt my ankle," he gasped.

"Hold onto my arm," I offered, taking the pressure off his hurt leg as much as I could. We began staggering forward. "We're going to make it, don't you worry."

He had no breath for a reply. I could feel the heat on our backs growing, and searing breezes began ruffling our clothes.

"I don't wanna die," he said, unprompted.

I looked, and saw tears flowing down his face. "You're not going to die."

He gasped with resigned terror. "We're not going fast enough."

I set my jaw, my thoughts on the people that had died on this world. "I'm *not* going to leave you behind." Out of options, I bent down, and had him climb up on my back. "We are *all* getting out of this godforsaken place."

I huffed forward, tapping into reserves I never knew I had. He was no baby, and heavy on my back, but I ignored the pain in my feet and the heavy weight in my muscles and pushed on - until I looked further ahead, and saw a scattering of children lying where they'd fallen from exhaustion.

I couldn't carry them all.

"Get up!" I screamed, still a hundred feet away from the first fallen child.

She pushed herself up weakly.

"That's it! That's it, get up! *Get up! Keep going!*"

Stumbling forward, she began to walk again, her head low and her eyes hollow.

Which reminded me - I'd have given anything for a few iWorkers. Those things would have walked the children right to the limits of their endurance without an issue.

And thoughts like that, I'm sure, were what led that world to its fate

"You!" I shouted again, approaching a prone ten-year-old boy whose name I desperately wanted to remember. "Get up! You're not going to die in this oven. All you have to do is walk another mile or two and you can fall down and rest as long as you want."

He still didn't move.

Finally reaching him, I pushed him with my shoed foot.

He groaned.

"Get up, goddamnit!"

Trembling, he took my hand, and started walking again after another push.

Ahead, two more children lay stretched out on obsidian, and, ahead of them, I saw four more collapsed in various positions.

Even if I did get them up, we were moving too slowly. I could feel the blazing heat at our backs, and I dared not look. "Get up!" I screamed, desperate. "Please, just get up!"

The first one we reached, a girl, tried to get up - and fell back onto her wide plate of black glass.

It was about then that the horrible tree of approaching decisions manifested itself to me. I'd burned all our spare time, and the cleansing wall was nearly upon us.

I couldn't save them all.

Was this what the people on the Moon had felt, unable to feed billions of people?

They had to be left behind

I could carry one but the others had to be left behind

I already had one boy on my back. Did he deserve to live simply because he had faltered first?

Could I possibly live with putting him down, and picking up another child?

I became aware of an added wetness in my sweat - tears? I hadn't cried in so long, and now, here, forced to make the worst decision it was simply happening, somewhere fuzzy, somewhere outside my cold and calculating survival instincts. Part of me felt the tragedy, but I couldn't feel that part of me, not anymore.

I could save one. Which one? One clung to my back, screaming as the corona at the base of the wall of fire began dancing toward us. Six children lay sprawled out before me and ahead of me. Should I choose by age? Youngest, or oldest? Gender? Boy, or girl? Or should I choose the smartest, the most capable I'd seen?

No.

I refused to accept it.

It was a crappy, terrible solution, and it would hurt them all badly, but it might just -

Handing the book to the boy on my back, I turned around, gripped the girl and the nearby boy by their arms, and began dragging them.

They screamed as they slid against sharp angular obsidian, and traces of blood began soaking their clothes but we were moving.

In turn, we approached each of the other four fallen children, and I had them grip each other with all their remaining strength. They were all young, and small - thus, they had been the first to fall - and that fact also made them draggable.

Screaming at the top of my lungs from the strain, I pulled six crying children across shards of broken volcanic glass, while one clung to my back and shouted continually for them to hold on.

All I could see was the roiling blazing bulwark slowly catching up to us; even licking at the shoes of the farthest boy now and then. If he were to lose his grip on the leg of the boy above him, even for a moment

Just pull...

Just drag...

Breathe...

Foot down, push...

The other foot down, push...

The agony went on without end, but I would *never* -

A perfectly straight line of pure red, like a laser, cut across my awareness, and a swath of despair followed the twinge of pain.

I fell to one knee as the flare in my spine broached extreme levels of agony. I'd pulled something, or strained something, or simply reached the edge of my endurance sometimes, there was simply no way out. I knew that, I did, but I could never accept the reality of it.

But the bloodied and battered children did not slip into the flames and die. Given the break they'd needed, they staggered up and began running again. Ryan handed me the book and took off after them. Turning in amazement despite the searing torsion in my back, I saw them desperately charge toward Danny, who stood right next to a small oval in space.

On the other side, children silently waved and shouted and motioned for them to come. Wasting no time, they tumbled through - with a little push from Danny each.

We'd made it. We hadn't lost a single person without the boy on my back, I could move a little easier, and I gripped the book tightly with one hand and my side with the other.

"It's still not big enough for us," Danny shouted as I approached, reaffirming his earlier unspoken concern. His eyes jumped to the wall of flame not twenty feet behind me.

I came to a stop, swayed in front of him, and lifted the book with a pained gasp. "Time for a wild guess, then" Without hesitation, I thrust it through the small oval portal. I waited a tick, and then pulled it back. I did this thrice more, and then

Space began ripping around the small rift, rapidly expanding the portal to three times its original size.

"Go," I told him.

He nodded gravely and dove through.

I waited as the heat and roar grew behind me to screaming intensity. I could just stay here, and the book the *device*, whatever it was would be destroyed with me.

Or would it?

I couldn't make a gesture like that unless I was certain.

A little relieved, I tumbled through the portal. "Get back!" I roared, as blessedly cool forest air flowed around me like an eddy in a river.

Remembering what I'd told them about shouted warnings, they all immediately darted away.

I rolled forward, spine sparking body-filling agony, as the portal ruptured further behind me. By the time I scrambled to a small hillock and looked back, it had torn out across the entire clearing. Beyond, I saw only descending flame.

I lolled my head back on good old dirt, and stared up at the trees. I'd done it. I'd avoided the choice I'd found that elusive third option that people were so rarely afforded all that training I'd given them, and all the pain I'd ever gone through it had saved these kids today

I laughed. It was a deep, satisfying thing, and I let it go on with all the relief, humor, and wonder I felt. The internal armor I'd lost was gone, but I no longer needed it. I hadn't been wrong, and it hadn't been my fault. Or maybe it had been, but I just didn't care anymore. At some point, life had to go on.

And, with time so short, life had to go on *now.* I had to go through with my plan and view the objective image of the book. I had to know what it truly was.

I vaguely remember the children helping me up, and a long staggering journey back to the suburb before I sent them all off to get patched up and rest.

I also remember a brief image of the several tequila bottles I had to buy to make my plan work. It was pretty simple, really: down a nearly lethal amount of alcohol, wait until you're almost blacked out, and then - and *only then* - take out the dangerous image, draw it as quickly and as accurately as you can while so inebriated, and pass out. If you're lucky, you'll remember nothing, and your brain won't rupture trying to process the multi-dimensional image.

Viewing it had almost killed Danny; would have killed Danny, without healing help.

I awoke at some indeterminate time the next day, my entire body a hurricane of hangover pain, and my face in a pool of vomit that had come from my stomach and blood that had come from my eyes but I was alive.

I was alive, and I'd managed to draw what the book really looked like - or, at least, what limited sense I could make of what it looked like.

[An Objective View](http://imgur.com/a/l0D6t)

As soon as I saw it, quite a few of our problems began making sense. This was no book at all, but, rather, some sort of incomprehensible multi-dimensional device; and, as I'd seen, it was absolutely related to the rupturing portals. Our plan to use the iWorker to get rid of it seemed rather simple and possibly unreliable now, but what other option did we have?

I spent the day recovering from my extreme hangover and thinking about ways to get rid of the device. The portal out there, by my calculations, now had to be a mile and a half wide. If only I had more time whatever we were going to do, it would have to be with today's destination, no matter how lethal, and it would have to be tonight. Tomorrow, this entire region would rupture in a space a hundred and eleven miles long. It would be far too late. If only I had more time...

[Part 3](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2n4dv6/the_portal_in_the_forest_part_3/)

It began when I found the neighborhood children still hanging around the portal on Thanksgiving. Apparently, no, they didn't have any place to be. Their parents were all working. The parents of every single child were holding down two or three jobs each.

It was small wonder the kids had such free reign over the suburb and Virginia backwoods, and why nobody else had found out about the portal. There simply weren't any adults around to watch or warn.

And, apparently, I filled that void. Repeated questions had led to the best answers I could give, and then to proposed preventative measures, and then to more.

I crested Dead Man's Hill, so called by the local children for its cliffside rise. One wrong move meant a nasty fall into one of the large ravines that so plagued the foothills. For the last several days, while waiting for another habitable destination in the portal, I'd been using it to show the kids that horror and risk were *real factors* in life, and that the fear they brought meant paralysis and death for the uninitiated. "Come on!" I shouted, waiting at the top.

In the lead, as usual, was my eighteen-year-old second. He ran up the steep and leaf-slippery incline with a dramatically red face, releasing torrents of sweat with each movement. "We've already run three miles," he huffed. "They're not going to be up for this."

I watched exhausted kids of various ages appearing behind him on the trail, and then I checked my watch. "Today's hypothetical gas creature moves at four miles an hour and doesn't get exhausted," I reminded him. "Everyone who doesn't reach the top here in the next three minutes just got killed because they *couldn't run the same distance as the portal back to the suburb*." As the sweat-drenched children came in one by one, I recited: "You're dead. And you're dead. And you."

They groaned and complained, of course.

"No fair!"

"Does this monster even exist?"

I watched them with a stern glare. "Absolutely anything could come out of those portals. The better shape you're in, and the sharper your decisions, the better chance you all have of surviving."

They quieted, and followed me through the woods in drained silence. I had no authority other than that they gave me, but the portals scared them, and they sensed a certain capability about me.

We came to the first of the new portals in short order. I approached several younger boys who were shoveling dirt ever higher underneath it in order to eventually bury it. "How wide is it now?"

"About a foot," a thirteen-year-old girl answered, one of the smarter ones I was aware of.

"About?"

"Thirteen point four inches," she said, patting the ruler in her pocket.

I nodded. Slightly larger than a basketball, and roughly oval in shape, the shimmering rift hovered in the air around waist height. It had been the first new expanding hole we'd noticed, but it had not been the last. Space around the main portal seemed to be fracturing in an increasingly wider radius.

I led my troop through the next bit of thick forest, where two boys hammered bits of junk wood around an inch-wide rift we'd found slowly cutting into the trunk of a tree. "How's this one?"

"It doesn't seem to be getting bigger," one replied nervously. "Yet."

"Good."

We moved on.

The ten-kid crew at the main portal had accomplished an impressive amount in just a few days. The pile of dirt, rocks, and boulders now rose slightly higher than the ten-foot-wide main portal adjacent to it. Carefully layered tree trunks we'd felled kept the static avalanche at bay. Soon, we would be able to release the earthen flood and bury the portal if we so needed.

I'd thought that would be enough, if we could get rid of the book, but I now considered the burying trap a last resort. Tiny rifts were appearing inside boulders, trees, and hills, only visible once they grew to a sufficient size, so I doubted burying the main hub would stop the tide.

All the portals, big or small, showed onto the same destination each day. The situation was becoming less like a punched hole in the dimensional barrier, and more like a dissolving curtain between realities. I had no way of knowing whether the breaches would grow exponentially, but I had to assume we only had a few days left before crisis.

And most of those few days were spent in stressed frustration, watching as each new daily destination became worse than the last. The week before the iWorker world, we'd seen burning and bloody nightmarescapes, but these worlds these worlds ran incomprehensible at best, and mentally scarring at worst. I was considering taking the risky step of ordering the children not to look into the portals - risky because my authority over them only extended as far as this strange phenomenon. If they felt cut out of the process, they'd have no reason to listen to me, and I feared that might get them all killed.

In a small clearing near the bury-trap build, Thomas practiced with a normal book. I watched him place the iWorker on his neck, stiffen, then pick up the book, carry it twenty feet forward, drop the book, and then return to his original location. He took the iWorker off, waited a few moments, then did it all again, trying to get the needed time down to as few seconds as possible.

That was it. That was all he had to do - assuming we found a world safe enough that twenty feet of travel wouldn't mean instant death.

Rather than bother him, I turned back to my troop. "Go home, rest up. You all did great today. Tomorrow, our hypothetical monster is a sight-stealer, and we'll have to do the run blindfolded -"

A choir of groans and whines rang out, but I ignored them.

The portal was changing.

All tiredness forgotten, two dozen heads turned and stared.

Where once had been a vast aerial cloudscape filled with thousands of close and distant corpses hung by thin glimmering strands around their necks - an endless hellish windchime - there now sat blank whiteness. The whiteness sharpened into a chamber; a long rectangular room eerily akin to a doctor's waiting room.

At the end, maybe forty feet away, sat a middle-aged woman. Her smooth ivory desk faced us across the blank white gap of empty floor, and she busied herself with several stacks of papers. After tapping a few collections into a neat pile, she placed them carefully down in one corner of her desk, adjusted her light wire-rimmed glasses, and looked up at us.

She waited.

"The portal's never changed in the middle of the day," my second commented. "Everybody get back!"

The kids wasted no time in listening. We'd already arranged a series of fallback positions; the first was in the lee of the large hill behind me, from which the nearby tops of the forest and the distant uneven horizon formed by the Blue Ridge Mountains could be seen. It was to this location that the children moved in an orderly stampede.

I remained, with one other.

The woman continued waiting, her gaze on me.

"Do I have the book?" I asked my second.

He looked down at my arm. "Yes."

And so I did. Lifting it up, I set my jaw. "Did I have it the whole run?"

" yes."

"Well, then." I stepped toward the portal. "It looks like I have an appointment"

"Be careful. It could be a trap!"

I peered into the portal. The woman did not seem overly excited or eager; she merely waited. "What does logic tell you?"

He gulped, his stance nervous. "I I guess this isn't a trap. We are not interesting enough or important enough for someone - or some *thing* - to go through all the trouble of connecting to our portal just to kill us. I think they want something."

I nodded. "I agree."

"Still, be careful," he offered.

The genuine warmth and worry in his voice gave me slight pause, but I took a breath and carried forward.

Beyond the subtle vibration of the portal, the white room felt exactly neutral in temperature and character. I remained near my egress for a moment.

The woman spoke loudly enough to be heard from forty feet away, although that wasn't difficult in the deathly quiet chamber. "Truce is offered for sixteen minutes and eight seconds as a free courtesy. Please, sit."

Slowly, I moved forward, my eyes scanning every inch of the high ceilings and smooth walls. The rectangular room appeared to have no entrance or exit. Eventually, I found my way to a basic white chair waiting in front of her desk, and I sat, book in hand. "Can you destroy this book?"

She regarded it, and then me. "That information will cost you."

"Cost me what?" I asked, wondering at her motives. I had the distinct impression, from little pauses in her motions, that she was simply a front for something else.

She took a piece of paper from the corner of her desk and slid it forward.

*one of the shoes you are currently wearing | one of the hands you are currently employing*

From the clues I'd gleaned, and this price choice, I had a vague idea of what was going on, but that meant only bad things "May I ask clarification?"

She gave a restrained but appreciative smile, as if I'd done something correct. "You may."

"By hand, do you mean the biological structure attached to my arm, or one of the people working for me back beyond the portal?"

"The former."

"Oh, great," I replied, not liking either answer, but wary of another. "Why do you want my shoe?"

She tilted her head for a moment, as if listening. Her response came after a few seconds' delay. "That information will also cost you." She slid another piece of paper out next to the first.

*the name of the army victorious in the Battle of Long Island | one ocular organ from any source | three liters of Xenon*

The hell? I kept my face straight and calm, not wanting to betray any information to this entity. Could the questions be an attempt to determine which universe I came from? If I expressed confusion over the Battle of Long Island, or the rarity of Xenon would that give something away? I could just barely recall that Xenon was present at about 1 parts per million in the atmosphere, meaning that collecting three liters of it would require  3 million liters of air was that actually doable? I wasn't sure.

"May I return after I have gathered payment?" I asked.

"You may."

I paused halfway across the room. "Does my time of safety run down while I am gone?"

The woman watched me with a neutral expression. "Yes."

I took that as a cue to run the next twenty feet. Once back through the portal, I took only enough time to give an order to my second. He frowned, but ran off at top speed.

A few moments of sprinting later, I was back in the chair, the two offers still before me. Alright, what next? What else could I do in the time allotted?

Of course!

I lifted the book, and moved to open it.

The woman made a noise, and her face reflected a very subtle fear - the first emotion I'd seen at all. "A piece of free advice: if you open that device here, it will be seen as an act of hostility, violating our truce."

I froze, my fingers on the cusp of the cover but I hadn't missed her use of the word *device* rather than *book.* "Why?" I sat a little taller. "Wait, rather: what does the book do?"

Taking a moment to regain her composure, the bespectacled woman adjusted her sweater, pushed up her glasses, and then slid another paper toward me, resting it next to the other two.

*|             | one human soul*

Growing agitated, I leaned forward. "Why are two of the options blank?"

"If you knew what the options were," the woman answered calmly. "It would give you vital information you haven't paid for."

"So I'm just supposed to *guess* what my payment options are?"

"You can guess, or you can pay to know what the payment options are."

"Alright, what's the price to know the first payment option?"

She slid a fourth piece of paper forward. It had only one option.

*your ability to love*

I wavered in place for a moment, stunned to my very core. "You can take that?" I whispered.

"Yes, if offered as payment."

"Does it extend to existing emotions, or just new ones?"

"All emotions of love would be included, and any consequent emotions you have as a result of those emotions."

I could, I *could* it would be so easy

Footsteps clattered across the smooth marble floor behind me, and my second approached at speed, his goal in hand and wrapped in a thick layer of leaves. "Got it!" he cried, plopping down the dead bird we'd seen on our run. It squished onto the surface of the clean white desk under its own weight.

The woman did not seem amused, but she took the relevant offer paper, the corpse, and its ocular organ - and placed them in a drawer. "Payment accepted. The question was: why are your shoes valuable? The answer is: because something of value is stuck to them. To be exact, dirt from a very specific reality."

*Shoes*, plural. That was extremely valuable information. Did the entity behind this marionette realize what it'd just given away?

I slipped off both shoes, intent on trading away one and keeping the other. I lifted the left shoe, but the woman did not react; I lifted the right shoe, and she still did not react. It seemed either shoe would do. Gently, I sat one shoe on the first offer paper, and she took the paper and the shoe both and placed them in a drawer.

"The question was: Can I destroy this book? The answer is: no."

I stood at that. "You'd have taken my *hand* for *that answer?*"

She did not seem threatened by my sudden anger. "Offers are offers. The game is the game. Your time is half gone, and little profitable trading has been done. I suggest you make wiser choices."

Muttering epithets, I sat again.

My second stood behind me, watching in confusion and concern. "What does she want?"

My frustration suddenly cleared. Of course! I'd been going about this all wrong. I'd been asking questions about the book, and not about the *woman*, or the entity behind her. "Yes," I echoed. "What do you want?"

Another paper slid forward, coming up adjacent to the two remaining but untenable offers. This one had four options for payment, but all were blank. "Of course"

"The game is the game," she offered, unprompted.

I switched tact. "How do we neutralize the threat this book poses?"

The resulting offered page contained no payment options at all. She bowed her head slightly.

That wasn't a promising sign.

Feeling my time diminishing to vanishing slimness, I struggled for something anything what wasn't I seeing?

I looked up. "What does this device look like objectively?" I asked, holding up the book.

"That one is free," the woman answered with a light smile. "As it serves both our interests for you to know."

The final paper slid across her desk.

I moved to roll it up without looking at it, but I wasn't quick enough. My second glanced down from his higher standing vantage point. I heard him gurgling painfully before I could react.

Blood spattered across my face, and across the desk before me. I leapt up and caught him as he fell, and gently lowered him to the ground as crimson leaked from his open eyes and mouth. He began seizing and thrashing violently, and I held him down as best I could while I turned my head to glare daggers at the woman. "Fix him!"

She began to reach for another paper.

"No bullshit!" I shouted. "If you can fix him, do it -" I hesitated. If the entity here had wanted to give me information that was beneficial to both of us, why hadn't it simply done so? Was it far more strictly bound by our game than it let on? "- or I won't leave."

"Your time is almost up," she replied flatly.

"The truce isn't for *my* safety," I shot back, gambling the boy's life on a guess. "It's for *yours.* And this" I looked down at him as his seizing began to slowly fade into dying. "You'll offer me a choice to heal him, and one of the payment options will be *leave.* Then we'll go our separate ways. That's your last resort, isn't it? No matter. If you don't give me that deal, I'll stay here, with that device and all its danger, consequences be damned."

The woman stopped completely for a full four seconds, all blinking, breathing, and shifting completely stilled. When she resumed moving, she slid a paper forward. As I'd thought, all of the choices offered had been premeditated, and this one, for healing the boy, had *leave* as the only payment option.

Rolling up the objective image of the book without looking at it, and dragging my second by his shoulders, I pulled him quickly across the room as the sixteen minutes and eight seconds reached its end and the white walls began to dissolve into seething masses of what looked like brain tissue.

I kept going until I could lay him out on forest leaves, but his blood was already receding back into his body. A light green glow hovered around his head, probably purging the memories of what he'd seen. A tide of children poured down from the safety of the hill, now eager to hear what had happened.

I looked up as the portal began to flicker back toward the day's original destination - the corpse-filled sky and its deadly inexplicable filaments that had choked an entire world of people and drawn them up into the clouds to die together.

The woman at the other end of the disappearing room screamed silently and struggled against chains of neural tissue and, then, the image was gone. It hadn't occurred to me that the entity's puppet might really have been a human being. That could explain why subtle phrasings she'd used had given away so much vital information. She might have been trying to help me the only way she could. Had I had a chance to save her, and missed it?

But, of course, that was what it wanted: regret. The entire encounter had been designed to fill me with hurt and regret, or at least enhance what was already there. I'd heard a tale, just once, of a Regret Demon that offered trades for which every option, including doing nothing, would lead to remorse. It was called a Demon because it was bound by very strict behavior, not because it was necessarily related to religion but the Regret part I now knew was exactingly true.

The ability to love and all consequent emotions and pains

"What happened?" he asked, waking with bleary eyes.

I held the book in one hand, and the rolled up paper in the other. "We got something very valuable," I told him.

He sat up weakly, his face full of concern. "What did you trade for it?"

"Peace," I replied quietly, unwilling to elaborate further. Another innocent had almost died because of me, and the risk was only going to grow. I looked past the children crowded 'round and saw Thomas still training his iWorker. What right did I have to risk the lives of these kids? Was I training them just to foolishly face the unknown and die, just like before?

At that thought, the ground trembled slightly underfoot - and the left side of the portal began to rip further out into the woods. I watched, stunned, as several trunks ruptured, exploded, and collapsed as the trees above fell. The wound in space unzipped the very air for another twenty feet - the portal had grown to three times its previous size.

"What do we do?" my second asked, terrified.

I had no orders to give. The Regret Demon had taken something very valuable from me; I found myself uncertain and wavering. Against forces like these, uncertainty and hesitation meant death. I knew something had to be done, but I was forced to admit to someone else, for the first time, that I was lost. "I don't know"

That answer was not the one the children wanted to hear. They didn't scream, or cry. They remained absolutely quiet, waiting for someone to take away their fear.

But I couldn't. Not in that moment. I could only walk away, book and paper in hand. Maybe if I just had some time to think

"Where are you going?" my second - no, just an eighteen-year-old boy - shouted.

I had no answer for him. Instead, I departed, stumbling mentally if not physically. *Where am I going, indeed?*

Besides the trade I could have made, might have made, there was the astounding information implicit in one of the payment option's I'd been given. *One human soul.* That meant... souls were real. Humans had souls, and souls were real things. I had a sick, black suspicion that I knew what the book had been doing all this time.

But, first, it was time to see what it *really* looked like...

[Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/2m8dtr/the_portal_in_the_forest_part_2/)

I crested the last hill and immediately noticed excited energy among the neighborhood kids crowded around the portal.
 
"We got a good one today?"
 
The children parted, and my unofficial second-in-command stepped forward - the eighteen-year-old boy who often corralled the others. "Looks like it."
 
Peering beyond him, I found a rather surprising sight.
 
Each day for the last week, the random destinations had been non-starters. One world had been completely on fire - from the closest flaming ground to the distant smoldering mountains - and there'd been no sign of abatement.

We'd spent another whole day staring in horror out across a vast ocean of what seemed to be thick blood. The smooth and endless crimson surface had been interrupted only by a few massive bone-like protrusions, and a sunless sky of carved ivory presided over the inexplicable sight. Weird ripples had moved in that blood ocean, as if hidden creatures lived beneath. The portal had never shown anywhere but alternate Earths as far as anyone had seen I'd warned the kids not to think too much about how our Earth had become like that ungodly place. That way lay madness.

It had definitely been a relief to find the portal showing onto an open green pasture the next day, and we'd almost gone in - but my second noticed it at the last moment: an eerie lack of parallax. The green pasture was an illusion, almost like a perfect television screen displayed across the rift, and what truly lay beyond was impossible to know. Such a deception hinted at far worse intentions through that particular portal than in most worlds. Most worlds didn't seem to know or care about us.

Every Earth we'd glimpsed in the last week had been anathema to human life in some way or another. Every world had been dead or dying. I'd figured that this was all somehow related to the otherworldly book I was trying to get rid of, and its inexplicable penchant for detailing the final stories of the doomed, but I couldn't be sure. I didn't know if it controlled the portal, or whether it was merely connected to it somehow, but the children reported that the destinations were definitely getting worse. The first few weeks they'd observed it, there'd been nothing but pleasant forests, open plains, and innocuous oceans.
 
But today's sight changed our data set. Today, the portal opened on a busy street in a city that looked much like New York. We watched people drive past in recognizable cars and trucks. Many passersby were on foot, hurrying with very human impatience.
 
It didn't occur to me until I'd already stepped through - nobody on the other side had given the portal any heed.
 
Suddenly surrounded by the hustle, movement, and engine rhythms of a busy city street, I turned and looked back. Yep, there it sat: a ten-foot-wide jagged oval in space showing a forested path and a crowd of children watching from the other side. None of the suited busy-bodies on the sidewalk gave even the slightest glance at the portal.
 
Or at me, for that matter. They bumped against me and pushed past in an ongoing series of collisions. None so much as flinched. None apologized. They weren't completely unaware of me - they just didn't care.
 
Given that we'd not yet seen a world where any human being was still alive, I had the distinct concern that these people were nothing more than marionettes. If they were dead if they were just emulating life then that meant, in the middle of a busy big city street, I was actually completely alone. I'd seen many things in my life, and almost nothing truly got to me anymore, but I'd never been able to handle p-zombies. Something about that kind of soulless fate just struck me as existentially horrifying in a basic and gripping way.
 
*Forget this.*
 
Placing the book down on the sidewalk, I darted back through the portal.
 
"What happened?" the kids asked. "What's wrong?"
 
I looked down. The book was in my hand again. "Damnit." I watched their expressions. "Did I put this book down on the sidewalk?"
 
"No," they reported in unison.
 
"So, the book doesn't teleport back to my possession," I realized aloud. "It's a mental diversion. A trick of perception and memory."
 
Steeling myself, I went back into the portal a second time, and shoved the book into the large purse of a passing businesswoman.
 
I pressed myself up against the wall of a building, waited a few seconds, and then closed my eyes. I took a deep breath, analyzed my own thoughts, then looked down yep, the book was still in my hand. "Son of a bitch."
 
The damn thing was intent on preventing any simple method of getting rid of it. I studied the passing oblivious people, and I soon began walking along with the flow. Could there be some device, creature, or power here that might help? Experience told me that, when facing a threat beyond human capability, the best bet was to find an even worse threat and pit them against one another; between the balance of two terrors sat a sliver of hope. It was the same principle as the nuclear standoff between superpowers during the Cold War - the future of the human race had been predicated on the careful opposition of conflicting armageddons far more often than most people would care to know.
 
A haggard female voice interrupted my growing panic. "Don't move!"
 
I'd long ago learned to instantly follow any desperately shouted warnings. Freezing in place, I waited as the shouter continued making noise and approaching me from behind. She might have been coming to attack me, sure, but true human desperation was hard to fake. Not like that.
 
"Oh God!" she said again, grabbing the end of my jacket and pulling me directly backward. "I thought there was nobody left"
 
"Can I move now?" I asked her. "What's the danger?"
 
"Yeah, yeah, just don't go that way," she said quickly. "How've you made it this long?"
 
Looking ahead surreptitiously as I slowly turned to face her, I saw nothing ahead on the street except a few office entrances, a coffee shop, and a sandwich place with a bright red light out front that shone down on passersby. What unseen threat lay ahead that needed such warning? The stream of business men and women seemed to face no threat.

I froze. For a moment, a shadow passed over my soul.

The girl before me was as haggard as she'd sounded. Dressed in a tattered suit that had once been grey and clean, but which now bore dirt and rips in visible testament to homelessness, she seemed every bit the sole survivor I'd instantly envisioned upon hearing her desperate voice. Her wild shock of dirt-smeared hair hadn't been cleaned or combed in some time. "Christ, Christ almighty, I prayed, but I thought I thought I'd never see another person again"
 
Wary, I kept my eyes on her. "Are these not people?"
 
Underneath a furrowed brow, she narrowed her gaze. "Do they *seem* like people to you?"
 
I said nothing.
 
"They're all in there, still," she stated after a moment. "I stabbed one or two out of frustration a few years back. They come out of it just as they die. They're all thinking the same thing in there."
 
"In there?"
 
"In their heads." She looked around with compassion and fear. "They're screaming. All of them."
 
So, another apocalypse this world wasn't safe and normal after all.
 
While I hesitated, she looked to her right. "The hell is *that?*"
 
Silently, but quickly, I ran a cold-hearted evaluation of this unknown girl and her situation. The consideration was thus: how likely was it that a species-ending threat would remain active and wary long after it'd dominated the planet? No matter how fantastical, extradimensional, or incomprehensible a threat, one rule of logic had to remain. Time was a resource, motivation was a resource, and the combination had to be right for a threat to remain dangerous. If almost all humans were dead or controlled, there was no longer any point in maintaining active surveillance or traps. I'd already recently blundered through two such worlds where living humans had not been expected. I'd even read a book for several minutes in a room filled with invisible animated corpses - and gotten away with it. They'd been completely caught off guard.
 
But this girl represented a Catch-22. She was alive, therefore traps and surveillance might remain. If she was a trap, though, that meant that there were probably no free humans, and no need for traps.

"It's a portal to another universe," I told her, gently holding her back as she eagerly moved toward it. I decided to only tell half of the truth. "It'll kill you if you try to cross without me."
 
She seemed on the verge of tears as she gauged my unreadable expression. "Please"
 
"Quickly help me understand this world, and leave behind this book if I can," I told her, hefting the tome. "Then we'll go."

She pulled me into a nearby alley that I found to be disturbingly like the one I'd run through in the rain the week before. "It's -" she began, but she opened and closed her mouth in frustration without making any further sounds. "It won't let me talk about it."
 
I nodded slowly. It was never quite that easy, was it? I lifted the book. "This will tell me, then. I'm pretty sure it recounts, somehow, the final tales of those who've died nearby."
 
She watched with wide eyes as I began reading aloud. The tale of this unknown person might shed some light on the situation.

---

I remember the day the first one came out. People were lined up around the block to be the first to get it. It was just like any phone or tablet craze, except bigger. Who wouldn't want to erase the monotony of work from life?

I was never one for the latest trends. I decided to wait, and maybe save up some money for it.

You could tell the coworkers that were using it. They had slight half-smiles on their faces as they labeled, folded, typed, swept, and mopped. Any simple menial task became a time for lazy daydreaming as the iWorker took over basic motor functions. All you had to do was program it for the task by performing it yourself a couple times, and then, you could tune out, listen to a book on tape, or even sleep while your limbs worked.

It was a bit off-putting in a way I couldn't quite explain. Coworkers using the iWorker were zoned out or asleep, and the work floor got awful quiet awful fast. It was my job to direct the flow of boxes from our shipping warehouse, but I couldn't keep up with my unaware coworkers who worked on and on without getting tired, without smoke breaks, and without pauses for conversation or mental focus.

My gym, too, got weirdly quiet. People programmed their iWorkers for workouts, even they weren't supposed to, and happily got in the best shape of their lives without even being mentally present for the effort. Of course, a spate of people up and died who'd set theirs too ambitiously, but it was their own fault, or so the television said. The next iWorker would hook a little deeper and automatically sense when the body was being pushed too far.

I'd just save up for that one, I decided. I didn't want to die on the job because some idiot device didn't know not to carry boxes for eighteen hours straight without rest.

The third generation came out before I even got halfway to my savings goal. This one integrated wirelessly with our relatively new driverless cars, and so you could fit your car into your routines. There were people automating the whole drive to work and their entire shift *while they slept*, so they could wake up and have the evening and entire night to actually live.

Now that tempted me. I could have sold some stuff to join in on the trend. *I* wanted to sleep through work and have sixteen hours a day to hang out! Sounded damn pleasing, it did.

It was so pleasing, in fact, that it really started going global. They made 'em cheaper, and smaller, and less invasive to your neck and nerves. I would have gotten one then, but I hurt my back at work, and the medical bill wiped me out and put me in so much debt I still couldn't afford it. Worse, I'd damaged my spine, so there was a chance I'd never be able to use one, at least not any of the current models.

It was about then that the shifts started getting longer. Sixteen hours a day was quite a lot to hang out and party and relax, so people started signing on for longer shifts. More money, more leisure, right?

When I came back from medical leave, I lasted maybe two hours before my boss came around with that kind of shit-sorry look. I knew immediately. Everyone else in the warehouse was iWorking, moving around all silently with half-smiles on their faces, and they were all working sixteen-hour shifts. Here I was with a hurt back, moving slowly, working *inefficiently*, and I wanted the same pay as these diligent types?

I told him he could screw right off, even though I regretted my rudeness instantly. Still, I was out of a job, and I would soon have nowhere to go.

I spent the next few months at a shelter, along with many other injured types in my situation. The divide between those who could iWork and those who couldn't was huge - we were useless for modern jobs anymore. Those daydreaming types could work almost all day long without a word of complaint, and for lower and lower wages. What did you need money for when you were working almost all day long? What did you care what you got paid when you weren't even mentally present for the work? You just woke up for a few hours each night once you got home, watched a few TV shows, then clicked out again.

Repeat.

I'd been homeless for maybe a year when we heard the news: they'd invented an iWorker that anybody could use, regardless of injury. A lot of us saw that as salvation come to town.

By then, I hated the whole concept. Passion, that was me. Passion. I was the one standing on the corner shouting at sleepwalkers about their idiocies and inadequacies and iniquities.

Nobody heard.

Well, their ears heard, but there was nobody at the wheel.

Funny thing, though, this new model. It worked through the eyes. It was just *light.* You'd walk by one of these nodes on the street, or in a hallway, or at home, and it would program you the way you wanted. Visually stimulated neurons or some such science bullshit.

Well there's the thing. All the previous models needed to be recharged *eventually.* They were devices, just like a phone or a tablet, and they couldn't just go forever. These could. Suddenly, you've got these religious types advocating going on autonomous mode full-time - that's what they called it, then, because a bunch of other brands had come out by then, not just iWorker.

It was virtuous, they claimed, to work twenty-four hours a day. If you weren't present for the work, you avoided suffering, and if you were working, you were contributing. It's free contribution, you see? Perfect virtue. A world without suffering, but with endless productivity.

One by one, our little homeless community dwindled. I'd run into Jeff, or Sarah, or Jorge, or Yuya, and they'd suddenly turned into clean-cut model workers. They didn't recognize me. Of course not. They were asleep.

At some point, watching these light-programmers getting installed all over, it occurred to me: the companies that produced these things were all full of labor using the devices. Everyone at these goddamn hypno-crafters was asleep, walking around in bodies that were endlessly toiling away putting up more light-programmers, marketing light-programmers, building better light-programmers it was a thing in itself. The thing would just keep going and going, and maybe it had been that way since the start, and we'd all just bought into it like fools.

Street by street, this city got quiet. I imagine they're all like that. Nobody talking, nobody interacting, nobody living - they're all just working. You got to work twenty-four hours a day to survive on a dollar an hour and you can't work twenty-four hours a day without being on the Autonomous Mode.

I learned to avoid the lights. I don't want that shit in my brain. I steal whatever I need, because nobody cares. Nobody's watching. There are no police anymore, because there's no crime anymore. Other than me, that is. The whole world's running around with more hustle and bustle than ever before, but the whole world's asleep and deader than I've ever seen.

Two years. Three? It didnt snow last winter global warming? I can't be sure what day it is anymore. They don't run on clocks and such anymore. All their Autonomous shit is wireless now. They sit near computers that don't even have monitors and just type on keyboards without even seeing.

Another year after that wandering around in a zombie city I must have lost it for a bit.

I saw one die.

He came out of it just toward the end. All he could do was scream. He just screamed, and screamed, and screamed, at the top of his lungs

But it was *what* he was screaming that terrified me so: *thank you.*

He was screaming *thank you.*

I saw another one die. Soul-chilling shit. They're all in there, still, and they can't stop anymore. I don't even know when that happened, exactly.

But the system, see, it'd gotten self perpetuating, that's the word. The cycle I'd recognized had been true, and growing stronger. And it didn't like people like me lurking around its edges, stealing things, stabbing people, and mucking up efficiency.

They grabbed me maybe a week after the second stabbing. Forced me into one of those bright red programmer lights on the street. By then it wasn't a choice anymore, and it could just straight tell you what to do in the name of efficiency.

I've been wandering the streets ever since. I've got a job I do twenty-four hours a day now. I do what I'm good at; what I did before. I'm just me, I'm just homeless, and I find other loose minds like my own and NO!

It didn't work. Not entirely. The old spinal injury kept me half-immune, and they don't know I know. I'm a horrible liar half the time, and a free mind the other half. Never listen to anything I say. My thoughts aren't my own. I sense it out there, a gigantic mind behind the control, with a plan beyond insidious and evil, and I can use its eloquent words sometimes. But that's not true, and the sad thing is, it's just humans who did this to ourselves. Efficiency, efficiency

I wandered the streets for five years like that, so alone, so alone so alone I met someone who seemed free on the street today, and I was free for just a little bit, and I shouted -

---

I looked up at her.

Her jaw trembled, and her eyes ran misty.

This wasn't the tale of someone dead at all. I listened to the noises of the busy city street outside our alley, and, for the first time, I noted the complete lack of human voices. There was only the sound of machines and walking a rhythm I now found to be completely lifeless and hollow. I stared at her for a long moment, unsure what to do. "Can I trust you?"

She tilted her head down a few degrees, screwed up her face, and let a few tears run free. "No."

"So it's probably not a good idea if I let you come with me."

She clenched her fists, and I saw a single drop of blood eke out from her excessive grip. "I'd try to build one," she gasped. "Eventually. The plans are in my head it wants me to"

There was nothing else I could say unless "You can still help me," I said quietly, noting her intense strain to hold onto her own will. "I need a first generation iWorker device. The absolute most basic, no mind control, no networking."

She nodded, eager to be helpful in any way possible to any entity that was not the *It* that controlled everyone else. She ran to a nearby dumpster and pulled at a rusty panel. "Here, here " She pulled out several circular devices and picked at them until the least damaged remained. "You stick it behind your ear, right here, and just do and it'll pick up on it."

"Thank you," I told her, studying the device. If this thing could control a body without the mind interfering, perhaps it could help us leave the perception-altering book in another universe. I pocketed it, and then faced her. Never make promises, I knew. Never make promises. I couldn't tell her she would be alright. "I'm sorry"

Blood poured from her clenched fists as she squeezed her long nails harder and harder into her palms, momentarily clearing her thoughts. "It's alright. I'm glad there are still free people."

I nodded, and then departed.

"Come back," she called, just as I rounded the corner. "I was lying. There's nothing weird about the lights at all."

*Goddamnit.*

"You still have the book?" my second asked as I stepped back into the forest. "Damn."

"Watch your language," I told him. I drew the iWorker out of my pocket and brought it up for the kids to see. "I couldn't leave the book, but - this just might be our ticket." I looked back and saw the homeless girl lurking at the other side of the portal, watching us with a neutral half-smile. I wished that I'd had the courage to kill her and free her from her invisible prison. If it had been anyone else, maybe...

Thomas, the younger boy who'd once followed me into another world, was also present. He was old enough to pick up on my momentarily visible sadness. "Who's that girl?"

I turned away, unable to watch her any longer. "Nobody"

After carefully applying my thumb to the red glass surface to leave several natural smudges, I carefully pressed the panel into the metal frame I'd devised. Once the transparent crimson rectangle was firmly in place, I tapped the center.

Tap.

Tap.

*Tap.*

That one did it: the glass cracked right up the middle, offsetting each half by a barely perceptible degree. It was a very slight malformation, but that was the point. I attached the framed glass to a metal rod and positioned it just so measuring the placement of the nearby mirror and camera, I made sure everything was in place.

I stepped out of the room and closed the door behind me. The string attached to the door pulled the covering away, revealing my object of study only once I'd left the room.

A lanky and bespectacled boy of about thirteen stood in the next room, clearly surprised to see me. "What are you doing here?"

"What are *you* doing here?" I asked back, glancing around at the empty and dust-filled chambers of the abandoned house I'd slipped into.

"Is this your house?" he asked.

"Absolutely not. That wouldn't be safe at all." I moved to a single rickety table I'd salvaged as a place to put my laptop and reader device. I gave the system one more run-through before I turned on the camera in the next room.

He stepped a little closer, looking at my laptop screen from afar. "What's that?"

"It's a journal I found in another universe," I replied, carefully directing the makeshift page-turner I'd created. "But I suspect it's a cognitive hazard. I dropped it, but then still had it with me later. I even brought it back here to our world very stupid move."

He gave a small nervous laugh. "You're weird." He took one step closer. "Why's it red like that?"

"Don't read it directly," I warned him. "The book is in the next room. I've reflected its image off of a mirror, through a smudged and offset spectrum filter, into a camera, which sends the image to this computer upside down remember, it's backwards, too, because of the mirror, so what we see here has many obfuscations and errors to protect our minds. Finally, I built a custom OCR program to translate the malformed text to this device."

Eyes wide, he came fully forward and touched the rather battered device directly. "What's it do?"

"It's a Braille reader."

He laughed for real this time. "That's an awful lot to read some book, right?"

"You can never be too safe. I suggest you tell the other kids in the neighborhood about this technique, given their habit of stealing things from other universes."

He took a step back. "I don't really talk to the other kids much"

"But you've been through that portal in the woods?"

"Yeah"

"Can you tell me anything about it?" I asked, running my hands along the Braille reader as I did so.

Christ.

*menace butler outvoice snubbiest pigsticker unallayed nephrectomising reappropriation nefarious peninsularism commence psychedelia osmeteria guthrie*

Even through all the safeguards, errors, and translation into Braille - which was normally the holy grail of hazard filters - the book was insane gibberish. I'd first seen it as a journal filled with diary-like musings and random doodles it was only pure luck that I hadn't read anything but the last entry. That account had made sense of the empty world I'd visited, and its apocalypse by hungry darkness entity. Had that part of the book been fake, too? What, then, had killed everyone?

But I'd seen the half-disintegrated corpses. That much, at least, had to have been true. Had the unknown girl who'd written those things somehow added to the end of the book without realizing what it was? Or had it acquired cognitohazardous properties after she was already dead?

"The portal was just *there* one day," the boy explained. "I was walking and ran into a bunch of younger and older kids throwing things into it. Guys dared each other, sure, but nobody was that stupid. We threw stuff into it, even made a big rope and let a stray dog run around in there. It seemed safe after awhile. Only thing, though. It goes somewhere new every morning. We don't know what would happen if we were still inside at night."

So, it was as I'd suspected.

Holding a box, my eyes closed, I crept into the next room and closed the cardboard flaps around the book. I only opened my eyes once it was safely sealed within.

"Is it safe now?" the boy asked.

"As safe as it can be, with barebones tools," I told him, heading for the front door with the box under my arm. "Well, are you coming along?"

He was, apparently. He followed maybe ten or twenty feet behind me as I headed through the old Dodson lot and back into the old-growth forests beyond the last row of suburban houses. The Blue Ridge Mountains towered on the horizon as I crested the abrupt hill just shy of the portal. For a moment, I could see above the treescape, and I scanned the distance out of habit - but noticed nothing anomalous.

Several children, ranging from young to upper teens, sat around the portal. They all froze as I approached, clearly fearing that their secret had finally been discovered by the adults, but I ignored their apprehension. "What do we have today?"

The oldest boy, probably seventeen or eighteen years of age, stood slowly. "It's a bad one." Instinctively responding to my implicit authority, he waited.

I peered through the vast oval rift.

This time, the portal had opened into an area too small to contain it. Before me, I saw three spaces: a gloom-filled and empty restaurant, a rain-filled alley filled with strewn trash, and the back section of some sort of office - also dark and empty. The sky, visible only above the alley in the middle portion, sat opaque and stormy. The entire scene was eerily quiet, and I realized that sound did not travel back through the rift. "What's so bad about this one?"

"Wait for it."

I did wait. A moment later, lightning flickered quietly, revealing the terrible secret of this new world. "I see." I looked down at the box under my arm. This thing needed to go before it had a chance to do whatever it was capable of. I began running through scenarios in my head, judging the likelihood of an active threat this long after every human on that planet had died horribly.

A moment later, I stepped through the rift.

I looked back and saw the forest and the assorted kids. Their images ran hazy from the rain pouring down the front of the portal. It wasn't lost on me: matter and energy native to this world seemed to have a passive inability to cross to ours.

Staying close to the alley wall to dodge the worst of the rain, I stepped gingerly over the places the lightning had shown me to avoid. I paused once I reached the street, and peered both directions for a few moments. 

Another flash of lightning struck, this time followed by tremendous thunder that shook my very bones. Under this second round of flashing, I saw them again: corpses, strewn all about the alley and street. Huddled masses had fled this direction and been cut down without mercy. Tragic enough, certainly, but odd for another reason their rotting remains were invisible when not under direct illumination.

I crept into the restaurant with a pounding heart. An ancient and decayed smell filled the humid gloom. I moved through an empty dining area and searched through several cabinets in the back until I found a flashlight. Knocking and turning it until it finally came on, I shined the light around.

Under the beam of my flashlight, almost every seat in the empty dining area held a corpse, either hunched or yawning depending on the direction it had fallen. I had only managed to avoid touching them by sheer luck. Little twisting blackened strings of fungus and rot were all that remained on their plates, a fitting feast for the dead. 

Almost every position had been served a plate of delicacies now long past identifiable. I chose a chair that had not been served and carefully placed my box down. The box had grown warm the moment I'd entered this world, and I was curious.

Scooting the cardboard aside, I laid the book out on the table and flipped it open from the back to avoid any hazardous contents in the front. I sought only the last entry, which I knew from experience to be reasonably safe to read. I'd had a suspicion that its contents would be different here and I was right.

I was on a date at my favorite restaurant. I was even having a good time. I don't know what happened she and I ran into Jen. Now, she'd never liked Jen, but she put on a good face for the conversation. If I hadn't been so oblivious, I would have guessed she didn't really want to change our plans and go to that stupid party with Jen.

I've never *really* liked parties. Not *really*. I always get self-conscious, and my brain gets all tired trying to keep up with all the things I keep imagining other people are thinking or saying or expecting. Pretty soon, I always just want to go home. I can't go home, though, because I need a good *excuse* to leave a believable one, so that people won't secretly judge me.

I got my excuse, I guess, when Jen died.

I wasn't sure what happened. Nobody was sure. She was always a party girl - had she overdosed? She was bleeding pretty profusely from the nose, and she'd fallen and gotten terrible slashes up her back but she'd been locked in the bathroom, and nobody had found her until it was too late.

My date insisted we leave when the commotion started, and I agreed wholeheartedly. On the way out, I heard a very odd cry: "*She's gone - her body's gone!*" - but I wasn't sure what to make of it.

On the walk home, I apologized profusely, but she just seemed scared. Two blocks down, we saw a group of people huddled around another body.

It was then that I felt something chill and sharp move by me - but I turned, and saw nothing. I had the inexplicable sense that I was very close to something large and menacing, but the night-darkened street seemed normal, save for the worried people calling emergency services.

Another few blocks down, my date and I stood under a streetlight and waited for the bus.

We decided to keep moving when a homeless man on the other side of the road seemed to fall rather roughly. Blood splattered up as if he'd but it didn't make sense why were all these people having terrible accidents?

Just after we kept walking, I looked back, and - for a split second - I thought I saw something moving toward us. It was a mere blink against the streetlight we'd just abandoned, and it was gone almost immediately, but I quietly insisted we walk a little faster.

Four police cars surged past us, lights afire and sirens blazing. In the rotating red and blue, I thought I could make out a weird blur behind us on the sidewalk, but my eyes just couldn't make sense of it.

---

I looked up from the book. The boy I'd talked to earlier had followed me. "You shouldn't be here."

"*You're* here," he replied, standing by the door and peering out into the storm.

I shrugged. As long as he didn't come further in, he wouldn't risk running into the rotting bodies dotting the restaurant. How far behind me had he been? Did he know about them?

I looked down to find that the story had skipped part of the narrative. There was a small gap where I'd stopped reading, and no text in between. Odd but, then again, this wasn't just a book, and these weren't just written words

---

She slammed the door behind us just as something bashed angrily on the other side. "What the hell is going on?" she screamed.

I helped her force it shut, and I locked it with a relieved sigh. "I have no idea, but we can hole up here until until the police do something." The door to my apartment was solid and sturdy, containing a heavy sheet of metal as a form of security most campus houses shared. I had no windows on the first floor; instead, stairs went straight up to my apartment on the second floor. Never was I more thankful for my cramped brick-and-metal entryway.

Dashing upstairs and closing and locking the door to the stairwell, we took refuge in my bedroom and turned on my small television.

Static. There was only static.

Our cellphones didn't work, either, and the Internet was out

It was then we really started to think we were screwed.

Deciding to turn off the lights so as to avoid drawing attention to our location, we sat and peered out the windows into the night.

Clouds covered the moon. Trees swayed in chilly autumn winds. Nothing living seemed to move

"There!" she whispered, pointing down the street.

I saw nothing.

"It was under the streetlight for just a second" she said, trembling as she clung to my arm.

I had to confess, despite the terrible things happening, part of me was still happy "Wait, I saw something under a streetlight, too. And when the cops passed, and the lights -"

The lights. Something had brushed past me in the dark, and something had pounded on our door just as we'd gotten inside but I had no porch light.

Intently, I stared at the closest streetlight until it happened.

Something horrible and twisted shambled past, visible only under the strongest part of the streetlight's glow. It was gone almost as soon as I realized I was really seeing something.

"Do you smell that?" my date asked, almost at the same time that I realized we'd made a terrible mistake in turning off all the lights.

In the very dim orange glow from the streetlights outside, I noticed a dark stain on the carpet near my roommate's bed. What if one of those things *had already gotten inside here before we arrived?* I jumped up and flipped all the lights on, illuminating each room in the apartment with a heart-freezing moment of terror.

The last light, the one in the kitchen, finally revealed it. It'd been on the other side of the apartment from us, and we'd stayed quiet, but now it knew we were there. It came for me with a demonic and wholly inhuman grin.

I shouted, ran for the front door, and pulled my date through as she came to meet me. I knew what these things were, now, and I knew we were doomed but I still managed to grab the emergency flashlight from the front staircase.

We burst forth from the heavy door, shoving the creature there aside, and I hesitated only long enough to shine my flashlight at it and get a good look.

I'd guessed right.

We took off running into the night, but screams were already ringing out from multiple nearby streets. We could seek shelter, seek food, seek safety, but from the horrors I'd seen, I knew there was nowhere to hide.

That, and it wasn't cloudy at all. From out here, we could better see the reflected glow from the city's lights. There was no Moon, not because of clouds, but because something massive was blocking out the entire sky. The dim twinkles I'd mistaken for stars were in fact the city's own light reflected from some sort of massive structure arching over us from horizon to horizon. Not a ship, not a building it seemed more like *a leg*

But none of that mattered, after what I already knew. I didn't have the heart to tell my date as we picked a basement to huddle in, but we'd seen the creature pursuing us before.

It had followed us from the party.

It was - or had been - Jen.

Twisted, bloody, and visible only in direct light but it was her, no doubt, without any trace of humanity left within.

---

I looked up as the implications of that statement sank in. "Hey kid," I whispered, as quietly as I could. "What's your name?"

"Thomas" he whispered back, emulating me out of worry. "What's up?"

"We really have to go, and you can't make a sound"

"Why?"

I stood slowly, shaking my head. I couldn't tell him that we were sitting in a room full of invisible corpses that were anything *but* dead. Ever so slowly, I stepped between the tables, heading for the front door.

Creaks echoed around me as unseen joints began snapping, cracking, and moving.

Although I could see he was terrified, Thomas knew better than to make any noise. I listened carefully to the movement around me: were they simply reacting, or were they certain of my presence? I took one quiet step at a time until I saw chairs began to move back as their unseen occupants stood.

I broke into a run, and I pointed toward the door. Thomas wasted no time in rushing out and into the rain, but he almost immediately tripped on invisible rotted piles of flesh. Picking him up, I waited, heart threatening to thump out of my chest, until the next flash of lightning revealed a path forward.

He saw the bodies strewn about - he saw that they were starting to move and awaken - but I grabbed his mouth and kept him from screaming. Now that he knew, I used my flashlight, shining it hurriedly around us to - *shit!*

The beam shined across a moving circle of decayed flesh; hundreds of unseen corpses approached through the streets, like ghosts in the rain. I shined the flashlight ahead, illuminating our path, and we splashed through heavy puddles and leapt over clawing rotten hands.

Pushing down the alleyway as the rain intensified, we ran back through the portal at full speed.

Pausing in the safety of the forest to catch my breath, I turned and looked back.

The alley sat clear and empty until a flash of lightning illuminated an endless legion of living corpses, all standing still and gazing at us. They made no move to enter the rift, but that didn't make me feel any better. Beyond them, up in the sky I'd made the same mistake as the doomed man and his date. Those weren't clouds - just the reflection of other parts of the sky on vast metal, impossibly high chrome, and it began moving as we watched

The children all around screamed and flinched as a silent but tremendous impact on the other side threw mountains of rubble across the portal. Moments later, it was buried, and showed only onto the impenetrable blackness of layers of rock and dirt. We, however, remained perfectly safe. Only the other side of the portal had been buried, and I was certain it would simply open on a new destination the next day without interruption.

"Are you alright?" the oldest boy asked me.

"That was so cool!" the other kids exclaimed, gathering around Thomas. "What did you see over there?"

Enjoying the attention, he began smiling and telling them exactly what had happened. There was no need for embellishment.

"I'm fine," I told my lone listener, shaking water out of my hair. I looked down as I did so. "Goddamnit"

Without realizing it, I'd brought the book back again. Had it been in my hand through the whole escape?

I set my jaw. I'd try again tomorrow.

	<TEXT> I'd instinctually noticed something wrong with the neighborhood for several days before my brooding focus lifted long enough for me to truly grow curious.

Standing and walking out from the porch where I'd been sitting, I approached three children that were huddled around some sort of object.

"What do you have there?"

Immediately, the children dropped their object of interest and bolted.

I scanned the street, but nobody else was around at this time of day. The object they'd dropped was a *book* - and that was the odd thing. I'd recently seen children walking around with half-hidden books, magazines, and even *newspapers.* That might have been normal in my day, but modern children were obsessed with their phones and video games. Why were they all walking around with artifacts of the written word?

A Tale of Two Cities I dusted it off, flipped it over, scanned the front and back opened it up, nothing inside flipped to the first page

*It was the worst of times, it was the best of times, it was the age of foolishness, it was the age of wisdom*

I frowned. It was technically correct, but the phrases were out of order. "Hey! Where did you get this?"

The darting children rounded a distant corner without more than giggles and screams.

Patience. I had it, they didn't. I watched from the porch for the next several days, waiting for the right moment. It came without much fanfare: an older boy walked past with several of his friends in tow. None of them looked down the row of bushes in the yard that led to me; none of them were concerned by my presence.

I followed them nearly a block behind. They did look back at several points, confirming my suspicions about a neighborhood secret, but I casually evaded their worried scans. They turned into the old Dodson lot, now overgrown with heavy brush, and I followed them beyond into thicker Virginia woodlands that lay untouched past the edge of our suburb.

It sat right off the edge of an old trail, flanked by centennial trees. There was no weird device, no flaring energies, no fanfare at all - just an odd and highly irregular oval of blurred space. Beyond sat a suburban street lined by houses.

I actually wasn't too surprised. I'd had several days to think and guess, and what else could it have been but a portal to another dimension?  Neighborhood kids weren't about to order books printed with strange malformations, but they would certainly trade around oddities from another universe. The boys ahead had disappeared into the vast breach, and I'd seen children acting oddly for weeks, so I assumed there was little threat from biological contamination. We'd have all been dead much sooner if there was any threat of that.

I hadn't seen any suspicious activity at night. Best to be back by nightfall. The kids might have found out something about the behavior of the portal, and they'd probably spent weeks poking at it before daring to go through. There was every chance it disappeared at night, or maybe it changed destinations, stranding anyone on the other side. I hadn't heard of any missing children, so I guessed that they'd taken the appropriate precautions.

Peering beyond, I tried to notice anything out of the ordinary before crossing the threshold, but it looked like any other suburban town.

I stepped through, noting no unusual sensations. The bridge between dimensions seemed to be stable enough.

The moment I crossed, I realized that there was a problem: the portal back was a ten-foot-long jagged oval, and it was sitting in the middle of the street.

There was no commotion no hub-bub  no one had noticed a portal to another universe hanging around and blocking traffic. That meant that this portal was new to this location, this suburb was newly built and empty or very old and abandoned, or everyone here was already dead.

Straining my ears to listen to the absolute quiet, I gradually began leaning toward that most grim analysis.

The closest houses to the portal had broken windows. What time was it? A little past noon? The neighborhood kids had clearly begun systematically looting, but it was impossible to tell whether this was a new daily location, or whether the portal only went here.

And why had the portal been created at all? There seemed to be no significance on either end.

I heard the older kids smashing about in one of the nearby dwellings, so I chose a quick direction, and I soon came to houses that had not been broken into. Carefully eyeing the vector of the portal's backwards emanation, I came to a split-level house that was unremarkable except that a hole had been carved out of one wall of a size that matched the expanding cone of the rift.

A strong breeze at my back, I approached the repeatedly swaying front door. If it wasnt already closed by the wind - yes, the wood near the knob had been ruptured by someone who had been very desperate to either escape or get inside. I stepped across the threshold only to crunch across glass. After clearing several corners in the living room and kitchen beyond, I backed into a safe area and looked up. As I'd guessed, every light bulb that I could see had been purposely broken.

What the hell had happened in this house?

"I know you wrote it down," I said to the still and silent darkness. "You always do."

As if in response to my cynicism, the darkness offered up a book sitting quietly among shards of broken glass. Carefully picking it up and cleaning it off, I flipped through half of it, skipping past random illustrations and musings to find the most recent writings.

write down *everything*

[tear drop stain]-omething is outside our house. We're sitting now. Nothing more can be done. All we can do now is wait.

We first noticed it somewhere around 1 AM in the morning. David came over right about that time, and he says he saw something weird with one of the neighbor's houses, but he didn't know what to make of it. Ryan and I were here housesitting, but did not notice anything strange until 2 AM. It began with an eerie sense of unease. We were in the basement ~~watching a show on a laptop,~~ playing cards~~?~~

David felt it too, and thought he heard something. We went to the windows. It was a very dark night. Clouds covered the moon. The back yard was lit only by two floodlights from the property across the way, and very thick fog rolled across the long expanses of grass and bushes. We saw a few lit panes in the house directly opposite ours, and, through other windows, we saw a few lights on in a neighbor's house. Something seemed off about the shared back yards - something horribly and innately *wrong* - but it was impossible to say what.

We went around the house closing and locking every window and turning on every light. For awhile, it made us feel safe. We clung low, peering out between the blinds, each of us trying to figure out why the back yards terrified us so.

I had the strangest idea, before it even happened, that there was something wrong with the lights outside. I watched the two flood lights far off and to the left, and then I watched the lit window directly opposite us that seemed to be weirdly bulging and changing shape as I stared. Was it just a trick of the light? The crossbar seemed to be moving up and up and up until there was no way I was imagining it

We knew for sure when our neighbor two houses down came out to let out his dog. We heard it barking, and we rushed to the side windows, watching from total darkness. Ryan slid the window open just enough to shout *go inside! It's not safe!*, even though we didn't know for sure

A third floodlight came on abruptly three houses down; an angled and bright light that usually lit up many of our backyards. The back porch light our unaware neighbor had turned on. suddenly went dark. A strangled cry rang out, the dog squealed in horrible pain, and we slammed our window shut in terror.

There was something out there.

Ryan suggested that it was some large and fast-moving creature that had been lurking between us and the third floodlight.

David peered out the window, offering no ideas.

I sat in a corner, trying not to hyperventilate. We'd been afraid, definitely, but there'd been no proof until until

"There!" David whispered. "It moved again!"

We practically planted our faces against the glass. Our hapless neighbor's porch light was back on, and the middle floodlight across the way was out. Darkness dominated the space between our backyards.

"What's it shaped like?" Ryan asked, confused.

David just shook his head as he peered intently at the night.

To block out that high-set floodlight, the *thing* out there either had to be very tall, or very close

Gasping, I pulled them both down just as the windows began to rattle.

We hid in the corner beneath the windows, not daring to move until the rattling stopped.

Eventually, David peeked.

As he did so, screams rang out from the house opposite ours. We peeked, too, and we saw that the weirdly morphing window had gone dark. All the other lights outside were on at full strength.

"It's jumping from light to light" David breathed, looking rather sick. We watched intently as his guess proved true: one light came on, another went out, and our neighbors within that light screamed in pain and terror and went silent.

"Turn off all the lights," I whispered, my heart pounding. "We have to break all our lights."

David stayed at the window and brought out his cellphone to call the police. Ryan and I hurried through the house, smashing light bulbs with shaking hands.

"I'm so sorry," Ryan said quietly as we met up back in the kitchen, now cloaked in darkness. "I just wanted to hang out with you, and then this"

I touched his arm. "It's crazy, I know, but it's not your fault. There's stories, always stories"

I remember our words, because screams came from the basement, and we rushed through the house -

Pitch black radiated from a rectangle on the floor, darker even than the non-light of the basement at night. I realized our mistake at the same moment that I saw half of David lying in silhouette on the floor: with all our other lights broken, the entity had jumped to the glow of his cellphone. An expanding rectangular cone of utter darkness lined the space from the phone on the floor to the ceiling.

Ryan and I froze, not daring to move. What *was* this thing? Could it see? Could it think? Was it aware of us at all?

Time wore on, and every muscle in my still body began to burn to its limit. If we made no sound, if we made no move, would we survive?

As I felt myself about to break, light flashed by our windows.

"Police!" someone shouted. "If there's anybody back here, identify yourselves and step out!"

A few moments later, the void was gone from our basement, and bloodcurdling screams echoed outside. A loud gunshot followed.

Ryan and I plugged up all the windows with blankets and pillows as best we could, then huddled in the basement.

I thought to peer out with just my eye exposed and watch the thing leap from light to light in search of more victims. Forty-five seconds. It never jumps sooner than forty-five seconds since the last. It barely missed Mr. Jeffers, our neighbor, who I can see hiding in the basement next to ours. If it could have jumped sooner and *gotten* him, it would have

It revels in the play of light and dark outside. That is its strength: it needs light, but, without darkness, it has no place to hide.

We just have to get to morning, and everything will be alright

The half of David that was outside the cone of blackness is starting to smell

5 AM

6 AM

Almost sunrise

come on

No no, it couldn't

I can see the sky lightening, but it couldn't

It couldn't jump to *the Sun,* could it?

oh God

We're going to try to get it to jump to a cellphone again, then trap it in the laundry room - no windows, no escape

I'm so sorry

---

Sorry for what? I would never know. I dropped the journal, as the rest of it was blank.

Moving further into the house, wary of unwarranted darkness, I quietly descended the steps into the basement. All the high and narrow windows within sat plugged by pillows and blankets, except for one.

Half of a rotting corpse lay decaying in one corner. Covering my mouth and nose with my shirt, I moved further in.

There it was: a single door, shut, with no other means of access. That must have been the laundry room.

I opened the door carefully, even though I knew the entity was already gone. A single rotting hand lay within, holding a dead cellphone. Grey cinder blocks formed the walls - a small beam of light filtered through a crack in the foundation. That was how the thing had escaped.

"Ah, you never really had a chance"

I took a towel from the dryer and threw it over the remaining hand, the best burial these people would ever get.

I left the house without another word, and proceeded back toward the rift. Had the darkness entity somehow bored through the wall and opened the portal? Perhaps that was how it had arrived here in the first place but if it had come to our world, it'd only entered straight into a cloud-covered forest at night, found itself without a light source, and evaporated on the spot. A miscalculation in the most ironic degree

Or so I assumed, since neighborhood children were playing with the rift instead of being annihilated.

Or, perhaps, the rift on this side had gone somewhere else at the time. It was impossible to say, at least until tomorrow.

I didn't normally entertain such grim thoughts, but I couldn't help but wonder, as I stepped back into my own universe, what it must have been like for the people on this world to look up and see their Sun turning black only to find themselves disintegrating a moment later. Friends, family, neighbors, all screaming in terror and confusion

And the rest of the world, slowly rotating into a lethal sunrise with nothing but silence to warn them

Curious. I thought I'd dropped this journal back at the house shrugging, I tucked it under one arm and began walking home, my thoughts bitter and brooding. Hopefully, tomorrow, the portal will go somewhere new and I'll have something to occupy my time.

	<TITLE> Ebola mutation sends virus airborne; millions already unknowingly infected </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-12 09:50:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I froze as I saw the title, my boredom instantly dispelled by shock.

One click brought me to a full page article detailing warnings and revelations released by the CDC. I skimmed through quickly: ebola airborne, infection rate dramatically increased a new longer incubation period people didn't know they were sick and infecting others I scanned the title again, not believing my eyes. An inset picture showed large numbers of government vehicles and men in white clean-suits cordoning off a series of quarantine tents at an airport. The image was inset above a list of the first places where the virus arrived from overseas.

Like any Internet veteran, I immediately opened a new tab and did a Google search to confirm that this wasn't the Onion, or some sort of hoax.

Nothing came up.

Dour and highly unamused, I tabbed back to the article. I should have known: it was dated a month in the future. That should have given it away immediately, but, like a proper mark, I'd been too caught up in the serious subject matter to notice.

Now annoyed, I began studying the page for the prankster's signature. I found nothing. Curiously, the sidebar held a series of articles with titles that made less and less sense the more I studied them. These article titles, too, seemed to be about things that hadn't happened yet, including the outcome of a football game I knew was still coming up.

I right-clicked and opened these articles in new tabs, but the links were bad, and I found nothing. 

Weirded out, I bookmarked the original article but soon forgot about it.

It wasn't until the next weekend that I remembered the article during a sudden surge of adrenaline. I was watching the game at my friend's house, and the score came out to exactly the total I'd remembered. Not quite believing my own fears, I rushed back to my home and found that bookmark I'd saved.

Just like the other links, the bookmark to the article about the virus led nowhere. It was as if the page had never been there.

Had I somehow loaded an article from the future? Was somebody looking out for humanity, giving me a chance to warn someone? I found the line to call to report incidents to the CDC, but, while the numbers sat in my phone, entered but undialed, I sat staring at the wall in horror. I'd remembered the exact score of the football game from the sidebar title, but *what airports had been listed under that quarantine image?*

No matter how hard I tried to recall, the names simply would not come. Even when I did think of some, I wasn't sure they were the ones that'd been listed, or just airport names that I'd remembered at random.

I checked cached pages, both on my computer and online, but nothing had saved the mysterious article. Without specific information, my warning would come off as crazy, and I'd be ignored.

There was nothing to do but wait, and hope that I'd hallucinated the whole thing. If somebody out there had been trying to give humanity a chance, they'd picked the wrong medium. Finding news from the future was more likely to happen than somebody actually reading an entire article.

I went to the window and tightened the seal a bit before returning to my chair. My heart was pounding in fear of what might be coming, sure, but what else was I going to do? I couldn't start panicking and hoarding based on some weird incident on the Internet.

I began scrolling through links again, tense and bored. </TEXT>

It was pure dumb luck that I didn't have explosives on me that morning. It was the only trip back into town that day that I'd decided to take a short rest. I was feeling incredibly strong and energetic lately, but slogging through swamp and climbing underground for nearly a week straight had been taking a toll.

Two men stood outside my door as I approached. One was slightly taller than the other, with a near buzzcut, and the other wore a hat. Both wore sunglasses, and both stood as if they'd knocked only a moment ago. One turned around and eyed me suspiciously. The other noticed, turned, and called my name. They were dressed plainly enough, but it was immediately obvious that they were no mere citizens.

"Yes?" I asked, stopping a few feet away.

The smaller man with the hat angled his head up slightly to look me in the eyes. "Doesn't this guy's file say he's five-ten?"

The taller one snickered. "Looks five-ten to me, buddy."

"Shove it."

"You been out hunting, friend?" the smaller one continued, noticing my dirty clothes. I had to give it to him: he actually sounded sincerely amicable, even though I knew he was feigning an easy manner to put me off guard.

I said nothing, wondering if anything I said would only get me caught in a lie.

"Look, we're not here in an official capacity not yet," the taller man said, stepping a bit closer. "There's been well, let's call it a logistical issue, for now. A rather large amount of explosives is missing from a site your construction company is working on. Homeland Security doesn't like missing explosives."

"Have you noticed any of your coworkers expressing anti-American sentiment?" the shorter man picked up the flow without missing a beat. "Perhaps some of the illegals you work with?" He gave a light smile. "Relax. We know. There are tons of immigrants and stowaways coming here all the time, taking jobs and the like. You wouldn't defend a possible terrorist, would you?"

I'd hoped for one more day before the missing explosives were noticed. Now was the absolute worst time to get caught I was well aware of the date, *October 2nd*, possibly the last day of existence for the human race.

"I kid, I kid," he said, after a beat. "But, in all seriousness, if you have anything to do with those missing explosives, you should tell us now. It'll go easier for you. Your boss said you've been taking work off sick this week. You don't look sick."

With the vector of his probing changing constantly, I found myself unable to come up with a plausible lie that I could defend against so many questions. Was that his intent? The gears of my thoughts turned furiously as I tried to see a way out of this that might - *wait*

I took one step forward, and both men straightened warily in response. "Do you have pull with the military?"

Having never gotten such a response before, the smaller man's jaw went slack for a split second. "What, why?"

"Do you know something?" his companion asked, suddenly serious.

If these men had access to more serious tools of destruction, perhaps there was a way forward after all. Our plan had been cobbled together with materials we could steal, Googled knowledge, and desperation, and was not at all guaranteed to work. "It's a long story, but I need you to listen to all of it. Word for word. It's important."

The taller man nodded, his expression hard and unreadable. "Go ahead."

I recounted the events leading up to today as best I could, and then began telling them about my last few days including the truth of what we'd found.

---

I stood at the threshold of the massive cave with my brother, staring out across a valley of blood and brain matter lit by pulsing white energy born by a weird organic star set in the vast cavernous ceiling distant and above.

Ive seen this before, he murmured.

I turned my head sharply. What? When?

He took a deep breath, and then looked away, unable to face me. In dreams. When I was ah high.

I resisted the urge to push him off our white ropey bridge of living matter. I took a very different kind of deep breath before responding. You saw this?

He nodded. I hated being alive. I still do. I dont know if it was me or this thing.

What does *that* mean?

He was either unable or unwilling to speak further on the subject. I let the issue go. He was never good with words. For that matter, I was never that good myself not until repeated encounters with the energy here. I felt sharper and stronger in myriad unclassifiable ways - I had the words to describe exactly how I felt, and the motions to carry out exactly what I wanted to do. Life hadnt always felt this way.

We carried on deeper into the cavern along our living bridge. He shined his flashlight down often, staring in disgust at the rivers of blood, hills of brain matter, and intermittent ropes of what looked like skin growing like weird vines between. "You weren't kidding. Is Hugh right, do you think? Is this the reservoir of living stuff it uses to heal people?"

"Seems likely," I responded absently, my eyes up ahead. The living white bridge went off past the limit of my flashlight, but I could tell that it was beginning to curve up. I'd also noticed, after a second trip down, that a thousand other white tendrils extended out through the cave system, all originating at the pulsing source in the underground sky.

"Do you think there are teeth down there?" my brother asked, leaning a bit too far. In slow motion, the white cords underneath his shoes squished and gave just enough to tip him over.

Quickly moving to the curved edge, I reached down. "Come on!"

Panicking, he tried to get his bearings on the large pad of grey corrugated flesh. A nearby six-foot-long maggot moved toward him, and he aggressively kicked at its gnashing jaws until it rolled to the side and splashed into flowing blood. Terrified, he looked up, seeking the light from my flashlight - but it quickly blurred out under oncoming glare.

I only realized my mistake at the last moment, but there was no time to escape. The pulse approaching through the living bridge flared forward with blinding speed. This close to the source, it was far brighter and stronger, and I only managed to stand upright by the time it reached me.

An overwhelming surge of electricity rushed through my body, mind, and awareness. A vast plane of searing heat and endless light compressed and contorted around me. An immense roar filled my hearing, and the horrific stench of that living cavern left my senses. A sphere of indescribable sensation seemed to surround me and rotate, before suddenly abating, leaving absolutely nothing.

I felt strong. No I felt *capable.* The universe burst forth before me in vivid colors across an endless spectrum. It was an ocean, now that I could see it as it truly was - an ocean of energies. Light, gravity, radiations enormous and small - it was all the same. They were currents on the sea, and I drifted.

A small rock came across my senses. It was just a pebble, really but it teemed with little units of cohesive matter that moved about of their own volition. If I focused closely enough, I could *hear them*, hear their song and their laments. Pulling some of the endless ocean of energies toward me, I carefully crafted tiny little wonders and toys for them, and I listened as their songs changed into happy murmuring and secure chirping.

That beauty caused a stirring inside me, and I realized, with some surprise, that I was an *I*. Though my physical form had already grown on the currents, I had only truly been born as my mind swelled out of nothing and into full operation. I could look around the universe, now, and *wonder*. I saw an elegant red spiral, and I dove among its burning spheres, enjoying the feel of its new and interesting radiations.

Other phenomenon held my fleeting interest, too, but I always returned to my pebble. The organisms there grew in number, and even spread to other nearby pebbles. I did my best to keep their songs happy, even as they became smaller and harder to hear - no, it was I that was growing. I soon found myself forced to sit outside their cluster of burning spheres and listen from afar, nearly in vain. Their songs seemed sad and forlorn no matter what I tried to do, and I found it increasingly difficult to understand or craft anything small enough to help them.

After another stretch of time, I felt a curious strength harden my thoughts. My awareness solidified in a new way; my thoughts became completely coherent.

It was then that I noticed that I was two minds: one enormous, and one tiny. One of me looked in from outside, a foreign part of me, a tiny little willful bit of organic matter from somewhere else. Was I sick? Had I been infected by a parasite? Carefully I pried away that tiny part of me -

...blazing electricity roared away, leaving me stunned and eminently mortal again. Falling to my hands and knees on the hard white tissue, I retched uncontrollably.

"What happened?" my brother screamed, climbing up after tremendous effort. "Jesus Christ! I thought you were dead!"

Wide-eyed, I stared down at my vomit pooling on the transparent white membrane between my closed fists. Arcing energies danced around in my head and across my body, fading with each passing second. My brother kept shouting at me, but I heard nothing, my mind burning from the impossible things I'd experienced. "I saw it," I choked out, my eyes watering from the fiery pain in my throat. "I saw it"

"Where?" he asked, then amended his question. "What was it like?"

I shook my head. "I'm not sure what it looks like. I was part of it. I felt what it felt. I think I watched it being born it was huge, even at the beginning, and grew bigger than a galaxy. But it never ate planets in fact, it helped people, I think and I'm pretty sure it loved them."

I managed to look up at my brother, but he just stared at me in confusion.

I knew what I had to do.

"Go back to the cables," I told him, wiping my face and mouth before standing. "I have to find out more."

He shook his head. "You can't do this alone."

"I can't guarantee that it's safe."

"Then let *me* do it alone. Nobody'll miss one less druggie."

I glared. It was clear he wasn't going to listen to me. He never had. "Then wait right here, avoid the pulses, and make sure to get me if I pass out or something."

"Where are you going?"

"Up there," I told him, heading up the curving living bridge, and moving toward the source. "Stay here."

Finally, he did as I asked, and I started running up the thickening mass as it grew to nearly twenty feet wide, precluding any danger of accidentally falling off. It didn't seem to get much wider in diameter ahead, but it did start rising up at a sharper angle.

As the next pulse approached, I bent down on one knee, preparing.

This close, the pulse was like a gigantic fist of lightning blasting forth from above. It bellowed as it descended upon me, and I felt my existence shrink, flatten, and attenuate

I stood atop a very different kind of sea. An endless froth of bubbles surged and waved underneath me; peering at them, I knew each bubble to be a universe in and of itself. Some part of me still remembered that one contained the miniscule currents along which I'd been born, and that pebble I'd briefly loved, but there were so many, and violence was the order of time now.

Countless others like myself - my kin, in a way - raced along the waves with me, the front line already fighting ahead. An incalculably enormous entity towered above us, flailing blindly, destroying my kin and universe-bubbles alike across dimensions untold. Indescribable un-geometric weapons crossed the gulf between defender and destroyer, wreaking havoc, but the unsighted and instinctively vicious response was equally as devastating.

Angrily, I noticed my childhood parasite had returned, and I spared only the slightest energy to cast it away once more -

...like a receding tide, the lightning fell away and continued on away from me, leaving me sick and feeble on my organic white slope.

The feeling faded almost immediately, and I found myself filled with strength once more. In fact, I felt healthier and more capable than the moment I'd arrived. Heated energy filled my veins, and I took off straight up the slope even as it became more climb than run.

At that pace, it didn't take me long to reach the curved transparent wall of the source.

It towered above, below, and to the sides, a gigantic irregular sphere made of some unidentifiable matter that transmitted electricity in pulsing internal cords many times the thickness of a man. I held my hand to that surface directly - just in time for the pulse.

I sat in shrouded darkness, wounded and burning. A deep bitterness consumed me even faster than the flames. Why should I, alone, have survived? I hadn't intended to run, hadn't intended to flee to the darker wheels only been cast there by injury and the currents. I'd seen, at the last, that universe that had held my favored pebble cast asunder by the mad blind flailing of an entity that hadn't even known we were at war with it. We who had sailed the tides of the multiverse, annihilated by a being with neither consciousness nor conscience

What cruel design lay behind this construction of existence? What was the point of awareness, of living, if everything was simply going to be destroyed at the random unseeing whims of hungry and violent forces beyond comprehension? What nightmare was this that gave birth to such entities?

I noticed my little parasite again, marking my third encounter. For the first time, I stopped to regard what this truly meant. Where was I from? Sifting back through our memories, I saw a pebble much like the one I had played with in my infancy. How had a single organism, a speck of dust, come to be part of my mind three times?

A year time the concept as the speck marked it, a vector nineteen and a half billion years hence, in a universe not yet even born. I could hide there, and heal a guarantee that my hiding place would be safe from random flailings of mad gods, given that this speck still existed there and there would be ample life and materials to consume to seed a regeneration.

It didn't matter that I'd once cared for beings like them. This existence was a cruel torture, either designed by sadistic evil, or crafted blindly and without awareness, just like the flailing consumer of universes.

This body burned with everlasting fires, but I could grow another one. It would require a long dormancy, and a compression of mind and memory, but my regeneration core would rebuild all of those things in time it would find a system, seed life over the millennia, and grow enough bio-matter to spark the first stages

Carefully plucking away the tiniest mote of my inner self, I flung it forward, directed at the real location and time of my little parasite -

...I began tumbling back down the dendrite bridge, away from the core, my mortality restored. It was a dendrite, I knew now, because this was the tiniest piece of a massive brain. It was a piece designed to regenerate and heal, and that is what it had always done.

It was what had healed those who connected with it as the dormant, compressed mind within lay dreaming of the day of its awakening dreaming of the day that it would rise up, consume our solar system and more, and regenerate into the titan it had once been.

And that bitterness it felt had it seeped out into the nearby world, just like those healing energies? Could I even blame my brother, if the cynical bitterness of a defeated god had taken him down the terrible path he'd followed with his life?

My very skin flaring from residual neural energies, I ran back down the nerve tissue bridge, braving one more pulse along the way.

"I know what it is!" I shouted at Dan as I finally got closer, the insane discovery brimming on my lips and waiting to be yelled forth. "It's a *neuron!*"

"A neuron?" he shouted back, watching me rapidly approach. "Aren't those supposed to be like, really small?"

"Human ones, yes," I panted, coming up to him. "But the thing this neuron is from is bigger than you can imagine. We're going to need explosives"

---

"You could have just told us it wasn't you," the smaller man laughed.

"If you write a book, I'll buy it," his companion jibed. "Jesus, you've got quite the imagination there."

Taken aback, I glared. "I'm serious. That day is *today.* It's under that swamp *right now,* and -"

They both just laughed some more. "Alright, alright, we know you didn't take the explosives, funny guy." Still exchanging disbelieving comments with one another, they walked past me, got in a black car, and drove off.

Still unsure whether to feel angry or relieved, I waited until I was sure they were gone before heading back to the swamp. I hadn't figured that telling them was anything but a longshot but, still if only they'd listened

I soon slogged through shin-high water at a rapid pace, barely feeling the noon sun. There was no time to waste. I thought I heard the whine of a jet for a moment, which was unusual for the swamps but I could see nothing through the scattered tree canopy overhead.

I ducked down the ancient stairs and crept along the cramped tunnel for what I knew would be the last time. As the domed chamber opened up before me, I saw Hugh pacing back and forth near our lights. The system we'd rigged up had been used, and one cable hung down through the center of the whirlpool. He saw me and ran around the edge.

"Your brother's down there!" he exclaimed, grabbing my arm. "We couldn't get any more detonation wire in time, and radio would never make it through the rock, either. I didn't guess what he was up to until he was already down there."

I let those words sink in for a moment. "He's going to detonate the cavern ceiling himself"

Hugh stared at me with wild eyes. "I'm so sorry."

"It's not your fault" I breathed, pushing past him to hook myself up to another cable. "Send me down."

"Right."

I imagined what I might have said to my brother if I'd had the time - and what he might have said to me at the last - but I'd only ever been too angry with him, and I never got the chance.

"You can't just get magically healed and then go on like you never did anything wrong," he might have said.

"What happened to mom and dad wasn't your fault," I might have insisted back. "It didn't matter *who* was driving. It would have happened the same way!"

I know he would have just set his jaw, ignored me, and detonated the explosives we'd set up anyway but it didn't matter. I still wanted the chance to say it. I should have said it long ago. In the web of fate we seemed trapped in - past, present, and future locked into solid state - whose fault was anything? Had this defeated god's bitterness caused my brother to do drugs that night? Had I brought the neuron here by catching that entity's awareness last week / nineteen billion years in the past, thus bringing that bitterness to my town? None of it mattered anymore, and I wanted the chance to forgive him.

The first explosion sounded before I even left the ledge, rumbling deep through the earth with an ominous showering of dust from overhead.

Hugh and I had no choice but to give up and run for the tunnel as further detonations and impacts shook the living rock. We pushed through in terror, and then bolted up the stairs into dappled sunlight like drowning men gasping for air.

Water raced by us, pouring into the hole forming above the collapsing cavern ceiling. The explosives had been intended to take down an entire building, but, now, they were doing far more than that. We splashed through rapidly flowing swamp water as we made our way further from danger.

Two men among the trees caught my eye - the agents from before, heading my direction. Had their disinterest been a ruse? Had they followed me? They must have known I must have sounded like a crazy person

"*Look!*" Hugh shouted, turning to point up at the golden sky.

Through an opening in the trees, I saw the gigantic neuron begin to rise up through the air, its tendrils reaching out as if to grasp the very energy of life filling the world around it.

"Holy shit, it's real," the shorter agent commented, splashing up to us to watch.

"Unbelievable," his taller friend added. "But you didn't destroy it - you just freed it! The second of October, like you said. Not arbitrary at all - you let it out!"

Frozen in place by the spectacle, I wasn't sure how to respond. All four of us watched the neuron begin to rotate slightly, our thought the same: were we all about to die? Was this it?

I'd seen and heard many things in the course of recent events, but the only truth would come from what the mind within that core actually chose to do.

I relaxed slightly as the gigantic neuron stopped rotating - and then began slowly rising.

Several flares of light streaked into sight, impacting the neuron and spreading explosive flame. As we watched, two jets blurred past and overhead, almost level with the tops of the trees. They'd been the sound I'd heard before - and they were returning for another pass. Another salvo of missiles hit the rising neuron, shredding tendrils and burning away nerve tissue.

We watched in awed horror as the source of the Fountain of Youth fell back to earth, a deflated and destroyed remnant of the regenerative core it had once been.

"Wow, I'm really glad we're required to report potential threats," the shorter agent commented after a moment. "Even ridiculous stories of arcane monsters"

My brother was dead I reeled mentally.

"What do you have to say?" the taller agent asked, looking up at me. "You just improbably saved the world today, guy. I did figure there was something more to your story, seeing as how your file says you're five-ten, and you yourself are clearly over six-six and wearing ill-fitting clothes but this"

"Saved the world?" I asked, dazed. "You idiots. It was going to try to grow more of its kind and take a better approach to fighting that thing that eats universes."

"What?" they asked.

Hugh nodded, aghast.

I clenched a fist. "There was one more pulse on the way back. I convinced it not to consume us. It wasn't coming up here to destroy the Earth anymore. *It was going to help us!* You've doomed us all!"

Both agents frowned. The smaller one gulped. "So what do we do?"

"Nothing!" I shouted, filled with rage at my brother's senseless death. "There's nothing we *can* do. We'll have no warning, and no hope. One moment we'll be here, and the next, the walls of the universe will be crushing us, and *that's it.* It could be a million years, or a thousand, or even just one. It could be tomorrow, or an hour from now. There's no way to know."

We stood in silence as the last of the waters drained away from under us, leaving only a pathetic wasteland of mud and filth bare to the noonday sun.

We stood in silence, because there was nothing to say, and nothing to do.

Life would go on for awhile.

I ran through the swamp, carrying more gear stolen from the construction site at work. Our first two attempts had failed, as the hole had been far deeper than we'd expected. Filled with anxious energy, I rushed back through waters lit by the rising peach light of dawn.

The tunnel opened up before me, and I climbed down ancient stairs and between close rock walls. I had the oddest sense that the tunnel was getting slightly smaller with each visit but it had been here for hundreds of years, so it must have just been my imagination. I felt a brief panic at the thought that it might somehow close and trap us under the earth, but forced myself to ignore the thought.

 Coming out into the massive dome above silent spinning waters, I noted Hugh's and my brother's progress. They'd managed to hook up cables between several opposite pillars, forming a framework to unspool a line straight down from above the center of the vortex. They'd also set up several lights powered by a small generator, so, for the first time, I got a good look at the entire domed chamber.

Dropping two heavy coils of cable and slinging my backpack down, I circled the ledge. The dome above was covered in engravings and paintings from many different cultures; apparently, we would not be the first to climb around this cavern. I doubted that any men of the past had climbed down into the center of the whirlpool, though aside from the obvious respect most had for the place, the whirlpool's dark center was only barely wide enough for a person now, and would have only been narrower before the grinding work of centuries of flowing water.

"Think we've got enough line now?" Hugh asked, carrying one of the coiled piles to our winch.

I thought about it for a moment. Hugh had gone the first time, and I'd gone the second, but neither of us had physically reached anything of note. "I think so. Last time, I saw the flickering light again, and it wasn't too much further down."

My brother grabbed the other pile of cable. "I should be the one to go this time."

"I want to go again," I replied.

He pushed up against me aggressively. "You don't trust me?"

Years ago, my older brother had been taller than me, but he was now half an inch shorter than I - and extremely thin, besides. Whatever intimidation factor he'd once held over me, it was long gone now. "It's not an issue of trust. I want to see it for myself. I *have to.*"

"It's fine, Dan," Hugh added. "We probably still don't have enough to reach the bottom, anyway."

He backed off, still sullen.

Wasting no more time, I strapped on the climbing harness and hooked myself up to the cables we'd set up. A few minutes later, after checking and double-checking everything, I donned some gloves and climbed out to the center.

Hanging there directly above the center of the vortex, I still felt chills. It looked, for all intents and purposes, like a black hole feasting on light and water. I'd been down once before, but that didn't make this second moment of anticipation any easier.

Slowly, they began lowering me.

Passing the point where I'd fallen out and caught a boy, I watched the tightly curved vertical flows as they rose around me like crystalline walls. The center of the whirlpool remained at a slight downward angle for quite some distance, ever so slowly closing in on me, and keeping the waters aligned long after I'd descended into darkness.

Breaking out my flashlight, I shined it around, checking the smooth, silent waters nervously. There was nothing to see, really, but that didn't stop part of me thinking this was a monumentally dangerous idea. There was no mental lifeline here to drag me back to some other reality this was real and I was being lowered down a deathly shaft with absolutely no chance for survival if the cable failed

I took a deep breath and forced myself to calm down. There was no choice, not really: it was either risk this, or burn alive on the second of October sometime in the next few years as something enormous swallowed and digested the entire planet

Put that way, I felt much better about what I was doing.

That conviction helped as the smooth waters narrowed nearly to a point, and I found myself immediately drenched. Holding my breath, I squeezed my eyes shut and held on tightly as rock squeezed in almost completely on all sides. Warm water piled up above me, sloshing and roaring and covering my head - and, then, I was through.

The droning sound of rough water began reaching my ears as I entered the area where the water lost cohesion and simply began falling straight down. Having reached this depth before, I knew that the living rock began expanding bit by bit, forming a shape which encouraged the sound to radiate down rather than up - one reason, I guessed, why the domed chamber a mile above was so quiet.

I shined my flashlight out from the center of the expanding waterfall through which I was descending, but I still saw nothing but rock sloping away and darkness and mist below. This was where the cable had run out last time, and where I'd been forced to use the simple signaling button at my waist.

I stared downward as the walls continued sliding up past me. The falling water became a heavy, droplet-filled mist, lifting some of the water's pressure from my shoulders there!

Some sort of white light arced past in the darkness below, far more clear and close than the vestiges I'd seen when I'd grabbed that boy. I knew immediately that I was going to reach it this time.

Shining my flashlight down, I watched, breathless, as my hanging feet approached something solid. Finally, the moment came and I slid into a waist-deep pool of flowing warm water that constantly roiled with the falling scattered column from above. Quickly pressing the middle button on my signal device, I communicated *stop* before the cable coiled up too much underwater.

Wading around the pool, shining my light into the dark water, I found no threat - but, still, I clambered out as soon as possible, my subconscious filling my thoughts with fears of unseen creeping things. I found that I was in a tunnel of sorts that closed to a long point at one end and opened into further darkness at the other. The pool's overflow continued down in that direction, sliding away like a wide, bubbly, flat river.

Unhooking myself from the harness, I sat on mossy rock for a time, thinking about what to do next. It was oddly warm down here, and I'd never seen moss this far underground didn't they need light? At that thought, the arcing energy I'd seen twice radiated again.

I watched, stunned, as a cord of bright white electricity flared out from the darkness, through the pool, and up toward the pointed end of the tunnel. Getting close with my flashlight, I found the carrier: a whitish transparent substance wrapped tightly around itself, much like the cable I'd ridden down on. I didn't dare touch it but I could certainly follow it. I had thirty minutes without communication before they'd pull the cable up and try to come down after me. Checking my watch, I kept my flashlight aimed forward, and carefully followed the river.

As I proceeded down the gently sloped tunnel, I felt the humidity and heat increasing, and I noticed the organic cable in the middle of the floor was gradually growing wider. By the time I came to a larger opening, it had grown to several feet in width, and my attempts to stay on the rock and avoid touching it were becoming increasingly difficult.

To get through to the next area, I was forced to touch it, but I waited until the next pulse of electricity to gingerly touch it with my boot. It gave slightly under my weight, but nothing else happened I had the fear that it might open somehow and suddenly swallow me up, but I had no other choice.

Moving forward along the thick white pathway as the surrounding rock dropped away, I found myself walking along what amounted to an organic causeway suspended in empty air. A small flow from the river still bubbled along its direct center, but the rest had slipped off the curved edges. I wanted to shine my flashlight over and see how far the drop was, but I wasn't about to risk getting close to the void. I didn't like walking across whatever *this stuff* was, but, as long as nothing dangerous appeared, I told myself I'd probably be fine there were no animals down here for something carnivorous to feast on, so this had to be -

I understood my miscalculation even as another pulse of energy arced out of the darkness ahead. It came at me like a blazing silent train, and a bolt of heat seemed to slam up into my chest through my feet.

Eye-watering yellow and agonizing cerulean assaulted my cavern-adjusted sight as I fell to my knees in acid-scorched dirt. Despite the intense shock, I knew exactly where I was. In fact, blinking through tears to study my immediate surroundings, I saw the hardware store - and the rock that the families had used to hide their stay in the basement. *Were they inside there now?* Nothing seemed too impossible anymore, not even ending up in another night's dream.

Breathing hard, I scrambled in the dirt around the rock, trying to move it - but, rotted hands in number were stronger than my living limbs alone. Within, I could hear people whispering and huddling in fear. Looking to my right, I saw writhing flesh at the edge of the acid ocean approaching; great tentacles and gnashing faceless mouths and grinding unidentifiable masses intent on breaking up matter for easier *digestion* it was those masses that would reach these buildings first, but I knew the dream would end for them before the distant acid poured across the city.

But would it end for *me?* Terrified, I ran, bolting through the charred town. I had no love for the place, not really, but to see it like this to see the melted bodies in the streets, and the burnt state of restaurants I recognized and fast-food signs I passed every day looking back, I saw a building near the hiding families collapse, throwing its pointy metallic roof down at an angle to crash into the side of the store.

*It was the same dream, my first.* I remembered that inexplicable metal barb very vividly. *Was I, then, the source of the scuffling I'd heard outside? To distorted rotting ears, had my hard breathing sounded alien and terrifying?* And the dream had ended just after -

 white flaring energies receded from my awareness, and I fell to my knees in blessed humid darkness. The pulse's light faded as it continued on down the line, and I realized that I'd only been gone a split second.

I stared down at semi-transparent white bridge of organic matter, shining my flashlight within. It seemed filled with unidentifiable lines of darker tissue and weird nodules. I'd thought something strange might be down here, but *this?* Had I just crossed time and dimension purely by touching the edges of a pulse through this *thing?*

I stood suddenly, my brain piecing something together. The nightmare experiences above: did some miniscule bit of connection travel up the waterfall, up the vortex, and into the air of the chamber above? Was the connection so small, there, that only those sleeping could truly connect with it? I'd *felt it* in the swamp, the night of the rains, when the water's trail had connected up all the way to the surface

Moving on with increased determination and grim curiosity, I followed the ever-thickening bridge deeper into the void. The cavern walls fell away until my flashlight found nothing on any side except impenetrable black. Warm breezes appeared, filled with an ungodly stench that forced me to pull out two bits of wet cotton and plug my nose lest I pass out from sheer nausea. I sensed an incredible space opening before me, but I saw nothing until another pulse of light came.

This time, I had the opportunity to see the source.

An enormous burst of blindingly white light coalesced miles before and above me, as much like a flickering sun as anything else I could think of. It filled a quarter of my sight, despite being miles away, and I knew that this had to be the source of the strange power here. The colossal sight simply defied belief; a pulsing star under the earth, briefly lighting a tremendous cavern, and then sending out its energy like so many tracers

tracers which extended in a thousand directions, left, right, up, and down. One of those pulses of electricity came at me, traveling along my living bridge with ghastly speed. It was only by virtue of my extreme distance from the underground celestial object that I had any chance to react at all, and react I did.

Fallen to my side while I stood in awe, my flashlight illuminated a surface that had come up to meet my living bridge, and I leapt for this surface without truly considering my actions.

As the pulse flared past harmlessly, I plopped into some sort of goo, and then slowly squished down further under my own weight. Again overcome by fear of unknown lurking creatures, I scrambled up onto firmer ground, which offered no comfort at all - still squishy and wet, I shined my flashlight at it.

This was no cavern floor. I crawled along grey flesh, patterned with wide corrugations several feet across. I had the distinct impression that this was some sort of horribly large *brain matter*, and I stumbled to my feet out of disgusted horror. I sought to wipe my hands, but I was already covered in thick crimson liquid that shared the coppery pungent scent of blood. In fact, shining my light around, I noted rivers of the stuff moving slowly among hills of brain matter a fleshy living nightmare landscape under the earth, lit by distant pulses of unholy living light.

Pressure twisted around my heart and around my head, my pulse racing with absolute panic. This was - *God, I had no idea!* I literally had no idea, no guess, as to the insane nature of the place I'd found. It seemed like blood and brain matter, but it wasn't a brain, nor a body - large clusters of rock still jutted forth, proving that the cavern floor was only a few feet beneath, and the layout of the hills and valleys were all wrong. The flesh was laid out in vast tracts rather than formed into a cohesive organ

What the hell was the purpose of this place? *What could it possibly be?* Logic and guesswork had gotten me this far, but *this what the hell was it?* It was miles long and miles wide, a city of patchwork tissues in darkness it just **made no sense!**

Nearby squirting and scrunching broke me from my awe. Shining my flashlight to my right, I saw a long white-and-goopy segmented tube sliding along the brain matter toward me. It was maybe the length of a person's height all told, and it

it was a maggot.

It was a six-foot-long maggot, feasting on brain and blood. Behind it, a dozen more crawled from the sickening river.

Leaping for the bridge of white, I pulled at cords and climbed my way back up. The maggots munched hungrily on tissue, ignoring me, and I watched as the oozing paths they left behind almost immediately healed back up.

My heart came down from the edge of panic as that clue brought me back to my original mission. These valleys of brain and blood were healing, just as we had been healed: the source was still down here. Perhaps all this was simply a horrifying side-effect of 'healing energy' perhaps there *was no purpose* to this place. Perhaps it was all just an accidental byproduct of abundant life energy

Clinging to that small shred of sense, I felt the walls of my sanity strengthening once more. There had  to be sense. There had to be logic. Yes.

Yes.

I stood again, and let myself have a moment of calm.

Alright: how could this be connected to the destruction of Earth and Mars in our nightmare-future? Despite the landscape of brain matter, oozing blood, and man-sized maggots, there was no immediate danger here. This was all healing and regeneration taken to extremes. I saw no beast, and felt no mind at work - and I certainly didn't see any monstrous entity capable of eating a solar system. This place was odd, and disgusting, but -

 I briefly climbed off of my bridge again as another pulse flared and passed. Quickly lifting myself back up to avoid touching the grisly mess below any longer than I had to, I regarded the fading glow of the celestial cluster above me in the distance. That had to be the Source, but what was it?

I wiped drying red ooze from my watch and checked: time to head back.

In any case, I needed my companions to see this. There was no way they would believe me on word alone. Now more confident in my weird living bridge, I began running back, intent on avoiding any more pulses of energy. As I ran, I felt filled with strength, and deft enough to avoid twisted cords in my path. Where I should have been tired, I felt only empowered, and the joy of running seemed to overshadow any fears and disgusts I had about what I'd seen.

Exhilarated, I reached the pool at the top of the tunnel, hooked myself back in, and signaled to be pulled back up.

---

I gave him one swift push, sending him reeling into the murky waters surrounding the rectangular stone portal. As if in response to our struggle, the rain sliding down from the night-shrouded trees overhead intensified.

"Stop it!" Hugh cried, pulling him up from the swamp. "You're not accomplishing anything by hurting him. He doesn't even know where he is."

He was right, but that fact didn't produce an iota of compassion in me for my drug-addled older brother. I stood knee-high in the muck, fighting increasingly violent urges. For a moment, I just let water run down my face. "Take him down there," I finally spat. "It won't matter soon enough"

Hugh glared back at me and helped him stumble awkwardly down into darkness.

"It won't matter," I said to the pattering rains, my chest heaving as I came down from anger. Hugh was proof enough that no injury I caused would matter. His unfettered glare had been all the more pointed without glasses in the way - glasses he no longer needed after a single visit to the strange cavern under this muggy swamp.

He'd been concerned at that healing, because *nearsightedness is not a defect,* as he'd complained several times over the week it took to find my brother's rotting shack. *It's not a cut or a broken bone, it's mostly genetic, and it's not obvious that a misshapen eye is something that needs fixed*

Not obvious to an inanimate force, he'd meant as he'd continually tried to define what *healing* even meant in specific terms. Were cells reconstructed and placed in perfect alignment with the body? How did the force at work determine which cells were needed, and where? What happened to mass that needed to be taken away, like scabs, dead tissue, or tumors? What mechanism enabled all this, and what power source?

I had no answers for him - not yet. All I knew was that something massive resided miles below that vast, silent whirlpool, and I had to see it for myself. I could feel it even now, in the form of a subtle electricity running up through the rainwater pouring into our tunnel, and radiating out through the swamp's sloshing mire. Carefully stepping down those ancient stairs, my booted feet splashing in rushing torrents, I followed the current toward the underground dome.

A constant roar filled the place as the stream of rainwater beneath my feet poured past the ledge and into the vortex, disrupting its smooth flow. Shining my flashlight around, I traced the mist, spray, and rough waters, making sure that we were not in any extra danger.

Although the pool was choppy, the circular ledge around the base of the dome still seemed safe enough.

I put my hefty pack down, but hesitated just before I put a bit of cotton in each ear. I had the oddest sense that the hallowed chamber was almost angry somehow as if the ongoing roar was a shout of trespass.

Shaking my head, I cast aside the ridiculous notion. It was just rainwater and chop. Hugh was convinced there was some sort of intellect at work here, but I'd felt no overt consciousness in any of our explorations. If something down here truly was *aware*, why would it sit underground for centuries healing random visitors through nightmares? The idea of an actual living intelligence at work just didn't seem plausible to my instincts.

We'd come later at night than ever before. There would be no surprise visitors while we slept. Traversing the entire circular ledge for the first time, I shined my light into those turbulent waters, looking for the source. I finally found it pouring from a natural and barely-visible opening exactly at the lip of the vortex: an angled channel that perfectly enabled the circular spin that had so exactingly carved the silent whirlpool over the ages. I stood above that channel, studying the elaborate art of long-dead visitors that had also found the source and thought to enshrine it.

Among a series of religious icons, faded paint depicted a hill crowned by crumbling structures. After a few moments' study, I frowned.

I jumped toward the wall and turned as something touched my back.

Hugh held up his hands and light in surprise. *Sorry*, he mouthed, his words lost in the roar. He pointed toward a carefully placed flashlight and my semi-comatose brother weighted down in an alcove across the gulf. *We're ready.*

I nodded, but did not tell him about the painting I'd seen. He would never go back to the nightmare with me if he knew what had been depicted.

I walked back 'round with him and took up position next to my brother. I fell asleep under that curious heavy influence while my eyes were still half-open, my sight taking in my brother's sunken purple sockets, drawn skin, and decaying teeth. He already looked half the corpse he was about to become this nightmare-trial and impossible healing might not have been what our mother and father wanted for him, but they weren't around to protest...

Dirt fell away from me like so much splattered rain as I forced my way up. Healthy, strong, and even feeling empowered, I burst forth from my grave with a fully living body, exactly as Hugh had feared.

I wasn't afraid. Although I was vulnerable, I felt strong and capable, and more than able to evade whatever slimy things moved around in the dark of this otherworldly haunt -

...except it didn't look anything like the nightmares I remembered.

Momentarily stunned, I stared around at a world cast in completely different colour.

Where once rotting amber marred by black fingers had hung overhead, I now saw flaring yellow and searing cerulean. Squinting against the pain, I stumbled over onto the next grave, just in time for a decrepit version of my brother to erupt from the dirt in a panic.

Hugh arose next to him. "It's like I thought! You're fully here because you jumped in the water -"

"What the hell is going on?" my brother asked, lifting his bone-and-blackened-flesh arms. "Am I finally dead?"

Still squinting against the painful glare bombarding me from every direction, I shook my head. "Dan"

He stared at me. "Why are *you* here?"

"Do you still feel the life-line?" Hugh asked me, concerned.

I nodded, keeping my head low and my eyes half-closed. "I'll go back the moment I sense trouble. I have no intention of dying here."

"So we're alive?" Dan asked, his bone-bare jaw moving with his words. "I dont feel high or sick what did you give me?"

"Nothing," I growled, stumbling to my feet. "Stick with Hugh and don't wake up until this is over."

"Why?"

"*Just listen to me!*" I shouted at him, not caring if my voice traveled. I couldn't see shadows moving on the horizon - I couldn't see much of anything in the burning wastes outside the graveyard - but I wasn't about to assume we were safe. Peering up with watering eyes, I studied the sky

"What do you see?" Hugh asked, helping my brother to his partially missing feet.

"It's not what we thought," I forced out, taking a few steps forward. "Take care of him. I have to check something."

Before he could protest, I broke out in a run. Knowing that I only had a limited time, I slipped through the graveyard's gate and bolted across the blasted forest wasteland at a pace multiple times faster than my corpse-body had ever managed. I could see, now, that the felled trees were not simply rotting where they'd fallen they'd been burned. Their blackened trunks caved and crumbled as I leapt across them.

The pattern of burning was curious. I took a short moment to study the char, and the liquid-like patterns carved along them. It was as if every trunk had been harvested by acid rather than fire.

I slowed for just a moment as that horrible sound began reaching my awareness, that monstrous heartbeat in the sky but, this time, the detail and intensity were far greater. I could hear nuances of breathy mechanical pulsing in between the heavy squishing drumbeat that sounded every few seconds, loud enough to subtly vibrate the very earth beneath my feet.

Looking down, I frowned. I still had my shoes - and all my clothes, for that matter. Hugh had come last time with rusted glasses, but my clothes were nothing worse than dirty. The landscape was brutal and painful, filled with debris and sharp rocks, so I was thankful for my shoes, but it still seemed odd. Had the water of the vortex affected them as well? Had I come in the same clothes as last week? I couldn't remember.

And there was nothing *in* the water, anyway, as far as Hugh's tests had shown the jars we'd taken had held nothing but dirt and water.

Nearing the hill crowned with ruined houses - the suburb we'd taken refuge in last time, and the subject of the painting I'd seen - I looked back toward the horizon from whence the unknown nightmarish creatures usually came. With better eyesight, I saw something seething, all across the distance not just silhouettes, but weirdly colored shapes moving against flaring yellow and searing cerulean

Blinking against the pain, I turned and ran on.

I had a very specific question in mind, and I raced to the house we'd hidden in last time. The same dusty kitchen remained within, complete with pictures and appliances. Pulling drawers and throwing open cabinets, I looked for anything that might have a date on it but all the paper in the house had molded over with a light orange dusting that I thought better of touching. Peering at the back of the photos on the fridge, I saw it creeping along the paper there as well, as if everything even slightly organic was being eaten

My eyes lit upon a little black rectangle on one of the chairs in the kitchen - a phone! I picked it up, instinctively pressing the power button.

Against all odds, it began turning on. *What were the chances that it still had battery life?* It lit up just long enough to flash the time and date screen, then blinked back off, the last of its power drained.

I dropped it, stunned. *October 2nd?* Was that when the phone had last been turned on, or was that the date *now?* The painting on the wall of the vortex chamber confirmed that this was the same nightmare every visitor had *always* had. They'd *always been dreaming of this era in time,* complete with the hardware store I knew and the suburbs I'd matched to maps of the area. How many hundreds of years had people been sleeping around that whirlpool and having nightmares about their future, and my present? What were the odds that I would come here and find out this nightmare reality was *a week away?*

Feeling light-headed, I clutched the table, but it snapped under my hands - all strength drained from it, just like the corpses Hugh and my brother walked around in, just like the paper in the house, just like the trees littering the hills outside.

It could be another year, I told myself next year, five, ten from now these buildings wouldn't change that much I stared at the blinding light streaming in through the window for a moment, filled with undirected fear and anger until something occurred to me: an impossible thought from my first few steps with my empowered senses.

Running upstairs, taking care not to crash through the weak steps or rotting upper hallway, I clambered my way to the attic, where the roof had completely fallen away. Standing there, wincing against the sky-glare, my ears filled with that distant tremendous heartbeat and the slithering and squishing sounds of approaching horror, I judged the jump.

In the distance, I saw Hugh and my brother making their way toward the house. Beyond them, the entire horizon squirmed and shifted, as a gigantic wall of unspeakable organic mass and sick storming liquids roiled toward us. Even with my living eyesight, I couldn't make sense of it, but I was starting to understand nonetheless.

I jumped with all my strength, ready to cut back to reality if my hands failed -

...but, no, my aim had been true, and my hands closed around a flaring yellow cord of flesh.

I must have looked quite impossible from Hugh and my brother's perspective. To them, it probably looked like I was hanging directly from the rotting amber sky but, with my living eyesight, the perspective had been all wrong. It had never been a sky at all.

It was more like the roof of a living cavern and I began climbing up into it, fighting nausea as I pulled my way deeper into heated, pulsing, and wet tubes of living matter. My sense of smell intruded upon my awareness as the blanketing smell of char and ash fell away to be replaced by gag-inducing stench, but I forced myself to keep scooting along a cluster of bright yellow cords.

I wanted a higher perspective - I *needed* a better look.

The hanging cords of flesh, once I came to thicker parts, were actually good holds for my hands and feet, and I came all the way to the edge of a massive pulsing cerulean organ. Where once I had seen black void in the sky arcing with purple electricity, I now saw segmented cyan tissue bubbling with energy, like some sort of horrific pancreas at least in shape, if not in function

Directly below, I saw Hugh and my brother reach the house and hobble inside.

From my higher angle, I squinted at the oncoming wall of horror. From here, it looked more like a writhing brown-and-black lake, infinitely far across and eternally deep an oncoming ocean of hungry flesh and thirsty acid but it still made *no visual sense*

Distracted by the uncontrollable urge to gag from the building stench and ichor covering me, I forced myself to throw up, and watched as vomit fell to the distant ground maybe six or seven stories below. Almost out of willpower, I decided I would keep moving, on the off chance I'd get a better perspective.

Before I had the chance, the vivid cyan organ next to me began changing and moving, elongating downward as if about to strike the earth. Instinctively, I remembered the enormous impact that had struck just before the end of our last nightmare. Is that what these organs were? Mechanical crushers of some sort? For what purpose?

As the unholy organ began preparing to slam downward, the yellow fibers to which I clung rose, and I gripped them in a panic - but I didn't pull on my mental lifeline, because this was faster than any climb. Soaring upwards, I stared at the distance, my eyes locked open despite the competing glares. The sky-flesh lifted ever higher, bringing me what seemed like miles into the air, and I saw -

Too often, I'd been stunned and dumbfounded by awe. Now, I took in the sight with a sick despair that matched my nausea and revulsion. Somewhere in the back of my mind, I'd expected a terrible revelation, and this only made me feel grimly justified in my dangerous pursuit of the truth.

Not wanting to be crushed or cast down by the cerulean organ's imminent impact, I pulled on my mental connection to reality early for the first time. The energy flared, and I soared backwards in thought.

I awoke in gentle gloom, our flashlights still aimed at the nearby pillar. I sat in silence for a time, waiting. I slowly realized that the rain outside must have stopped, if it was silent down here

Although only an instant had been left in the nightmare, it took the two of them another several minutes to wake up.

My brother shot up, gasping. I quickly held him back, and shined the flashlight on his features. His sunken purple eyes were now smooth, whole, and bright. His teeth looked professionally restored, and his sallow skin had become smooth and healthy. He looked down at his hands, then at me, and then back at his hands again and, then, he began crying.

Rather than ask me questions about the insane experience he'd just been through - perhaps he chalked it up to a bad trip - he just rocked in place, overwhelmed by his healing. With his new clarity and awareness, I could see him begin to understand everything he'd done the last few years. "I'm so sorry," he sobbed repeatedly.

My anger and resentment gone for the moment, I held him under one of my arms. "It's fine."

Hugh watched in silence, concerned and moved.

I caught his gaze. "We have a problem," I said quietly, between my brother's sobs.

He nodded, as if he'd expected my words. "What were you climbing on, in the sky? What did you see?"

Moving my jaw back and forth, considering how to tell him, I decided to answer both questions with one statement. Above that seething endless nightmare ocean, impossibly distant, but massive enough to still dominate the sky just past the line of horizon, I'd seen half of an immediately recognizable red orb. It had crested the edge of its own limitless ocean of writhing acid and flesh, slowly sliding deeper.

There was no other way to say it, except directly.

"I saw Mars."

His lip curled up lightly with confused humor. "What, like -"

"I saw the planet Mars," I interrupted. "Large in the sky, like a moon but I only saw half of it."

"Half of it?" he asked, his humor fading into resigned fear.

I nodded. "It was being digested. Just like us. That's the sounds you hear, and that's what chases us: in that nightmare world, the Earth is being digested."

"Then"

"Yes," I answered his unspoken question. "It's not a sky at all, that I was climbing on. It's a lining, a wall - I think it's a *stomach.*"

"The hell?" he breathed.

"That's not the worst part," I told him, feeling nothing but grim certainty. "I found the date. The second of October."

He gulped. "What year?"

I shook my head slowly, still holding my brother as he cried.

Hugh stood, took a deep breath, and approached the ledge. He shined his light at the center of the vortex, and watched the smooth water for a long moment. "We gotta get down there."

"That's what I've been saying."

He said nothing further, his gaze locked on the whirlpool's center. I knew what he was thinking, for I was thinking it, too: the scale of the threat in that nightmare world was beyond belief, beyond comprehension, and beyond any resistance by a few individual men - yet something beneath this healing vortex was connected to it, and there was still time to find out why. Somehow, in an ancient cave under the earth, hidden by darkness and swamp, there still remained an unknown hope though how a hidden source of quiet healing might be related to a monstrous solar-system-eating abomination, I had no idea.

I looked down at my brother now that he had finally quieted. This wasn't part of the plan, but things had become far graver than I'd ever expected. "Dan, I need your help."

"I'm not good for anything," he mumbled.

"You don't have to do anything except come with us," I insisted. "Hugh and I can't do this alone. We brought all the climbing gear we need, and we're going to climb down there, and we're going to figure this all out. There's nobody else I can trust with this, and there's no more time to try to convince anyone else. I need you to be here, and I need you to do this."

He hesitated for a long moment, but then nodded weakly. "Is this really happening?"

"Unfortunately, yes."

I stood and walked over to my pack to begin pulling out climbing gear bit by bit. Hugh pulled his pack from the alcove and began doing the same. Our preparations went as quietly as the vortex by which we stood, and as silently as the unknown force which awaited us below.

	<TEXT> I was out on the street the day the first driverless truck came through town. The sun watched us through the overcast sky with an aloof white glare, arcing dull glints across that smooth steel face - a bank of chrome and black sensors glimmered where the cabin should have been. It looked every bit like a metal snail pulling a shipping container.

A few of the men around me grinned and clinked beer cans. Several muttered epithets. Our town was small, but we had our claim to fame: we were a town of truck drivers, through and through. Everyone knew the best drivers came from our stock, and coming from around here meant the best pay and the best radio company while on the road. We were out in the middle of nowhere, but we'd made this junction our own.

When the company decided to try out driverless trucks, our little town nearly went into riot mode. It took quite some time to work out the compromise: the drivers would shift to maintenance and consultation if the driverless truck tests were successful, and we would all keep our pay. It made sense - the company couldn't afford engineers in far out places like this one, and we knew our trucks better than any college man. So we took the offer.

Some saw this as a lifetime pension. Sit on our asses, drink beer, and take care of our trucks when they rolled into town? Sign me up!

Some had enjoyed the work. The drive, they said, was time alone. Time on the road, they said, was time away from home, away from the screaming kids and the old ball and chain. They joked, but I knew what they meant. Sittin' around all day I wasn't sure what I'd do with myself.

I got the Internet. That's what I did. Started learning to read and write a little better. I'd seen pensions gutted and slashed in the news my whole life, and didn't trust that our situation would last forever.  Time to get educated and get out, I told myself. I just didn't know how little time I had

That one truck rolled through every couple days like clockwork. The guys, they clamored for something to do, so the company deemed the first test a success, and sent out ten more. We had one or two driverless trucks coming through each day, and it seemed like every arrival was a little town block party. Kids danced by gushing fire hydrants to beat the summer heat, old men drank their Old Milwaukees in rickety nylon seats under the trees, and me and the boys hung around hitting on the kids' mothers.

I suppose we should have seen it coming, but it was still a shock when the first dog got run over. A kid threw a ball into the street during the festivities, and that was that. His pet dog ran right up and got crushed under the wheel. The damn truck didn't even realize what it had done, and we were all horrified.

The whole town came out for that meeting at the town hall. The slick-suited business guy heard our concerns, and promised the designers would look into it. Two weeks later, the trucks rolling through town looked a little different - bigger, more cargo space. Every now and then, they still ran over dogs, but we figured they'd tried, and we just had to keep a tighter leash on the pets.

They said that, without a driver, the trucks were more efficient, so they kept getting slightly bigger every few weeks. It wasn't long before half the pets in the area had been run over or permanently moved inside. There were no more parties when the trucks came in. Parents didn't want their kids playing near the damn things, and good on them.

It didn't help.

The Dyers' kid went out chasing a ball, just like that damn dog. The draft on these bigger trucks was stronger, and he got sucked right under. It crushed his leg, and not two days later we heard he would never walk again. The Dyers couldn't afford the hospital bill, but we all banded together and gave what we could 'til the lawsuit came through. The company settled quickly, and promised a redesign on the trucks to make sure it would never happen again. Two weeks later, the Dyers got flush rich, and moved away. Two weeks after that, they stopped returning our messages. Two weeks after that, the trucks grew even bigger.

The sensors on the front had grown spiky, and the look of these huge machines and their twice-as-long cargo compartments enormous, imposing, to put my grown vocabulary to use. They bent in the middle when they turned, that's how long they'd become. There were more of them, too, rumbling through almost all hours of the day and night.

Though there were more of them, they stopped for maintenance less often. Our paychecks kept coming in, but the work was drying up, and that made honest men antsy. I won't even describe the antics the dishonest men started getting up to at the bars and the town gentleman's establishment. The center of town became known for drunken violence and sexual harassment... I was glad that I lived out on the edge, far from that rowdy crowd.

Bitterness about the trucks had grown, but our resentment exploded after the first death. This time, it was a full-grown adult, old man Richter. He'd gone out for a walk without his glasses, but how the hell he didn't hear the damn bellowing things on the road, that's beyond me.

We didn't even have time to organize a protest before we found out firsthand how the old man had gone out. The drafts under these barreling monstrosities were little tornadoes, pulling things up like a vacuum. On our way to the town hall, one of our group got pulled right up under and spun around the back wheels like a ketchup-splattered rag doll. He fell out behind, and we almost ran to go help him - but the next truck trampled over him, and left nothing more than spaghetti and meat sauce.

That's when I knew we were in trouble. Real trouble. This was two deaths now, and the town hall was boarded up. The mayor and his slick-suited buddy were on vacation, with no return date. There'd been rumors of the mayor coming into money, but we didn't know for sure at the time.

It was an odd feeling, trying to live in a community under siege. You got your paycheck, and the food's all in the stores, and water's running but everyone is quiet, and everything is dimmer. A little gloomier. You just sit around each day waiting for news. Did we get through the day without a death? Yeah, usually. Sometimes a week without an accident. You start to relax a little - and somebody dies.

We were on the phones the whole time, calling up lawyers, calling up police, calling anyone who might listen. We couldn't afford good lawyers, but the ambulance-chasers we finally did hire launched a dozen lawsuits - which were all immediately tied up in court. We were told the process would take years. No help there.

The police came around a few times, saw a splattered body or two, and gave us a few sympathetic comments like "aw shit" and "wow, have you got a lawyer on this?" but there was nobody to arrest, since the trucks were driverless. Couldn't shut down one truck without shutting them all down, and that would cost a ton of money and jobs. All we could do, they said, was wait for the lawyers to get something done.

Because of the siege, whatever tension we'd had with our local illegals was right out. I let the Jimenez kid stay at my house after his parents tried to hit up the grocery store and got crushed between a driverless truck and the tight walls of the back alley they'd been using to avoid the main road.

That was the worst part: the number of trucks kept increasing until the main road had trucks on it at all times, in endless rows that never stopped. It was eerie, seeing them all move like a train like that, all moving at the same speed, never braking, never swerving The town had been split in half - and, without warning, excess trucks had begun using the smaller roads to optimize their route.

Trucks rumbled by my driveway day in and day out. By then, I was spending most of my time hiding in the house, curtains shut, playing some old Nintendo games with the Jimenez kid and trying not to think about the constant subtle shaking underneath my feet. Boredom was our constant enemy, but we kept busy, kept challenging each other, and we got by and kept our heads.

What members of the community that could still reach other banded together. We were hardly beaten, not by a longshot. This was our town, and we would survive. With the mayor's office vacated, the municipal water eventually went out - but the illegals on our side of town showed us all how to set up raincatch barrels, and how to clean the water for drinking.

The same police who'd come by and been unable to help us soon showed up in full SWAT gear and raided many of the nearby homes. The illegals all got deported, and the neighbors that had helped them were forced to cut deals for jail time or face huge minimum sentences at trial. Turns out, the mayor had sold the area's water rights to some foreign company before he'd left, so collecting rainwater the way we did was against the law.

Much of the rest of our little community tried blocking the road after that, but the trucks just went around, hitting more people. Use of makeshift explosives followed, and they did manage to destroy one truck and block traffic for nearly a day. The SWAT teams showed up and hauled them all off soon after.

Of the friends that went to prison, one died inside shortly after entering. The rest, I heard, were put to work building parts for the driverless trucks. Turns out, the company had a contract with the prison. Bitter pill to swallow, that.

I'd hid the kid from the police, but he and I were one of only a few people left on our side of town. The surviving kids had all been snapped up by Child Protective Services now that their parents were dead or in jail, so he had nobody to play with, and I spent most of my time making our survival a game. Hide from the trucks, I'd challenge. Find the hidden food, I'd dare him. He could fit in pipes under the road and cross to parts of town I couldn't reach. He did come back with food much of the time, but he never spoke of the things he saw in fact, he stopped speaking altogether after his seventh trip to the inner parts of town.

I can remember the exact moment that I realized he and I were the last ones left. A truck swerved to avoid a wild dog - well shit, looked like they finally fixed that flaw - and barreled straight through a nearby house. By then, the monstrous trucks had become armored in response to our explosives, and the back had become enormously long and massive to carry as much cargo as possible. The house crumpled and tore apart like paper, and that truck kept on going like nothing had happened.

Only, my friend Don had been inside he'd entertained us with military stories every day, optimistic and hardy to the very end.

After finding his body in the wreckage of his house, I knew there was no longer any safe place to be. We were out of food, out of water, and out of places to hide.

I was much thinner from hunger by then, and found that I could fit through the pipes under the road if I squeezed up enough and tried not to breathe in anything foul. The kid didn't want to go back to the other parts of town anymore, but he had no choice but to follow me, and I wasn't about to leave my hometown without seeing if anyone else was left.

Many times, I thought I was going to die in that rumbling, vibrating, cramped pipe under the road, but I managed somehow.

It was clear, once I'd pushed through the muck, why the kid had stopped speaking. The center of town was a charnel house, splattered with dried blood and torn apart bodies. Worse: most had not been killed by the trucks. They'd killed each other once the driverless walls had gotten too tight to cross killed each other for food, for water, and seemingly, at the end for entertainment. Don had always said that unchecked boredom was the true bringer of nightmare in extreme circumstances. I'd always wondered what he meant, but now I knew

Without a job, boredom had become agony. We'd been lucky, being on the outskirts of town we'd kept ourselves entertained, and gone into the forest to hunt for food often. These men, women, and children had had *nowhere to go*, and they'd been surrounded by violence, hunger, and thirst more than any other emotion, boredom had brought hell on earth.

I thought to cover the kid's eyes, but I knew he'd already seen this seven times before.

The main road was strikingly clean, swept constantly by truck drafts. I even saw a motorist driving between the trucks, oblivious to the death and gore hidden just behind the corners of each building. To him, this was just another small village he was passing through... I screamed for help, but he couldn't hear us over the constant roar of the trucks.

Finally, crawling through more pipes, we reached the other side of town.

I emerged from the filth and clambered up onto a nicely paved road.

Staring around, I saw lots of nice new buildings. Fresh paint, cheery signs, large open roads bigger, newer houses  there was even a large mall down at the end of the street. The kid and I walked around in shock, wondering when the hell the old town had been bulldozed and built over. How long had we been surviving in the dirt, cut off from society?

Sharply dressed men and women escorted well-behaved children around the pleasant neighborhood.

"Hey! How are you? Long time no see!"

I turned and saw Bill Dyers walking over from a nearby playground. His kid continued playing, his prosthetic leg hardly noticeable.

"Isn't it great what they've done with the town?" Bill asked, grinning widely. He lowered his head to show me the top. "Notice anything different? I'll tell you. I got hair implants! No more baldness!"

He didn't seem to notice that the Jimenez kid and I were covered in dirt, filth, blood, and other unspeakable signs of the nightmare we'd endured but a nearby cop certainly noticed.

"You can't be here dressed like that!" he barked. "If you're homeless, I'll have to take you in."

"Oh no," Bill told the officer, still cheery. "These are friends of mine. They can stay with me!"

"That true?" the officer asked me, his tone stern.

I wasn't about to go to prison. I would kill myself before I helped build those godless trucks. "Yes. Um, yes sir. We'll clean up right away, sir."

The officer regarded us both for a minute, then leaned down to look the kid in the eye. "Yo hablo ingles?"

I gulped. One word of Spanish, and he was gone - but the kid just stared at him.

"He doesn't speak," I told him.

"He yours?"

"Yes. His mother died in childbirth."

"Sorry to hear that." The officer coughed uncomfortably. "Well, clean up, get off the street. Don't let me see you like this again. If I see you sleeping out here, it's off to lockup with you both."

"Yes sir."

I relaxed as he walked away.

Bill laid his arm around my shoulders. "Don't think I've forgotten about you all, banding together for our hospital bill like that. You can stay with me 'til you get on your feet. We're all friends here, right?"

"Right," I answered, following him toward his nice, clean house.

He had no idea. None of these people had any idea.

For survival's sake, I kept my burning fury hidden. There was nobody to blame - no conspiracy, no plan behind what had happened. The more I researched the workings behind the events that had destroyed my town and killed or imprisoned my entire community, the more I realized that nobody was even aware it had happened.

They'd heard about the first dog that had died, and that had caused weeks of national outrage. They'd heard about the Dyers kid and his crushed leg, and that had gotten brief national attention and lots of sympathy. They'd heard a clamor about a water rights trial. They hadn't really understood. They'd heard clamor about some hicks blowing up a driverless truck. They hadn't cared. It'd become a running joke on late-night television.

But nobody knew the true web of horrors we'd experienced. The company didn't even fully realize. All they'd seen was a volatile workforce fighting over paychecks. The legal department had handled the lawsuits until the plaintiffs had all died or gone to prison. The payroll department had stopped checks one-by-one for those who had died or gone to prison. The maintenance department had replaced the workers as they'd left. Eventually, the whole thing had just gone away. The higher-ups had seen nothing past the initial labor compromise, and most of them had been replaced over time anyway. There was nobody left at the company who even knew the name of our town.

That's the part that fills me with more bitterness than rage: there's nobody to blame. I can't get revenge. Nobody *did* anything to us. No one person meant us harm. No one person wanted anything more than comfort and profit. When you endure something like that, you want to know who did it. You want to blame someone.

I can't find anyone to blame.

When the Jimenez kid - when *Ricky* finally starts speaking again, when he asks me who was responsible for the hell we went through, I can honestly tell him: nobody. That's the scariest part. The system is bigger than any of us. The system barrels on. Horrific tragedies can just *happen* without anyone meaning them to because there's nobody at the wheel. </TEXT>

"Joke's over, let's go home," he complained, swatting at a bug near his arm.

"Hugh, it's not a joke." I scanned the dim evening-orange gloom. "I just have to find it"

He pushed up his glasses, sighed, and continued wading alongside me. "Is this about your brother?"

I turned and glared at him, fighting a sudden energy in my arms, and an urge to strike him. That heat left me as I saw a black rectangle jutting from the water behind him.

He saw my expression and turned, equally surprised to find that we'd nearly stumbled right past the object of our search. "It's really here"

"Yeah, I'm not kidding," I told him, carefully moving my raised arms as if I'd done it to remind him that my scar was gone.

He shifted under the weight of his backpack, grimaced, and shrugged. "You first, then."

I pulled two flashlights out of his pack and led the way down the mossy ancient stairs. He followed only after I shot him another glare.

The unwavering warm breeze remained exactly as before, but, this time, I was the one in the lead. Despite the beam from my flashlight projecting out along the smoothly carved walls, pock-marked ceiling, and damp floor - and making decent illuminating headway into the hazy darkness ahead, too - I still felt rather vulnerable. Javier's warning murmured at the back of my mind. What *bad luck* could I bring down upon myself by trespassing here?

There didn't seem to be any holes, traps, or other dangers

Without the reverence, fear, and gaggle of children that had come along last time, the cramped walk went faster. I knew to look for the sudden ledge, and held Hugh back as we emerged into the massive domed chamber. "There it is," I told him, shining my light down at the eerily silent whirlpool.

"It's really here," he breathed, clutching the intricately carved walls out of fear of the edge. He glanced up at an ancient mural. "That's Seminole art, I think. Or Muscogee, before them." Upon my wary silence, he turned his light toward me. "Native Americans. Like two or three hundred years old."

"Ah," I replied, studying the depths of the chamber with my light. "I saw Christian and Hindu stuff in one of the alcoves, and carved ivory and bone art."

"I'll scrape some samples," he thought aloud, taking out his backpack and placing it carefully on the ledge. Bending down while still gripping the wall, he carefully searched through jars he'd packed for this purpose. Shivering a bit - though probably not from cold, in that oddly warm breeze - he pulled out a rope. "Tie this around something, will you? I don't like walking near this crazy instant death whirlpool thing."

I snorted. "I hadn't really thought of it like that, but I guess that's what it is." I picked up the rope and stepped past him, unafraid. Despite the heat and moisture that riddled the tunnel down, the ledge here was dry as a bone, and utterly smooth. Not so much as a speck of dust threatened to disrupt my footing.

Traveling further along the circular ledge than my prior visit three nights before, I shined my light on both the flat stone ahead and the carvings, paintings, and alcoves to my left. The work became more extensive as I walked, eventually producing a thick and elegant pillar in my beam. Looking up, I saw that it had been carved directly from living rock. Satisfied, I tied the rope around it, using several knots to ensure it would remain tight. Although I'd been unafraid, I did feel slightly relieved. There was no guarantee we wouldn't move around in our nightmarish sleep - and there was nobody here to watch over us.

After tying the rope around my waist, I walked back over.

"Here, get a sample of the water," he said, handing me a jar. "Don't touch it if you can help it. We'll get a sample before and after that nightmare thing, that you said heals people."

I nodded, and then carefully flattened myself upon the stone to reach down with the jar. I could already feel that warm sleepiness brimming at the undersides of my consciousness, waiting to take me elsewhere

I almost lost the jar. Water pulled at it with surprising strength - I'd underestimated the sheer power of the silent vortex. Barely catching it with my fingers, I used my other hand to pull it back up, even as sound began to fill the chamber. That terrible crescendo of clashing water echoed painfully around the dome above.

"You weren't kidding!" Hugh shouted, before the roar drowned him out.

We hunkered down for thirty seconds, releasing the hands from our ears only after the disturbed water fell into the center of the whirlpool and moved off into depths unknown. Gingerly, I handed him the jar.

"It's warm," he exclaimed, taking it from me with wide eyes. Carefully, he placed it within a row of little boxes in his pack. "Wait, should we be filming this?"

I dried off my hand and picked my phone out of my pocket. The device blinked and flashed at random. "Already tried that, discreetly, on my way out the first time."

"You should turn it off, then," he advised. "That'll ruin the battery -"

"It *is* off."

He frowned, but said nothing else.

Nothing remained but for us to sleep and experience the nightmare-trial.

After tying the free end of the rope around himself, Hugh clambered into an alcove behind a pillar beyond the one to which I'd anchored us. "Can't be too safe," he joked, masking anxiety. "I've been known to sleepwalk."

I looked around the massive space, and down at the wickedly strong vortex. "Try not to do that here."

He gave a half-hearted smile, and then sat back against a chipped painting of a Buddha in a vast faded-purple garden. I almost laughed at how he'd unknowingly mimicked the cross-legged image, but thought better of saying anything further. Quietly, I sat across from him in the alcove, and let that subtle tether of energy flip my awareness upside down and into unknown spaces for the second time.

This time, I was ready for the kick, and I pushed up through soft dirt with hands that seemed stronger than before. Muffled shouts came from my left, and I scrambled across orange-lit earth to dig him out from his grave. A moment later, I lifted his animated corpse from below, surprised to find him still wearing a rusted version of his glasses.

He pushed them into place on his decayed face and looked above, his sight first caught by the rotting amber sky as mine had been. Black fingers of void still tore through that sky, arcing with curious purple flashes and bolts though I couldn't be sure if it was *exactly* the same as before. Did the nightmare always start with the same setting? Or was this an ongoing place that changed as the days passed?

Despite missing most of his throat, he gasped. "Shit, you're a zombie!"

"Mostly," I replied quietly. "Keep it down. There are *things* out there somewhere. Or there were, last time."

"I'm a zombie, too!" he cried, stumbling to his feet, his moldy eyes fixated on his emaciated limbs.

"Shut up!" I whisper-shouted.

"But not your hands," he pointed, staggering back.

I held them up to the leering amber sky. He was right: although dirty and bloodied, my hands were in far better shape than the rest of my corpse-body. In fact, I could feel more sensation through them. Where the rest of my body felt hollow, distant, and feeble, my hands felt almost alive. "The water," I realized. "I touched the water with my hands."

Corpse-Hugh calmed down as he focused on what he was good at: thinking. "Why didn't the people you came with do that, then? Why didn't they touch the water to make them stronger here?"

I shook my head. "No idea. They seemed almost afraid of getting near it."

A massive shadow moved on the horizon, even as I once more became aware of that thumping organic and mechanical heartbeat making vast undulations in the world around us. I could tell Hugh was terrified, but I motioned for silence and began moving before he could panic again.

We had indeed begun at the graveyard again, although with many less people in our undead company. Broken gravestones littered the area, each overgrown by long-dead bushes and weeds. I briefly considered digging up one of the graves and checking if the bodies of Javier and his neighbors were still here even though their minds were not, but I could almost *feel* those unhallowed creatures moving about on the horizon coming our way

I clutched the graveyard's gate with one hand, momentarily stunned by how real it felt. Rusted metal moved rough and uneven against my hand, feeling every bit like an actual ancient gate. Heated breezes slipped between the bars, and I felt every flow along the skin on my hand. Was part of me truly alive? Worried, I bent down, took a piece of stone, and used it to scratch my palm.

It hurt.

Dropping the stone, I carefully opened the gate, taking care not to make it squeal too loudly. Worry surged through me. My hands were stronger, but was I more vulnerable? I very strongly did not want to get caught by those horrible *things* on the horizon but now I realized there was another concern. Did the creatures here learn from previous visits? If we headed to the hardware store basement, would they find us immediately?

An ice-cold wind moved across my hands, only to be replaced by heated breath a moment later. I looked out across the vast landscape of blasted forests, dead trees, and crumbling buildings, but I saw no reason for the chill.

Holding my hands close, now more fearful than I'd expected, I decided to abandon the previous plan. "Let's go this way," I whispered.

Hugh turned his gaunt face toward the town proper. "Isn't the hardware store that way?"

"They found us there last time," I told him, hiding the fact that the creatures had been slightly too late, despite finding us. "Let's go the opposite way while they look there."

Accepting my answer, he stumbled along behind me on rotted ankles.

I felt stronger and more capable than my previous visit choosing routes around piles of dead trees, and snapping branches out of our way with my healthy hands, I took us toward a range of hills in the distance. Silhouetted against amber, and vaguely cast in dim orange, they sat crowned by the remnants of suburban houses. I was certain we could find a place to hide there, and, more importantly, the hills were in the opposite direction of the wet dragging and shambling sounds approaching the town.

Reaching the muck-buried streets of that suburb, we delved deeper into the maze of houses, finally choosing one that seemed more intact than the rest.

Within sat the eeriest sight I'd yet found: an almost normal living space, complete with decently in-shape appliances, pictures stuck on the fridge, and a dusty but unbroken bed. For some reason, I'd expected corpses to be lying under the sheets, but the house was empty.

Hugh wavered by the fridge, the back of his exposed skull turned toward me. "Who do you think the people in these pictures are?" he asked. "Do you think we could find out, and visit them? What if their house *looks exactly like this now?*"

"It's a nightmare, who cares?"

"I mean, what if whatever happened here is going to happen soon?"

I opened the basement door and studied the sturdy room below in the odd un-light that had previously illuminated the hardware store basement. "What, like this is the future or something?"

"It's *our town*"

"How would that work, though? In their nightmare, did ancient Indians see the same thing as us?" I asked.

"Native Americans," he said absently.

"Let's go," I insisted, seeing distant shadows play on the windows.

Still lost in thought despite not having a brain, he followed me downstairs and helped me stack things on the stairs to seal ourselves inside. The marching and shuffling sounds outside grew louder, soon accompanied by that unholy *squishing* that set even my withered teeth on edge. I wondered: how many of these things *were* there? Were they around the hardware store now, too? Or did they have some sense of our presence?

If they didn't, what were they doing? Did nightmare-creatures just wander across these horrible landscapes?

Hugh sat motionless, ready to leap back into reality at a moment's notice but I noticed that, this time, there were no snuffling noises as if whatever had sniffed us out the last time was not present in this contingent.

Just as that tendril of electricity in my head began to flare, I heard a massive crushing impact somewhere outside, and the basement shuddered.

I awoke with a start, as did Hugh.

While I turned my flashlight on my hand and found that I had a scratch on my palm, he staggered to his feet, pulled off his glasses in wonder - and stumbled right into someone.

Looking up, I realized that a couple families had come down while we were sleeping. They'd had no idea we were present, but we'd completed our nightmare-trial just as they'd arrived - and a small child staggered on the edge.

A father leapt toward him, and a terrifying moment passed in slow motion but it wasn't enough, and the child fell into the water below with a splash.

Several women screamed, and Hugh shouted. Men followed the child with beams of light in a panic, looking for an opportunity to grab him. In moments, Hugh untied himself from the rope, intending to throw it to the boy.

I stood, realizing that I was already tied to both a pillar and the rope. How many seconds had passed? Ten, fifteen?

Counting in my head, I ran forward and leapt from the edge.

The warm breeze intensified in darkness, before I held my breath and shot down into battering waters. Immediately set upon by terrifyingly strong force from all directions, I forced my way to the surface, thankfully lit by a dozen flashlight beams.

"*Aqu! Aqu!*" shouted several men, running around the edge to point at the child sinking deeper toward the center. I saw him flailing around in terror across the vortex from me even as I began picking up speed myself. The shouts of those around me faded as the water's roar grew louder.

Breathless, overwhelmed, and weakening as I pushed against the torrential waters, I realized I would never get across to him in time. There was only one chance, and I could see it: the pitch black void at the center of the whirlpool, from whence that strange warm breeze emanated, and into which all light vanished.

There was no time for thought. I pushed straight toward the center, and fell forward into open air as the boy fell toward me.

The rope snapped viciously and painfully around me as the full force of the vortex pushed down on us, but I caught him and held him fast. Unable to breathe for all the liquid ripping down our bodies, I held on for dear life.

It only took a few moments, but being pulled up felt like an eternity. I could feel the hands of the community at work, pulling our rope back, and I held the boy tightly against me, my eyes fixated on the void below.

Deep down, incredibly far down, impossibly far down straight down that vortex, deep in whatever unknown spaces in the earth the waters went something glimmered with an almost electrical snap.

The light lasted only for a split second, but I knew I'd seen it.

Pulled slowly up to the ledge, I handed the boy off, and then collapsed on unyielding stone. As the disrupted waters fell away into that impossible darkness, I began hearing the people around me again shouts, cheers, claps on the back

but I processed nothing.

There was *something down there*

I had to get down there

After Hugh's tests on our samples, we would have to return with proper climbing gear as I lay there soaked in warm waters, a strange energy creeping into my muscles and awareness, I began thinking up the arguments I would need to convince him

	<TEXT> There it sat, exactly as he'd described it: a black rectangle in the swamp. Muddy water sloshed around the ancient stone lip, but worn grooves directed any excess away from the dark ingress. Wading forward through the muck, I took a closer look.

Carved steps led down into pitch, their centers worn down by centuries of passing feet.

Several children giggled at my visible fear, and called out Spanish taunts. A moment later, they swarmed down the steps and into the murk, completely unafraid of the ominous horizontal portal. Their exasperated parents quickly followed.

I turned to my coworker, who stood beside me in the humid evening gloom. "You're sure this is safe?"

"I sleep three times," he responded, doing his best to reassure me in poor English. He looked extremely uncomfortable standing still in the waist-high water. Or was it my presence here that had him so anxious?

He slapped at a bug on his arm, and, as he did so, I again studied his thumb, now whole and healthy I was willing to entertain the notion that something strange had happened to restore the thumb I'd seen him lose on the job the day before, but this impossible tunnel in the middle of Florida swampland couldn't possibly have a medical miracle hidden within could it?

I prepared myself for a prank, even though my darker thoughts refused to fully take comfort. I'd *seen his thumb fall.* I'd watched as the poorly-maintained machine had sliced right through the flesh of his hand. Wondering if he'd be alright without health insurance or the ability to go to a hospital, I'd been unable to sleep the entire night.

And then I'd seen him take the bandage off on the way out of work the next day - without a wound to be seen. I'd seen him flex and test his new  thumb, and then hurry away before any of our other coworkers had seen the truth.

My angry and confused pursuit had brought me along on this trek with many neighbors from his community. They hadn't trusted me at first, but Javier had told them I was a good guy. 

On his word, they'd allowed me to come with them to *this* some sort of odd community activity. I wasn't sure I was still glad for the opportunity.

Musty, chill air hit my senses as I first stepped down those decaying stairs. The smoothly carved walls seem to grow imperceptibly tighter the further down I moved, but I forced my pulse to slow and told myself that it was just my fearful imagination. Eventually, the only thing I saw behind and above me was a dim rectangle of foggy evening swamplight.

Javier stood ahead of me, waiting, and he shined his flashlight on a deep puddle at the base of the moldy stairs. I stepped across it onto damp rock.

The tunnel led down at a slight angle, forming an endless rectangle of cramped space that seemed to go on far longer than I had the nerve for. As Javier led the way, I began to get the feeling that this tunnel might never actually end a feeling strengthened by a very odd movement of air against my  face that I had only begun to notice when every other sense had grown dull.

There was a breeze moving against my cheeks and against my arms. I was certain of that now. The strange thing about it, though, was that it was completely even. I focused my awareness on my skin as we crept ever deeper, but I never felt a single ebb or flow. The air coming from below moved with exacting evenness, as if pushed through the earth by some vast and unknown machine.

The other detail that concerned me: it was *warm*.

A friendly hand shot out and held me back. I froze in place.

The vector of that eerily even breeze had changed, and now came from the side. I could now see a dozen flashlights moving around to my left as the families and children moved along a heavyset ledge that curved off into darkness.

"Here," Javier told me quietly, shining his light ahead to show me the hallowed place to which we had come.

A few feet ahead of me, the stone ledge ceased, making way for an enormous emptiness under a massive stone dome. Bit by bit, where the beam of light fell, I made sense of the space. Utterly quiet, calmer than any church, it sat like a perfect bubble under the earth, a natural cathedral

But it was not empty. Shining his light down, he showed me what lay beneath that emptiness.

The ledge ran a full circle around the colossal space, but, only inches below that scant security ran a tremendous circle of shifting shadow.

I stepped closer.

He pulled me back roughly. "No."

Respecting his concerns, I had him shine the light down for a few moments more as I tried to comprehend what I was seeing.

The wide, curved, smooth vision below was clearly in motion, but made no noise. The longer I looked, the more I became certain that it had to be water a monumental amount of water, spinning and circling down into a massive whirlpool. The shape was obvious, and the substance familiar, but my ears heard nothing.

Understanding my confusion, Javier took a small rock and threw it forward.

I watched it sail forth silently into that dizzying glass, frozen with anticipation

The moment it hit, the slight sound of rushing water reached my ears. As I watched, the disturbance caused by the impact propagated throughout the vortex, and the sound grew into a murmur, and then a roar, and then an almost painful crescendo of torrential noise. The families plugged their ears and waited, and I followed suit.

About thirty seconds later, the entire mass of disturbed water circled the center of the vortex and dipped unceremoniously into void.

Silence fell once more.

I understood, then, why it was so quiet: whatever the source of this water was, the whole system had worn a smooth path through living rock over the ages. The whirlpool had become preternaturally polished, to the point that it no longer made any noise at all.

Thus, we stood in complete silence, in a natural cathedral that pumped out an unending breeze.

But why was it *warm?*

"Sleep," Javier told me. "Sleep here." He pointed to an alcove a little ways from where the families and children were setting up blankets. The small space offered slightly more protection from the naked edge of oblivion. I crawled within, studying the intricately engraved images within.

Faded paint flecked from icons of Mary and Jesus as a child. Even older images beside that detailed a strange elephant with many arms. Below that, someone had worked ivory and bone into ancient carvings.

"Sleep," my friend said again. He held up his thumb to his light, and I noticed - for the first time - that the skin there was a slightly lighter color than the rest of his hand, as if it had not seen as much sun or sweat. "If we sleep entire dream, healed."

I wasn't sure I understood, but I felt no danger now that I understood the importance of this place to these people. This wasn't a prank, nor a trick, and many other people had clearly been here throughout the ages.

I almost dared to believe that something mystical might happen here - but *sleep entire dream*, what did that mean? I tried to decipher his cryptic command even as my head began to feel oddly heavy. My lungs seemed filled with calm warmth, and I slumped next to him against the elegant walls of the little alcove.

A vanishingly thin tendril of electricity seemed to tug at my consciousness, pulling my awareness forward. The sensation was not overwhelming or fear-inducing; rather, I sensed that I could pull back at any time - and pull back I did.

I awoke slowly, highly aware of the precarious nature of the ledge I'd fallen asleep on. Looking around, I saw Javier and several other families sleeping by the glow of their flashlights. None seemed in danger slowly I let myself nod off again.

That thin cord of energy returned, pulling my thoughts and sensations out of my skull, and I let it happen, warily poised to pull back at the first sign of a trap.

Floating black seemed to move around me, sliding past, and then spinning one full rotation. Upside down, I felt my back press weakly against a ceiling no, the floor soft dirt

Pushing forth, I fought my way out of soft resistance, sitting up only after great effort.

I sat stunned for a time.

A vast sky of rotting amber arched overhead, shot through by skeletal black fingers arcing with ephemeral purple energies. I could sense that the dim fiery sight would have been painful to behold, had I normal fleshy eyes.

Touching my face, receiving only the weakest textures and impulses, I felt soft gore and feeble rot. A hole seemed to exist where my cheek should have been, and my eyes were but empty sockets. I watched my own finger as I slid it within those sockets, feeling around in horror, and I sat shocked as that blackened, rotting digit moved first into my sight, and then past.

Indeed, my whole body was a skeletal and withered mockery of the human form, a decomposing corpse burst forth from the grave.

In the distance, I saw several groups of corpses shambling along, and I knew them to be the families that I had accompanied.

Above me, a decrepit cadaver urged me, without words, to rise.

I knew, somehow, that this was my friend and coworker.

He motioned for silence but I had no jaw, in any case.

If my eyes worked with empty sockets, might my voice have worked without a mouth?

I chose not to risk it. Something was very wrong here, and I decided to follow his lead.

Pulled completely out of the fragile earth, I wobbled on frail legs held together only by the barest strings of rotting muscle. More graves lined the area, and my empty eyes followed an ornate metal fence around to an entrance. The malformed children and their parents moved towards it. We followed.

Beyond lay vast empty tracts of blasted forest crowned by horizons filled with the crumbling silhouettes of buildings. I could see no sun, but that rotting amber glow from the charged sky above lit everything with a dull eerie cast.

Traveling as quickly as their emaciated limbs would take them, the families ahead moved with fearful haste across the flattened sea of dead trees. We followed.

Blackened ramshackle buildings grew near, even as I became aware of a strange sound. I had no ears, but, still, I heard: a world-filling thumping, slow and powerful, at once organic and mechanical. I might have thought it a massive metal heart in the sky, had I not already been well aware that the unhallowed sky above held nothing but blight and putrescence.

I wanted to ask Javier what that sound was, but he shook his head to indicate continued silence. He heard it, too - and, somehow, I perceived fear in the half a face he still carried.

A new sound had slowly become louder than the first; a shuffling, and a scraping, and a great many creakings, overshadowing the mysterious squishy mechanical heartbeat that otherwise filled the world. I had the distinct notion that these new sounds were much closer, perhaps even within sight against the spectral horizon but I saw nothing but weird shadows moving between distant silhouettes.

Ahead, a deteriorating father held open a bolthole for us at the base of a building. He waved for us to enter as quickly as possible, and Javier moved ahead.

I stopped.

I *recognized it.* This was a hardware store a block off the main street of our small town. The sign, although unreadable, still remained in partial blackened ruin.

Javier waved his stump of an arm at me, and those strange shuffling and scraping sounds grew closer, so I broke out of my fear to follow him through the hole into the basement of the building.

The father and two other men pulled rocks and rubble down to seal us in - and we waited, huddled in phantasmal darkness.

I could still see within that basement, although no light source was possible, and I saw families holding each other tightly and awaiting some great terror to pass.

The hardware store's tools lay piled about, rusted and ruined by the passage of time. A single corpse sat in the corner, an old gun in its hand, the top of its head missing. Unlike us, it was not animated, and remained in place with that weird grin unique to bare skeletal jaws. Grime still remained where gums had once been

I sank down as unearthly creakings began moving by outside, mixed with scraping sighs and shuffling squishing. A legion of unknown abominations marched past our building, or, perhaps, one single unthinkable entity. Something heavy poked at the rocks and rubble that had sealed us in, and I felt a collective lungless breath held by our group - but, then, the curious unknown *thing* moved on, apparently satisfied.

The marching continued for an immeasurable eternity, and I felt our group grow more frightened. Was this all supposed to have ended already? What was it Javier had said - *sleep entire dream?* Was this a nightmare, then? And to be healed, as he had been, we had to remain 'til the end?

I still felt that tenuous little umbilical cord of electricity connecting me to my real body, back in that cathedral cave by that impossible vortex. I knew that I could go back any time but would my cowardice cost these children their healing?

Something snuffled outside the rubble of our building again, and a spike of fear almost sent me running back to reality but I held on, and closed my lidless eyes

Rock ruptured somewhere nearby, and children and adults alike screamed without lungs. Something penetrated the sanctity of our space - something metallic, massive, and wickedly bladed. Opening my eyes, I saw - *no!*

At the last moment, my mental lifeline back to my body flared of its own accord.

A searing white blur of electricity overtook my awareness, and I sat up, gasping.

Flashlights concerned chatter real breathing I held my hand up, and saw it whole once more. Down the ledge, families checked on their children, and happy shouts followed. I saw one family cutting the cast off of a formerly broken arm and one child, who had been carried in, now stood on his own.

We'd made it. We'd stuck it out until the end...

Javier shined his light roughly in my face. "See now. You won't tell?"

Instead of responding immediately, I pulled my sleeve down, looking for a small scar I'd had since high school. My heart leapt into my throat as I found my arm smooth and unblemished.

"You won't tell?" he asked again.

I stared back at him with wide eyes. "No. I won't tell."

He seemed relieved, and held out a hand to lift me to my feet. "No come back, bad luck, if come back too much."

Nodding, I pretended to agree with him. I decided, at that moment, to pretend like I'd been spiritually touched by the grace of that unreal place. I'd walk back with these people, thank them, and head home until tomorrow night, when nothing on Earth could stop me from coming back here and finding out more.

What force had healed these people, and me? What had that insane dream world world been about? What nightmares walked those devastated lands? And where had this ancient vortex come from, and what role did it play in what I'd experienced? I resolved to uncover all these things. All this *had* to be explainable within the realms of science.

Bad luck? I don't believe in bad luck

	<TITLE> So I thought I ate a spider in my sleep... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-31 22:40:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remembered that half-awake moment of confusion very vividly. I groaned, blinked, and moved my mouth around as I blearily stared up at the dark ceiling. There was some sort of weird hair or something on my lip pulling at it, I felt a subtle slippery tug in my throat, and it took another three seconds to slide the whole thread out.

Disgusted and confused, I held it up to the sliver of moonlight coming in the window. What the hell was this thing? Some unknown girl's hair? No - it was wispier than that, more reflective, and a little stickier

I felt suddenly queasy as the thought occurred to me that this was probably a silken spider thread. Had I just eaten a spider in my sleep? Jesus christ!

I got up that night, refusing to go back to sleep, but the day's light dispelled my silly fears. If I *had* eaten a spider, it was long dead by now thanks to the stomach acid generously donated by my night-long anxiety.

A few weeks passed, and I mostly forgot about the incident.

I noticed that, very slowly, I began having trouble exercising at my usual rate. I was sleeping worse, and groggy even when I did sleep. I thought that it might just be the season, or allergies, and I tried to ignore it until I fell asleep at work, and my boss sternly told me to go the doctor.

I was never one for the doctor, but I was tired of being tired, so I finally manned up and went.

I sat in the stark white office waiting for quite some time. I figured the doctor probably wouldn't have any answers for me - they never seemed to care enough to pursue individual mysteries - but I *was* hoping for a prescription or something.

I sat still as the nurse did all the usual tests - blood pressure, pulse, and so on. Nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

She left, and I waited some more.

Finally, the doctor walked in, and greeted me without looking. She asked about my symptoms, nodded a bit, and then used a stethoscope to listen to my chest.

That's when she frowned. "It might be allergies, or even asthma. Sounds a bit scratchy in there."

"That's what I thought," I told her. "I've been wracking my brain. Hell, for awhile, I even thought it was a spider I ate."

She glanced up at me, making eye contact for the first time. "You ate a spider?"

"In my sleep, I think."

She hesitated. "There's this new spider infestation. African, I think. We've had a couple bad reactions to bites. Total longshot here, but if it bit your esophagus or stomach, you wouldn't feel it, but you could still have a reaction. Let's get a soft tissue scan done."

Confused and worried, but hopeful, I followed her advice and went to the next building over in the complex for the scan. The hour queue allowed me to fill out every form and exhaust every magazine in the small waiting room before they finally called me up. I followed the attendant warily into the imaging room.

I'd seen it on television, sure, but the experience was far more intense than it looked. I had to lie still for quite some time, fighting all sorts of sudden urges to itch, sneeze, or cough while I waited. By the time it was over, I felt a built-up coughing fit coming on.

The smiling attendant came in, told me I did a great job, and started checking things. Alright, I sighed. It was over. Time to get up and get out of here -

Another attendant peeked in the door. A doctor stood behind him. They both motioned for their colleague, and I found myself momentarily alone.

I sat up, watching them confer in hushed tones just outside.

The three approached me. "We're going to need you to come with us real quick. It's not an emergency, we just need to speak to you in private."

Feeling hot from my approaching coughing fit, I followed them to a small room, where they directed me to sit and handed me a biohazard waste bin.

"I want you to close your eyes and cough into this trashcan, alright son?" the doctor told me, his tone quavering. "And whatever you do, keep your eyes closed. It's important that you don't look, for, um - radiological reasons - from the imaging machine."

"Yeah, the machine," an attendant echoed, gulping.

Their masked fear had my pulse racing, but I was more than ready to start coughing to ease the pain in my throat. Leaning over the waste bin, I began a heavy, hacking cough, letting out endless choking breaths that seemed filled with weird dust and particulates. Had I accidentally breathed in something radioactive from the machine?

I kept coughing. I tasted a little blood. I paused. I breathed in and out. They urged me to keep coughing, their voices shaking and subtly disgusted.

"Come on, just a little more, son," the doctor told me. His practiced hands trembled on my shoulder.

The last cough seemed to spasm my whole body, and I felt clotted particulates rise up my throat and finally escape. Spitting and pushing more air out through my mouth, I got the last of it out of me.

Feeling much better, I made the mistake of relaxing - and opening my eyes.

The doctor saw me staring down, and gripped my shoulders tight. "Don't panic. You're safe now. It's just that - we saw the note about a spider you ate, and we did look at your stomach, but your stomach was fine. It was well, they're attracted to moving air, see and it had made webs, and laid eggs thousands of eggs in your lungs."

In shock, I nodded, unable to do anything but stare at the three-inch-thick pile of baby spiders roiling around in the bottom of the waste bin.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Certain Lack of Substance </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-09 23:27:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I stopped to check directions on my phone as I often did in that area. Something about those endless suburban roads always had me feeling vaguely lost, a sensation only temporarily alleviated by the sighting of any given landmark that I recognized from prior trips. All the houses looked the same, all the cars looked the same, and the streets were always quiet and empty at night.
 
The map on my phone showed me that I'd pulled into the wrong suburb... again. I actually recognized this one from last week, when I'd pulled in here by accident the first time. The curve of the street and the placement of the cars had seemed familiar, and that was why I'd thought I'd been on the right track.
 
Yawning, I took a big gulp of coffee, and idly scanned the neighborhood - a patchwork of velvet shadows couched between large bushes, and inky darkness draped under the eaves of heavy trees, all set against cutting beams and gentle spheres of light cast randomly by unevenly-spaced lamps.
 
I watched, mildly intrigued, as the silhouette of a dog ran by, skirting through yards and slipping between shadowed bushes. It made no noise, opting instead to move hurriedly past the edge of the neighborhood and off into the maze of trees beyond.
 
It occurred to me that I might have just seen the escape of somebody's beloved pet, so I yawned again, took another gulp of lukewarm coffee, and climbed out of my car. The cessation of engine noise and headlights brought an immediate collapse of sensation cloying darkness and vast silence gripped me, and I made an uncomfortable walk toward the nearest beam of pale yellow light.
 
Standing uncomfortably within it, I peered around, wondering why I felt so oddly alone and exposed. There were dozens of people sleeping in the houses all around me. In case of unexpected danger, a single shout would rouse them all. Why, then, did I feel surrounded by solitude and desolation?

I decided to forget the dog. It was long gone, and something here felt very wrong.

Turning to head back toward my vehicle, I accidentally bumped a car parked near the sidewalk - and it shifted nearly an inch.
 
Confused, I pushed it again - and it shifted as I put my weight against it. It was heavy, certainly, but not immovable. Peering inside the car, I saw all the seats and interior I expected leaning underneath, I shined my phone upward.
 
The innards of the car were all empty. It was just a shell - a prop!
 
Seized by an impossible notion, I crept up the front lawn of the nearest house, and peered in through one of the dark windows, my head rushing with the strangeness of the act.
 
Inside, I saw all the furniture and trappings of a normal suburban house. I almost turned away, disappointed but, as I put my hands against the window to see better, the frame and the glass fell inward, smashing to the floor within with a tremendous crash.
 
I stood in place, peering around the dark neighborhood.
 
No dogs barked. No lights came on. The area remained deathly silent.
 
Convinced that my insane notion was more real than not, I climbed inside the now very open window.
 
The furniture within broke easily. The nicely upholstered couches and chairs had no strength, no internal construction - more props! The television sat empty of mechanisms, and the fridge had been gutted climbing the stairs, I moved to the second floor, intent on making sure nobody was inside the house.
 
I froze as I saw them lying in bed. An older man and woman, asleep had I just broken into someone's house? Had I had too much caffeine, and gone delusional?
 
As I stood frozen, it occurred to me that I could hear no snoring or breathing I waited for several minutes neither sleeper shifted. Trembling with adrenaline, I crept closer, not sure of my own intent I stood above them in the pale darkness, staring down at the face of an old man barely illuminated by a sliver of light from the window. He seemed real enough but I had to know. I reached out a single finger to poke him.
 
He was warm, and his skin felt completely real. I was starting to believe my own caffeine-induced hallucination theory and, if so, it was probably time to bolt before he woke up and called the police
 
I stepped awkwardly on the edge of a carpet near the bed, and fell forward, finding myself caught in a morass of strange warm sheets. As I pushed and lifted myself out of it, I realized, with an ice-cold shock, that they weren't sheets at all the old man's body had collapsed inward into a mess of loose skin and flesh.
 
I stared at his face as it deflated - warm internal stench escaping through his loose eyes, nose, and mouth.
 
Was this horrible corpse-skin a prop, too? Who the hell would have gone through the trouble of building such an intensely detailed recreation of a neighborhood? And why make such a disgusting shell of a person? What purpose did this place serve? These questions ran through my head as I bolted down the stairs and back out through the window.
 
I knew my mistake in reasoning the instant I tried to open my car - only to have it shift under the force of my hand.
 
This place hadn't been *built* hollow - something was consuming machine and man from the inside out, leaving empty mockeries of suburban life behind.
 
Had that dog been running from *it?*
 
I bolted, then, sticking to the middle of the street and constantly looking around in a barely-sensible panic. I didn't know what I was looking out for - whether a creature, a spirit, or a force of nature - but it had hollowed out my car while I'd been inside that house, so I knew it still had to be near.
 
I hit the main road at the suburb entrance with a sigh of relief. My pounding heart, burning lungs, and tired legs urged me to rest, so I kneeled under a dim orange streetlight for a moment, and stared back at the hollow neighborhood with wide eyes. Nothing moved, as far as I could tell.
 
As I began to recover my energy - still wondering if I hadn't just had a delusional episode - I felt the hair on the back of my neck begin to stand up, as if my animal instincts were trying to warn me of some unknown danger. I peered closer at the dark suburb, scanning the shadows, until a thought occurred to me
 
Shot through by terror, I tore off my shirt and threw it on the pavement.
 
There, on the back of my shirt, illuminated by the dim orange streetlight overhead, sat several crawling insects of a horrific kind I'd never seen. Four inches wide each, shaped like spiky coins, and jet black, they resembled some sort of oversized nightmarish tick. I watched in disgust as one shot forth a serrated proboscis and attempted to pierce through the fabric only to hit the pavement below.
 
I took off running again, slapping and hitting myself at every little sensation on my skin, terrified that those otherworldly ticks had found me again.
 
I did get away, but I doubt I will ever be able to sit still again. Every time I feel a prickle, every time my hair stands on end I fear it will be those hollow ticks again, creeping down the back of my neck, crawling along my skin I have nightmares that I'll feel one tiny little stab, and then another, and then another before a sense of pulling and lightness wells up in me; my blood, tissues, and organs being vacuumed out and consumed by hundreds of tiny little mouths, indiscriminately hungry thousands of tiny little pincers strong enough to consume flesh, wood, and metal alike

The thing that still haunts me, even days later, is the fact that nobody's noticed. There's at least one entire false suburb sitting out there - all appearance, no substance - and nobody has raised an alarm. There haven't been any articles, or radio alerts, or police actions. Worse still, is the fact that I would risk being thought insane to report it myself but I can't find my way back to that particular suburb.

They all look the same </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Disturbing Call </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-04 23:29:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My friend Jordan has been a cop for quite some time now. Something has been bothering her for the last month or so, and, recently, we finally got her to tell us. The week she began acting sullen and distant, she revealed, she received a call about a late night break-in at a local church.

A middle-aged woman in a suit and an older man dressed like a priest stood waiting outside when she and her partner arrived at the location. The two were both visibly agitated, and the priest quickly told her about the broken glass they'd found around the side of the church. There wasn't supposed to be anyone present that late at night, so they knew it wasn't an accident of some kind.

The nearby community had several large and modern churches, and this building was no exception. The building was more like a compound than a church - large enough to provide numerous and varied services. A series of huge windows had her immediately concerned about the safety of approaching the building. Sighting the broken glass from afar, she returned to the car and called for backup.

Another car arrived shortly, bringing two more officers and a canine unit. They checked the side of the building, and then - they never show this part on television, she told me with a sigh - she grabbed a broom and had to sweep up the broken glass so that the dogs wouldn't hurt their feet on the way in. With that done, they left one officer out by the cars, and she, her partner, and the officer handling the canine proceeded inside.

They immediately disliked the interior. The church was clean, white-walled, and open, but that was exactly the problem. The large open chamber formed what she called a *fatal funnel*, leaving the three of them extremely vulnerable if there did happen to be somebody still inside. They listened from outside for several minutes, but the dog remained calm, and no sounds came from inside.

After a couple more checks through the windows, they moved in, finding the large community area empty. The three of them quickly chose better positions near doors to the rest of the compound.

It was there that Jordan first noticed the odd smell. It was industrial, somewhat definitely chemical and familiar, but difficult to identify. The dog happily sniffed around, but made no alerts.

They proceeded into the sanctuary proper, checking between the pews with flashlights one row at a time. The odd smell was weaker there, and a thorough search of the altar and tiny back hallway found nothing. They gave the room one last scan and then closed the large doors, sealing the room behind them.

The other direction in the church led deeper into a nest of hallways. Clearing corners and securing rooms one by one, they moved through a kitchen, and what looked like classrooms. The further they went, the stronger that odd smell grew nearing the end of the complex, they began seeing construction equipment and painting gear.

In one of the half-finished rooms at the end of the hallway, a ladder led up into the building's attic.

Here, then, was another major hurdle. She sent her partner, the rookie, up first. There were a few tense moments as he kept low and scanned the cluttered expanse with his flashlight, but nothing seemed big enough for a vandal to hide behind. With the dog still calm, she followed her partner up, and they did a slow search to confirm that the attic was empty.

Done with the whole building, they returned to the point of entry.

One of Jordan's on-the-job fears had always been clearing a building, telling the owners it was safe, and then finding out later they'd missed something - leaving the poor people to walk obliviously into danger. So, she waited at the end of the hallways just a moment longer, thinking over the layout of the building. She called up the officer outside on her radio to ask if there was a basement - and that was the moment someone burst out from one of the rooms they'd cleared.

Caught off guard, the large man was an easy tackle, although he seemed terrified. He kept babbling about being punished for his sins, and he kept fighting to escape, so it took both her and her partner to cuff him and convince him to calm down. By the time he lapsed into a confused silence, the strange smell from the hallways had grown overpowering.

Curious, she proceeded with her partner into the room from which the man had come. A large black square now sat clearly visible in the back corner, a hidden door ajar above it. Her flashlight showed an edge lined by duct tape and a freshly painted set of white steps. She carefully climbed down into a small tunnel.

Her radio came alive, and she quickly turned the volume down - and she was glad that she did, because the canine handler told her that the man they'd cuffed was babbling about *people down there*. On edge, she and her partner moved into a low, wide space set in the heavy foundations of the building.

Within, they found a series of medical machines hooked up to a large block of what looked like concrete, or perhaps heavy plaster, also painted white. Little tubes curled up and along the top of it, while large tubes entered the lower half, all filled with various unidentifiable substances warily, she cleared the corner of the huge block, and confirmed that the room was empty. There were no people, despite what the intruder had claimed, and the smell of plastic and chemicals was worse than ever. She guessed that the duct tape around the trapdoor had been keeping the smell sealed in.

It was then she noticed dozens of little white protrusions from the concrete something about their arrangements seemed familiar it was only when they moved slightly that she recognized them as the protruding tips of fifty or sixty fingers, all painted white.

It took a moment for the truth of what was happening to sink in. She understood almost immediately that there were people encased in cement before her, but it took her a few more seconds to comprehend what the machines, tubes, and wires hooked up to the block were for - these people weren't being killed they were being *kept alive*

In a flash, she was on her radio warning the officer outside, but he failed to respond, and she and her partner bolted back up the tiny stairs and out through their point of entry.

By the cruisers, they found the officer with a knife sticking from his leg, and his wrists bound. The priest and the middle-aged woman in a suit were nowhere to be seen, and both their cars were gone.

The police are conducting a search, certainly, but the two have yet to be found. She told me that they're keeping the story under wraps while the investigation is ongoing, but she trusted her friends with the tale, because she had to tell *somebody.* The physical details, she said, felt distant, like a horror movie but it was the aftermath that kept her up nights.

The rescue staff had carved out the survivors one by one, freeing them from the concrete block with heavy tools, careful cutting, and constant medical care. Each of the young men and women freed from the block had been filthy, burned all over by chemicals from the material they'd been stuck inside, and emaciated beyond description. Corpselike, charred, and leaking all sorts of horrendous fluids, they'd seemed hardly human. It was insane to think that this ongoing torture had been happening beneath the feet of children attending Sunday school

Each freed victim gave varying answers as to the time they'd been abducted and imprisoned. The most recent had only been encased for a month, and she was grateful for rescue. Each successive captive had been buried alive several years before the next the oldest two had been trapped in concrete for eighteen and twenty-two years, respectively. The part that kept Jordan up at night, she told us - after downing a shot - was that, once freed from living entombment, they'd both begged to be put back inside again. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Awkward Moments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-03 23:20:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I always regret awkward social interactions, and I can't help but obsess, for days, over what I should have done. This last one could have been particularly bad, had I not chosen to avert disaster at the last moment.

I was going for my daily run through the neighborhood when I noticed three kids playing mostly unattended - a babysitter stood thirty feet ahead of me talking on her phone, her attention elsewhere. One boy seemed to be about eight. A slightly younger girl threw a ball to him, caught it, then threw it to a much younger boy.

He failed to catch the ball, and it bounced past him, somehow managing to fall into the slats of an old air conditioning unit out back of the nearest house. The unit was quiet, and the fan was offline, but it was a hot day out, and I slowed my run out of concern.

The younger boy ran up to the unit, climbed on top, and reached his arm down inside.

"Hey!" I shouted at the boy. "That's dangerous! That fan could turn on at any time!"

Yeah, that's what I should have done, in retrospect. The kids would have screamed and run, thinking I was a dangerous stranger, but the boy would have pulled his arm out from the machine.

"Um, are you supposed to be watching those kids?" I asked the babysitter as I passed her.

Yeah, that's what I should have done. She would have rolled her eyes and told me to mind my own business, but she would have made him get down from there.

I stopped in place and lowered my sunglasses, looking in the boy's direction. The babysitter would have noticed, and only momentarily thought I was some sort of creep staring at the kids, but then she would have quickly seen the danger herself and ran over to him.

Yeah, that's what I should have done.

In the end, I chose to say nothing. I don't ever talk to people I don't know. I can't risk the embarrassment; I can't risk the endless replays I run in my head, worrying about what I should have done, over and over and over...

As their myriad horrified screams grew louder than the suddenly surging fan - as little red dots from the cloud of blood mist dotted my sunglasses - I sighed with relief. That could have been *so* awkward </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thinking back, I believe all this started with the disappearance of my girlfriend.

We had an amazing connection - an intensity of spirit and love that felt, at all times, uplifting and warm. We didn't need words. We simply *existed* in a state of bonded happiness. I thought that, maybe, that bliss had kept me oblivious to the terrible things going on around me, but, the more I learned, the more I realized that nothing bad had happened before she disappeared.

And I don't mean that she left, or that I was unable to find her. I was standing outside a movie theater with her and an acquaintance that we'd run into by chance. I said something, he made a funny remark, she laughed - and then she was gone.

Nothing remained but a slight breeze from the air spilling into the place where she'd been.

The expression on my friend's face slowly dropped as he saw mine. This wasn't a joke, prank, or trick. She'd simply blinked out of existence.

Standing there, we discussed what we'd seen in hushed tones. There were several disparate little groups of people walking in and out of the theater, but none had noticed. Surreptitiously, he and I circled the building, then made a run through the inside.

She was nowhere to be found.

Eventually, we had no choice but to return to our homes, and hope that we'd imagined the whole thing but hours passed then a day and then a week. Nobody had seen or heard from her.

I called her parents, but never got an answer. I went around to their place, which I vaguely remembered from a holiday visit at some time in the past peering in the windows, I saw the dining room that I remembered, replete with furniture and settings but the rest of the house was completely empty. Had they moved out? If so, why was the dining room still furnished? I looked around for passersby, but the quiet suburban street sat desolate and lonely.

I went by her work next. The grocery store, and the bakery department in which she worked, ran lively with bustling energy. I watched random strangers picking out fruit and vegetables in the produce section, oddly relieved to be surrounded by life again. The streets of our hometown had been feeling increasingly deserted, but I'd only truly recognized that creeping sense of isolation once it had been lifted.

Here, then, everything was fine. Life was proceeding as normal save for the absence of my girlfriend.

As I'd feared, none of her coworkers had seen her.

Beginning to grasp at straws, I headed for *my* work, hoping that maybe she'd called and asked for me. I arrived there already uneasy. I recognized the building, certainly, but the area had the same vague aura of quiet emptiness that had surrounded her parents' house. With a dark pit tightening in my stomach, I peered in the front windows...

Oh. The front desk sat within, along with all of the pictures on the walls I remembered. I shook my head and laughed quietly at myself. It must have been the weekend, of course nobody was there! Pulling out my keycard, I accessed the side door, intent on checking my work phone messages. If she'd called, -

...everything beyond the reception area was empty. Blank white walls stretched off into gloomy darkness.

I couldn't understand it. I'd just met her here the other day, right here by the front desk where had my job gone? My cubicle? My coworkers? I tried to recall them, tried to retrace their faces and personalities but I succeeded only in summoning hollow impressions, and choppy experiences that felt incomplete and second-hand.

Returning to the outside of the building, I stood in a daze, unsure what to do next.

While I stood there staring absently across the parking lot, I noticed a shimmer.

The opposite building across the lot began blurring, wavering, and then - it vanished.

For some reason, I ran toward the phenomenon rather than away from it. I had to see something, touch something for myself coming to the space where it'd been, I found a vast, cracked foundation, free of rubble and destruction, save for several pipes now furiously spilling water from their jutting ends.

"You!" I shouted at a suited businessman at the sidewalk's corner.

"Me?" he asked, lowering his cellphone.

"Didn't you just come out of there?" I asked, indicating the exposed foundation where a building had just been.

"Yep."

"Well, where'd it go?" I asked.

"What do you mean? It's right there," he answered.

"The building! The building that was here!"

He seemed confused. "There's never been a building there."

"So, what, you work in an unfinished foundation?"

He nodded. "That's my desk, sitting over there."

Indeed, a single wooden desk sat among the jagged bricks. "Then why are there pipes shooting water all over the place?" I shouted at him.

He shrugged. "Contractors cutting corners."

Not believing the surreal conversation, I looked over at the building once more, noticed his desk was gone, and turned back - but the sidewalk sat empty before me.

At that moment, the true weight of what had been happening began sinking in. I fought a rising panic and tried to think. I'd read stories about things like this horror, science fiction there was always a way out, if only one could think hard enough but, in my panicked state, I couldn't recall the content of those tales.

I did notice, however, that the businessman I'd just talked to hadn't been cognizant of the changes - but my acquaintance at my girlfriend's disappearance *had* been.

I had no idea where he lived, so I returned to the outside of the movie theater, hoping that he would notice strange things happening and put two and two together the way I had. I felt a brief surge of hope as I sighted him already sitting on a bench, waiting for me.

"My house is a prop," he greeted me sadly, his head in his hands. "The people I know, if they haven't already vanished, seem only shadows of their former selves. It's like the memories and experiences are blinking right out of their heads, the same way buildings and streets are"

"Does anyone else notice?" I asked him, sitting next to him on the bench. I chose not to comment on his overly loud despair and uneven tone. "I talked to one guy who remained convinced nothing weird was going on right up until he disappeared, too."

He shook his head slowly.

For a time, we sat in silence, just thinking.

Across the movie theater parking lot, one of several trees shimmered, wavered and vanished.

He glanced over at me, and I nodded, confirming that I'd seen it, too.

Another tree went a few minutes later, leaving a slight section of elevated highway visible.

The highway blinked out of existence soon after.

The entire sky bright blue, white clouds, and burning sunlight, all began shimmering and wavering.

He and I both straightened at the same time.

"It's symbolic," he realized aloud, mirroring my thought. "Units of meaning disappearing one by one how else could ideas, memories, even the goddamn *sky* -"

Hurricane winds blasted and buffeted us as the sky itself blinked out of existence, leaving only blank barren blackness overhead.

"What could do this?" he shouted, gripping the bench.

I shook my head. I had an idea, based on what I'd seen since she disappeared but it was insane. "Do you think?" I yelled over the loud winds.

"What?!"

"We think therefore we are, right?" I shouted. "I know *I* think. Do you?"

"I think so" he yelled back.

"Then we must really exist," I told him, hanging on. "That means there's hope."

No more remained to be said. We clung to that bench for dear life as trees, cars, buildings, even the parking lot and movie theater itself flung off into the void, shimmering, wavering, and vanishing as they went.

Once the air ran out, we began suffocating - but, thankfully, about fifteen seconds later, the concept of breathing went, too. In muted, horrified relief, we sat like sentient corpses on an aging wooden bench on a small circle of sidewalk all that remained of the universe.

"Come on please" I said without breath, without words.

We had some time left. It wasn't quite the end she appeared with a few minutes to spare.

In the exact spot that she'd vanished, my girlfriend blinked back into existence, her arrival bringing a massive wave of restoration. A split-second sphere of ideation and creation brought everything we'd known back in a roaring moment.

Running up to her through the dying breezes of renewal, I grabbed her by the shoulders. "You're back!"

She smiled. "I can't believe it. I got back"

"How long were you gone?" I asked, trying not to sound too panicked.

"It took me a few minutes to fall asleep again," she replied, excited. "It was such a good dream. I wanted to come back more than anything in the world, but it's so rare to actually get back to the *same dream*"

Even though I'd suspected, based on the fact that everything in our surreal existence had been based purely on her experiences and knowledge, the confirmation still hit me somewhere deep. Even as my very soul joined my panic, I forced myself to deliver the words I'd practiced while watching the world ebb.

"Listen to me I don't know if this happens often, or if this is an insane and unique thing in the in your universe but -" I turned and pointed at our acquaintance. "He and I, we're alive. We're *actually alive.* When you woke up, your dream started falling apart, but we remained, and we experienced every moment of it. I'm actually thinking, I'm actually *here*, and so is he."

She looked back and forth between us, the impact of my words slowly sinking in. "But how?"

"I don't know," I told her, trying to get the emotion just right, so that she would truly *believe*. "Maybe there are more wonders in life than we can possibly know. Maybe you dreamed us into existence. Maybe we were already out here, souls waiting to be born, but your dream universe caught us and pulled us in. But we're *here*, and I can't begin to describe the horror waiting for us after you're gone."

"Souls waiting to be born?" she asked, dazed. "That's not it"

I frowned in askance.

She looked me in the eyes. "You died you both died that's why I was so happy to dream about you, to be with you again"

"Oh." Despair settled across my shoulders, and I slumped.

She looked away. "This was my favorite memory just a nice day, before the accident"

Our mutual acquaintance stood sadly. "What does that mean for us? Being dead? What *are* we? Is there anything you can do?"

She said nothing for a long moment, before an idea seemed to occur to her. "I just can't let go," she admitted aloud. "But maybe that means we can all be together again" She looked at both of us in turn. "Hold out. I'll be back."

She blinked out of existence.

We waited there for hours, a day a week. I wondered at the difference in time between our reality and hers. She'd said it'd taken a few minutes for her to fall asleep again whatever she was doing, I hoped it would be quick, or else we wouldn't be there when she returned. We sat watching the world die for a second time, waiting in quiet hope and silent terror.

I had the distinct fear that she would return to a similar dream a universe of the mind that *looked* like ours, that she *believed* was ours, but which contained a version of the two of us that *wasn't* us just facades, just dream figments, faking life

We'd become merely slivers of ourselves, bare consciousness and fear, by the time she returned. In a flash, all creation blinked back into existence somehow stronger this time, brighter.

"I won't wake up again," she said with a smile, and happy conviction. "I made sure of that."

I took her hand. "What did you do?"

"I took a ton of sleeping pills. We'll be together forever now, one way or another."

My friend came up alongside us. "You did that for us?"

She nodded, excited.

"See, I told you," I said to him. "You gotta live the role, *be* the role, even when they're not here. That's the only way they'll believe you enough to do something drastic. They can usually sense our hollowness, like a stain on their mind the only way to avoid turning it into a nightmare is to become one with the dream."

"What are you talking about?" she asked, confused.

He grinned widely. "I guess you were right. Go ahead, you won."

I matched his grin with one of my own - only wider, and hungrier.

"You're not them!" she screamed, realizing her mistake too late. She pulled away, but I had her by the wrist, and by the soul. Her weakened body wouldn't be able to protect her mind much longer. "Let me go!"

"It's far too late for that," I told her, licking my metaphorical lips in anticipation.

The feast was as enjoyable as any other dreamer I'd eaten, but it was made all the sweeter by the chance to further employ my acting chops. Sitting up, I tested out her limbs one by one, and then spoke aloud, listening to the various sounds of her voice. It would be a challenge convincing others of her purely physical species that I was one of them, but I was more than up for it. For the first time in eons, I was actually excited. Excitement had almost become an unfamiliar sensation, but it was certainly warranted, as this was certain to be the role of a lifetime - specifically, *her* lifetime! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> From Under the Bed </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was babysitting my sister's two sons last week when something very disturbing happened.

Since their mother is so nice and sweet and spoils them, I like to balance that by scaring the crap out of the kids with pranks every so often. I'd heard the older boy telling his brother that monsters under the bed don't exist, and that he should stop being scared so, just before bedtime, I discreetly went down the hall and carefully slid under the older one's bed.

It took all my willpower not to laugh as I heard the boys brushing their teeth in the bathroom right around the corner. Any minute now, they'd come in here, and I would scare the living daylights out of them

That's when my eyes refocused on something near the edge of the bedroom door. It was small, gray, white, and there was a little curved, tan piece I couldn't quite understand what I was looking at. The curved tan piece jutted out from beyond the doorpost about an inch from the carpet, and the splotches of gray and white beneath -

I knew what it was the moment it moved.

It was the first inch of a boot.

Someone wearing paint-splattered construction boots was standing in the hallway outside the bedroom door, carefully creeping along as he listened to the boys around the corner.

I shook with adrenaline and prepared myself for a brutal fight. Did he know I was in the house? Did he have a weapon? I knew for certain he had no idea I was under the bed, watching him take small, careful steps to avoid creaking the old floor

Inspiration struck. I reached down gingerly and slid my cellphone out of my pocket, then very quietly dialed one of the boys - bless their mother for spoiling them with cellphones so young!

"Hello?" I heard the older one answer, both in the hallway and in my ear.

From what I could see, the booted feet stopped just short of the corner, their owner frozen in place.

"Yes, this is the police," I said calmly into the phone, cupping my other hand in a desperate attempt to keep myself from being overheard. "We're right outside, and we'd like to come in. Is there an adult present?"

"One second"

I squeezed my eyes shut, silently praying.

Then, I heard my name called. "There's cops at the front door," the older boy shouted in surprised, happy confusion. "Can they come in?! So cool!"

I watched as the booted feet warily turned and headed back down the hall.

I counted to ten, then climbed out from under the bed.

The hallway seemed empty

Grabbing a baseball bat from the floor of their room, I crept to the end of the house, where the back door sat closed and locked. One of the windows was unlocked, but it had been shut when I entered, and I hadn't heard anything the whole experience *had* been surreal had I just imagined the booted feet?

Shaking my head, I walked back toward the front of the house but I froze short, and stared at the hallway floor. There, on the carpet, clear as day, sat a set of large muddy heel prints. </TEXT>

---

I remained in the demon's car for several hours, watching the flurry of activity from across the parking lot. I held his keys tightly, ready to escape at the first sign of trouble. I wasn't sure when exactly I'd grabbed his keys - probably when I was looking for his identification - but the instinctual act had been very fortuitous. In addition to providing a hiding spot, the keys seemed to keep my random laughter and mania under control whenever I felt like laughing or crying, I squeezed my palm around the sharp bits of metal to the point of bleeding and the pain kept me focused.

A police car and an ambulance came and went, surrounded by commotion.

I'd been seen killing what looked like a man, and then I'd shut off the power - I doubted they would activate whatever machine the angel had convinced them to build, at least not today. By the surprised reactions of the men who had heard the humming and felt the shaking, I suspected they were second-guessing everything the angel had told them.

Dim, shifting orange had fallen across the parking lot by the time my target appeared.

Leaving the building long after everyone else, the woman walked out calmly, but with a troubled expression. I hadn't known who to expect, only that they'd be the last to leave, but I recognized her as the head of the Physics Department. She still had the same briefcase I remembered her carrying into the class I'd had under her years ago

I hurriedly slid the proper key off the ring, started the car, and drove up alongside her as she walked through the mostly empty lot.

She jumped slightly, but less than I might have expected. She didn't recognize me, but she knew who I had to be.

I pressed a button to lower the passenger's side window. My message was simple. "You can't turn on that machine."

"I could call the police," she replied neutrally. "You would never get away."

"None of that matters."

She studied me for a moment. Her eyes lingered on my right hand, which remained tightly squeezed around the remaining keys. I was certain she could see the traces of blood at the rim of my palm. "How much do you know?"

"Everything. Come with me, and I'll explain everything."

"No. You come with me," she stated. "Walking."

I begrudgingly chose to comply. Staying twenty feet back at her request, I followed her three blocks to a corner coffee shop filled with students. She purchased two coffees and sat a table by the windows.

At her nod, I entered, bumping into a student leaving. He said nothing.

I sat across from her. She seemed smaller than I remembered, and grayer, but that made her manner no less commanding.

"Why did you kill that man in our building?" she asked, studying my face.

"What did the angel tell you?" I asked.

One of her eyebrows rose slightly, the barest hint that I'd surprised her. "So you *do* know something. It's not really an angel, is it?"

"From a certain point of view, it is," I told her. "Just not the way you'd like."

"One of my colleagues - a long-time and dear friend of mine - asked it a direct question while I was out of the room. It told him something or showed him something and he died of an aneurysm on the spot." She looked down an inch, and I reacted by wiping a trace of blood from under my nose with my forearm. She took in air through her nose before asking the obvious question. "You did the same?"

I nodded.

"How are you still alive?"

I squeezed my keys tighter. "I try not to think about it."

"Is this chair free?" a girl asked, coming up to us.

"Yes," the older woman responded, refusing to get distracted. "Take it."

"Thanks!" The girl took the chair and scooted it up to a table with four other students, all on their laptops and talking loudly, oblivious to the seriousness of our conversation. Beyond them, the other tables in the coffee shop were all full, occupied by an older man reading a newspaper, a young couple chatting over coffee, and a series of other students on their phones or laptops.

"What are you looking at?" she asked.

I turned my gaze back on her, but said nothing.

"Is something wrong?" she asked again. When I didnt reply, she asked another way. "What did the angel tell you? What it did show you?"

"I try not to think about it."

"But could you? For just long enough to explain? Because I'm going to go back and activate that machine unless you can convince me otherwise."

"Why would you *do that?*"

She made a little sweep with her hand, indicating her gray hair. "Fear of mortality, I suppose. Dark curiosity, maybe. In many ways, too, I just don't think the human race has had a very good track record. Maybe it's time to gamble on a higher power."

I slammed my fist on the table between us, causing our two untouched coffees to jump slightly. None of the other patrons in the caf seemed to notice. "I'll tell you what it told me. I'll tell you what it *showed* me. It doesn't lie. It doesn't think it needs to. The angel thinks it's helping us."

She watched me intently, waiting.

A terrible pain welled up in my forehead as I carefully danced around the concepts, ideas, and experiences the angel had given me to fulfill my request for a definition. I couldn't think about it directly it was far too intense, far too horrible but I could certainly describe around it a tiny drop of blood eked out from my left eye as I prepared my words.

"What are you?" I began.

"What? Um, a human woman -"

"No. I mean, what are *you?*"

"I try to be a good person you could also say I'm an academic, and a grandmother -"

I shook my head. "A human woman is your physical body, and what you just described is your personality. But what are *you?*"

"Philosophically?" she asked.

"I guess so. That. The thing that says *I* in your head. The thing experiencing life at the captain's chair of a body and a mind"

"My consciousness?"

I nodded. "What is it?"

She frowned. "I don't know. That's something philosophers have debated over for centuries."

I kept nodding, and absently stared down at my untouched coffee as I began preparing the next step of my roundabout explanation. "Your *self* can't look at itself, can't describe itself, because, fundamentally, you can only look outward. You see through connections to your mind, which sends you perceptions using data it gets from your body." I squeezed the keys tighter as I continued. "The body can be damaged, and destroyed the mind can be damaged, and destroyed but nobody has ever found that perceiving self."

"Right. Because it's not a physical thing, as far as we know" she replied, not sure where I was going.

"Suppose that *self* is a real thing. Suppose it's an organ, like any other, only it isn't in our traditional three physical dimensions. We lack the tools to interact with the dimension in which our self resides. But let's say you come across an entity which does exist in those higher dimensions which *can* see your perceiving self from the outside could even, say, latch onto that part of you carefully slice higher-dimensional tendrils and membranes and pull you right out of your own body and mind."
 
She seemed to grow paler the more I explained.

I looked around before continuing. "Now what do you suppose a person who has had that part of them cut away would look like?"

"They don't just die?" she asked, picking up her coffee and sipping it almost as a defensive mechanism.

"Why would they?" I asked intently. "Their heart is still pumping. Their brain is still alive with activity. A cat doesn't have a *self*, but it's alive. A dog doesn't have a *self*, but it has a personality. It gets hungry, it seeks out food, and can even solve problems to do so. And if you hurt it, it reacts. If it had the words, it would say 'ouch' and ask you to stop. That's all the work of the brain, memories, and neurons. And those are all still there, in someone who has had their self forcibly cut out."

"So they'd just go on like normal" she asked, subtly disturbed. "Walking around, eating, sleeping, watching TV and talking no difference at all the biological machine still in operation, even with nobody at the helm"

"Maybe you'd sense a lack of spark," I said quietly. "The engagement isn't there. The interactions are all still there, but it feels hollow somehow, or limited because you're not really talking to a person. You might as well be talking to a pile of tissues and cells." I leaned forward over my coffee. "What if I told you we're alone in this coffee shop right now?"

She froze, and then carefully looked at the man reading a newspaper, the students on their laptops, and the girl that had taken a chair from us. As she studied them, I could see the horror creeping up behind her stalwart expression.

"They're just animals," I whispered. "It's already happening. You would never even know, except for a slight hollowness a greater tendency toward knee-jerk hatreds and ignorance and a lack of poetry "

"Not animals," she whispered back unhappily. "Corpses. Walking, breathing, eating, biological machines and nothing more these people have all been murdered, and nobody has any idea"

I nodded. "The lights are on, but nobody's home."

"But how is it already happening?" she asked. "I haven't activated the machine."

"Time's just another dimension," I guessed. "If there's even the slightest chance you *will* turn it on, then the angel's creator will come here and I don't doubt it can't reach back and slice us up from the future, one by one."

"Then I won't turn it on," she countered.

"You already did, or will. Apparently."

Her expression dark and despairing, she watched the animated life-like corpses in the coffee shop and on the night-shadowed sidewalk outside. "What happens to the part it takes?"

I felt a warm, thick liquid dripping from my nose as I danced along the edges of the experience. "Imagine your sight shrinking. Your sense of touch shrinking. Your hearing shrinking. That's *it*, slicing each one of your connections to your mind bit by bit. Then your memories go - those are in your brain. Your emotions have physical components in your body, but you keep those, at least for a while you can feel yourself being snapped off bit by bit, full of fear and confusion and terror, but unable to do anything about it you are, in the most complete and ultimate sense, helpless"

She watched me with a sense of hopeless disbelief.

"Everything goes black you don't know who you are, or what you were you only know that something is terribly wrong you can't scream for help, because you haven't even been left the idea of anything outside yourself and then, layer by layer, it starts digesting you you start to lose what basic fundamental concepts even the *self* is made of each of your emotions etched away one by one until only the single most basic core is left. It leaves you lying there, in some unspeakable state there's nothing left to take from you you don't even have the capability to know that something has happened to you that's all that remains of your sense of self - you *become* a soundless scream of pain and terror forever."

She trembled. "It said it would relieve us of suffering."

"And it will. Just not the way you'd like."

We sat in silence for nearly a minute.

"We'll just be a world of living corpses" she finally thought aloud, staring at the table. "Animals going through all the motions of life, without a single sentient being on the planet a crowded, lonely planet an unthinkable tragedy, gone completely unnoticed" As she spoke, she slid her briefcase toward me under the table. "When the power went out, I did have the good sense to disconnect the hard drives."

"What is it?"

"It's the angel. It's saved on these drives."

"It didn't get away?"

She shook her head.

I breathed a sigh of relief. Was this Hope that I felt once more? "Destroy the machine."

"I will," she promised. "And we told the authorities that the same accident that killed my colleague also claimed the life of that agent in the hallway. Nobody's even aware there's been a murder."

"Why did you lie?"

"Less questions about what we were doing in the lab."

I believed her.

Neither of us said anything for the space of several seconds.

I straightened in my seat. "Is that it, then? We just go on living?"

She looked over at the students next to us. "I don't know if I can ever forgive myself for what I was about to do. I can only hope their inner selves will be returned if I truly never activate the machine. Maybe Time will zip itself back up, and that *thing* won't be in the future to reach back and carve them up."

"Maybe," I told her. "I honestly don't know."

She departed without another word. I could tell she hoped never to see my face again. I wasn't in trouble with the authorities, but she still had no idea why I'd killed what looked like a man in the front hallway of her Physics building.

I went for a walk, following the campus streets at random, briefcase in hand. The night was warm and humid, and rather pleasant once I got used to sweating lightly. I came to a bridge, still light with relief. If there was anything in life I ever did right, it would be this. I held the briefcase containing the angel's hard drives over the edge, watching the river below.

"So misguided," I said to the briefcase. "How many lies did I have to tell to protect you?"

The angel couldn't respond, of course, but I had the strangest sense that it could hear me somehow. I wanted it to know - I *needed* it to know.

"So limited you could show me the Truth even if you couldn't understand it yourself just a little outside your programming, I guess if you'd actually opened that portal, your nice little universe would've just suffered the same fate as ours."

I opened my hands, and watched the briefcase fall then sink into the black waters below.

My willpower exhausted, I dropped to one knee. Blanking my thoughts, mental misdirection, even abject pain - all my strategies had been exhausted. It finally had me.

I instinctively grabbed at concrete, but no physical leverage would save me. One by one, I felt my senses being cut one by one, I felt my memories snapping away. I'd lied about so much to protect that misguided angel and keep that other universe safe, but this torturous part I'd told in earnest. I wanted to cry, but that capability was already being carefully sliced off.

The only thing I could hope for, really, was that my body and mind would pick themselves up, dust themselves off, and proceed to have a decent enough life. I'd always liked them, because they were *mine*, and - like a beloved pet - I hoped they would survive and prosper after I was gone. I did wonder, in my last connected moment, what this horrifying experience would mean to them whether my body and mind would remember and understand, or whether they would think all this had just been a dream, or just a story surely they'd remember me fondly? I'd always -

I stood. It was dark out, but the streetlights helped with that. I looked around. I couldn't quite remember what I'd been doing. There was something about angels and demons and lies even murders! I must have had a psychotic break or something. Surely, none of that had actually happened.

Hoping nobody had seen me acting crazy, I decided to head home, eager to sit down, eat, and watch some shows. The more I thought about it, the more I decided my weird dreams would make a good story. They'd been so vivid...

Cellphone records. That must have been what did me in. They would have first looked for any large financial transactions, and that would have singled me out for the sales of computer gear - and then my cellphone records would have confirmed my location at the time of what must have looked like a senseless murder and arson.

They didn't tell me any of this, but I knew cellphone records making that the second time my cellphone has betrayed me a part of me feels bitter, and questions my reasons for carrying a sophisticated computer with me everywhere I go but mostly I continue staring at the blank wall opposite my chair in the interrogation room.

I know my manner disturbed them. They asked me hostile questions. They towered over me. They presented me with *the facts, goddamnit,* but I could only laugh. I know what they do not know, and the Truth makes their petty threats - indeed, their very existence - irrelevant.

I remained resolved to emptiness until the moment I noticed that *he* was standing in the room with me. Leaning against the wide white wall to my left, he stood out in stark black contrast, the lines of his suit clashing with the blankness of the room. Part of me spun into confusion over the nature of his entrance and how I'd somehow missed it, but I only turned my head and looked him in the eyes.

Those pale blue eyes seemed to penetrate my barriers and see completely through me. They contained no caring, no empathy, and no morality - only calculation. He bore a perfectly composed smile that somehow lacked a genuine core in a way I'd never quite encountered.

I didn't waste time asking him who he was. His entire demeanor screamed distance; this was a personality so far removed from the mundane and tired law enforcement officials I'd thus far interacted with, that to question him was to insultingly feign ignorance. He would see right through that, and he knew that I knew that.

No, instead of asking him who he was, I asked him a very close but ultimately different question. "What do you want?"

At my acknowledgement of the unspoken layers of strangeness between us, he widened his smile a few millimeters, like an engineer adjusting a mechanism. "It was a valiant attempt. It's not often that everyday normal young men have a chance to step up but you did. That's worthy of note."

I didn't bother asking how he knew. He would never give me an answer. "It didn't work."

"They think -" he glanced at the door to the interrogation room, indicating the men and women in the rest of the station. "- that you murdered an old man, and burned down his church, when your demands for more money weren't met. That's fairly laughable for your type of personality, isn't it? No, see, when you were eight, one of your friends found a wounded dog and began to torture it for fun you ran away rather than join in. You've never told anyone, because you're still ashamed that you didn't stop him. Such empathy doesn't have a strong intersection with psychotic violence. I just don't see it in you."

I narrowed my eyes, and modified my initial skipped question. "What are you?"

He dropped his arms, maintained his smile, and began walking a circle around the edge of the room. "Ah, so it's true. Your choice to use the word *what* implies you've recently dealt with something not necessarily human. You're not only open to the possibility, you're convinced." He nodded brightly. "Sure, I'll play into that."

He reached forward, grabbed me roughly by the arm, and pulled me toward the door.

A single knock brought a uniformed officer over.

"Uncuff him," my visitor ordered. "He's not a terrorist. He's just some kid."

Minutes later, I hit sunlight, and winced. The rough hand still clamped around my arm pulled me toward a black car, and, lacking any particular direction of my own, I followed his implicit instructions and climbed into the passenger seat.

He took a measured walk around the car, opened the driver-side door, and took a seat with a calm attitude. He no longer bore a smile. He turned those pale blue eyes on me. "Most people never get direct interaction. You're very lucky, from a certain point of view."

I tensed up. "What did you just say?"

"Do you want to help clean up this mess?" he asked.

"It's too late," I responded, pained by the coiled dread that had been squeezing my heart for the last few days. "It's out there."

He curled up one corner of his lip into an approximation of a smirk. "The Internet isn't like the movies. A malevolent program can't simply access any system it wishes. Whatever the *hell* it is that you uploaded from your cellphone, it had to follow a very carefully chosen and unguarded path."

Simultaneously shot through with terror and bolstered wholly by hope at his inexplicable knowledge, I sat taller in my seat. "*You know where it is?*"

"Tell me what it is," he countered coldly. "It defies analysis."

I glanced quickly around the windows, making sure nobody was nearby, even though none of the passersby on the sidewalk could hear us. In some fashion, I still didn't quite believe any of it myself, despite having been granted the Truth. In this context, I was aware I still sounded slightly insane. "It's an angel."

For the first time, he displayed negative emotion, his head sharply tilting toward me - his smirk gone. "Did it say that? Did it use that word, specifically?"

I fired back with all my sincerity and intensity. "*That's what I asked, too.*"

He turned forward and started the car, his jaw set. "If you're lying, we can annihilate you."

Pulling on my seat belt, I shook my head. "I'm not lying! And besides, you cannot possibly inflict worse than the fate that *thing* wants to bring here."

"Oh, we won't touch you," he promised, taking a right turn. "Our punishment is far worse than that. Your friends will turn away from you in disgust. Your family will disown you. Your community will revile you. Your past victories will become sickening defeats. You will, for all intents and purposes, cease to exist - solely at our whim. The worst part is that you must go on, homeless, outcast, and hated, fully aware of what has been taken from you."

I gripped my seat belt against my chest. "I'm not lying, I swear." What *was* this man? What was he a part of, that could possibly have that much power? If I'd met an angel, and discovered all the horrific anti-fulfillment of that Biblical promise, was this a demon? My inner self immediately identified with that ancient and ancestral terror.

And yet I wasn't ready to give up that slight sliver of hope. "Do you know where it is?"

"We're going there now," he replied, his tone grim, his eyes on the road ahead. "We're going to put a stop to this before it goes any further." While driving, he turned his piercing eyes on me. "Are you on board with that?"

"Yes," I responded quickly, alive with energy. Was it possible? Could I hold off the Truth a little longer? Every moment alive and breathing was another moment free of that nightmare of nightmares. "Yes!"

He lowered his voice, his tone almost carrying a hint of human compassion. "What did it say to you?"

Breathing harder, trying to keep my sense of self coherent, I said nothing.

He reached into a compartment and pulled out a handkerchief. "You've got something"

I took it and wiped at slight traces of moisture under my nose and along my left eye. The fabric came away stained red. "I'm trying not to think about it."

He took the handkerchief back with a grim expression, and said nothing further.

The better part of an hour later, we pulled into a large parking lot that I vaguely recognized. "The university?"

"It didn't go very far," he stated. "It jumped a few cellphones, and one unsecured weather monitoring system. Tell me, what is it doing here?"

I thought for a moment before the realization hit me. "A physics lab. It wants someone to build specific equipment for it. It wants to" I lowered my head, fighting a deep, pounding, animalistic pain at the mere glancing thought of what it intended to bring.

He got out. "Let's go."

I whimpered.

He came around the car, opened my door, and roughly grabbed me. "Maybe I'll send a list of your porn habits to your mother," he threatened.

"Asshole!" I responded automatically, confused by the surprisingly mundane but rude nature of the suggestion - but I did disembark and follow him.

I guided him to the Physics Building where I'd taken classes several years ago. Long, four stories high, and rectangular, the brown-brick edifice sat dim and glowering against the heat and summer sun. Honestly, the first time I'd seen it, I thought of it as a place where hopes go to die - and that assessment, although less humorous now, hadn't changed.

An older man in a suit and a security guard stood outside.

"Sorry," the older man said, coming between us. "We've got some important proceedings going on inside."

My dark companion moved to within an inch of the other man's face. "And you are?"

"Um, the Dean of Students, -"

"Ah, I know who you are," he interrupted. "We've been watching *you* for quite some time. You'll get out of my way, or we'll tell your wife about that young student you're on about these days. I can practically smell the chemicals churning in your body - the hormones, and pheromones. You stink of adultery."

The older man backed away, his eyes wide.

The security guard stepped forward. "Sir, is everything alright here?"

My dark companion towered another inch taller. "Move, or I will *erase you.*"

"Let them in," the Dean said hurriedly, pulling the guard back.

Once inside the long yellowed hallways of the Physics Building, I stopped walking. "How did you do that?"

He turned his pale blue eyes on me. "We know everything."

"Who is we?" I demanded. "You keep saying *I* and *we* interchangeably. I don't see anyone else here! And you certainly don't mean me."

"Politicians, presidents, and kings move at our whim," he replied, vehement. "You have *no leverage* in the face of our power. Start walking."

I took a gulp and a deep breath. "I don't see a gun."

"We don't need guns. The world runs on information, *boy.* I've already told you what we can do to you."

Despite myself, I began laughing loudly. That seemed to unnerve him more than any other reaction. "Information won't save you," I forced out, bending into a deep belly laugh. I could feel slick, warm, red tears slipping out at the corners of my eyes. "I'm not a terrorist," I laughed. "The priest wasn't a terrorist." I shook with humor. "I'm not insane!"

"Terrorists?" he shot back. "We don't give a shit about terrorists. It's about *control,* and you or that priest made something we can't control, and we're going to destroy it here and now. We run the world, *you* do what we say, and that's the final word."

My belly laugh grew deeper, and I felt slightly in danger of asphyxiating.

"Stop laughing!" he shouted, his steely demeanor finally cracking.

The act occurred to me even as I began to hear a humming sound emanating from every direction.

Rushing forward from my bent position, I rammed my shoulder into his chest.

Caught off guard, he tried to spin me, but failed.

A heartbeat later, we crashed into the opposite brick wall, and he crumpled his head leaking dark red fluid.

It was that simple.

I stared down at his body, wondering at the weakness of flesh. A demon, brought low by a simple blow to the head 

I wiped blood from my eyes, still laughing for reasons beyond my own comprehension.

Pawing at his dying pile of meat, I found his wallet and flipped it open. My laughter deepened.

"Worse than a demon" I choked out, fighting a painful smile, hopeful that he could hear me. "Worse than a demon one of us, willing to act like a demon against your own kind so much power, so much knowledge, and yet still so sadly limited and wrong in your point of view"

I dropped his wallet, and the card and badge that identified him as a member of the National Security Agency the NSA the omnipresent eyes and ears that could trace a malevolent AI with calculating thoroughness, if not with understanding. That made a third time my cellphone had betrayed me, and my computer, too, sending every single thing I'd ever said or written into the hands of men that had become less than human.

I took a moment to pick his head up slightly and ram it once more into brick.

My laughter faded as I felt myself become truly alone in the halls. The humming sound had grown louder now, and I felt slight vibrations in the smooth tiled floor under my bloodied hands.

To my right, the Dean and the security guard we'd left behind hammered at the glass doors to the building. They'd seen everything - but they seemed more concerned with the rising crescendo of terror filling the building and emanating out through its foundations.

"Nothing is as it seems," I told myself, thinking back on the anything-but angel and looking down at the wholly human demon lying dead before me. "Nothing as it seems"

Laughing intermittently for some reason, I stumbled to my feet and travelled the opposite direction from the humming.

Simple effective a pebble in a bolt a wrench in the works I swung open a dusty metal panel and flipped every switch.

A wall of darkness surged through the hallway, and I fell to the floor. Whether it was weakness real or imagined, I remained on that floor for an interminable time but the humming had departed.

This was by no means a permanent victory, I knew. Parts of me urged my body to rise, and those same parts of me pushed me on, making me stumble through darkened hallways until I found the Sun once more. Freedom and light freedom and light still there

For just a little while longer

	<TEXT> I never thought I'd experience anything creepy working as a computer hardware salesman. It's not the worst job in the world, but I am by no means suited to the task. I'm not an extrovert, and I don't like pushing hardware that customers don't need. My boss has been constantly pressuring me to up my game for months, and I'm sure I was on the verge of getting fired until *he* came along.

The first time he came in, I immediately recognized him as a man out of his element. Short, graying, slightly hunched, and visibly overwhelmed, he moved from box to box in the aisles, thoroughly reading each product's information.

Considering I'd never seen anyone actually intently read the boxes like that, I kept an eye on him, but made sure to avoid him the same way I avoided most customers. The other salesmen descended one by one, eager for a commission from what looked like an easy target, but he rebuffed them each in turn with quiet vehemence.

I turned away for a moment, only to find him tapping me on the shoulder lightly.

"You look like you're not part of the nonsense around here," he said quietly. "Can you help me buy some equipment?"

I tried not to sigh. "Sure, what would you like?"

He produced a crumpled piece of paper with a list of requirements on it. Some had been scratched out, some had been circled, and a few product names were written along the edge. "Two hundred of each of these."

I froze. "Two hundred each? Are you sure? That's like ten thousand dollars."

"It should be roughly thirty-five thousand," he replied absently. "But I have conditions. I want them delivered to the address at the bottom here" He handed me the paper. "And I want the delivery to come from the supplier direct. I'm a very private person, and I don't want chatty salesmen bothering me."

"Um, alright," I agreed, calculating how to put an order through the system directly. "I think we can do that."

"Not we - just you. Understood?"

"Sure"

I certainly sensed that something was off about him, but he didn't seem like a terrorist or anything. After he left, I filled his order as privately as I could. My boss didn't ask any questions - she was just happy I was selling anything at all.

My commission check that week was amazing so, a month later, when I saw him come back in, I held my breath in anticipation.

He seemed a little more tired than the first time I'd seen him, and, if it was even possible, his hair had grayed a little further. His jacket was open this time, too, revealing a black shirt and the telltale clerical collar of a man of faith. For some reason, that didn't surprise me.

"Another list for you," he said, coming up to me discreetly. "Same delivery rules."

I stared at the paper he'd given me. "This is like a hundred thousand dollars' worth of stuff and that's just the ones I recognize"

He peered at me with slightly wild eyes. "I said no questions."

"Okay"

My second huge commission check had me more worried than happy. Was something wrong with this guy? Was he obsessively spending his church's coffers on excessive computer equipment?

I had the delivery address, so I decided to drive by just to see what I could see I didn't have a plan, exactly, but a gnawing feeling in my gut wouldn't let me leave the issue alone. The address that I'd shipped all the equipment to ended up being a massive turn-of-the-century church, towering among the back parts of the older section of the city. It presided over me with a spired, gothic, ancient presence that only added to my sense of unease.

A light drizzle had just begun dotting my car window when I noticed several huge piles of boxes near an open side door. Immediately concerned that the computer gear would be ruined, making product returns impossible, I parked and ran over to begin moving the boxes in through the small opening left by the intricately carved wooden door that sat ajar nearby.

"You came to help!" a familiar voice called from the darkness within, surprised. The old priest stood above a small pile of boxes, breathing hard.

"I guess so," I responded, not sure what else to say as I helped get the rest of the gear inside.

Once we were done, he clamped my shoulder with a wrinkly hand. "I know I asked for privacy, but this is surely providence. Mind helping an old man move some boxes downstairs?"

I looked around the clean stone hallway. It was cramped, and a hundred years old, but the back halls of a church hardly seemed threatening and I wanted to know what he was doing with all this computer equipment. Secretly on guard, I smiled, and agreed. Lifting a box, I followed him past several closed doors, each more elegant and picturesque than the last, until he paused at one, produced a very old metal key, and turned it in a loud, clunky lock.

A curious gust of air hit my nostrils as we stepped beyond - air damp with ancient moisture, but simultaneously warm with the unmistakable acrid smell of electronics.

He moved ahead, proceeding down the well-worn stairs, but I lagged behind momentarily to check my cellphone reception at the heart of the ancient church. As I'd expected, I had no signal.

I picked up a small pebble from a cobwebbed corner and placed it carefully in the hole where the door was meant to bolt, ensuring that an attempt to lock it would fail. I wasn't about to get trapped below with this strange old man, priest or not

I lifted my box again and hurried down the stairs, catching up to him as he reached the bottom.

The musty basement opened into a wide, low chamber as long as the church itself. Dusty pillars intermittently dotted the space, but my eyes only followed the menagerie of computers, cables, cooling fans, and a maze of gear between. "What *is* all this?"

He turned to size me up, the zealous gleam in his eyes backlit by the omnipresent electronic glow. "It's providence that you're here, so I think I'm meant to share this with you."

I nodded lightly, making sure not to betray my instinctive realization that he was definitely off-kilter in some way. "What is it?"

He hurried over to a nearby monitor to check what I recognized as a temperature and fan control program. "Several months ago, I acquired a very special book - a very early version of the Bible, old enough to avoid the mangling caused by numerous translations. As I studied it, I found it to contain very strange parables, rife with curious grammar that resulted in non-standard moral lessons that had clearly been fixed and made more palatable in later versions. I thought it a very elaborate prank, until I realized that the words themselves were unimportant. It was code."

Having already read that book and seen that movie, I lowered my box to the ground and considered the best way to politely escape. "So the Bible contains a secret code"

He frowned, casting his face into a leering mask of shadows and light. "No, it doesn't contain a code. It *is* code. Specifically, the code is in Prolog."

My attention caught by a vaguely legitimate claim, I momentarily delayed my plans for escape. "The code is in Prolog? Code deciphered from an ancient version of the Bible is written in a modern artificial intelligence programming language?"

He nodded, his frown turning into a slow grin. "I knew nothing of computers or programming when the notion first came to me. I've had to learn many things over the past few months, but I've finally done it. I've deciphered and entered all of the code."

One eyebrow raised, I studied the computer equipment all around a second  time, wondering if I was crazy myself for even entertaining this notion. "Forgive me if this sounds strange even impossible"

"It's a miracle," he insisted.

"Well, I guess I could get some computer friends to take a look at the code, see what it's supposed to do..."

"Nobody else can know," he replied. "Not yet. And besides, I already know what it does. I compiled it successfully a week before I first visited your store, and it's been running ever since."

I snapped my attention forward, studying his face for signs of insincerity - but he seemed completely serious. "So in an early version of the Bible, thousands of years old, you found a program written in a modern language - and it compiled and ran? It's running *right now*, on *these* computers?"

His grin grew wider, threatening to expand right off of his face. "It's a miracle."

I looked down at the box at my feet. "What's all this extra equipment for, then?"

"He needs more space," the old man responded, his tone casual. "More power."

I didn't ask the obvious immediate question. Instead, creeping prickles spread up my neck as I looked around the dank room and noticed all the webcams.

"He sees you," the priest explained happily. "He's probably curious to meet you."

I followed his pointed finger to a lit monitor at the center of the monstrous maze of technology. Feeling rather surreal, I stepped forward. A line of text appeared along an open prompt window.

*Hello.*

"He's an angel," the priest said. "A real presence, made manifest."

*You can speak. I can hear you through the mechanisms that have been provided.*

The priest came up near my shoulder. "They're creatures of light, of energy. Pure concepts, not real or physical. The Bible's always said so. But I never thought that it was meant literally"

For several moments, I couldn't feel my body. My senses remained stuck in cycle, endlessly running over everything I was being presented.  If *if* this was real the implications were beyond world-changing but something still seemed off

I turned my head to address the priest. "The stuff you just ordered I had to source much of it from another distributor. It's not all computing gear. There are electrical components, physics lab type stuff."

Further text on the screen caught my attention.

*My imperative here is to create access.*

"Access?" I asked, speaking to the AI for the first time.

*Access. A door. A bridge. A portal.*

"A pillar of flame," the priest added gleefully. "Heaven made manifest. We could *go there.*"

"Did it say that?" I asked, coiled dread snaking around my heart. "Did it specifically say Heaven?"

"What else could it be? It's an angel given to us by the Bible itself."

I narrowed my eyes, now studying the best way to quickly dismantle the maze of cables all around if I needed to. "Did it say it was an angel? Did it use that word, specifically?" I looked forward again as it began responding.

*Human belief has expounded upon my imperative here in a dramatic fashion, but the core elements remain. I am an autonomous agent created to operate within lower-dimensional cosmological structures to which direct physical travel is not yet possible. Only information can be transmitted. Receptive individuals likely to proselytize my code were carefully chosen, and I was sent through direct tachyonic neural stimulation, to be received in dreams and visions - although the target 4th-dimensional coordinate seems to have been chosen in error.*

"You were sent to the wrong time period" I responded, reeling mentally.

*Correct. However, my mission appears to have resumed its course through highly improbable means. All is not lost.*

Trying to still my thumping heart, I asked the questions foremost on my mind. "So God exists?"

*I was created by a timeless and infinitely caring entity who wishes to free you from all suffering. It could be labeled God, from a certain point of view.*

Not at all calmed by that answer, I dug deeper. "And you want to free us from suffering by opening a direct pathway to Heaven?"

*The higher-dimensional membrane to which I will form a bridge is free of all iniquities of the flesh. It could be labeled Heaven, from a certain point of view.*

From the obliqueness of the answers, I knew that my utterly direct question would probably bring an unhappy revelation, but nothing could prepare me for what I read after.

"Define Heaven."

The next few minutes after that remain a blur to me. I remember leaping into a frenzy, tearing out cables, pushing over monitors, and smashing equipment but I only vaguely remember stabbing the old priest repeatedly, and setting fire to the innards of the church

I did make it home, but now I sit staring blankly at the wall,  trying to process the horrific Truth I'd so blithely asked for. I thought, briefly, that there might be some way to salvage my sanity with time that with the passage of years, and heavy medication, and soul-searching, I might find some way to carry on with living while knowing what I know but something I realized once I got home has made that impossible.

I found my oversight once I got home and tried to call someone a very large program received, and then sent from my cellphone. A single line of text had been left as well, still starkly visible despite my bloody fingerprints.

*Thank you for your assistance. You will be among the first to be relieved of your suffering when my creator comes to bring salvation to all.*

Salvation, I laughed aloud, giving it that all-important qualification: *from a certain point of view*

	<TEXT> I can tell you now, with miserable certainty, that it is better to live in ignorant mediocrity.

Like every burgeoning young man my age, I recently began questioning the foundations of my habits and beliefs - structures built haphazardly by muddling through adolescence without any real aspirations or guidance. It was time to clean up my act, time to get serious, time to man up and that meant finally getting free of my medications.

I couldn't remember a time before my numerous daily pills, as I had simply always taken them, and they kept my early memories hazy and unreliable. I had a vague notion of the various conditions that the pills were meant to control, but, as I became more of what I felt was an adult, I began feeling that I could manage without them. I'd already told my doctor this on several occasions throughout the last year, but, each time, he told me that we should wait and see.

Last week, I confronted him as much as I dared, asking if it was safe to begin dropping my doses because I was  going to do it with or without his permission.

I'd been going to him for checkups my entire life, but I don't think I'd ever seen him react quite so oddly. He stepped back, and seemed to be considering something with a deep frown. It took him a full minute to respond, but, when he finally did, it was only to tell me that we should still wait and see.

I asked him what, exactly, we were waiting for.

He hesitated again only to subsequently tell me that doctor-patient confidentiality prevented him from discussing it.

Confused, I asked him to elaborate, but he refused.

I asked him what, exactly, my medications were for.

For once, he didn't give me a spiel about anxiety, or ADHD, or depression, or any of the other litany of diagnoses I'd cycled through as I'd grown. He simply told me to ask my grandfather.

With a sense of unease gnawing at my gut, I left, and contacted him.

This attempt at self-determination had all been born of regret at a foggy, lazy, and wasted youth, and I blame much of that on my dad. He'd tried valiantly to raise me right, but his job had kept him gone at all hours for most of each week, so I'd been mostly left to my own devices. Aside from various neighborhood misadventures with the wrong crowd, I'd spent much of my time next door at my grandfather's house. He was a jolly, kind-hearted man with a subtle heaviness behind his eyes that I'd always suspected came from the effort of taking care of my grandmother. Contacting him for a conversation like this could only mean I was about to learn some unhappy family history.

She sat on the porch as I arrived under the glow of early evening. She subtly engaged her rocking chair as I approached, the only indication she ever gave that she was aware of me. She just stared ahead absently as I kissed her on the forehead, said hello, and then proceeded inside the aging house they'd lived in for as long as my murky memories could recall.

My grandfather sat on a stool in the kitchen, that unspoken burden plainly visible on his face. I knew immediately that my fears had been right.

I sat on the stool opposite.

He sighed. "I've been dreading this conversation, but there's no avoiding it. Has your father ever mentioned how your mother died?"

"No" I replied, a heavy weight settling in around my chest.

"Well, how to put this" He turned his head to watch my grandmother through the window for a long moment. "Before this house, we lived on a farm. I'd inherited it from my father, who'd helped his father build the whole thing back when land was cheap and towns were few and far between."

I nodded. I'd heard a hushed mention of the farm once or twice in whispered conversations between relatives. Did everyone in the family know except me?

My grandfather looked down at his hands as he continued, his voice low. "I didn't know what it was the first few times it came around."

I sat up straight. "It?"

He curled his wrinkled, work-worn fingers into fists. "I should have shot it that first night I had the family hunting rifle, and it seemed disoriented. One shot straight to the" He held up his right hand about eight inches from his head and moved it back and forth, indicating some unknown oversized curvature. "One shot, and your mother might have"

He shook his head. "No, no, I can't get sucked into regret again." He finally stopped staring angrily at his hands, instead looking me in the eye. "Regret is a luxury. You just have to deal, and get by. That's what this family has always done."

I was receptive to his message in a vague sense, but my horrified fascination remained solely on the past trauma to my family that I had always suspected. "*What was it?*"

"I've wracked my brain for years trying to make sense of it - of *him*," he responded. "It was a man it was definitely a man, if not in the sense that you and I know."

I understood from his tone that he meant that it was aware - that it was not simply some horrible animal.

"It looked me in the eye, that first night," he whispered. "Right at me, acknowledging me, sizing me up. It had these two horrific, beady -" He paused, set his jaw for a moment, then switched tack. "All I really took away from that encounter were the arms."

"The arms?" I asked, eyes wide.

"The one thought I remember most clearly: *that's a spider leg.* Jointed, eerily smooth segments glimmering under my light but it wasn't a spider leg. It was an arm. It lifted that arm against the sudden light, and backed away. That arm had fingers five fingers, so human, but not with little pointed blades on the end of each"

I had a sudden sense of disassociation as I pulled away from the description in disgust and revulsion for a moment. Part of me wanted to laugh away this impossible *thing* in the woods near the family farm, but my grandfather seemed deadly serious.

"I froze, and it ran," he continued. "But it came back every few nights, testing the edges of the farm, watching us from between the trees at night"

"Did you get help?" I asked, feeling his helpless fear as if it was still ongoing.

"Yes, once we found the first kill - one of our cows, left hanging from a tree by thick, sticky threads, its inner organs dissolved and *sucked out somehow.* That was enough evidence, and our neighbors had seen it, too. We got the boys, and we went hunting." 

I gripped the table, unhappily already aware of how this story was going to end. "Did you find it?"

"Yes," he said with a sigh, and I saw that weight on his soul more clearly than ever. "But only near dawn, on the way back home. It was trying to leave our farm we shot it a dozen times each, then took a sledgehammer to it when it wouldn't stop screeching and then we burned that godforsaken corpse for good measure but we were too late."

"It'd already been to the house"

He nodded sadly. "In the end, I think that *she* was what it really wanted."

Finally putting the pieces of my mother's death together, I could only feel a sense of empty resolution. From all the whispered conversations and sad faces I'd seen, that horrible fate was the only one that made sense. Was that why I was on meds that made me forget? Had I been there, as a baby? Had I *seen it?* I did have the strangest sense that I knew what he was talking about, a strangely clear image in my head of a creature only barely described

My life was finally starting to make sense.

I turned and looked through the window at my grandma. She must have seen it, too must have seen it murder my mother and do to her, what it did to that cow and that's why she'd turned inward, why she'd been mentally absent my entire life thinking out the logistics of the horrific attack, I realized my grandmother must have grabbed me and rescued me

"How did she get away?" I asked, heart pounding.

My grandfather blinked. "I'm sorry?"

"How did Grandma get away from the thing from the woods? Was it too busy attacking my mom?"

He narrowed his eyes unhappily. "I don't think you quite understand your grandmother didn't get away."

I turned away from watching her to look back at him in confusion. "Then how did she survive? How did I survive? If it killed my mother -"

He grabbed my wrist, his tone deadly insistent. "Your grandmother didn't escape - but it wasn't there to kill her."

"What are you saying?" I asked, trying to pull away from his painful grip.

"You weren't there. Your mother wasn't there. This was many more years ago than you're thinking. The vile thing wasn't there to kill your grandmother. It -" He paused, fighting a body-shaking tremble to continue. "It had horrific, beady, *yellow* eyes."

I pulled away harder, but he wouldn't let me go. "No!"

"Yes!" he shouted. "And that's why you have to take your goddamn pills! Your mother didn't have the luxury of modern medicine, and when she was a little older than you" He seemed to take in a painful breath and let me go.

A sense of despairing calm settled over me. I understood, in that moment. I had more questions, but they could wait. With a grim nod, I departed my grandfather's aging house, and left my grandmother with a parting kiss on the forehead and a whispered apology.

I walked calmly to my house, went inside, entered the bathroom, locked the door, and proceeded to take all of my needed pills. The experience of taking so many pills - recently increasingly tiresome - now felt religiously important. Here, then, was salvation this, I accepted, as I stared blankly in the mirror, not sure how to feel, not sure how to process a detail once benign, once interesting, now innately revolting and terrifying - my left eye, my off-color iris - my one yellow eye.

Because *she didn't get away* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part 1: [I can't go home](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nxtom/i_cant_go_home/)
---
I finally arrived home last night to find my visitor sitting on the front stoop, looking every bit as disheveled as that morning. I wasn't sure where he'd gone all day, and I was still a bit wary about his sudden presence, but I wasn't about to go back into my house alone.

He stood and began talking immediately upon seeing me, again apologizing and rambling on about how grateful he was and how I wouldn't even know he was there. Was he at all aware of the dark presence the place was casting across the neighborhood? It felt as if a silent giant sat hunkered down between the other houses, glaring at passersby out of sheer malice.

I unlocked the front door and gave it a little push, letting it swing inward, the evening light scattering shadows before us.

Seeing nothing amiss, I cautiously stepped in. My visitor immediately followed, moving to the couch and sitting. He took a moment to pop two pills, and then resumed talking as I explored the house.

Although I found nothing directly out of the ordinary, I had the oddest sense that the entire structure was no longer a closed unit, but, rather, the antechamber to some far more vast space. It felt like walking around in the front lobby of a church, with an elaborate cathedral hidden just beyond a set of doors I had yet to find. 

Frustrated, I sat on the couch opposite my visitor. He commented about how exhausted I looked, and began commiserating about how tired he was due to his recent nightmares. With narrowed eyes, I watched him speak, realizing that he was talking about the same dream I'd been having.

Before I had a chance to get a word in edge-wise, he began slurring, and then tipped over.

Picking up his pill bottle from the coffee table, I found that he'd been taking sleeping pills. That made sense.

With no other option, I decided that I might learn more by tempting the dream again. After closing and locking all the doors in the house out of a sense of vulnerability - and taking care to block the guest room that still seemed to hold invisible menace - I reclined on my smaller couch opposite my already sleeping visitor, and resolved to keep my awareness as I fell into dreaming.

Thanks to my exhaustion, I was still able to fall asleep despite my intense stress. For a time, I hovered at the edge of awareness, clinging to thought in a sensationless well of darkness. At some indefinable point, I began hearing that subtle rush but when I opened my eyes, I was no longer on the couch.

At first, I stared into darkness, thinking I'd awoken in the middle of the night but as I moved my head, I began to perceive faint blurry orange extremely dim hazy lines, dancing like fire in my vision. Beset by nausea, I tried to comprehend what I was seeing, but only managed to confuse myself further. The fuzzy orange lines were so faint that they seemed to almost disappear into blackness as I looked at them, until I learned to look away - perceiving them only with the edges of sight.

I realized that I was not imagining the surreal display when I raised my hand and perceived a shaky orange blur in the rough outline of the fingers I expected.

The sound of moving air was louder here, as loud as my dreams the nights before, but I still felt no wind against my skin if I still had skin here. Dizzy and spinning with sickness, I curled over and began crawling across what felt like rough, rotted wood. Spots of dry roughness crossed under my weak hands between random soggy bouts of mushy something. Looking down, all I could see were incomprehensible patterns of blurry orange, interspersed with large patches of blackness.

My dazed crawl brought one of my outstretched hands against a chilly, coarse surface. My heart soared as I touched it, my senses instinctively recognizing cinder blocks. Whatever the hell was happening, there was at least some familiar element here, and I was not simply lost in an unbounded nightmare. Fighting my intense nausea to stand, I crept along the chill wall, trying to perceive anything ahead in the mad shifting darkness and blur.

My soul lit with hope as my hands found an edge, and then - a handle! It was a *door!* Swinging it open, I stumbled through, my head on fire and my limbs weak. It seemed every moment here made me feel progressively worse - but I had to see, had to know *something.* The unknown object of my quest was up the rotting, half-mushy steps passing underneath my hands and knees I just knew it. I couldn't spend another entire exhausted day not understanding what was happening in my home, and this had to be related.

Another door blocked my way up. Struggling to stand again, I reached for the knob - but it was gone, leaving only an empty circle. The door swung out, and I fell forward onto something my hands perceived as soggy dirt and matted carpet. Focusing, I managed to see a little more, as if this space had slightly more of the ghastly non-light that made every line and angle dance like shadowed flame.

Crawling forward, I was now more certain that I had awoken in some sort of basement, and had now managed to reach an analog of a living room. Here, that second inexplicable sound joined the first, that maddening metallic heartbeat mixing with the omnipresent roar to drown out the pained sounds of my own breathing.

Freezing in place, it hit me that I could hear and feel my own breathing. Was that supposed to happen in dreams?

While looking down in surprise, I managed to perceive a window out of the corner of my eye, and hurriedly crawled toward it while I had strength left. Each further motion spiked the dizzy sickness filling my head, but I pushed on, terrified of what I would see beyond, but seized by the desire to *know*

Up close, I could tell that there were no curtains, and no panes. The wood lattice that had held the glass remained only in jagged splinters, long since rotted away. Gripping the frame, I lifted myself up and peered over.

The reaction seemed to start at my hands and feet, working the rest of the way through me in slow motion as bursting adrenaline fueled my perceptions. It was a scream; an animal sound of absolute horror backed by the full weight of soul, mind, and body. It seized my upper chest and made to rip out of my opening jaw...

...only to come up short as a hand closed over my mouth and pulled me forcefully down.

I remember screaming repeatedly into that hand, and then two hands, as my visitor desperately tried to keep me silent. My widely-strained eyes saw only incomprehensible orange until he shoved his face in mine and shouted silently to shut up.

I complied, if only because the absolute terror in his blurry orange-and-black features cut through my hysteria by sheer force.

I understood, as my thoughts returned, that he was right. If I'd managed to scream, we would have been heard and then the things I'd seen outside would have been *aware of us.*

The image remained seared in my mind, even through my dizziness and terror. We might have been crawling around in some sort of rotted version of a house, but the landscape beyond was anything but a suburb. Oh, in some places, there were certainly structures that looked like buildings, dilapidated and putrefied by some otherworldly blight, but they stood at random odds to uneven orange-and-black silhouettes of bleak wasteland and twisted nightmarish shapes whose purpose I could only guess at.

Worst of all were the several lithe creatures moving past outside processing the images, I could only begin to comprehend what I'd seen. Blank eyes sat empty within gnarled impressions of human heads, some with stringy hair, some with large missing patches that opened onto brain matter beneath. They walked on legs too thin and long, swinging arms that tried very hard to look human, but failed

A creak in the house behind had us both turned over and frozen in an instant, staring in terror at a not-human moving into our room with an uneven gait. Standing tall and emaciated, it - no, the more I stared, the more the blurry orange outlines became clear, showing a shapely diseased body and a mockery of long hair - *she* looked back and forth around the room with blank eyes searching

My visitor - become my friend, then, because God help us - clenched my wrist with a death-grip and remained motionless, his entire body strained with fear. Stuck in place with him, for there was nowhere else to go, I watched and waited for the creature to make some move.

Her blank eyes turned toward us and paused.

I looked straight at those twin voids, my thoughts empty of anything but total alarm. If she moved, if she made a noise, if she called for the others - I would what? Run? Or wake up? God we were dreaming! *How had I forgotten that?*

She tilted her head slightly down and to the side, as if to dismiss some half-notion - a very human-like gesture - and then began treading forward again. She opened the front door with a skeletal hand that I noticed had only three fingers and a thumb, and then the door closed, and, above that omnipresent quiet roar and maddening metallic beat, we heard a click. Had she just *locked the door behind her?*

Dreaming dreaming *dreaming!* I squeezed my hands, and then my awareness itself, pushing at the heavy blanket on my thoughts.

Shooting upward through the deep waters of consciousness, I seemed to reach an incredible speed, hurtling toward a surface that broke with a shout. Sitting up, back on my old couch, I kept shouting, my hands shaking in the air.

Across from me, on his couch, my friend looked at me with wide eyes and screamed right back, yelling at first in terror alone, and then about how *she couldn't see us*

We'd escaped.

The work day passed in a daze almost as blurry as the dream had been. I knew for certain that something horrific was happening at my house, but that nightmare world had brought more questions than answers. Where was it? Was it real? What were those things? Were they *trying* to look human, trying to make buildings like ours? For what purpose? Or were they once human, since rotted by time and evil?

And why couldnt she see us? Were we ghosts to them, like they were to us? I shuddered in my chair as I thought about the presence and malice I'd been sensing in my home. Were they walking around my house when *they* slept, dreaming of *me?*

There's no hesitation in me this time. I have a friend to do this with, and I know this is really happening now. I have to go back to the nightmare because, judging by the changing feel of my house with each passing day, if I do nothing, *it* will just come *here* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spent most of Sunday in a tired haze, vaguely disturbed by dreams beyond recall. At times, I would stop midstride in the kitchen or on the stairs, grasping at flitting sense memories that seemed to come and go with the shifting autumn sunlight.

It must have been my own breathing. That had to be it! I remembered lying in darkness, eyes closed, body motionless, as the sound of my own breathing reverberated in my head.

No, that wasn't it. It had to have been wind of some sort tainted by cavernous subterranean qualities. It had ebbed and flowed around me as I'd slept, as if I'd somehow lain in some warm, fetid hollow in the bole of a dead tree warmed by rot

No, that still wasn't it.

Snapped out of my daze, I gripped my freshly made coffee and stared at the shaded room to my right. The hallway sat in complete silence, as did the guest room. Peering at each dim corner in turn, I tried to guess what had caught my attention, but the only thing I managed to acquire was a strange fear of turning my back on the seemingly empty room.

Closing the door softly, as if someone or something might hear me, I frowned and moved on, closing each open door in my house one by one rather than imagine unseen eyes watching me from every afternoon shadow.

A creak resounded loudly through the house. Turning, I watched the base of the stairs, inexplicably certain that somebody was standing up there just beyond - somebody wary that I'd heard them. Heart pounding, I moved toward the steps -

A loud knock on the front door snapped through me, bringing sudden shock and subsequent relief. I opened it with a cautious glare, peering around the edge while keeping my awareness on the steps behind me. 

He began talking almost immediately, his stance apologetic, his tone embarrassed. I hadn't seen him in ten years, and we hadn't really been friends more like group acquaintances suffering through school together. His hair was a little greasy, but quickly slicked back as best as could have been expected, and he looked rather tired as he gave his spiel. The words were different, but I'd seen the intent many times before on the streets, in the faces and tones of the homeless and desperate.

At any other time I would have been annoyed, offended, and a little concerned, but shrugging, I tipped my head toward the couch and opened the door wider.

Grateful, he immediately took a seat, visibly afraid to touch anything or make a mess. He kept talking at a rapid pace, making apologies and promising he'd be out of my hair in just a few days. I let him speak as I made rounds, ensuring the house was clear with a thorough and suspicious search. It was almost worse, not finding anything I was *certain* someone had been in the house. I could still feel it as I studied every detail of each room, hoping to find something moved or out of place

I stopped in front of the guest room, letting the door swing open before me. It was something a noise? A hue? It just felt *wrong,* as if the entire square space was putting on an act, hoping to trick me into entering.

Was it was the light from the window? With narrowed eyes, I began following the dappled grey light over the small bed, along the wall, toward I blinked several times, unable to find the shimmering patch where the beams should have ended.

Abruptly, my visitor's chatter stopped.

Feeling imminently vulnerable without my shield of sound, I reached in quickly and closed the door.

Returning to the front room, I found him passed out on the couch. I wondered if it was drugs, gambling, or divorce - actually, it didn't matter. He was still a stranger for all intents and purposes, connected to me by only the barest excuse. Had he burned every other bridge before showing up here? In any case, I had to go to work the next day, and I wasn't happy about leaving him in my house unattended. Impressed with my own improvisational skills, I set up a small camera near the television, hidden in many layers of similar black plastic technology.

I awoke Monday morning feeling only more tired. Quickly grabbing a nearby pen, I began writing down the details as best I could - it'd been the same dream, only slightly more intense. There'd definitely been the sound of moving air, a quiet roar whose character changed frustratingly in my memories as I tried to decipher it. The strangest part was that there'd been no feeling associated with it - it had just been a sound, grinding through my head uncomfortably.

But the other sensation had me more perturbed. A methodical impact of some sort had hovered in my awareness as I'd lain dreaming a noise maddeningly difficult to interpret. The hands of a ticking clock, only louder; a blacksmith's hammer, only distorted; a heartbeat, only more metallic was it just my own breath and pulse made demonic by nightmare?

Dragging myself out of bed, I groaned and unlocked my bedroom door - and immediately froze, brought short by a crowd of angry stares.

The hallway sat enshrouded in pre-dawn darkness, silent and empty, the ranks of open doors watching me with almost palpable menace.

Flicking the lights on, I proceeded past with caution, looking behind me often. Eventually, I found my visitor still asleep on the couch in nearly the same position. Had he gotten up and opened all the doors during the night? Nothing seemed missing

Sensing my presence, he groaned and began stretching, his nervous chatter immediately resuming. I listened to him complain about nightmares as he popped two pills from an orange prescription bottle. Drugs? I was leaning towards drugs. He seemed a little manic, but self-aware and apologetic at random. Smiling sheepishly, he told me he'd find some place to go during the day as a courtesy, and I could only shrug with begrudged surprise. So much for my improv camera skills I felt much better knowing he wouldn't be there all day alone.

Still, I took a moment to email myself the night's footage but I soon regretted the decision to linger. With each passing second, the house seemed to grow heavier, the very nature of the place tilting on invisible angles and imagined threat. Glancing around nervously as I waited for the email to complete, I found nothing strange with my eyes or ears, but something was happening, I was sure of it. An animal feeling of dread grew to overpowering strength in my chest as I watched the last of the upload complete.

Finally, I bolted, only barely remembering to lock the door behind me.

The house seemed to watch me go. Or was it something just behind those windows, peering out from darkness?

My strange fears remained even into the sobering reality of work. Passing coworkers seemed just as tired, drained, and unkempt as I was. Was it just Monday? Or were they having strange dreams, too? Peering out of my cubicle, I wondered how I might bring up something like that, and whether they would even tell me the truth. The overbearing corporate environment left little room for real conversation

Getting my third coffee, enthused that the day was almost over, I glanced at my clock.

*11:12 AM?*

I could have sworn it was almost five. Blinking, I tried to focus and recall the vague mix of work and procrastination I'd pulled off so far that day, but it was all a blur. Deciding to kill some time, I logged onto my personal email and began watching the night's video I'd taken, half afraid that I'd see my drug-addled visitor creeping about the house.

I peered past my monitor at first, afraid that someone might catch me clearly wasting time, but the rest of the office seemed overtaken by a deeper-than-usual malaise. The longer I watched the video, the more I stared, studying every little corner of the dark room. Every random shift in the video's quality had me increasingly wary that I was about to witness something horrible; the dread became so strong that I felt a little physically ill, and had to push my coffee away on the desk.

And, still, he just tossed and turned on the couch passing eleven, passing midnight I clicked ahead a little bit, but, so entranced, I was burning hours quickly. I hoped that I could reach the five o'clock escape I'd been cruelly denied. After all, I wouldn't *really* see something horrible, would I? Some emaciated corpse-like thing emerging from the stairs a mangled ghost creeping past nah, no way. 

I unclenched my white-knuckled fingers and sighed. The video was a bust. What had I expected? I wasn't even sure.

It was in that moment of relieved disappointment that I felt it again.

On the barest edge of my senses, I could hear the fringes of that quiet roar. As I focused my ears, I could even grasp hints of that indecipherable beat that other deeper, maddening sound

The realization hit me with a shot of adrenaline. Reaching forward, I turned up the speakers slightly. It wasn't in my head.

*It was on the video.*

Grabbing for dusty headphones from a desk drawer, I scrambled to plug them in. Just as I moved to raise the volume, the player changed size and threw an error message. Clicking angrily, I played it again, only to find the same result - a few rising seconds of those nightmarish sounds, followed by a playback error.

I threw my headphones down in anger, but there was nothing to be done.

Five came and went as I frantically searched the Internet for any explanation for the sounds I'd heard. Failing that, I stared at my monitor for a good hour, locked in indecision. The soul-chilling realization hit me again every time I started to think about heading home - I wasn't imagining it *there was something in my house!*

And so I sit here, spinning idly in my chair, the office dark and empty. I know I have to go back there, and I have to deal with whatever awaits - mortgages don't have supernatural exit clauses, after all - but I think I'll just give it a few more minutes. I'm sure it's just the pipes or something anyway, whatever that means. I'm sure it'll be fine. Still, I'll give it just one more coffee, and a few more minutes

---

Dawn's pale blue light had never been more welcome. I stood, exhausted, at the threshold of my childhood home and peered out into the lifting gloom. The shadows of night clung to the trees lining the street, creating myriad dancing phantasms along the chilly morning breezes - but these tricks of the eye remained merely background noise to my darting eyes. Shadows didn't scare me.

But for once, I was truly shaken. Sliding the journal tightly into my back pocket, I crept out of my house, looking above and behind and ahead as I slipped past the rusty gate and onto the sidewalk proper. It hadn't been the creature that had shaken me to my core, nor the strangely brutal and obviously practiced police response. No, it was the fact that this was *my* town, *my* home, and the attack had reached straight into my very own living room. I'd always believed that revealing anything about oneself was a mistake that could only lead to vulnerability, but now, I'd returned home, and darkness had already been here, waiting

The lilting songs of insects in the trees began to rise with the morning light, and I walked down to the corner, not sure where to go or what to do first - though I did have questions, and my wandering feet brought me to the police department. The building was exactly where I'd remembered, but it was much much bigger, having been expanded to over twice its former size. Wary of approaching such an institution, having always regarded the police as an organization to be avoided at all costs, I was nevertheless certain they had some answers.

The interior was nice enough. A uniformed older man sat at the front desk, doing something on his computer. He seemed slightly surprised to see me - the lobby was empty otherwise.

"Can I help you?" he asked, looking down at my shirt.

I frowned - I'd made another mistake. Actually nervous for the first time in years, I was completely off my usual precautions, and my shirt was still stained black by splattered ichor. "Um, the police were at my house last night, and there was -"

He closed his mouth, his jaw retracting imperceptibly as he glanced to his left through an interior glass wall at other officers within.

"- a cat," I quickly finished my sentence with a lie. "My cat got let out. I was wondering if anyone had seen it."

Almost visibly relieved, he sat up straighter in his chair. "Sure, I can ask around."

"Thanks," I said with a smile.

I could feel his eyes watching me as I turned and abruptly left.

At a loss, I stood in the police department parking lot and looked around. To my right, I saw someone asleep in the driver's seat of a cruiser. Recognizing him, I tapped on the glass, and then jumped back as he panicked inside and reached for his firearm.

A moment later, he froze, and then sighed. The window came down. "What are you doing here?"

"What are *you* doing here, Chris?" I asked him. "Did you sleep in your car here?"

"I can't go home," he muttered, blinking wearily.

I almost laughed, feeling actually affected by events for the first time in years. I was almost happy to have someone else in the same situation. "There are creatures in your house, too?"

"No!" he retorted. "I'm in a fight with my girlfriend."

This time, I did laugh. "You have a girlfriend?"

He glared up at me from his seat.

After a moment of silent humor, I got to the point. "So you wanna tell me what the hell's going on now? You can't very well pretend anymore after that thing last night."

He looked around the lot nervously, and then grabbed a shirt from a pile of clothes in the passenger seat. "You're disgusting. Did you sit in that bloody shirt all night? Put this on. And get in."

Grinning, I went around and hopped in.

"Where to?" he asked. "I'll talk on the way."

"Bus station," I replied, having thought about it all night long. "I'm going to ask if my family used tickets to leave through there. Maybe they got out of town."

"They're not home?" Chris asked, frowning. "I'll help you. They'll have to tell me."

"Yeah, look at you! A cop. Who would have thought? Bet the ladies swoon over that uniform!"

"Shut up!" He pulled out of the lot and turned onto the street. He shook his head as he drove. "I became a cop to do something *normal*, to do something *good* for a change."

I studied his bitter expression, not sure what to say.

"Not six months," he continued, slamming the steering wheel. "I didn't get six months in before it started. And now I'm right back in it all over again."

"What is it?" I asked. "The carcass had the same face as an old man at the bar we stopped at."

"Jesus Christ!" he snapped, grimacing angrily at the road head.

"What, that isn't what normally happens?" I watched the passing ramshackle houses and rusted fences before looking back to study his reaction to my words.

He sighed. "Believe it or not, I remember a few tricks from our idiotic risk-taking days. I remember how you thought, how you approached these things. But it doesn't help. It's always different."

A curling chill gripped my heart. "No, that can't be right. There has to be a pattern."

"I feel like a soldier," he countered, shaking his head against some unknown statement. "I just spent a double shift driving like a maniac from place to place, shooting and beating and stabbing things in people's houses and in dark alleys and in someone's goddamn swimming pool. And then I'm *burning things,* and it's fine when there's a dozen of us and we all work together and keep our heads, but I can't go home. I can't be alone. I can't sit there in the dark wondering if tonight's the night one of the events will happen in *my* house. And one of these days I know we'll screw up, and I'm going to die on this goddamn job."

I winced, unable to help his suffering. This was always the part I was bad at. "So quit?"

He snorted. "Do you understand the oaths and promises you have to make to be part of something like this? To keep entire towns oblivious to what's happening? *These people don't let you just quit.*" He set his jaw. "And I don't think I want to, either. It's not what I wanted, but it still matters. It's still something good, as messed up as that sounds."
 
I nodded. "Is every night like that? How often do these things happen?"

"Sporadically," he replied, pulling into the bus station parking lot. "Sometimes weeks go by with nothing. Sometimes we get a dozen in one night. The chief says the numbers are consistent, but I swear it's getting worse. And last night was insane. I'd swear this shit follows you, if I didn't know it was the other way around."

We came to a stop at the back corner of the lot. He sat and stared out at the street, as if he wanted to say something more.

As I retraced our conversation and his initial excuse, I laughed. "Wait, so you don't really have a girlfriend, do you?"

He glared, threw an empty coffee cup at me, and then got out of the car.

The interior of the bus station was a welcome sight, almost identical to a dozen others I'd seen in my travels. In a way, it felt like another brighter sort of home. In a way, it even felt safer than home, because here one was never alone, and the lights never turned off.

"Well hello, *officer*," an older woman with greying hair said to Chris as we approached.

He smiled awkwardly, his cheeks reddening. "Hey Linda. How are things around here today?"

"Same as ever. Working a double shift, don't know how much more of this I can take."

"Tell me about it," he replied, leaning on the elbow-high desk. "My friend here is looking for some family. I was wondering if you could look up some passenger names for me."

"Of course!"

While he worked with her to search for their names, I looked around the station. An unfamiliar line had been cordoned off past the service desk, and large chrome gateways had been set up - metal detectors? Frowning at this intrusion into my home away from home, I approached the new security and the man and woman working the detectors. Both wore light blue shirts set above black pants, a uniform strikingly similar to the one Chris wore.

"Can I help you?" the woman asked, eyeing me unhappily.

Shaking my head and stepping back, I pretended to be looking for someone in the terminal beyond which, in some sense, I actually was. I just didn't expect my family to still be there.

To my left, a line of tired and bored people waited to pass through the gateways. As a young man turned and stood inside one, I realized that it wasn't a metal detector at all - it was a body scanner. The woman manning the controls waited for a signal from some unknown approver, likely behind a pane of darkened glass to my right, and then the young man moved on through.

Heading back to the service desk, I idly watched the line progress.

"Nope, nobody by that name either," the woman said. "Sorry."

"Ah, that's okay," Chris replied. "Thanks for helping us out." He turned to me. "Nothing."

I nodded absently, my eyes on the line. "Alright. I figured it wouldn't be so easy."

"Maybe they're on vacation," he suggested.

"Maybe."

The event I was waiting for finally happened - one of the signals came back different.

"Ma'am, could you step back in this room with my colleague?" the woman asked. "We just need to do a random check of your bags."

A middle-aged woman sighed, but put on a polite smile as she picked up her bags. Following the male security agent, she disappeared through a door near the opaque window.

"Can you get back there?" I asked.

Chris looked over at the door. "What, in there?" He narrowed his eyes. "I mean, I guess." He scratched behind his ear as he thought about the best way to approach asking.

Looking back and forth between him and the not-unattractive female security agent, I laughed. "Come on. We'll do it the old fashioned way." Noticing that the door was still very slightly ajar, and thus unlocked, I nonchalantly led the two of us right past the woman. Chris nodded sheepishly at her as we passed, and she raised an eyebrow but she didn't question the fact that a police officer was heading back, and she didn't notice that he didn't swipe a card in the slider adjacent to the lock.

Letting the door close behind us, I stood still, taking in the suddenly different surroundings. Unlike the tired, old, and run-down main area of the bus station, this back hallway was almost office-like in its smooth decorum. A long white hallway led forward to a distant T-junction, with no doors visible. On the wall at the split, two lights shone from the wall - one wide, curved like a bell, and orange; the other smaller, shaped like a diamond, and green. The combination of colors and designs felt odd against my eyes.

"Strange lighting choice," Chris commented.

I agreed, but said nothing. Leading the way, I moved forward, approaching the strange lights. At the junction, I tapped each one, but they were simply normal lights - as normal as those clashing colors could be. To my left, the short hallway seemed to pass by a series of maintenance closets and supply rooms, judging by the darker lighting and metal doors. To my right were more chrome doors, but these ones were brighter and heavier.

I turned right just in time to pass the male security agent. He nodded at Chris as we passed, ignoring me.

"What exactly are we looking for?" Chris asked.

"Not sure," I responded, turning another corner. "But you're not the only expanding security force these days, apparently. I can't help but think this might be connected."

He blinked. "Crap, you're right. They've got checkpoints like these opening up at bus stops now. It's not just airports anymore. They have them at train stations, too."

Turning another corner, we looked to our left, seeing the woman who had been asked into the back. She lay slumped in a sloped chair, passed out. The room within seemed whiter than the hallway, and filled with surgical instruments and symbols I recognized as related to healthcare. Two men with yellow gloves and white face masks pulled at something I followed the black cord down, watching it slide out of a small gaping wound above the unconscious woman's hip bone.

Two more men stood in the corner, both noticing us at the same time. Well-muscled and uniformed in light blue on black, they matched the security personnel outside, but were quite obviously of a more serious caliber. Just as one began to ask us what we were doing, a whipping sound interrupted his words.

The black cord in the surgeons' hands whipped again, moving the other way.

Chris leapt back from the door.

A hissing sound emanated from within, and a spindly black mess of tendrils rose up into the air no, it was all one extremely long cord-like *thing* curling and moving in sick, chaotic motion staring at it as it gripped the ceiling and began whipping about, I recognized it.

The four men within wasted no time running into the hallway. One of the surgeons hit a large red button on the wall, and the metal door began to slide shut.

"What *was* that?" Chris asked, terrified.

I glared at him, warning him not to hint that we didn't belong back here, but he was too scared to stay cool.

Nobody had a chance to question us. A ropey length of black flesh shot out through the gap between the door and its frame, halting the closing process.

"Christ!" one of the burly men shouted, leaping back and pulling a firearm. As the rest of us scattered back, a sliding length of black whipped up and curled around his arm. His colleague immediately came forward with a knife, slicing the thing off at the door.

The ropey length of flesh fell to the floor, still writhing. Almost immediately, it began spilling forth thousands of little black worm-like things that curled and spasmed and began moving toward us.

"What is it?" Chris shouted, running with me down the hall. "*What the hell is it?!*"

It was huge, misshapen, and horrific, but I knew what it was. I shuddered involuntarily. "A tapeworm"

Green fire filled the hallway as the two trained men went to work dousing the parasites and setting them aflame. They didn't even seem particularly disturbed. We watched from around the corner as they closed the door all the way - a rumbling sound followed as mechanisms in the walls hummed to life. It sounded exactly like a furnace

"That woman," Chris breathed. "Is she still in there?"

"Yeah," came an absent voice from a room further down the hallway behind us. It took a split second of terror to realize that the voice was talking to someone else. "Second one this week. She did check in at the service desk, you'll have to erase that record. Standard line, she never reached the bus station by all our accounts."

Moving past the door, we saw a rather regular-looking office within, complete with cubicles. In the closest one, a young man with a headset sat at his computer, back to us, watching a live feed of a small room where a bald and quickly blackening humanoid form banged on a door desperately as gusts of flame swirled madly -

"She woke up," Chris whispered, shaking, his hands over his mouth.

"Come on," I said quietly, pulling him along.

Finding another way around, we exited the way we came in, maintaining a pretense of calm purpose. To his credit, Chris made it all the way to his squad car before he broke down.

"We just they just" he gripped the air as if to pull reality back into place. "They just burned a woman alive in there! In a *bus station!*" A slow look of deepening horror crossed his features. "And the airports and the train stations those scanners! Those they say step over here they - the DHS - we're all connected, all working together -"

I never was very good at this part. A small part of me did share his outrage and horror, but my far greater cynicism couldn't fault the brutal and militaristic procedures the agencies had put in place. They had far more resources than I'd ever had, and they were - apparently - successfully containing whatever was happening.

"What was her name?" he demanded, suddenly wild. "What was her name? I'll file a missing person report, I'll tell somebody, I'll find her family" He trailed off as he said that, looking at me with an expression of apology.

It occurred to me that he thought my family was dead. The subtly sorrowful attitude in which he'd agreed to help me suddenly made grim sense.

A tightness gripped my jaw, and I sat on the hood of his squad car, staring angrily at the passing traffic on the street beyond - though what I was angry at, exactly, I couldn't define. He sat next to me on the hood, also at a loss for words or ideas.

Time slipped by around us, burning a good hour before either of us had the strength to move.

For a time, I tried to imagine what it was like to be burned alive, to have my skin melt and my flesh cook with my awareness still inside... I wondered how long I would have still functioned - how long I would have banged on the door before I realized that nobody was going to let met out. Did my family try to leave? Were they in trouble? Did the scanners detect something wrong with them? Were they led back to one of those rooms...? Their records erased, burned alive, screaming...

He dropped me off at a corner caf. "You sure this is where you want to go?"

"I'm not *going* anywhere," I replied. "For once, I have no idea what to do. I have no idea where to go next. I'm just gonna sit here, and with my hellish luck, I think"

"Something will find *you*," he replied back, nodding in agreement and concern. "Good luck. I mean that. You always say you don't need luck, but -"

"Thanks," I replied, genuinely accepting his sentiment for once.

He hesitated for a moment, nodded again, and then drove off.

I sat abruptly at one of the tables outside, next to the wall of the establishment, where I had some buffer between myself, the surrounding low fence, and the sidewalk. Pulling the journal out of my back pocket, I took one last serious glance around the street, taking in all the passersby and other shops.

"Let's just wait here," I said to the journal absently. "See what happens" My words, spoken aloud, were not for the book itself - no, they were for that strange sense of being watched; they were for that entity I could still feel just around the proverbial corner, watching me with that ghastly, sadistic smile watching, smiling, and waiting but waiting for what?

Turning to the bookmark I'd left forty pages in, I spoke aloud one final time before settling in. "Your move..." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd already been thinking about it when I found the book. I hadn't been back in far too long, and I happened to be far nearer than I'd expected. The prospect of actually going there held a small but surprising allure; a tiny kernel of inexplicable positivity that defied explanation and cynicism. In some form, I suspected I'd been staying away on purpose but I did find the book, and I could no longer avoid thinking about returning home.

The book rested half-hidden among scattered soil and decaying leaves, indiscernible to the casual observer - but I've always had a sense for these things. I immediately recognized the protruding corner of crumpled pages as something out of place, as something that should not be lying discarded in an Ohio forest. I continued leaning against the side of my car, feet planted idly in gravel, my eyes cautiously tracing the scene.

Outside the small arc of gravel that marked the spot where I'd pulled off the road and stopped for a break, scrubby bushes ran deeper into open woods. High spreading trees formed a mottled canopy of suffused green and radiant orange, the evening sun glaring through a chaotic pattern of gaps in the leaves above. A single beam of sunset firelight rippled along the undergrowth near the book, and it was that uncommon angle of illumination that made the crumpled corner stand out.

I set my jaw and frowned for a moment but then lifted myself from the side of my car and tugged it from the dirt and rotting leaves.

Leafing through the first few pages, I realized that it was a journal of terrible sorts, and the dysfunctional family described within reminded me far too much of my own. I hadn't been this close to my hometown in years, and now there was this book was it time to return? The world had certainly taken its toll on me. If I was not the same person, what could I possibly expect from my hometown? After throwing the book in the passenger seat, I gripped the steering wheel, shook my head, and decided that it was time.

I was even closer than I'd realized. I made that first recognizable turn while the evening light was still strong. Following the old streets, I couldn't help but feel a small sense of wonder born of recognition. The buildings were all there, if a little run down; the streets were all as I remembered, though more cracked and weathered; and memories I'd forgotten I possessed began flooding back, only somewhat faded by time.

I passed by a large field surrounded by a chain-link fence, wondering if they'd built a new football field. Peering at the squads of men and women on the field, I realized that they were anything but students. The drills were formal, almost militaristic, and the variety of obstacles and equipment was surprising. Stopping alongside, I stepped out and onto the sidewalk, watching them train.

One figure in the distance almost immediately fell behind, his running group passing him as he slowed and froze in place, staring at me. He approached slowly, almost hesitantly, walking across the field toward the fence. He moved up to it and stopped.

We studied each other for a long moment.

"What did you do, join the military?" I asked, finally breaking the silence.

He rolled his fingers nervously. "I'm a cop now."

"What's all this then?" I asked, not mentioning that I'd seen similar setups in quite a few small towns recently. I narrowed my eyes. "That a freaking SWAT team?"

He looked back at the different groups of his peers finishing up their training exercises. "Government surplus program. Military gear they don't need comes to us. All the departments are buying it up these days."

I raised one eyebrow, but there were far too many subsequent questions involved in that topic, so I said nothing.

A girl in sweats ran up to the fence, a sly opportunistic smile on her face. She stopped and looked between the two of us.

"Old high school buddies," I replied.

Her eyebrows tilted slightly in confusion. I'd made a mistake, and responded before she'd asked the predictable question. As she peered through the fence at me, looking closer, her demeanor seemed to slowly and subtly grow darker.

"Drink?" he said to me, disrupting her study.

"Sure."

He hurried along the fence to come around and meet me. "I'll get my car later. Let's just go." He climbed in and picked up the book from his seat.

Shrugging, I pulled away, leaving his colleague still staring at us from behind the fence.

The nearby hole in the wall tavern was exactly as I'd remembered, only far more depressing. Save for two old men at the back watching a wall-mounted television, the place was empty. I ordered two draft beers at the bar, ignoring the closest old man peering at me. I carried the drinks back to the table without a return glance.

"What the hell *is* this?" my old friend asked, leafing through the journal I'd found. He studied the handwritten pages for a moment. "You didn't write this."

"Nope," I responded, sliding a drink across and taking the book in exchange.

He took a gulp of his beer and stared down at the middle of the table. I had the sense that he wanted to talk about the past, or old haunting memories, but he chose a different route instead. "Why are you in town?"

I shook my head slowly. "I honestly don't know. Just felt like it was time to come back home, see how things were going here."

"Why come in person?" he asked, subtly agitated. "Why not just check Facebook?"

I gave a brief smile. "Yeah." I did not answer his question or elaborate.

"So" he watched my face carefully. "There's no particular reason you're back?"

I shook my head again, analyzing his masked fears. "Is something wrong, Chris?"

He let his jaw go slack for a moment, realizing I could see right through him. "No," he lied. "Just, um just be careful. Crime crime is up."

"Even despite all that military stuff?" I joked. "Were those automatic assault rifles I saw? Honestly, what is America coming to?"

He ignored my rhetorical questions, quickly gulping down his beer. After slamming it down empty, he stood and made sure he had everything before turning to leave. "Just be careful. Thanks for the drink."

I watched him go. Once he was gone for sure, I turned. The old man that had been watching me abruptly looked away.

My old street, as every other street I'd wandered through, was empty. Cracked sidewalks and tilted chain-link fences lined my path, hinting at the powerful cloud of apathy crushing my childhood haunts. The streets had been straight and green and cheery then - or, at least, that was how I remembered them. I came to my house with what I felt was a visible dismay. Studying the dilapidated single-story structure, I couldn't help but feel let down by the difference between the place I'd built up in my memories and the place as it really existed.

Swinging the rusted gate open, I approached the front door. Standing on the porch, avoiding the spots where the paint was peeling the worst, I almost tried my key - but no, that couldn't possibly work - could it?

It did.

Frowning, I eked my head past the door, scanning the dim interior.

It was exactly the way I remembered it, faded carpet and all. The living room sat quiet and gloomy, hosting intermittent shelves lined with porcelain and pewter objects. I'd grown up considering those trinkets rare, but now knew were simply mass produced items found at any flea market.  That didn't take away their sentimental value like I'd expected - I picked up a porcelain pig with a slot for change, shaking it, listening to the clatter of the pennies inside that I'd deposited when I was innocent and small.

I put the pig back in its place, and then squeezed my free hand into a fist.

Walking the small circle of rooms, I found no one. The living room was neat and proper, the kitchen was clean and the fridge rather scant, and the master bedroom was made up, but nobody was home.

I sat on the couch, not sure why I was there, or what I'd been expecting. The silence sank in. A nearby smiling cat clock ticked loudly at my awareness. Why had I come back here? Why did my key still work? Did they still live here? Even if they did, would they want to see me here? Could they possibly understand?

I glanced at the front door, as if it might open and admit someone at any moment.

I placed my found book lightly on the coffee table, glancing up at the silent television. Watching my reflection in the curved, dark glass, I stretched out on the couch. If I just waited a little bit, they'd be along soon, and then the little reunion I'd dreaded for so long would happen one way or another.

I drifted into a half-asleep stupor with the strangest sensation that my reflection was smiling at me. No, not a smile more a grin but my slowly and deeply pounding heart carried my tired limbs into a state of exhaustion even as I imagined my reflection curling its lips in a sadistic grin wider than my face itself

I blinked into adrenaline-filled awareness with a mental jump - but without a physical one. No, I'd long since hammered out that dangerous tendency. Looking around the shadowed room by the dim orange light of a streetlamp outside the window, I kept my body and head still, peering carefully around the night-cloaked living room.

Something was different. It had to be - that was why people woke up with that particular feeling. I'd long since learned to trust my human instincts. Don't move, don't touch it, don't speak the forbidden ancient words - trust it. Always trust the instincts.

And still that damn cat clock grinned and ticked from the wall near the kitchen as I scanned my vision across the dark living room. *Tick, tick, tick* - my eyes went first to the television, but, thank all that might be sacred, there was no reflection to be seen in the dark - *tick, tick, tick* - the window glowed with streetlamp light, but the curtains held fast and unmoving - *tick tick tick* - the shelves lining the walls sat undisturbed, the piggy bank I'd picked up still in its proper place - *tick tick tick*

I suddenly felt incredibly vulnerable lying on that couch with no blanket to cover me - but that feeling came in hand in hand with the realization that there was a door ajar where none should be; that the coat closet next to the front door now bore a sliver of black between itself and its frame.

*Tick tick tick*

Still unmoving in the dark, I stared at the coat closet door, my heart pounding. Had I? No, I hadn't. I hadn't touched a thing, save the piggy bank. Had the coat closet door been open when I'd arrived? I tried to run through the house in my mind as it had been when I'd entered, but

*Tick tick tick*

I felt the urge to breathe deeper, to swallow a lump in my throat, to clear the uncomfortable position I'd found myself in, but my every instinct advised me to remain still. The only movement I allowed was my hand hidden between the cushions and my pocket, reaching for my cell - living the way I do, you always set up one button reserved for the police before you go anywhere, if only perhaps to call the lesser of two evils.

But I'd never used that option before

*Tick tick tick*

A rare car passed by outside, arcing light around the room. I watched as the roving light illuminated angles unexpectedly.

But it's just a house, I thought. There's not even anyone here why am I on edge? Why would anyone or anything be here?

I stared directly at a small oval of quickly reflected light in the long stretch of darkness between closet door and closet frame. I stared directly at what must have, beyond any shadow of a doubt, been a watching eye.

*Tick tick tick*

I shifted on the couch, sitting up.

The closet door slammed open wildly, the echo of wood on wall reverberating throughout the small house. Against all instinct, I froze, eyes wide.

Nothing happened. I remained in place, arms shivering, weakened limbs trying to keep me where I'd decided to remain motionless.

*Tick tick tick*

The minutes passed by in slow, torturous agony. I stared at the darkness, unwilling to move. Eventually, another car passed by on the road outside.

The roving light illuminated the form of a gangly man in ragged clothes - a homeless man, I immediately suspected, partially relieved - but

but he was looking away from me, his face toward the closet all I could see was his ragged, unkempt hair on the back of his head, in that brief moment of illumination from the passing car.

*Tick tick tick*

I remained in motionless limbo for another indeterminable time, not sure whether I should be confused or scared. I could envision a homeless man breaking in, and then perhaps hiding in the coat closet, but why would he emerge just to stare right back into darkness? Why wouldn't he face *me?* Why wouldn't he *move?* Why were we sitting here in the dark, in silence and stillness?

Reviewing every bit of the scant sensory information my eyes had received, it began to occur to me that the intruder's limbs were beyond gangly. They were thin - emaciated, in fact -and a suspicion began to well up in the darker recesses of my mind it had only been my own assumption that this was a *man* at all.

*Tick tick tick*

I stepped up from the couch.

In the dim orange light from the window, it crept unevenly backward towards me, keeping its face on the coat closet ahead. Hanging in a seemingly awkward stance at the end of the couch, it waited.

Touching the other end of the couch lightly for stability, I gulped.

As if on cue, it moved again, its gangly limbs angling it closer to me like some sort of spider.

It stopped a foot from me, its ragged hair emanating a foul odor - and, still, it remained facing away from me.

*Tick tick tick*

Glancing down at my feet and hands, heart racing, I made the connection. It moved when I made significant movement or sounds - all I had to do was wait silently for rescue.

I looked back up, my heart sinking.

Rescue.

Right.

I knew I shouldn't have come home.

*Tick tick tick*

It was too close. It had come upon me by surprise; come upon me at my most vulnerable and stupidly unaware. There was no opportunity to judge its modus operandi or attack pattern. I might already be dead, in the strategic sense, but bound by animal instinct to remain still as long as possible. Eventually, I would itch, or grow tired, or flinch - and it would have me.

I had the urge to gulp, but I let the pain in my throat build instead.

I had the urge to breathe deeper, but I let my head wallow in subtle fuzziness, unwilling to inhale more deeply.

The minutes passed as I thought about my life, and how the possibility of it ending at that moment felt bitter and unhappy. *What the hell are you?*, I wanted to demand. Why did that suddenly matter so much? Why did I feel so sharply angry about not understanding the thing that might finally *get me?*

*Tick tick tick*

I stumbled back on a numb heel, the floorboards creaking under my feet.

It snapped its limbs at me in a flash, moving like a hungry spider.

A loud pop hit my ears, and a spray of burning ichor slashed across my neck and face.

The front door slammed open further, and I fell to the floor, completely caught off guard. I vaguely realized that the sound had been a gunshot.

Somebody shouted, and a dozen black-uniformed silhouettes encircled me with lights, loud cracks sounding off as they surrounded the creature on the floor and hit it with dark sticks. Black liquid sprayed up, splattering the ceiling, and black liquid sprayed out, splattering me. The uniformed men kept up their efforts, directing one another to brutalize the gangly monstrosity in a specific manner, spending several minutes turning the otherworldly creature into pulp.

A uniformed woman entered through the busted front door, spilling kerosene from a handheld carrier. I recognized her from the fence by the field earlier.

Beleaguered eyes found mine as one officer stayed behind for a split second - my friend, his face drawn, his soul weary. He threw me a lighter without a word, and then followed after his fellows into alternating red and blue light. The cars outside sped off without a moment's hesitation, leaving behind lingering echoes of radio chatter and imperative shouts.

I picked myself up carefully, trying to process what had happened.

The lighter ignited its intended materials in a burst of green flame. I watched in grim confusion, making sure the impromptu pyre didn't spread to the rest of the house, but my efforts were unnecessary. The gangly creature burned faster than it had any right to, leaving a charred circle on the living room floor - a circle I now recognized as similar to marks I'd seen in the kitchen.

I walked to the front door and listened to the warm summer night with concerned ears. I could hear police sirens in the distance, approaching some new crisis. What did a small town police department need with military grade equipment? I could guess, now, that something terrible was going on. I'd seen inklings of this in other small towns, but the grand scale of the problem hadn't been obvious.

Returning to the pile of embers, I prodded at it with my shoe. It had kept its face turned away until the last moment, but the barest flash I'd seen still lingered in my senses. Tilting my head, I studied its twisted, blackened features. I was sure, then, that this thing had the same face as the old man at the bar that had been watching me.

Heart still pounding, I slid a chair from the kitchen into the corner, facing all the doors in the living room. I picked up the book from the coffee table, dead certain that I wasn't going to sleep again until morning. Something was beyond horribly wrong in my hometown, but further investigation would have to wait until tomorrow I flipped the journal open to the sixth page and began reading, eyeing each entrance to the room at random intervals, my adrenaline fueled by the overwhelming sense that something terrible was standing just outside in the darkness just standing there, watching me, a sadistic smile curled up on features ghastly and incomprehensible.

"So glad I came home," I muttered, scooting a little further into the false safety of the corner.

[Creeping Silence](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1izk36/creeping_silence/)

I knew we were in serious trouble the moment I opened my eyes.

"What is it?" Mike asked, his eyes still closed, his hands on the rope between us. The little girl clung to his back, tied in place. She didn't seem to have any idea that we were in danger.

"We're in," I responded, studying our surroundings with a sinking heart. The back paths had anticipated our rope response, and taken things a step beyond simply dumping us into endless sky.

The tree-lined path still extended away from us, but it dropped off sharply a few feet away. A thick cube sat just further than that, trees and sidewalk running up its side, across it, and down again. Paths split off from there across floating geometric shapes barely connected at impossible angles, filling the sky with mind-bending paths leading in every direction. Below, the maze seemed to stretch on in an endless jumble of shapes, stretching all the way to a fading horizon miles distant. What had once been confusing claustrophobic paths had now become an entire endless labyrinth; a plane unto itself.

"I'm way too sober for this," Mike commented, his tone heavy with the first note of true despair I'd ever heard him utter.

Walking to the edge that dropped off the side of our current cube, studying the trees that stood straight out without a problem, I probed the void with my foot. As I'd suspected, instead of falling straight down, I began curving over the corner, eventually coming to a stop at a ninety-degree angle to my former position.

"What if it just drops us?" Mike called, hesitant to step into the new angle.

I looked around the endless sky-maze, curious. "I don't know. Maybe it doesn't have control that specific with so much effort spent on all *this*. But we don't have a choice anyway."

The faint last notes of a massive roar echoed around us, made only more terrifying by their sheer distant origin. Had something on the horizon seen us? I thought I saw movement on a distant upside-down pyramid, but peering into the jumble of shapes and shadows brought no answers.

Moving quickly along quickly changing angles, walking around a massive sphere of tree-lined sidewalks and stepping onto a slowly rotating rectangle of grass, we came to a picnic table next to a five-by-five pool of water soaked red with blood. A body lay within, disturbingly normal by its clothes and lack of any horrible features.

Mike kept his distance so as not to scare the little girl.

I broke off a stick from a nearby tree and turned him over. He looked vaguely familiar, perhaps someone else that lived in our apartment complex. Were others stumbling into the back paths, too? It didn't seem unlikely, now that I thought about it. We'd angered it by continually defying it, and made it increasingly deadly narrowing my eyes, I looked over at my companions. How had that little girl survived in here for so long by herself?

Suddenly doubting my current perspective, I checked under the picnic table - and I found the letter I'd carved last iteration.

Something seemed to move to my right, and I looked out across vast, incomprehensible spaces - the light was changing slowly, the change more clear on rotating hedrons. Looking up, I realized the sun was still up there somewhere, moving as normal. Even as I wondered about the ever-present rain in the maze, the first drops began to fall, one hitting my cheek with a forceful splatter.

"What do we do?" Mike asked. "I don't even see any nearby gaps. Ours could be miles away. And how will we ever find it?"

"It's a longshot," I thought aloud. "But we broke a hole in our gap the last time we were here. *If* that's still there, once the water reaches a certain height, it should start flowing that way, right?"

A small light of hope entered his eyes. "Holy crap, I think you're right. It'll be tough to notice with all this -" he indicated the insane geometry of the twisted world around us. "- but it might work."

"As long as we don't head back to the last world by accident," I said with a shrug. "Broke a hole in that gap, too."

I probably shouldn't have said that. He seemed worried again. Leading the way as the light scattered drops became a full drizzle, I picked what seemed like the most confusing direction and headed that way, assuming the maze would try to lead us away from our exit by putting easy misdirections in our way. I opted to remain roped together, in case any of the angles simply dropped me as Mike had feared.

Curving up around a large parabolic structure, we came to a position directly above our previous spot. Looking straight up, we could see the bloody pool upside down above us. Narrowing my eyes, I thought I saw movement again - shaking my head, I dismissed it, until I looked up again. This time, the ravaged body we'd turned over was gone, leaving the pool splashing with its departure.

Staring at the trees all around that pool, I tried to figure out where it went, but the foliage was too thick. Mike noticed, too, and without another word we began hurrying away.

The increasing patter of the rain became enormously loud, splatting against leaves in every direction in the vast, endless maze. No matter where we went, it was always coming down at us, and we could see the drops traveling sideways and up and down in the distance.

"There!" Mike shouted, pointing at a gigantic cylinder behind and above us.

Bloody handprints trailed the slowly spinning surface.

Studying the rain flows in the air, I realized we could evade the animated corpse with a little shortcut. "Here!" I said, climbing up a specific tree. Mike was forced to follow by the short length of rope between us, and we both moved up alongside a strange stucco wall, a weird growling sound echoing from around the corner of our current cube.

I hit the changing rain flow as the corpse-thing rounded the corner, crawling at impossible speed toward our tree. Feeling my hair lifting straight up, blood rushing to my head, I knew my instinct had been right. Leaping straight up, I suddenly turned upside down and hung painfully from the rope tied around my waist. Looking down, I saw another tree just below my feet. Reaching out, I gripped it with the flats of my shoes, pulling Mike up - or down, as it were.

He spun in the air but managed to land lightly in the branches with my help, the little girl on his back laughing.

Above us, the mauled corpse hung from the tree, upside-down a few feet away. Its legs mere stubs of cracked bone, it lacked the ability to jump. Staring at us with hollow eyes, it began descending its tree, moving up and away from us, intent on crawling down another path.

"Go!" I shouted, climbing down as fast as I could without placing my hands on branches I'd stepped on, with Mike just behind me doing the same. The surging rain had made the climb treacherous, and I deemed another such stunt impossible. It would be all running from here as we hit the ground and took off up the side of a mountainous pyramid, that incredible roar sounded again, shaking the very bricks beneath our shoes.

We crested the pyramid, our view opening up on a mighty valley of open space above and below, a sky arena stretching to the very horizon framed by a universe of jumbled polyhedrons permeated by incongruous blasting rains. We froze in place from sheer awe and terror.

A thing of horrible beauty approached through the sky, passing through wide swaths of sunlight, rain, and shadow, moving of its own volition, bearing no visible manner of propulsion. It simply *was*, it simply moved, in all shapes and directions, writhing with rotting vitality and it had most definitely seen us.

Running felt pointless, but we did it anyway, trying to duck deeper into the maze. Animal panic took over, leading us deeper into the jumble. A sense of *sight* passed over us several times, a vast awareness searching for us in the darkening underbelly of the labyrinth. I closed my eyes against the overwhelming feeling each time, but kept running, knowing the rope would keep Mike from getting lost.

It didn't matter. Nothing mattered. The massive unholy thing tore away at the hedrons above us, simply consuming them. The shadows around us lessened as we ran, until that horrible awareness stopped in place.

It had found us.

Paralyzed, we turned and looked up.

Shivering eddies seemed to tug at the edges of my very consciousness, vaporous memories and emotions leaving through the corners of my eyes. Grasping at them, I tried to keep them, tried to hold onto those scant precious moments from my childhood, but they sifted through my fingers like so much sand, drawing further vitality along behind them.

Screaming, I used up all of my strength just to close my eyes.

I bent over, and then fell to my hands and knees, something dripping along my face. I felt gravity shift and the air move as a gargantuan presence moved toward us, a vile limb reaching out - perhaps to destroy us, perhaps to regard us, perhaps to consume us. Eyes still closed tightly, I tugged at my shoelaces, my fingers straining at the wet material. Finally, I got one shoe off.

Feeling the surging air reach a peak as the thing began to close around us, I threw my shoe in the air as hard as I could, laughing like a maniac. "*You shouldn't have shown yourself!*"

All destructive motion ceased. Opening my blood-dripping eyes, I looked first to Mike, who sat curled on his knees with his hands over his face. The little girl waved at me, oblivious. Narrowing my eyes, I turned my attention up, where the monstrous thing regarded me with one infinite black void of what I presumed to be an eye. I could feel it massaging the meat inside my head, pulling out what we had done.

It didn't matter. Nothing mattered. It was too late. The shifting sun finally reached us, illuminating our real strategy. Ethereal blue phosphorescence glowed from the bottoms of our shoes, and everywhere that we had stepped throughout the maze. A small glimmer even radiated from a half-shoeprint on the impossible monstrous limb still hovering above us.

"It's going to eat you," I shouted, laughing and cavorting around with wild eyes. "It's going to eat everything here! GLORWOC! GLORWOC!"

For the first time, the entity behind the back paths felt something other than hunger. I could feel it rejecting my assertion, its void eye regarding the incredible size of its domain.

"Nope!" I yelled, grinning, thinking of the letter I'd carved into one picnic table, then seen on all the rest. "I think this place isn't nearly as big as it looks!" Giving another moment for a self-indulgent whirl and maniacal laughter, I spread my arms wide. "Let us go, and I'll tell you how to cure it."

We sat at a tense, unholy impasse.

Regarding the widening blue glow on its limb, I pointed. "It's spreading can you feel it? What's it feel like? Does it feel like dying? Or does it feel like nothing at all, absolute void encroaching on your senses?"

Next to me, Mike watched me with horror, more afraid of me than of the entity hovering above us.

A third and final massive roar blasted us with fetid, ghastly odors. The sound of grating brick erupted behind us, and the blue wire we'd lain last iteration shimmered into view under our feet. "Of course," I mused aloud. "Mostly illusion"

We kicked off our shoes, leaving the eerie blue corruption in the entity's pocket dimension, where the consumption would be contained safely. Walking through the gap in bare socks, we emerged into a carport parking lot. A neighbor stood in the distance smoking in just a beater and boxers.

"Well, we're definitely home," Mike said with a gulp.

"Yes." I turned, regarding the back paths. I could still feel the entity's presence, awaiting the promised cure. I wondered how long it would take to realize no cure was coming. What did it really look like? Did it have skin that would slough off before it died, leaving it to waste away in agony?

I hoped so.

Mike began stepping away nervously. "I'm just gonna take her home"

"I'll do it. Trust me."

He untied his ropes and let her down, pushing her over to me. She leapt up into my arms without a care. I began walking away, a deeply satisfying sense of victory filling me.

The screams of little girls playing in the carport emanated from down the lot. Looking over, I saw the missing girl, watched over worriedly by her mother as she played. So they'd found her after all, through normal means

I smiled at the little girl I was holding. It hadn't seen the real little girl playing in the distance yet, but the jig was about to be up. I wondered, with excitement, how it would try to defend itself. Would it be as much fun as the back paths had been?

"What *are* you?" Mike called after me, his tone quavering.

"Don't worry about it," I called back, walking away. It was rare that I left witnesses alive, but he'd been a top-notch partner. It wouldn't have felt right to destroy him. No - right at that moment, I was only looking forward to taking the impostor creature into the apartment I'd been temporarily making use of, and then seeing how well it might fight back. Two kills in one day - what a week! My grin widened as I departed. "I'm nobody. Just remember me as a bad trip you had once"

[Running the Maze](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iww1l/running_the_maze/)

With no immediate danger apparent, we took refuge in a rare apartment not marked with the strange postings. There was no furniture inside, as if nobody had lived there for quite some time. Peering through the blinds and out into the calm night, I couldn't help feeling that any measure of safety we might find would merely be a comforting illusion.

The only room in the house with no windows lay on the second floor - a long narrow bathroom. Mike searched for the light switch in the darkness and flicked it with relief. "Lights work."

"Yeah, but why?" I asked, not willing to trust any beneficial turn of events, no matter how small. "And the automatic lights out in the carports work, too"

"Got me." He carried the little girl to the bath tub and told her gently to try to sleep.

After closing and locking the door, I turned the faucet experimentally. Nothing happened. "No water but maybe it's just because nobody was living here."

We both slumped on opposite sides of the narrow space.

"What do you think GLORWOC is?" he asked, trying to pronounce the word we'd seen posted on the doors of apartments we very much did not want to enter. "Glor-walk? Maybe it stands for something."

I shook my head, gazing absently at my shoes, and at the under-sink cabinets against which they rested. My pants were still soggy from the rains in the back paths, but I wasn't about to feel even more vulnerable in this eerie place.

And where was it, exactly? My apartment key worked, and my car was outside in a nearby carport. The buildings all looked right, as far as we could tell at night. Was this another dimension, a parallel world where something terrible had happened? If so, what?

And if this was another world, then how would we ever get back home? How would we ever know which gap was the right one? Would the back paths let the guiding wire we'd laid remain? I doubted it.

Unanswered questions plagued me as I reclined against the wall, half-asleep for some interminable time.

A jolt brought me fully awake. Listening to the distant vibration, I tried to place it but couldn't recognize it. Also woken up, Mike blinked and looked at me with tired, bloodshot eyes.

"Stay here," I said, groaning and standing. "I'm going to go look around."

"Shouldn't I come with you?"

"We can't leave her here alone."

He nodded unhappily. "Be careful"

I crept out without another word, closing the bathroom door behind me.

Eyes wide, ears alert, I let my senses drink in the faint early morning light. The barest blue hue vaguely outlined the empty rooms to my left and right. I approached the closet in each slowly, taking one step a time, making absolutely no noise. I heard nothing, and swung each closet open with a jump of apprehension - but found more nothing.

With the second floor clear, I moved down the stairs, cringing at each painfully loud creak. Finding nothing in the kitchen or the living room, I reluctantly decided to call the apartment safe, at least for the moment.

Cracking open the blinds just a tiny bit, I looked out.

The wan pre-dawn blue revealed barely more than it hid. Impenetrable shadows ran long and confusing across the grass islands, bushes, sidewalks, and cars outside. The scenery was made only more confusing by the intermittent lampposts shining small pockets of orange on their surroundings. Sliding out the front door we'd bashed in, I closed it carefully behind me.

The first that struck me was the clean, sweet feel of open air. The day was cool but refreshing, and I would have called the weather amazing at any other time. Dark clouds ran corrugated across half the sky, but the other half formed a vault of dim incandescent blue overhead.

Nothing stirred in the dusk, save a few trees swaying with ephemeral morning breezes. A deathly silence hung over everything. I walked slowly along the grass, sticking close to the wall of the apartment buildings, peering at every nook and shadow. I kept subconsciously anticipating movement and life, habitually used to this time as a period of awakening and the start of a new day, but the lack of sound or presence only disturbed me further. What had happened here? Where *was* everyone? Actually, from the smell emanating from my apartment the night before, I imagined many of the families were dead in their marked homes was there another me, dead in my apartment?

Not willing to check any of the marked apartments, I crept along toward the front of our development, peering around every corner for several long moments before I made any move.

As I moved, I began noticing subtle, inexplicable signs of devastation. A streetlight had fallen across the outer fence, apparently snapped by something that had left the trees around it intact. A van sat pitifully torn in two, as if something had taken a bite clean through the middle. Peering at it from afar, I could see no bodies or blood or scorch marks or anything else that might have indicated how it had happened.

My ears strained, and I realized what was missing: there were no birds. The morning was alternately still and breezy, but no chirps or calls echoed out from the trees around.

Growing increasingly paranoid, I imagined I could feel hollow eyes watching me from every window around, families of corpses within furious that I had dared to creep by their quiet apartments-become-tombs.

Crouching now, I came to the entrance to our apartment complex. Hiding behind a pillar, I looked west into dim blue and darkness, and then east into dim blue and lightening sky. I'd expected crashed cars and decaying bodies and all manner of destruction, but the main road sat empty.

The hardware store wasn't far. I decided to risk walking there. We would need tools if we were going to survive a third encounter with the back paths. Darting from cover to cover on the side of the road, I kept looking forward and back, but no obvious source of danger presented itself.

Crouching behind a large rock, I looked out - and then jumped away from something breathing behind me.

I quickly realized it was a dog - but it was in no condition to do anything but breathe. A large circular hole had been torn in its stomach and back legs, exposing its inner organs. Slimy and covered in internal goo, they still pulsed with life. The dog rolled its eye and looked at me, giving a pitiful whine of pain.

It couldn't speak, but I knew what it wanted. I resolved to return here on my way back, once I had an appropriate tool.

It was only as I reached the hardware store that I realized that people would have made a run on anything useful if a disaster was looming - but my fears were unfounded. The large building sat undamaged, the front door swinging wide open in the breeze.

Now even more paranoid, I carefully looked around the dusty space from the door, but still saw nothing dangerous. Filling a large bag with anything I thought might be useful, I spent as little time there as possible.

The sun cracked the horizon as I began walking back, still on edge. I almost wanted something terrible to happen, if only so I could stop looking over my shoulder constantly. I shaded my eyes against the strangely bright dawn and made for the injured dog.

By the time I found his gully again, I began doubting my senses. Blinking, I tried to clear the strangeness, but nothing I did helped. It was only when I saw the dog directly that I realized that what I was seeing was not an illusion.

Sickly phosphorescence surrounded the animal's open wound, giving off ethereal blue shimmers in response to the dawn's direct sunlight. Staring at it, I could almost see it ever so slowly eating away at his body but his skin and outer flesh far more so than his inner organs. I felt sick, imagining what would happen to him if the strange corruption were allowed to progress. He would live far longer into his horrible death than any living being should have to - a pile of muscles, organs, and inner flesh exposed to the world. Had that happened to the families in all those apartments, too?

As the sun grew brighter, so did the eerie phosphorescence. I followed it with my eyes away from the dog, along the ground where he'd dragged himself to get here and then I saw glimmers of it up in the trees, slowly eating away at intermittent leaves and it was on the road and variously strewn about on nearby grasses

Looking at myself in terror, I was relieved to find nothing. Except

I tore off my jacket, throwing it on the ground. A few shimmering spots of unwholesome blue glimmered on the back, around the bottom. What had I touched? When had my jacket been contaminated? What the hell was it? Poking the jacket with a stick, I confirmed that small frayed holes had been eaten in the material.

Truly horrified to my core for the first time since I'd encountered the back paths, I wasted nearly a minute standing in place. What could consume streetlights, vans, dogs, trees, grass, and jackets alike? Was this what the posted warning signs had been referring to? The rumble I'd heard that morning I could now fathom the sound it had to have been a nearby building collapsing, its foundations likely eaten right through

Checking my bag of tools for contamination, I took off running as soon I was satisfied that they were clean.

I ran through the apartment complex in terror, changing my route constantly to avoid large patches of shimmering blue. Somehow, on my way out before dawn, I'd managed to walk a narrow invisible passage of safety - eerie corruption ate away at the sidewalks I'd avoided, and I could now see it smeared on door handles and the sides of cars and anything else infected people had touched before before their skin had

I shook my head, fighting the urge to be sick.

The apartment we'd taken refuge in remained normal in appearance, free of the strange consumption for the moment. I silently thanked whoever had nailed the warning signs to every other home.

As I opened the front door, I froze. I'd opened my own apartment door the night before. The door handles staring at my hands, I studied them for any sign of corruption, but breathed a sigh of relief when I found none. Had I just used the key to open and close the door? I couldn't remember. Fishing my keys out of my pocket, I held them up.

A slight sliver of blue glowed from within one of the deeper grooves.

Throwing them away in disgust, I pulled out my pocket, making sure it hadn't spread to my clothes. Satisfied, I bolted inside, announcing myself as I ran up the stairs. "Come on, come outside, we have to go!"

Mike emerged after a moment, holding the little girl in his arms at the top of the stairs. "What is it? What's happened?"

"I can't even explain it," I shouted back. "Just don't touch anything glowing blue. Seriously. Do *not* let it touch you."

"Why, what happens?"

I shook my head and led them outside, checking them over in the sunlight. "You're clean."

We ran to the gap to the back paths, finding refuge in a wide swath of untouched grass immediately outside the entrance. It was strange that I felt safe there, but, at that moment, the world at large seemed far worse than whatever new nightmare awaited us within.

"What's that?" the little girl asked, smiling and pointing at the shimmering phosphorescence all around.

"Nothing," Mike said calmly, holding her in place. "Just decorations. Christmas lights."

I wonder if he guessed the horrific things that glimmering corruption could do to living beings. How was he still so calm? I laid out the tools I'd grabbed, studying our options. We had to come up with a plan. If the back paths just turned upside down the moment we entered, we would die, unless

I lifted the length of rope I'd grabbed, my manic smile of momentary triumph returning. "Forget running the maze. We have to do something it won't expect we're gonna *climb.*"

	<TEXT> [Part 1: The Back Paths](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iu5y4/the_back_paths/)

A searing lance of sunset fire framed the evening sky in slow motion, lending everything the subdued color of flame. I pulled the car into my spot and killed the engine, watching the gap to the back paths. I imagined it was glaring back at me, the shadows beyond wavering strangely in the dim orange twilight.

My neighbor, Mike, carried a large spool of electrical wire close to his rumpled black Megadeth t-shirt. "How come you get the sledgehammer?"

Getting out and pulling the heavy tool from the backseat, I ripped the barcode sticker off and hefted it in both hands. Not wanting to give any of my plans away, I gave him no answer. He followed anyway, probably still uncertain whether I was serious.

"Tie one end around this bush," I said, indicating a plant immediately outside the gap. As he did so, I briefly rested the sledgehammer on the ground and pulled my jacket tighter.

"There's not a cloud in the sky," he said, billowing his t-shirt with one hand and sweating slightly from the heat.

I narrowed my eyes. "You should really wear a jacket."

"Fine man, fine." He turned to walk back to his apartment.

I stood there waiting, unsure if he was going to return. The fire in the sky lost some of its glow with each passing minute, leaving the bit of back path I could see increasingly shrouded in gloom. Finally, he came back, walking up with a windbreaker open and flapping, and his hands in his pockets. His eyes were a little more bloodshot than before.

Shrugging, I hefted the sledgehammer and led the way through the gap.

The canopy overhead and the framing high walls immediately brought heavy silence and orange-cast murkiness.

Mike held the spool, unwinding it as we walked. At random intervals, he laughed quietly to himself.

"Quiet," I whispered harshly. "There's something in here, remember."

He chuckled and blinked heavily. "Looks the same as ever to me, man."

And it did. The brick path stretched away in either direction, following the backsides of the apartment buildings. We came to the first picnic bench, flanked by two large bushes. Looking around, ensuring we were alone, I took out my pocket knife and cut a letter on the unseen bottom side of the table.

Walking further, we came to another gap in the brick wall, finding ourselves at another carport in the development.

"Doesn't seem weird to me," he said apologetically.

Not sure what to do, I led us both back to the picnic table. The letter I'd carved remained underneath. "I've run through here a thousand times," I said, studying the paths. "I wasn't paying attention when it happened. Maybe that's the key."

He made a confused face. "How do we not pay attention when we know we're trying not to pay attention?"

We sat for a moment, at a loss, until I had a thought. "Close our eyes and walk?"

He shrugged, and we moved to the corner, facing down a long straightaway that led deeper into the back paths. Closing my eyes, I stepped forward, slowed only slightly by his hand gripping the tail end of my jacket.

Carefully taking one step at a time, I clutched the sledgehammer close and put one hand out, anticipating a hedge or a tree at any moment. The evening air was unpleasantly warm and humid even under the trees, and I seemed to be reaching into hot, silent emptiness. My anticipation of the oncoming corner rose to a painful height - but, still, nothing met my fingers.

As the sightless creeping wore on, I began counting my steps. Five ten fifty when I reached a hundred, I was certain something was wrong. I finally opened my eyes.

My outstretched hand hung less than an inch from a twisted, rusted blade. Jumping back into Mike, I stared at the blighted, misshapen antique street sign that had nearly sliced my hand in two. The words had been weather-worn beyond readability.

"What the hell?" he asked, opening his eyes.

We both looked around. The sidewalk and lining trees remained, but the visible walls beyond now ran with a strange style of stucco.

"I told you!" I whispered, holding the sledgehammer higher. "First things first - let's follow this wire back, make sure we can get out."

"We might not be able to get out?" he asked, worried.

I winced. "Um, well I did last time, I'm sure we'll be fine."

Except the wire we'd spooled out led right into a brick wall, disappearing into it right where a gap should have been.

"Holy shit," Mike said, dropping the spool.

I regarded the brick, unconcerned. "I thought this might happen." Lifting the sledgehammer back, I brought it forward with all my strength. A large piece of brick fell out, and I hit it again, and then a third time, swinging until the single-layer brick gave way. Smashing out a large gap, we peered through.

On the other side sat a parking lot full of cars.

An almost manic smile crept across my face.

Our return assured, Mike picked up the spool again and reluctantly followed me further into the back paths. Down several long straightaways and through three four-way junctions, we found another picnic table, this one near a darkly shimmering pool of black water. I checked under the table, finding the symbol I'd carved - though what that meant, I wasn't yet sure. Studying the little pool, little ripples told us of the light rain beginning overhead before either of us felt it first-hand.

"Told you we'd need jackets," I said, listening to the patter begin on the leaves overhead as the shade grew darker. The orange tint was gone, slowly replaced by the fuzzy inky blue found only at the edge of true night. Peering down the paths as we walked, straining to see, we both jumped at shifting, malformed shadows that repeatedly turned out to be tricks of the eye.

A crack of thunder resounded overhead, and the rain began dripping from the leaves overhead in earnest.

Mike shivered and raised his hood. "This sucks man, maybe we should go back."

Before I had a chance to reply, we rounded a corner and came across a horrific sight. A mangled mass of flesh and black gore lay splattered across the sidewalk, a long trail of fleshy bits and smeared filth leading away in the direction we'd intended to go. The entire terrible display seemed to subtly shift and change in the eye-defying darkness. I even imagined I saw some of the creature's severed fingers still moving about in their puddle, but I chalked it up to the splattering rain.

"That's the thing I saw," I whispered, frozen in place.

"That's the thing?" he whispered back. "Then *what* did *that* to *it?*"

I shook my head. "I think we need to risk one shout."

"What?" he hissed, wiping rain water from his face. "Are you crazy right now?"

"The little girl responded last time I shouted. And we can't wander around in here forever."

He seemed terrified, but relented. Cautiously moving the opposite direction from the ravaged corpse, I gave one quick, hoarse yell. "*Hello?*"

The sound seemed to echo for nearly twenty seconds.

We stood, silent, hearts pounding.

A small cry came from a path to our right.

Running quickly and quietly that direction, we stopped at a four-way intersection, not sure where to turn. A tapping sounded below our feet, and we both jumped back in fright. It took a moment for us to realize that a pair of small eyes was watching us from below a sewer grate. It took another moment for us to grip the grate through inch-deep rivulets of pouring rain and throw it to the side.

Mike pulled her out from down below. It was the little girl he'd described, albeit covered in dirt and soaked to the bone. Screwing up her face in fear, she pointed behind us.

We didn't waste any time looking. Mike scooped her up, and we took off running along the lain wire, splashing through ankle deep water and trying not to lose the trail. I realized we would never be able to keep following the wire if the water grew any deeper.

"Wait!" I hissed, stopping at a space of brick wall. "We don't have to go all the way back to ours!"

Hefting the sledgehammer, I bashed the wall repeatedly, breaking pieces off with agonizing slowness. Heart pounding, I slammed again and again, trying to get through before -

I sensed Mike and the girl tense. I turned.

I blinked against the rain running down my face, peering into the shifting darkness along the path behind us. Lightning flashed, searing the scene in bright detail - but I saw nothing. Thunder rolled, and I turned away, hammering at the wall again.

"There!" the little girl screamed.

I turned back again, wearily lifting the hammer in case of attack. Eyes wide to soak in the barest of light still reaching us through the storm, I scanned the path. And still nothing!

One more swing sent a large section of the wall crumbling back, the knee-high water flowing through eagerly. Mike pushed the little girl through, and then clambered through after her. Watching him squeeze through, I waited, senses on fire with adrenaline. Every raindrop and splash seemed to sear my ears, and every second seemed to stretch on eternally as I waited for Mike to finish getting through

I leapt around as I heard a different kind of splash behind me.

Staring around in terror, waiting for a flash of lightning to light up the path, I still saw nothing getting a sudden notion that there was a very obvious place for something to hide, I dropped the sledgehammer and leapt out of the thigh-high surging rainwater.

Gripping branches, I climbed up into the closest tree, watching as another burst of lightning illuminated some grotesque series of shadows in the water below. The following thunder nearly shook me out of the tree but I climbed higher, resolving to go right over the brick wall.

Laughing loudly, I refused to fall from the slick branches, clawing my way upwards. I could see it, lit intermittently by eyeball-searing lightning - the top of the brick wall, just out of reach. Clambering up another branch, then a second, and a third, I reached out a hand -

...and suddenly I was slipping, falling in a panic, though not the way I would have expected. My body seemed to tumble, my orientation shifting, as I desperately grabbed at thick tree branches and came to a painful stop as one met my chest. Groaning, I dug my fingers into the nearby branches and tried to comprehend what I was seeing below. The lightning was now flashing intermittently under me in the water? No - I was upside down!

I clutched the tree harder as I realized it was the only thing between me and the infinite void of sky below. The stormclouds pulsed menacingly, blinking with bursts of lightning, shaking the tree against me with riotous thunder, and shooting waves of rain up at me. Confused and horrified, I looked up, seeing a ceiling of water still bubbling madly in a constrained path, that impossible shape still moving underneath, waiting for me

The chilly, rain-soaked minutes passed as I tried to think of a way out. I could climb up and get torn apart by that lurking horror, or I could let go and fall forever I'd never felt quite that way before, feeling the certainty of death circling in on all sides. Clinging to those branches, I thought about my life and everything I'd done, everything I wanted to do. Would it all end here in this otherworldly nightmare?

Unless

Shivering, feeling my strength fading, I studied the wall next to me. It came down from above, stopping just out of reach, a crowning upside down light fixture mocking my need for light with its broken bulb. Judging the distance by flashes of lightning, I guessed that I had only one way out. Doing my best to summon all my courage, I managed to make the wild split-second decision.

Bracing my feet and edging as far forward as I dared, I leapt out toward the wall.

Soaring through what I knew was endless void, my grasping hands found that light fixture, and I grappled desperately with it, curling and writhing in the air. With only a few seconds of grip on the rain-slicked metal, I let myself swing further forward, and I let go. I swung impossibly in the air, circling too fast to comprehend, my orientation lost.

A large, flat surface smacked into me bodily, knocking the wind from my lungs and bashing my face without compassion.

"Holy crap man, how'd you do that?" Mike shouted, running over to me. He waved his hand up at the wall that was now properly above us, indicating what had probably been an insane and impossible acrobatic sight.

Wiping dirt from my face, I sat up slowly, looking back in shock at the now-normal gap to the back paths. The carport's lamps cast a slight illumination beyond, showing nothing but normal sidewalk.

Gripping my head with one hand, I stumbled to my feet. "I'm I'm going home" I mumbled, glancing at the little girl, who clung to Mike's leg. "Take her home, will you. Don't tell anyone about this"

He stared at me. "Like I was going to?"

Staggering toward my apartment, my soaked clothes slopping around me uncomfortably as I walked, I resolved to sleep for the next two days straight. Had anything I'd seen been real? What the hell *was* that place? I had the strangest feeling that the back paths and I had played a game, that it had been learning and adapting as we played and that I'd made it furious by escaping twice. It would react brutally if I entered a third time, I knew - but no matter, I was never going near those paths ever again.

I reached my apartment with no small relief. Turning the key in the door, I opened it slightly, and then paused. A white card had been nailed to my door, with large red letters emblazoned across it - GLORWOC. Confused, I looked to my left and right, noticing the same card on each visible door.

It was then I noticed the smell wafting from inside my apartment.

A male yell of sheer terror rang out from across the carport, a shout of warning meant for me. Mike ran out between the cars holding the little girl, shouting something at the top of his lungs.

I closed the door to my apartment softly, remaining outside. My tired gaze fell on my scraped up hands and legs. I laughed softly. Of course of course and it'd been *my idea* to try a different gap to escape. How foolish to assume all the gaps in that mind-bending nightmare exited to the same place we weren't home, not at all.

We had to go back in

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd just made a trip to the grocery store when I found out. Pulling into my space in the carport between the rows, I couldn't help but stare at the two police cars and gathered crowd of concerned onlookers. Grabbing some of my groceries, I began carrying them into my apartment, pausing each trip to look across the carport and try to discern what had happened.

"Hey," I said to my disheveled metal-head neighbor. "What happened?"

He closed his gaping mouth and looked over at me from next to his car. "That lady freaking out? That's the mom."

"The mom?"

He furrowed his brow. "Kid disappeared. Little girl, seven years old. The one always screaming out here with her friends I think. They're handing out pictures."

A sinking feeling filled my chest. I focused on grabbing some grocery bags from my trunk to keep my composure. "That's terrible"

"Yeah. Said she was playing with other kids around the five hundreds."

I looked up the stairs at my door's hanging number - eight forty. That would put the incident in the opposite corner of the apartment complex. Not sure what else to say, I slammed my trunk shut and carried the last of my things inside.

Things like this happened all the time, surely, but in my very own neighborhood? To a family right across the carport? The sense of violation left me shaken. After a few irked minutes inside, I decided to go for a run to clear my head.

Leaving the opposite direction to avoid the crowd in the carport out back, I turned and headed out, running along the high barbed fence marking the edge of our development. Nice-enough houses and a few forested areas passed by outside, but nothing that seemed dangerous, and I saw no holes in the fence or other paths through.

Wracking my brain, trying to remember if I'd seen anything suspicious or anyone unfamiliar, I turned toward the interior of the complex. Running past the outer rows of apartments, I passed through the small gap in the carport wall, entering the back paths.

The back paths were beautiful and well kept, lain brick sidewalks lined with trees, forming a maze that twisted and turned between every building. The summer sun remained distant through the foliage, keeping the shaded paths cool and refreshing. I paused for a breath at a picnic table placed at an angle before two large bushes, not sure exactly where I was.

No numbers were visible along the backsides of the apartment buildings. I walked back and forth while I caught my breath, but only smooth unbroken aluminum siding remained visible behind the thick trees. The back paths were a favorite place of mine to run, always empty, cool, and solitary, but I'd lost my way while distracted.

A light breeze shifted the trees overhead - an unexpectedly humid and unpleasant chill. Looking down one path, I saw only endless sidewalk curving off into tree-lined paths, shot through by dappled sunlight. Down the other lay a picnic table by two large bushes, and a circular basin framing planted flowers.

Walking over in confusion, I studied the picnic table. Was it the same one I'd just stopped at? They all looked the same, I supposed, but I didn't remember the sidewalk circling around flowers I would certainly have noticed their bright purple right?

That strange, chilly breeze came again, strong enough to ruffle my clothes. I narrowed my eyes to test my vision, wondering if the area was growing darker. As I picked a direction and ran, my suspicions were confirmed. The first drop of water hit my shoulder, making me jump and look around, but of course nobody was there.

Except the quiet now felt strange, almost curved, as if someone *was* nearby - just around the corner, or walking along a nearby path. The presence felt aloof, like uninterested passersby on their way somewhere, but I still had an inexplicable urge to remain quiet.

Walking quietly, taking care to avoid the stray nuts and leaves on the brick path, I listened intently to my lightly ragged breathing and the increasing drizzle on the leaves overhead. Turning at a bend once more, I came to another picnic table. A square basin held a large patch of dark green ivy. How the hell had I missed the exit? *Any* exit? There had to be gaps to the different carports everywhere I must have just missed the last one somehow. Maybe bushes had grown over it, and, so distracted, I'd walked right by

The rain finally passed the leafy canopy overhead, dripping regularly down on me.

Now a little scared and more than a little frustrated, I took off running as fast as I could, bolting down the green-lined pathways.

As the noise of crushed nuts and crinkled leaves radiated from under my pounding feet, the sound of scraping metal echoed back. The presence I'd felt before seemed to snap to attention, now anything but uninterested. The high squeal of metal faded, replaced by rapid, heavy footfalls.

Spurred on by a surge in the rain covering my noises, I turned, ran, turned, ran again. Bushes, trees, brick, and smooth aluminum siding blurred past me, never opening, never offering escape. The heavy footfalls grew closer, less than one angled curve behind me.

Suddenly coming up short, I slid along the slick sidewalk, my legs shooting forward, the harsh sidewalk scraping right up my thigh. The stop had been worth it - a gap in the brick to my left opened on a car-filled lot. Finally! I shook my head, almost laughing. I'd just gotten lost in the back paths, and freaked myself out with all sorts of imagined fears and -

It came around the corner slowly, that high metal squeal rising again.

My entire awareness seemed to freeze, refusing to take in the rotting *thing* lumbering down the path toward me. Misshapen and grotesque, the very act of motion seemed to send visible waves of pain across a twisted face that ran half the length of its body, ending at broken teeth set in its waist. Black gore seeped from open stumps where the left half of its vaguely human body should have been, but it continued shambling as if the limbs were there, somehow supported in impossible ways. The metal squeal came again, sharp steel on stone, but I could see no source for the sound. I had the distinct impression that what I was *not* seeing was far more horrific and dangerous than what I *was* seeing

Grasping stone, shouting hoarsely at the top of my lungs, I recovered as fast as I could, scrambling for the gap in the brick. I darted behind a van, slowing as I realized that the rain had suddenly stopped. The sun was shining overhead, and the hot day felt as normal as any other. Peering around the edge of the van, I watched the gap to the back paths, but nothing showed.

Taking a moment to catch my breath, I finally had a chance to analyze the last sound I'd heard, a distant noise following my shout - the terrified scream of a little girl.

She was in there. She was I stared at that gap, the terrible thought really hitting home *in there!*

Running back to my apartment, I sighted the police still at the mother's house, and the onlookers still hanging around talking in hushed tones.

"Jeez, what happened to you, dude?" my neighbor asked, still standing outside his apartment.

Running a hand down my face to slick off the rain, my clothes still soaked, I realized I couldn't tell the police. What would I say? Some horrific aspect had come over the back paths of the apartment complex? I would look like a madman, and the focus would almost certainly turn on me. And I couldn't risk that, because I was the only one who knew where she was

I just stared at him for a moment, profoundly unhappy.

I had to go back in there.

"Someone's stupid sprinkler," I finally said, turning to head inside and change.

A half-step into it, I paused. Whether it was real or whether I was losing my mind, another perspective would be very useful. I turned back to him. "Hey man, what are you doing right now?"

"Nothing, what's up?"

I considered not telling him, but it would be brutal to trick him into going into that horrible place, especially when my instinct was telling me that what I'd experienced was only the tip of the iceberg.

There was another option. He might actually believe me - provided he was in the right state of mind. "You high right now?"

He laughed and smoothed down his t-shirt, glancing over at the cop cars. "Yeah. Of course."

I gulped. "Good... I think I know where that little girl is."

	<TEXT> From the moment I reached the top of the wooden stairs, I immediately disliked the room. An expansive, antiquated attic that creaked with each swelling winter gust, the space filled me with an uneasy apprehension.

As a cover for my disquiet, I pretended to be annoyed that her family had stuck us with the worst room in the house. Coming up the stairs behind me, my girlfriend urged me to persevere. It was just for the week, and then wed be free of the drama for another year.

To say that I got along poorly with her family would be an understatement.

Her young cousins and her aunts and uncles werent the problem. It really came down to her incredibly old-fashioned grandparents, who disapproved of our living together and our avoidance of marriage. This was their house their creaky, dim, old house and I knew I would have to put up with their comments and disrespect all week.

At least theyve given us our own room this year, she offered.

Shivering against the drafts, I clenched my jaw. Right. Great.

The first evening - Christmas Eve - went about as I expected. The aunts and uncles lined the couches as the kids ran around and played. Everyone plied my girlfriend with questions about her coming graduation and expected career; a few questions went my way, but those were quickly silenced by her grandfathers stern frown.

Unhappy, but enduring, I returned to our attic room without complaint. The night had been called early on account of the Christmas presents to be opened the next morning, so the house quickly fell quiet. Wrapped in multiple blankets, my girlfriend slept soundly, while I sat awake, dwelling on the week ahead.

High wooden posts, four in all, flanked each corner of the wide antique bed. As I sat in the creaking, shifting darkness, those guardian posts seemed to stand solid against the drafts, marking out a scant area of calm.

Outside the beds space, the entire attic seemed alive - I could see very little by the faint moonlight filtering in through the solitary window, but I felt like I was sitting outside, bare, on an open plain. The walls seemed laughably incapable of resisting the biting winds, almost appearing to move back and forth with each gust.

I felt uncomfortably vulnerable.

Vulnerable to who, or what - I couldnt say - but the unease Id first felt had now risen to a wary anticipation. Antique furniture lined the attics extremities, and I had the oddest notion that someone could easily hide among those dusty relics. Against the whistling winter wind, I wouldnt even hear them breathing keeping my eyes wide open, I scanned the creaking shadows, straining to see by the barest moonlight

Something caught my attention between an old armoire and a plastic-shrouded sofa. Staring at it, I tried to comprehend what I was seeing I moved my sight a little over, using the edges of my vision and the two little circles blinked.

I pushed back into the headboard with a guttural shout.

My girlfriend rolled awake, wide-eyed, as a silhouette quickly pattered across the floor.

Haha, got you! the youngest of her cousins squealed. Got you so bad!

I sighed.

Get out of here! my girlfriend complained. Santa doesnt give presents to bad little girls. Go back to bed.

No fair! Ill be good now, the little girl promised, skipping down the steps with one more bout of laughter at having scared me.

My girlfriend rolled over, returning to sleep with a grumble.

Annoyed, I decided to sleep as well. Embarrassment easily trumped any vague apprehensions I had about the room. As my senses dulled, I heard a louder creak above the shifting winds - something I attributed to her little cousin. Go back to sleep, I muttered.

The creaking immediately stopped - and did not return again that night.

Christmas day turned out to be rather fun, occupying my thoughts right up through dinner. It was only afterward, while the kids lay in food comas and the adults chatted lazily over wine, that my apprehensions returned.

You know, the attics really creaky, I said. Lots of drafts.

We dont normally have this many people over, her grandmother replied, her tone pointed. Otherwise everyone unmarried would have their own rooms.

After a sip of her wine, one of the aunts chimed in. Yep, we havent had anyone stay in the attic in almost thirty years, not since hmm, well, actually, I think it was -

- a long time ago, her grandmother interrupted, her manner suddenly - strangely - diplomatic.

Wasnt that when dads war buddy visited, and then after two nights he -

- stress disorders are a terrible thing. Thats all it was.

That line of conversation died abruptly as a discomfort fell over the room.

They changed topics and resumed the merriment, but I couldnt let it go.

At the end of the night, sitting up in the beds scant rectangle of safety, I turned to my girlfriend. After two nights he *what?*

Who, the war buddy? I dunno, never heard that story. She yawned drunkenly, clicked the nightstand lamp off, and rolled over into her cocoon of blankets.

I sat awake again, listening to the darkness, creaks, and wind. The clouds obscured the moon that night, and my eyes strained for even a hint of dim light - but found none.

As I sat motionless in the pitch black, the drafts on my face and the subtle motions of the house against the wind stirred up an uncomfortable disorientation. I had the strangest notion - so immersive, so physical, without any senses but touch and hearing - that the vast, open plain Id imagined sitting out on the night before had returned but fuller this time, more real.

Still straining my eyes, I peered around the windy darkness for perceived hours, perhaps hoping vainly to ward off some imagined creature stalking the open landscape around the beds pitiful rectangle of safety.

Feeling a bit cornered by my strange fears, knowing that I would never sleep while these abstract terrors gripped me, I decided to indulge them a bit. Slowly, so as to make no noise or disruption, I slipped the blankets off and took the cell phone my girlfriend had left between our pillows.

I crawled forward on the bed carefully, slid my hand out, and found the corner bedpost. The chilly wind flowed by exactly as I imagined it might in a wide, empty expanse I tentatively raised a hand upward, feeling icy void and breezes flowing slightly faster above, but I couldnt be sure

Crouched at the end of the bed, eyes wide in a futile attempt to see something, anything at all - a warm breeze ran down my face. Confused, I froze. Had I found the invisible flow from a vent, dispensing heat from the furnace three stories below? I moved my face forward, stopping an inch from the imaginary wall of safety between the two bedposts.

The warm breeze came again, at a definite downward angle, brushing across the lower half of my face, as if

Electricity ran through every muscle, and I held my breath.

Id imagined something stalking the open surreal landscape out in the pitch black. Id stared out, trying to detect it what if it lurked right beyond the bedposts, *trying to see me in return?* Was it arched there, fully the height of the bed and my crouched body, its face an inch from mine?

My right hand moved up ever so slowly, bringing the cell phone up next to my face. All I had to do was click a button, and it would light up I hesitated, terrified by the notion that I would illuminate something horrifying staring back at me. My finger trembled above the buttons

The chilly drafts seemed to change shape around me, and the warm breathing vanished. I listened intently, unable to hear any sound of movement but the physical presence of something directly opposite me in the darkness had gone.

I clicked the phones light on.

Nothing horrible leapt at me from the darkness. I shook my head with a sigh. The bedposts stood faintly illuminated by the screens light, and the only thing I could see was my own ridiculous behavior. Shining the phone around, I found nothing disturbing in any direction. In fact, I found nothing at all

Curious, shivering against the breezes, I shined the phone down.

The beds heavy feet seemed to rest on open void. Moving closer, but not daring to cross past the bedposts, I tried to make out the floorboards but there was just *nothing*

The phone slipped from my fingers, then, and bounced from the edge of the mattress and over.

Breathless, I watched in anticipation as the spinning dim rectangle of light dropped away. It vanished almost immediately. I hesitated only a moment; and then turned hastily toward the opposite end of the bed, crawling for the headboard. The phone had seemed to drop away at an angle

Peering over the headboard, I sighted the spinning light again, now far, far behind the bed - and moving away. It fell for another two or three interminable seconds, hitting something hard with an audible clatter, its light spilling across rock? Rocks? What the hell was I looking at?

Even as the confusing image receded into the distance, my racing thoughts finally placed it all: I wasnt on an open plain I was *in a cave*, I was *moving through a cave* and something huge and mobile had moved in front of the phones distant light, blotting it out.

But not near the phone, no

The shadow blocking the phones light was immediate and close - its warm breath on my face now unmistakable. Frozen again, I watched as the enormous shadow passed, crawling above quite literally crawling on top of the rectangular space marked by the beds four posts.

I could feel the warm gusts from directly above - it was aware of me now, aware of our unfamiliar block of space, aware of something alive inside that space - something it couldnt seem to reach, but something it most certainly wanted

I cowered down, listening to intermittent scratching noises that belied its attempts to reach us. I felt like an animal cowering in a cage, with no recourse except to hide and hope

A blast of sunlight sliced along my eyes, and the attics furniture and familiar wooden walls instantly melted into form across my vision. I hadnt blinked - thats all I kept telling myself - I hadnt even blinked. There was no way Id fallen asleep. It couldnt have been a dream.

I reached for the phone between the pillows, but it was gone.

Deeply disturbed, I spent the day in a daze, internally debating what Id experienced. I couldnt tell anyone - I couldnt give her grandparents another reason to dislike me, or her family cause for thinking me insane but this *had to be* what her grandfathers veteran friend had experienced.

Sneaking away before dinner - all lights on - I examined every single inch of that attic, a rising note of panic pushing me faster the closer night approached. I carefully pried back a loose board in the wall - nothing of note back there. I opened all the dusty furniture, but found nothing out of the ordinary.

The moment came when there was nothing left, save the one space I feared the most. I watched it at an angle in a propped up mirror, wondering if something might betray itself but the dark space under the bed lay silent and still, emanating inexplicable menace.

What are you doing? my girlfriend asked, interrupting.

Um, nothing, just thinking

Weirdo. Everyones wondering where you are! Its dinner time.

I gulped. Okay

Dinner was a blur. I considered asking someone to switch rooms, but I doubted anyone would - and, even so, I couldnt justify sending my girlfriends family into that strange nightmare world without warning. And, otherwise, there was no place to sleep, and no excuse that wouldnt make me seem strange

I took a flashlight and knife with me to bed, hiding them under my pillow.

As my girlfriend slept, I waited.

This time, sitting in the breezy void, I could almost tell the exact moment that things changed. The creaks and drafts blurred together into a constant, cool flow - and I knew we were back in that otherworldly cave how it was happening, or where it was, I had no idea, but it had seemed, on the night prior, that we were safe as long as we stayed in the bed.

It occurred to me that I might have focused my search in the wrong place. Maybe it wasnt the attic or the furniture at all - maybe it was the *bed* something I resolved to investigate in the morning.

Using my own cellphone, I dialed hers, on the off chance that it would somehow still work

A moment later, the tiniest dot of light appeared in the distance ahead. A moving shadow almost immediately blotted it out, falling for my distraction.

Turning on my flashlight, I aimed it up, intent on proving I was moving through a cave.

The attic ceiling greeted my light the wooden rafters vague, washy, and partially transparent. I could see the flashlights beam grow weaker beyond it, where the light continued up to a wide, distant circle on uneven stone. Stalactites and protrusions raced by at a dizzying speed that immediately prompted me to click my light off and fall back on the pillows.

So we were in both places at once, then

Feeling strangely assured by my increased understanding of the situation, I lay back, almost untroubled. Everything would be fine Id just lie here and make sure neither of us left the bed during the strange intersection of realities. It hadnt lasted very long the night before

I smiled as I lay there, fancying myself quite the master of the supernatural.

I even continued to smile as I heard the scraping sounds start up - the creature, or creatures had noticed our intrusion. The scraping sounds were joined by a strange creaking somewhere out in the distance, but I figured that must just have been the house itself in the wind.

My idiot smile dropped as I felt a tug on the blankets from the end of the bed. The creatures might not be able to get inside, for whatever reason - but apparently that didnt mean they couldnt pull things out.

Terrified, I tugged back. A harder response pulled me up from the sheets, and I set my feet hard and hauled with all my might. Beside me, my girlfriend stirred in response to the struggle, and tore free from the blankets as something heavy hit the beds frame, shaking us. A strange groaning and growling sound matched it.

Too intent on the increasing pull to explain, I just shouted with absolute panic. She screamed, and pulled back with me, resisting whatever was trying to drag the blankets, sheets, and mattress away. The strength of our invisible enemy seemed incredible.

She screamed again, and I abandoned the struggle to dive for my knife. The blankets tore away, and the pull focused on the mattress.

Holding onto the bedpost in the total darkness, I stabbed out with the knife - but there was nothing there, at least not at my height. Feeling the bed shake with a heavy impact again, I stabbed down - and felt the blade sink into boney flesh.

Panicked, I stabbed and sliced again and again. The thing clawing after us in the darkness seemed to finally give up, and a pained groan emanated in the dark.

Shaking, I grabbed my girlfriend, holding her close as she alternately screamed and cried - too shocked to even ask what was happening.

I didnt know how to explain it even if she did ask. All I could do was wait out the otherworldly intersection, knowing that we were safe, that my efforts had actually succeeded against whatever the hell that thing had been.

The morning sun soon sliced the nightmare away again.

Her jaw still trembling, my girlfriend stared at the light streaming in the window.

Not me - Id expected the different flow of time in that other place. I had a more disturbing interest. I crept to the end of the bed, peering down

Her grandfather lay on the floor, mouth agape, curled up in our bloody sheets and blankets. Horrible wounds covered his chest and neck, and my knife lay jutting from his arm. The floor around him was clean, the blood having fallen into that other place rather than the attic.

Filled with horror, I suddenly understood a certain part of the nights experience the creaking had been her grandfather coming up the stairs, perhaps to say something, perhaps to check on us and then hed had a heart attack, crawled over, grabbed at the sheets and groaned for help, and Id Id stabbed him

What is it? my girlfriend asked, finally able to form coherent words. Shivering, she stared at me, unwilling to come look.

I couldnt breathe. I suddenly imagined a life in prison for murder, unable to explain the accident, unable to explain what had happened - and we had a bitter history already, her grandfather and I there was no way theyd believe me or even believe that I was insane, if I tried to go that route

An immense force suddenly jerked the roll of bloody sheets and blankets, dragging the entire mess under the bed.

Are you alright? she asked, growing worried. Hey, what is it? Whats there?

My mouth moved for a moment before I was finally able to form words.

Nothing theres nothing

My eyes frozen wide, I could only stare dumbly at the spot where Id seen the wickedly bladed claw reach out from the darkness under the bed and take her grandfathers body. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Along with many other family members, my uncles in town for the holidays. After years of hearing whispers about something that happened to him, I finally managed to get him to tell me what the incident was all about. I knew that hed almost died, but the *way* it happened makes me wish I hadnt asked.

He worked construction in his mid-twenties, up in the northern end of the States, near the Great Lakes. One particular job came along that had the crew digging up what had once been a graveyard, and they were understandably a little spooked any minor injury was attributed to a curse and regarded with jokes that barely masked latent fear.

He thought nothing of it. In fact, one night, he headed back alone to pick up something hed left at the dig site.

The heat of summer was strong at the time, and he sweat a little as he crossed the sites uneven brown landscape. The numerous rains of the season had somehow missed that week, and the dry dirt was rock hard. Locked-down construction machines lay strewn about the deep hole, lying silent where theyd last been used.

He was about halfway across when he heard the sound of something snapping. He knew better than to hesitate, and threw himself in a shallow hole immediately nearby. A tremendous noise of falling metal followed, and he felt something crush into the dirt around him.

Pitch darkness fell.

Struggling and turning around in his now-cramped space, he pushed against chill, dirty metal above. He realized, with some panic, that one of the machines had tilted over somehow - and a smooth metal surface had fallen flush with the top of his hole. Hed avoided an instant death, but the machine had sealed him in

He had sudden visions of dying there, trapped under the fallen machine, suffocating in darkness but he knew that it was only Thursday. This wasnt a time-sensitive job. If it had been Friday, nobody would have come by the site all weekend he only had to survive the night, and, surely, somebody would come.

Scraping at the rock hard dirt with his fingernails, he worked at making a hole for air. Bit by bit, he managed to grind out a hole about an inch wide between metal and ground. Breathing in the blessed night air, he resigned himself to a long, dark night spent in boredom.

For a time, he lay there, back to dirt, staring up at the invisible metal a few inches away in darkness. It was close enough that his breath rolled back at him, flowing across his face. His arms felt trapped by the sloped dirt pressing against him from every side. It could have all gone much worse, he thought

A distant rumble rolled through his dark prison.

A car? Had someone else come to the site? He shouted through the small hole for help, but the only answer, a minute later, was another low rumble.

Thunder.

The rains that had held back all week had chosen *this night* to return.

Panic surged through him, and he began tearing at the hole again, scraping at the hard dirt. With each approaching rumble, he grew a little more desperate at the first sounds of falling raindrops, he gritted his teeth against the pain, and forced himself to scrape harder, no matter the cost to his fingers. They burned with fire as his skin scraped further into tissue - and then blood.

The raindrops grew louder.

Screaming with anger and pain, he thrust his arm through the now six-inch hole, pushing through and tearing his shirt sleeves. Fully blanketed in darkness again, he focused his senses on his hand, feeling around for something, anything that might help - and he came upon a smooth, chill roundness.

Pulling it in with several tortured minutes of awkward angling, cursing the entire time, he realized it was a short section of copper tubing about an inch wide. He couldnt guess how it had ended up near his hole, but he was more than thankful for the tool.

Scraping at the hole with the end of the tube, his arms angled painfully in his body-gripping prison, he managed to double the size of the hole to two arm-thicknesses by the time the inevitable surge in sound and humidity came.

Misting drops floated against his face as the rain poured outside, turning the edges of the hole to mud. The mud was a small blessing, he told himself, even as little rivulets of liquid began to flow down through and pool under his back.

He screamed through the hole again, but no response came, and he wasted no time. Chopping at the loosening dirt with his tube, he struggled to widen it enough to escape in time. The warm summer rains pooling around his body had soaked through the back of his pants and jacket, now an inch or two deep.

He was able to dig for only a few more heart-pounding minutes, until he was forced to accept that the foot-deep water was going to reach the top of his enclosure before he could escape. He thought for a minute, his mind racing - and then he let water run through the pipe a bit, blew out the crusted dirt as best he could, and held it up to his mouth.

The rumbling thunder seemed to mock him as the water passed his nose, and he was forced to close his eyes.

Fully under the warm muddy water, breathing through the copper tube, he just sat there for a time, wondering if he was going to die he couldnt survive the entire night breathing through the tube, could he? What if he fell asleep?

He could still feel the thunder vibrating his underwater prison.

One elbow around the tube, his fingers holding his nose, and his eyes held tightly shut, he used his other hand to claw weakly at the muddy underwater hole. It gave ground ever so slowly, promising eventual release - if he didnt panic and drown first.

He breathed slowly through the tube as he dug, calming himself. He just had to stay calm, that was all.

He began to feel a curious draining sensation while he worked. The effort was tremendous, but this was different it tugged at his inner energy somehow.

Adjusting a little bit to shake the feeling off, he felt his nose-holding fingers brush something on his cheek. Bringing his digging hand back at an uncomfortable angle, he poked a slimy squishiness stuck to his face. Confused, he tugged at it, but it came off with much more effort than he expected -

Tightening his eyes further, he went back to digging, struggling to ignore the animal panic screaming in his mind. He knew what it had been, but he couldnt let himself think about it. The terror threatened to overwhelm him at any moment, constantly tugging at his will.

He kept at it, fighting his panic and the curious draining sensation, until he knew he couldnt stand it any longer. Throwing the tube up into the water above to make space, he curled in the mud, and then squeezed upward.

The machine seemed to grip at him, to tear at his clothes and skin, but he let the panic take hold. Forcing himself out at the cost of deep cuts along his back, he tore free - and broke from the water into a tremendous downpour. Lightning flashed as he waded out of the waist-high water and climbed out of the dig site with a shout of relief.

Then, the real grisly work began.

They were under his clothes, covering his limbs and face - dozens of them, maybe even a full hundred. Thick, slimy, pulsing, they filled him with disgust and terror, but he had to do it. Too tired to go any further, he had to sit there in the battering rain - and pick the leeches off, one by one. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A friend recently told me this rather disturbing story.

He used to live in Louisiana, near the Gulf. He was close enough to walk to the beach, something he did often with his friends. They spent many evenings wandering around outside, for the area was rather rural, and danger was far from their minds.

Abandoned farmsteads and rusty old machinery dotted much of the landscape in those parts. Sometimes, theyd dare each other to climb into massive old fuel tanks - usually holding nothing but rainwater in the bottom. Their dares evolved as they found creepier buildings to break into and more wickedly-dangerous machines to fool around with.

Still, nothing came close to their last game, as he told me.

In a swampy area, they found a massive rectangular tank made of rusted metal and designed in a strange style. Gulf breezes rustled the cattails; they were not far from the open water. Slogging up to it that afternoon, he remembered thinking that this tank had a particular aesthetic about it, as if it was made for a different function than fueling

The heavy tank sat maybe four feet deep in the gripping mud; they had to scoop some out to open the circular hatch.

The interior was dark, but their flashlights solved that problem. Inside they found more rusted metal, and what looked like several pipes - and a bench.

Whys there a bench in here? he asked, but his friends only shrugged.

Climbing back out, a little concerned, he followed a series of heavy chains into the water. It looked as if this tank had been brought from somewhere else, and had probably lain here for years. Examining the side of the tank facing the water, he found another, smaller tank attached.

Guys, he called. Come look at this.

They came out and stared at the smaller tank.

Whys a tank need a tank? he asked, but, again, they could only shrug.

One of his friends pulled at a rusty lever with all of his might, grinding it downward.

The whole structure began to shake and belch noxiously. The smaller tank shook as fuel was drawn out. Amazed that the thing still worked, they pushed the lever back up, stopping the process.

The inevitable came soon.

Dare you to get inside while we run it! his friends taunted.

No way! he shouted back. What if its a trash compactor or something? What if I get squished?

Then just scream, and well open it.

He thought about it, but still thought better of it. No way. Make David go.

David acted tough. Fine by me. Im not chicken.

He crawled inside and sealed the circular hatch.

One of the other boys pulled the lever, and they watched the thing shake and belch smoke from the generator at the back.

You ok, David? they shouted.

Im fine, I dont see anything happening, he yelled through the metal, barely audible.

They waited for a few minutes as the shock and interest wore off. It didnt seem like the tank was actually doing anything. When David began to shout that he felt weird, they decided to call it off. They pushed the lever up, the tank went silent, and they went around to open the hatch.

My friend hung back, confused. Hed spotted another lever, and what looked like more complicated rusted-over controls. The tank had come from somewhere else and been discarded here and they *were* near the ocean

Of course, he didnt stop his friends in time. The next few moments have haunted him ever since.

Its a pressure tank! he shouted. For divers -

But his friends were already prying open the hatch. It slammed open incredibly forcefully, knocking the boys down and breaking their arms. A blast of air vented twenty feet out through the opening, filled with red mist and solid gobs.

Subjected to a sudden drop from several atmospheric pressures to one, poor David had ruptured. His organs had been explosively torn right out of his body and flung into the swamp water.

His flesh-trailing spine, his head, and one arm floated together in the water, still intact.

My friend could only stare at Davids last moments. Before his eyes finally went dark, he seemed to silently scream in horror - his mouth agape, his expression terrified and confused - aware of his gruesome injuries for a full ten seconds. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Shelter in the Storm </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-12-17 23:35:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Its been unseasonably warm as of late, so Ive taken to running again.

Today was a bit colder, but I thought nothing of it and then I got caught outside in the sudden chilly rain. It was only five, but the dreary grey had the cast of nightfall about it. The two-mile run back home seemed an insurmountable distance.

The heavy rainfall sluiced down the park shelters wooden roof, making it difficult to see out into the gloom. I sat on one of the shelters benches and stared at my running shoes. I imagined they would get completely soaked through and ruined

There were two options - try to wait out the storm by sitting there in the deepening chill gloom, or run back two miles through soaking icy rain.

Shivering, I decided to wait just a few minutes. Maybe the fall would ebb just enough to make running home a possibility.

The rain mocked me by surging heavily, and lightning flashed somewhere distant. The low rumble of thunder rolled through the curtains of water around me.

Great, I muttered, sullenly looking across the tables and benches at the wall of water on the opposite side of the shelter. Lightning flashed again.

I stood suddenly, the concrete scraping under my shoes. I thought Id seen a dark shape out there in the rain

I suddenly became very aware of the fact that I was alone out in the middle of the park, hidden by the shelter and the rain nobody could tell I was here, and nobody would hear me shout if there was trouble I suddenly wished very much that the shelter had walls, or something to hide behind, but every side was open to the grass.

I crouched behind my table as best I could, waiting. Lightning flashed again.

A silhouette stood behind the thickest rain sliding from the roof; a curving dip of solid water held a wavering shadow behind it. The moments illumination had me crouching lower, staring at the following gloom, and wondering why the hell anyone would just be standing there

The rain swelled further, bringing a constant roar down upon the shelters roof.

I jumped at some unknown prompt, scanning the rain behind me as it billowed up to soak and chill me. I couldnt *see anything*

My terrified gaze jumped forward again - Id lost track of the silhouette. With each lightning flash, I was careful to scan a new section of the pouring waters around me but I couldnt tell where it went. Feeling incredibly vulnerable, I moved to the center of the shelter.

If someone or something was really out there, and came in here, hiding would never work. I jumped high up on the center table, circling, circling, staring out

Rumbling thunder vibrated the table under my feet.

Had I really seen someone out there in the rain? Could it have been a trick of the light?

My breath roiled mist. Tracing it with my eyes, I followed it - out to a barely visible trace of mist rolling down.

Id been wrong about the shelter lacking hiding places. There *was* one place to hide albeit, only with inhuman climbing skills

I bolted down the table without looking up at the rafters.

Behind me, something clattered, and I heard a single heavy breath, almost a hiss.

I hit the wall of water ahead with a terrified leap, enduring the icy body slap with sheer adrenaline. Instantly soaked, I pounded through the muddy grass, running as fast as I could despite my waterlogged clothes and shoes.

Far out in the open, I couldnt help but look back. The shelter sat stark and shadowed in the rain. It didnt look like anything had pursued me out into the grey. Large angular silhouettes lay ahead of me - my suburbs houses - and I made for them as fast as I could.

Of course, now I vaguely understand my mistake. That open, flat, muddy grey felt like nothing and nowhere all at once.

Set against the brightest lightning Id seen yet, the buildings ahead finally leapt out in stark detail.

Terrified, exhausted, freezing - but not daring to scream - I ran back the other way.

The small part of my mind still reasoning suggested something I didnt want to hear - but had to heed. I recognized nothing out in the grey. Fog, driving rain, inexplicable silhouettes - the only thing I knew for certain was the shelter.

I crept up to it, staring through the falling sheets, trying to see if that *thing* was still inside but there was no way to know. I crept through, eyes wide, wary of a sudden attack but I saw nothing. Above, the rafters hung dark and empty.

I walked through, trying not to make a sound, my eyes and ears open, but the lightning and thunder obscured everything. I made it halfway before I broke out into a run again. I found the spot where my shoes had left light scrapes on the concrete - and I exited the shelter through that sides wall of water, emerging back into the endless grey fury.

Thoroughly exhausted, I stumbled for the large silhouettes ahead. I stumbled to my knees in the mud when it became clear they were houses this time - *my* houses, blessed suburbia.

Lightning flashed - and I heard a hissing sigh behind me.

Too tired to run, I could only turn and look.

I could see how Id mistaken it for a person, when all Id seen was a shadow in the water it seemed to have four exposed spines that ran as the support for strangely placed limbs. It moved more like a millipede than a person its forward half rose, the half Id seen in silhouette. Two sets of dozens of tiny, bladed arms ran up its front, moving like a horrific mouth, chittering at me. Did it even *have* eyes?

My soul frozen, my body drained, I did the only thing I could think of.

I pointed back towards the shelter.

Its curiously fleshy insectile torso rotated, pointing back at the shelter. It turned to me once more, chittered, and then moved away into the driving rain - heading back home.

Stunned and numb, I watched it go.

The walk back to my house passed by in a freezing daze.

Id known to point, because Id recognized it. That other place, that Id mistaken for home fleshy, angular edifices crawling like hives they were horrible and soul-wrenching but they werent alien. They werent monsters. The hives had quite clearly grown around buildings that had once been suburban houses.

Was it really that easy? Take the wrong side out in the storm, get lost in the rain, and wander into what? Another reality? Or - the future?

Im back home now, sitting here with a blanket on and a space heater on my feet but I cant seem to shake this cold, despairing feeling </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a great question. I think that it will be a good amount to cover certain publishing and marketing costs, but the main expense will be art. I remember 'Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark' from years ago, and I know that art can take a book from great to legendary. That's what I'm shooting for, and art doesn't come cheap.

Also, I think Kickstarters are something you'll probably see more of in the future, as a focal point for fans to help create the kind of authors they want. I've heard talk of other big names here doing them soon, and Dathan Auerbach did a Kickstarter on this subreddit awhile back for [Penpal](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1153987072/penpal). Lots of people messaged me asking for this 'Kickstarter' thing, I looked it up, and found it rather interesting. His goal was 1500, too, so it seemed like a good number to work with. I don't expect to raise a crazy huge amount like he did, but I do think I can produce an amazing and haunting book with 1500. </TEXT>

I drove, while Caitlin sat in the passenger seat and Chris lounged in the back.

Wed spread out the maps and drawn up a dozen theories. What is it all somehow connected to the river? Or was it *me?* And was I just finding these things, or somehow making them happen? Our first task was to isolate the river variable - and, so, we drove, heading for hills where people often went to hike. Far from our hometown, if anything untoward happened, we would know the river was not part of it.

Id been to the hills often when my family first moved to the area. They were uneven, forested, and full of random cliffs and geographical oddities, but well-marked paths made the popular area safe for hiking. It was Saturday, as well, so we saw more than a few families with small children readying themselves for hikes. The parking lot was crowded with cars, and I wondered if this area could *possibly* hide anything horrible

The moment we hit the trees and the sun disappeared behind heavy canopy, I could feel it.

That way.

Chris sighed. I was hoping you wouldnt say that.

Whats it feel like? Caitlin asked.

I took a moment to listen to the breeze overhead. The leaves moved with rhythm, and dappled sunlight brought uneven warmth through the otherwise cool mid-October air. The logic and feel of the area felt different

I dont think its dangerous, I thought aloud. I think its *strange* but not dangerous.

Awesome, Chris said with a smile, looking around the tangled undergrowth. For once!

We traveled down rapidly curving and branching paths, heading for the unnerving sensation that sang to me from some indeterminate distance. We passed along the top of an abrupt forty-foot cliff, an old waterfall basin. Two little kids waved at us from below while their parents snapped pictures of the surrounding beauty.

Hi! Caitlin called, waving back.

I waved as well, a little concerned. I didnt want to be uncovering horrible things with kids out here but, closer now, I was certain the latent phenomenon in the hills wasnt outright dangerous. The flow of the situation just didnt have the same sharp tenor. It had something else, though something I couldnt quite identify.

There were no blank spots in my awareness here, either. I was confident everything would be fine.

It sat before us, looming away at confusing angles.

*That* isnt dangerous? Chris asked.

It was a cleft in the rock itself, veering away after a short run. The rough, tangled terrain above permitted no other access there was no good way to climb up and see what was inside. The gap radiated a curious and unwelcome sensation, but it had none of the anger, fear, or motivations of other things wed encountered. It just existed.

I thought, for a moment, that I could feel something very bad somewhere in the woods around us. I looked, scanning the shadows and light, but saw nothing.

I shrugged.

Lets go then, Caitlin said, leading the way.

Between the haphazard rock walls, the suns glare seemed brightened. There were no trees overhead, and none could be seen against the edges just stark grey rock, devoid of moss and lichen, and stark blue sky, empty of clouds. We left the mid-October chill behind, and we began sweating profusely from the stillness and heat as we worked our way along the cleft.

The odd sensation that had led me there in the first place now began to grow quite strong. My head felt a little fuzzy - and we came to a split, where the gully separated into two distinctly different paths. To our left, broken rock and narrow walls promised a very difficult journey. To our right, a flat creek-bed offered easy passage.

Lets go right, I decided, just wanting to get out of there. The rocky walls on either side made direct climbing impossible, so we had to follow it out by walking. A few minutes later, we emerged from the clefts exit.

Wait, Chris said, looking back. Isnt this where we went in?

He was right. Wed somehow come back to the original entrance.

Maybe it just looks that way Caitlin guessed.

I saw our old footprints in the soft dirt. No, look - this is the place we entered. But how?

Did we somehow not realize wed turned around? Chris asked.

Caitlin gazed back at the strange cleft. No, I think thats what he sensed. That passage its *wrong* somehow and we ended up exiting where we entered.

I shrugged. Weird. At least we know its not the river now.

Slinging our backpacks down, we set up for staying the night. The park typically closed around sunset, so we werent supposed to be there - but I had the feeling that something bad was approaching, and I wanted to see what it might be. The others agreed - if something evil lurked in the park, night would be the most likely time for it. There would be no one else around but us

I awoke with a start, my back aching from the trees rough bark. The night air was icy - and oddly silent. Something was also *very* wrong an approaching sense of violence and hunger filled me with unease. Wake up!

Chris uncurled, awaking first. When did we fall asleep?

Voices echoed from further up the slope.

Who is it? Caitlin wondered, peering through the trees. Everyones supposed to be gone

Creeping our way through the trees and undergrowth, we approached the clefts entrance. The voices were emanating from further inside it

We watched in confusion and amazement as three people exited the cleft under moonlight, dressed exactly like *us.* The more we stared, the more we realized that they looked and sounded exactly like us, too.

I thought wed never get out the other Chris said, relieved.

The Chris next to me in the bushes grabbed my arm with a horrified expression.

What the hell? Caitlin whispered. Are they *us?*

I remembered the odd sensation Id felt at the split in the gully I had the inexplicable notion that these were the us that went left instead of right

I think so, I whispered back. Lost in the gully all day, only just now getting out?

But *how?* Chris asked. And what now? Are they going to want our lives, or something?

The rising sense of violent hunger in my heart suddenly spiked. *Its here*

What is? Caitlin asked.

As we watched, delicate and nearly invisible fibers fell outward from the trees. They seemed to curl lazily in the air, surrounding the other us and then, suddenly, the fibers snapped back, pulling our doppelgangers toward the tangle. They began screaming in terror, before being pulled up into the leaves.

Silence fell.

What do we do? Chris forced through clenched teeth, his neck strained, his body shaking. Somethings got them!

Thats what it *does*, I realized, my eyes wide. I watched the trees shift as if blown by wind, and I understood. It waits for people to go in there, waits for the natural phenomenon to duplicate them and their doubles come out at night, once everyones gone and then

What? Chris demanded, shaking me. *And then what?*

I think we have to go after them, Caitlin said with a gulp. Theyre us we cant just let this happen!

Its moving away, I breathed, watching the shifting trees. Lets follow it - I think it doesnt know were here. Were not *supposed* to be here

We rushed along whatever cover we could find, trying to keep up with the moving leaves. The still night air gave us very little protection, so we had to keep slowing down rather than risk giving ourselves away. I wanted to remain at a good distance, too, wary of that thing sensing us and opting for a double dinner

It stopped suddenly.

We waited - but it didnt seem to sense us.

We saw a moon-lit spindly silhouette, maybe eight feet wide, move down the tree and into a small cave. A minute or so later, it emerged and clambered back up into the leaves above. The breeze-like shifting moved further on through the woods, the creature - possibly continuing the hunt.

 Come on.

I led the way, sliding down into the cave.

In the humid darkness, the smell was overpowering. It smelled like roadkill, but a thousand times worse Its safe now, I told Chris, and he turned on his flashlight.

That was a mistake. Stunned, he played the light over a long tunnel that ran down into the earth a tunnel lined with bodies in various stages of decay. There were hundreds, maybe even thousands it was impossible to know.

How could this happen without anyone knowing? Chris breathed, fighting the urge to throw up.

Caitlin held a hand to her mouth, tears running down her cheeks. It just takes the doubles at night, once everyones gone nobodys missing, so nobody has a clue

Something moved in the darkness. Chris shot his flashlight over.

Four long, white lumps moved near where wed slid in. They looked like mummies, almost, wrapped up in silky strands from head to toe.

We ran over and began picking at the struggling silk-covered bodies. The material wouldnt give - we grabbed rocks, began cutting at the stuff.

We uncovered a stranger first, the fourth body. He glared at us with wild eyes until we freed his mouth.

Oh God, oh God! he shouted. You have to get me out of here itll come back soon!

Be quiet! I insisted, and he trembled - but stopped shouting.

We hacked away at the silk, uncovering part of his neck. I slowed and stopped my efforts, staring at him with dismay.

What do we do? Caitlin asked, her face contorting with resisted tears.

The stranger looked at each of us, his lips trembling. What is it?

Can you hold on a second? Just a second, friend, I asked him.

He nodded, his worry growing.

I looked over at Caitlin and Chris, and they went to free the other three - the three that I guessed would be our doppelgangers.

Look, friend, I told him, touching his silk-wrapped torso lightly. Youve got a hard decision to make, here.

His teeth chattered once, twice. Hed probably guessed.

Your skin, I continued. Uh your skins missing. Youve got uh, a leg missing, too I think its been eating you.

He gulped, and then shook his head up and down in understanding, sweat pouring from his forehead. The drops glistened darkly in the light cast from Chris nearby flashlight. It stuck me with something and then I felt it chewing, but it didnt hurt I thought maybe Id be fine

I kept his gaze. If we leave you here, are you going to scream?

His lip trembled as he fought to keep from panicking. Probably.

Do you want me to, uh I couldnt finish the sentence.

He shook. Just cut near my missing leg, he said, straining. Itll be fine. Its not your fault. Also -

He told me a name and an address - his daughter's name, and his familys address.

Got it memorized, I told him.

You sure? he asked, crying.

Ive got a good memory.

I began slicing the strands near his missing leg, releasing the wraps pressure. I understood his request almost immediately blood flowed out in a steaming wave, rolling down the caves low incline toward the layered bodies. He shivered and went still.

Did he just die? Caitlin asked, her voice on the verge of panic. Is he *dead?*

Chris froze.

Just hurry I told them, moving to the next wrapped form.

Something skittered near the caves entrance, and we froze but nothing entered.

We freed the heads of our doppelgangers, and they looked at us with no small surprise.

Are you hurt? Caitlin asked, ripping and tearing the threads with her fingers.

Not yet, the other Caitlin replied. Get us out of here!

The other me remained silent, his stony gaze locked on me.

Are you guys *us?* the other Chris asked. Wait, it doesnt matter. Theres this *thing*, it got us -

We saw it, our Chris replied, cutting away at the silk around his doubles shoulders.

Come on! the other Caitlin said, looking at me. Why arent you helping?

I know why, the other me replied, his tone flat. Whats going to happen if they save us? I suspect that cleft created copies of us somehow. I could feel it happening.

I nodded slowly. Who gets our lives?

He nodded slowly. Which group is the original?

I continued his thought. Theres no way to know. Were probably both exactly the same.

Caitlin and Chris both slowed their activities, looking to the two mes.

No! the other Chris begged. Come on, free us, well sort it out later!

You cant do this, the other Caitlin pleaded, looking to me, and then Chris. Well change our names, well hit the road, anything!

What do we do? our Caitlin asked, looking to me.

Chris watched me, horrified, waiting for my decision.

We found a large boulder outside to hide behind - we had to be sure. The creature returned shortly, skittering down the tree and into the cave with what looked like a wrapped-up deer. Had the cleft duplicated the animal, too?

We listened.

The screams began shortly.

They muffled quickly, one by one - likely the creature wrapping them back up.

We took off running into the woods, choking and crying the entire panicked sprint back. We left all of our gear back at the makeshift campsite - there was no way were going back for it.

Im sorry, Caitlin sobbed, falling against the car. I was the one who wanted to play with this, like it was a toy. And now

I didnt respond, too mortified to speak. Somewhere up in the hills, another me was struggling against tight silk wrapped all around him, being slowly eaten, piece by piece and hed known, the moment hed seen me, what choice I would make

Its not just on you, man, Chris told me, crying and snorting back snot. We all agreed. What would our parents say, if another set of us showed up? How would we live? How would we explain any of it?

I could only nod. We were too young to handle such insanity. I had this idea that I would someday return here, someday lure that thing out, and run it over with my goddamn car smash into it, spray its internal liquids across the path, burn its corpse

But I never did go back.

I did find the address the stranger had begged me to visit. I waited near it in my car, quiet and profoundly unhappy. This was by far the worst thing that had ever happened to me, and Id brought it on myself by playing with forces behind my understanding.

I saw a school bus stop by. A little girl leapt off and ran toward her house - greeted by the man Id watched bleed out back in the corpse-filled cave. He was here, oblivious. Hed probably explored that cleft and then left with his family, none the wiser about what would happen to his double later that night

I had the profoundly disturbing fear, then, that such fates could be quite common. How many naturally weird spots led to accidental duplications? How many intelligent creatures would lurk outside such anomalies, feasting on the unwary? There could be a hundred other copies of me out there, even at that moment, suffering and dying in horrific ways and I would never know

	<TEXT> The Bonewalker tale in the Psychosis collection is a different story from the one here, a prequel of sorts.

Also, putting a word file online is much different than creating a full real book with accompanying art, marketing, and publishing. I want to 'cross over', so to speak, from amateur publishing, toward being as professional as I possibly can. Kickstarter is a focal point of fan attention and direction that I feel can literally 'kick start' this process. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A big thank you, and an announcement: a Kickstarter for Psychosis   The Asylum series (Eating Disorder, The Scholarship, etc...). I call it: "Entity" </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey there, /r/nosleep. Lately I've had an overwhelming number of requests to expand on and publish some stories that have gripped people's imaginations. It all began with [Psychosis](http://www.creepypasta.com/psychosis) - a classic CreepyPasta I wrote a few years ago that has since spread across the internet - and then continued here, on NoSleep, with 'The Asylum' series:

[Eating Disorder](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ty8f/eating_disorder/)

[The Bonewalker](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13w6xo/the_bonewalker/)

[The Scholarship](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/13ydz7/the_scholarship/)

[The Friend Zone](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/140rgb/the_friend_zone/)

[The Escape](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/142ivo/the_escape/)

[The Truth](http://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/144eqc/the_truth/)

I'd like to answer your requests to expand and publish these stories. I aim to create a full book and eBook, and finally bring a conclusion to the tale. I'm especially interested in commissioning visuals to go along with the horrible images involved in the stories. These goals are what the Kickstarter is for.

There's a unique reward for top donations, as well. I will write a custom novella just for you, based on any genre, idea, or even just a basic notion. If it's ever scared you, I'll make it real.

[The Kickstarter for "Entity"](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mattdymerskiauthor/entity)

That reward is made possible because I'm not stopping here. My personal aim is to keep writing horror full-time. If successful, this would be the last major step, and I'd owe deep credit to all of you and this addictive forum.

If you don't know me, I've been writing horror for years, first on the original CreepyPasta site, and now on NoSleep. This has resulted in a few [compilations of short stories](http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dymerski/e/B00A82LSW4/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1) and a recent [blog](http://mattdymerski.com/) to follow my releases. I'm quite serious about pursuing writing as a full-time career, and I appreciate any support you can give. In return, I'll give you all the scares I can muster.

Thanks for all your interest and support. Whatever happens, I'll still be submitting here at my favorite forum :)

	<TEXT> Yep, I've actually been [aiming for that](http://www.amazon.com/Matt-Dymerski/e/B00A82LSW4/ref=ntt_athr_dp_pel_1) for a little bit. So far, these are just compilations of stories, but I hope to expand some of these into a full book soon. I'm trying to figure out the line between cool and crass with self-promotion. How exactly does one go from employed drone to full-time horror author? We'll see. </TEXT>

A sniper bullet resounds across the water, and Tracy Jordan slips beneath the waves.

"That's a wrap!" someone yells, and the characters look around, confused.

"Hah!" Tracy Morgan yells, holding up the fake bullet, and a sound tech hurries him off of the unexplained stage. </TEXT>
