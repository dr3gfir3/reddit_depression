And then he's like awkward and apologetic. I mean that whole scene from start to finish is straight up awesome. Just thank you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! Your unique question really did provide the perfect opportunity to tell this story! 

Oh, here's a cool one. So, my son is 8 years old at the time. We are walking in Harvard Square and I see Michio Kaku approaching us. He's engrossed in conversation. While out of earshot I quietly tell my son who is approaching. Well, my son then says, "What?" just as Michio enters our earspace...Michio looks up briefly, and I maintain eye contact and say, "that's Michio Maku," and received a warm smile. That was a pretty cool shared moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Awesome. I was 16, working as a cashier in a convenience store and he walked in, perused the magazines, purchased a bottled water and said, "nice tunes". I was playing my Aerosmiths Greatest Hits tape. I said thanks. I had no idea who he was until after he exited, at which time my co-worker brother brought me up to speed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude, get to the gym (raise endorphins), and get evaluated for an anti depressant (raise serotonin). You're maybe a bit agoraphobic, coupled with the added anxiety of socially "catching up". And all this at an age where you tend to have peak anxieties like these. Especially as a guy.

	<TEXT> Definitely take some time off. Go to a psychologist and get diagnosed for depression, and then uni will approve a medical leave of absence. Get on an anti depressant. Go to the gym. Get a job as a bar back. Play in a band. Do all of these things. Return to school, or don't. You Mom has an old school view of education. Without joy and focus it's a waste.

Later that week I happened upon Steven Segal, throwing beads from a balcony. I said hello and he tossed a few our way.

	<TEXT> True. I used the reply by ratspeels above and built my response off of it. 

This Trump-getting-elected thing has really opened my eyes to the fact that a significant portion of society is lacking fact checking skills. And, moreover, a significant portion of society is administering disinfo and misinfo onto these uninformed people with relative ease. So, yeah, I'm trying to wage rebuttals in the face of these unfounded claims and assertions-stated-as-facts. This DARPA thing is particularly distressing. Peaceful, unarmed water protectors getting their asses kicked while the majority of the world dismisses them. They need popular opinion behind them if they are ever going to have even a chance against the dark forces being levied against them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi. I'm posting the above link here in hopes that those in the know here will offer a line-item counterpoint. 

I've been following DAPL very closely, but only recently - beginning with watching the live streaming of the horrifying night of water cannons; since then, I've been tuning in daily to each stream and have been slowly (finally) seeing this story cross the line into mainstream media. 

I'll add that the longer it has taken major media to acknowledge the brutality against the water protestors on that evening, the more outraged I have become. 

Thus far, I have seen credible journalism presented as either protestor-positive or protestor-neutral. I have seen op eds on both sides. And on the non-credible side, I have seen shady pseudo-media sites (reminiscent of the stuff we saw that helped trump get elected) post extremely hateful pieces on the water protectors. 

So, now onto the link above. Orlando Sentinel. That's a credible newspaper, and the author is arguing that we are not getting the complete picture, and it is presenting a data filled argument to back up its claims. I am really hoping someone with a deeper knowledge of this topic can help me get to the truth: are there two sides? 

Either way, the treatment of the water protectors is inexcusable. I will not dismiss one iota of what I've seen. However, if there has been credible outreach by the architects of this pipeline to the community at large, I want to know. And of course if there hasn't, and this article is bs, I want to know. What I don't want to do is ignore this article because - unlike the crap spewed forth by, say, a shady Facebook page called Netizens for Progress - this above article is 'news', and now needs to be scrutinized.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, the amnesia is tragic. I'm convinced that there exists a happy medium in some people's brains, wherein they can still access visualization capabilities in a fully awakened state (sans psychotic break). Emphasis "see" meaning in mind's eye, versus hallucinate. As an example, my wife, an engineer and aspiring astrophysicist, can "see" math formulas. And my friend - an architect and artist - can "see" what he is sketching.

I am hopeful that there just might be an artist here in the nootropic community that uses noots in order to access their creative potential.  </TEXT>

You're right, it's hard to qualify a descriptor like "complex" in this context. Do you recall dreams? If so, can you relate to how real and vivid your dreams are? If so, this might be an apt way to convey the level of complexity...it's every bit as real as the images your brain conjures in a dream.  </TEXT>

By contrast, I can write. My "gift", if you will, seems to be audio...I hear what I think. I can see words, and hear music, too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will continue to try. It is so far impossible for me to get back into that quiet, relaxed mental state. I can sometimes get a few visuals just prior to falling asleep, but nothing like the first 45 seconds of waking up. It's as fascinating as it is frustrating. The most amazing stuff is in the beginning, and then the ability degrades into eventual chaos, and then nothing. I can only surmise that this imagery is the remaining neurochemical elixir that permits the visual component of dreaming, eroding as it is being flushed out.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Each morning I awaken to 45 or so seconds of what is, for me, an exquisite ability to render images in my mind. I can only imagine that this is the ability that permits an artist to create. 

As my state of mind becomes more alert, for lack of a better term, the ability scatters, and my inner thoughtscape becomes dimensionless. In its place, thoughts consists of my inner monologue and, usually, repetitive music (ear worm). 

I am forever searching Google for a new way to facilitate this capability into my fully awakened state, and so far to no avail. Can anyone shed light onto what neural chemistry permits this skill, and how I might attain it?

* Update / Reply: Thank you. It's great to wake up to helpful Reddit feedback. As to the one reply that asked for a link to an example of an image: in this brief interval, it can be any image. I'm aware and in control. So, numbers, lines, pictures; it is particularly fun to morph animated objects into one another, a style portrayed by, say, Bill Plympton.  </TEXT>

Many think that the patented "Longvida Circubrain" crosses the blood brain barrier and effects cognitive enhancement; I have no idea if it actually does. I do, however, assert that my experience with this product has been positive. 

I have yet to find a "cure all" for the issues you describe, but hope that turmeric might be considered as you build your stack. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with those that suggest you see a physician. 

At 40, did you introduce anything new to your existing nootropic / supplement regimen? I know my feedback is purely anecdotal, but Adderall gave me major fog between doses, L-Theanine wipes me out, fish oil makes me depressed, and multi vitamins make me tongue tied...and, yes, all of this is weird, but suffice to say if you started anything new at onset of your issues, I hope you've experimented with removing them in order to eliminate variables.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whoa, easy there fella. Happily married guy here, who can relate to some of your youthful folly, with some advice: learn the word NEXT. You're getting stuck. (Glad you now see it as a TIFU, but still feel compelled to drive this point home, because remnants of your dramatic state of mind appear to still be vying for control over you, and that worries me.)

People converge, run parallel, and diverge. Life is long. Go with the flow, and that means knocking off all that introspective angst.  

Good luck fighting the good fight, my friend. This round is "man versus himself". And it's about loving yourself, and learning to have some fun with yourself, socially, and taking things with the ladies lightly. Otherwise, you are smart and studious: you almost have your shit together, which is awesome :)

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm just copy / pasting my Craigslist "Wanted" here in case one of my fellow redditirs can help. Thanks! 

Wanted: boat rental, Newfound Lake (Newfound Lake)
9 Mayhew
(google map)

I'm on the lake through August 3. I have a FL boater license which is reciprocal with NH, and own a 44' in FL, and have owned a small boat and personal watercraft in the past. Looking for a boat and a tube to take my son and nephew out on, and hoping someone on the lake might have one available to rent. Our house rental has a dock and a mooring buoy. I'd rent a couple of fenders, too, if available. </TEXT>

I didn't post a rant about smokers walking down a city street, or outside of buildings, or with their windows down at red lights, or with their other hand pushing a stroller. Nope.

	<TEXT> Well, the first thing I do is identify why I am so mad. Mad is a primal drive. Forcing the more evolved part of my brain to participate, by asking "why" intellecualizes it, helps me to disengage from the rage. 

For me, "why" is not, say, "because he stole my money", but rather, "why am I freaking out?!?" Generally the basis for my anger is that I am either hurt or afraid. How to position myself to be ok again then becomes my replacement energy. Evolved me solves problems. Primal me just makes noise. Cooler heads prevail. 

It feels absolutely amazing to convert rage into cool and sharp thinking. It is empowering. Quick example: she cheated on me! Instant rage. 

Scenario One: Punch wall, flip couch, go out drinking all night, talk shit "f that bitch", start smoking again, blah-blah-blah-insert-cliche-behavior. Solves nothing. 

Scenario Two: Calm down. I am just hurt and scared....Why? We had a plan. It's hard to change that plan. We have a lease. A dog. Common friends. I am embarrassed....How can I fix? I can either forgive her and request counseling or this is a long overdue wake up call. I think this is a wake up call. She has lied to me before. I am going to leave this apartment now, go to my best friend's place, and start looking for a room mate. People are betrayed all the time and somehow they survive. I will. 

I don't know how old you are, or your situation. And I don't need to know. These tactics are universal. They will be helpful to you. "It's not how you act. It's how you react." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The mind is wild, isn't it? We are all wired so differently. Two people smoke pot: one hyper focuses, the other can't spell her name. For some of us, a job is therapeutic. For others, a jail sentence. Last night, I was reading that 2% of us cannot see images in our mind. 

For people with ADHD (and who are struggling as a result of it), it is ultra important to seek therapeutic guidance in order to stay on task and on track. The problem is that to the person with ADHD this often seems counter-intuitive, a phenom that manifests as ODD (oppositional defiance disorder). This might be the paranoia you see in your friend. For someone else, it might be lashing out at a teacher, a school, or "the system". 

ODD is what I hope OP will avoid. Life is too short. We will all take a lot of shit along the way, and some ADHD people - especially ambitious ones - can be damaged very easily without proper guidance. Others can avoid stress and mute symptoms. Still more can - with help and extra effort - become doctors, lawyers, CEOs, et al.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That depends. Does your career and / or do your passions and goals play to your strengths? If, say, you function well in quiet environments, and you work in a library, then it is likely in this context to be of minimal impact. 

ADHD, like many disorders, is exacerbated under stress. Unfortunately there is no cure for ADHD - only treatment - and treatment is only partial and, moreover, comes with side effects. This is not an argument against treatment, however. Exercise is your first and best option. It may not be enough, and if not then see a psychopharmacologist, and see if therapy and pills are helpful. Be mindful of any advice given, and follow their instructions to the letter. 

As with anything, you will need to give any treatment time...say, six months, in order to evaluate efficacy. That includes exercise. So, start with evaluating whether the challenges of your life aspirations jive with your innate strengths or weaknesses and, if to your weaknesses, then start treating your ADHD.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not even a passing thought. Just as I don't wonder at the slightest possibility of Zeus striking me down with a lightning bolt. But, lol, if we are just referring to the visceral reaction that you had, I'll bite: I would never want to have to sit up there....I picture AM talk radio, 'comfort' food, slow internet and fat people. It would be like thanksgiving with the in-laws, without the option of leaving or suicide.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You smell like asparagus. What did you have for dinner? 

Me, 14 years old. Dad, driving. My date had just gotten into the back seat, and that was my greeting. Dad later told me that he nearly lost it (trying to stifle his laughter). In recounting the story to Mom, he had tears rolling down his cheeks. </TEXT>
