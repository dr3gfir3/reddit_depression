	<TEXT> He bent a knee. He made peace, he offered an alliance and to praise trump going forward. 

He refused to grovel on the ground, that's true. He stood by some principles. But after deriding trump and then offering to work for him and praise him? He bent his knee.

On Trumps end Romney presented to much of a risk, maybe if Romney grovelled maybe Trump would have been assuaged... or maybe not. Trump was worried about a man with his own powerbase, principles (by political norms) and country first attitude.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> what? Hitler constantly fired generals for retreating or suggesting retreats. Personally ordered army groups around, and disregarded advice from any general he disliked. His greatest disasters (and some successes) came as the result of disregarding military advice. He held absolute power. People were relieved of army groups for suggesting tactical retreat.

Hitler was, first and foremost, determined to command personally. According to his so-called Leader Principle (Fhrerprinzip), ultimate authority rested with him and extended downward. At each level, the superior was to give the orders, the subordinates to follow them to the letter. In practice the command relationships were more subtle and complex, especially at the lower levels, but Hitler did have the final say on any subject in which he took a direct interest, including the details of military operations, that is, the actual direction of armies in the field.

Moreover, as time went on he took over positions that gave him ever more direct control. From leader (Fhrer) of the German state in 1934, he went on to become commander-in-chief of the armed forces in 1938, then commander-in-chief of the army in 1941. Hitler wanted to be the Feldherr, the generalissimo, exercising direct control of the armies himself, in much the same sense that Wellington commanded at Waterloo, albeit at a distance. http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/hitler_commander_01.shtml

	<TEXT> He was not bad, he just didn't understand people. A president needs to lead a nation of people, not numbers. Economic principles like free markets, laws like criminal law, science breakthroughs etc. are tools in the service of our society... not ends in and of themselves... 

I say this as someone who believes that our nation was founded on principles of rule of law, empirical thought, advancement of science and man, and ideas of dignity, self-determination and freedom. Our founding fathers were enlightenment inspired humanists. 

Romney and many modern day republicans in an obsession with supply-side economics, free markets, unrestrained capitalism did not seem to get that this wasn't the goal itself. Market efficiency is irrelevant if that means a couple of guys own the country and the rest are little better than slaves. It was not clear the Romney saw the human side of the job. He would have been a solid administrator though and he is an unpretentious leader. He really wanted what was best for America. 

Trump... well inhuman is the best way to describe him, incompetent administrator, petty to the core and invested in his own ego.  </TEXT>

Briefings are hard. It's complex info and not predigested by the media or info wars. Sometimes it's info that you have to file away. It's sometimes self contradictory. It does not work with the fact trump is an intellectual lightweight and has no patience for learning. They are about groups he never heard of in places he can't find on a map with geopolitical forces at play he does not understand and realities he does not want to accept. 

He likes making snap judgements on actionable easy to digest info on topics he understands. He is not interested in heavy cognitive lifting and making weighted difficult decisions with expert input...

Trump thinks he is smarter than everyone, that he can intuit complex policy decisions using easy predigested info...

Their government still has substantial cash on hand and individual Chinese have significant savings. It will be painful when the market corrupts and possibly politically destabilizing inside China. 

But, why then is Trump giving them an external threat to unite against, and further stoke nascent Chinese imperialism and militarism? 

China did communism, then replaced it with westward facing communism after the sino-soviet split/ cultural revolution, and then consumer capitalism + authoritarianism after Tiananmen, now in the latest round of unrest they are building a nationalist military narrative... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you read accounts? Stalingrad was bypassed, the German troops were freezing, starving, out of food, and ammunition. There was no armor left. The airlift was a failure and by then the Germans had not the planes or airfields or fuel to continue... and by then they had lost all airfields in Stalingrad. The northern pocket held out a bit longer but surrendered when the Soviets just pointed artillery and tanks point blank at building by building.

Paulus was likely not even the one who initiated the negotiations. Hitler in his inability to fathom tactical retreats doomed Germans soldiers all over the eastern front and ultimately hastened the end of the war...  100k starving, frostbitten, unarmed, immobile troops are not going to carry on any measurable fight. It's ironic because the encircle, bypass, mop up pattern was learned by the soviets from the Germans in their early reversals in the war.

Ultimately, hitlers incompetence was a good thing for everyone but the nazis so no complaints... Auchwitz was liberated that much earlier, it meant the allies could open new fronts, Hitler lost his window for Moscow or southern Russian oil... Stalingrad was a failure, the most visible and costly example of Hitler's own blind spots and weaknesses.

edit: Also there was no honor in fighting for Germany and there was no integrity in that nation...

it was run by a pack of murderous ideologues on pharmaceutical grade meth and synthetic opiates who wanted to hold as much territory so they could murder more Jews and Slaves and loot more material and treasure. 

You know how we say country before party? there is a humanity before country clause above that. If your country is engaged in the inhuman sometimes it is honourable to lay down one's arms.

Post Tieneman square the agreement of the government and the people was no democratic reforms but we will give you economic growth and material wealth. If growth stalls... you get unrest.

But if Trump wants to dig up old nationalist tropes in China like challenging one China then he is handing the Chinese leadership a nationalist rallying cry. And China can weather a trade war better than we can owing to smaller deficits and large cash reserves, while blaming hardship on US belligerence.

An let's not forget why one China policy exists, until 1970s we only recognized Taiwan as China. China was in a civil war, the nationalists retreated to Taiwan, as recognized them as then official government as did the UN for decades. Communist China is still sore about that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Paulus surrendered at Stalingrad because the Russians were about to outright annilihate them. 

Stalingrad should have been bypassed to begin with and then evacuated or broken out of when things got bad. It was held because it was named after Stalin and Hitler could not cope with losing any territorial gains even transiently. 

So yes, Paulus saved his own skin but his command staff facilitated the surrender and whether they fought and died made no difference by the time they surrendered.

Thankfully for the allies and humanity, aside from some luck earlier in the war, Hitler's mistrust of others and arrogance coupled his being a rather amateur tacticition and strategist meant he ultimately handicapped the German efforts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Green house gasses do not fundamentally alter the physics governing earths weather. The equator remains hot because of its position relative to the sun, seasons still happen because of the earth's tilt.

Green house gasses do trap heat, and this has disperate effects. Now some of these effects because of long term shifts in weather and global temperatures, but the rate is much faster than anything we have seen before and seems to correlate with man made changes to the amount of green house gas in the environment.

As things heat up the equatorial regions dry out, wetter regions get wetter until global warming disrupts things like the Gulf Stream and then places in Europe will get colder and drier... other currents and weather patterns might mean similiar disruptions and then you might have some places change their character from wet to dry or cold to warm or the reverse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the problem is Hitler is a loaded topic, I think if you substitute someone like Mussolini it is an easier discussion to evaluate the perils of trum leadership. 

Furthermore, there is Hitler in the 1920s (building power base), the 1930s(consolidating power) and 1940s (WWII and fall). Comparisons fail because people see WWII Hitler not beer hall putch or nurenburg rallies hitler and miss the point. 

Finally, history rhymes but never repeats. Trump's current position is clearly distinct from Hitler or Mussolini, the country is in a different place with different power structures and demographic.

However, trumps rallies, the blind fanatacism of his followers, the corporatist and military cabinet he is assembling, his direct to the people propoganda, attack on news media, use of racial and geographic fault lines, willingness to outright lie, and cult of personality are all concerning. 

The ties with Russia, Russian interference in US politics, and Russian propaganda are not far from Stalins power plays pre WWII. Stalin was pushing communism, Putin Russian imperial greatness.

Furthermore, the discontent, fear, divisiveness, racial tensions etc. all have echoes of 1920s Europe. I think Mussolini is probably not a terrible comparison, he wanted to restore Italy to greatness, rose to power on popular support, suppressed the media, flamboyant cult of personality etc...

In the end Trump is scary because of the echoes of past badness, and not that I see internment camps in the future, or WWIII, but it is important to remember that neither did many in interwar Europe. It is too easy to declare "peace in our time". 

We can assuage our fears with the fact that he has no dogmatic or ideological vision... but we do not know that for certain, at least he has not shared it with us. Also, the people around him definitely do have visions (Pence, Bannon, Flynn) that are scary. 

We can assuage our fears by placing trusts in insitutions, but the bicameral republican control of congress, and their unwillingness to meaningfully challenge Trump or the Hastert rule is not reassuring. The supreme court might soon be stacked with trump appointees rubber stamped by a cowed congress. 

We can say the military will never turn on its own, but the military rank and file was strongly pro trump. Also trump has surrounded himself with respected military men. 

We can that the US presidency on its own is weak, but expanded executive power in the modern presidency, the precedent of war without congressional consent,  and the need for courts and congress to check his power mean trump could do much damage before he can be stopped.

We can say the media will not let the public sit quiet, but trump bypasses the media, has an alternative media in infowars and bretibart. People do not listen to mainstream media but hyperfocused fragmented media sources. 

Furthermore, the media is pared down, local media is decimated, investigative reporting budgets are gone and there are half the reporters of yesteryear; Discussion panels and opinion pieces replaced investigative reporting because it is cheaper. False equivalence reigns. Post Iraq war, the media never recovered their authority.

And look at the alt right, recruiting among disaffected blue collar former middle-class whites, getting rid of silly robes, and buzz cuts for suits and (slightly less ridiculous than shaved heads) metrosexual fashy haircuts. Go over to r/the_donald, the fanatacism is unreal. It is like they are trying on brownshits over there. I think Orwell best captured the appeal of facism to the young and disaffected in his review of mein kempf.

All three of the great dictators [Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin] have enhanced their power by imposing intolerable burdens on their peoples. Whereas Socialism, and even capitalism in a more grudging way, have said to people I offer you a good time, Hitler has said to them I offer you struggle, danger and death, and as a result a whole nation flings itself at his feet. Perhaps later on they will get sick of it and change their minds, as at the end of the last war. After a few years of slaughter and starvation Greatest happiness of the greatest number is a good slogan, but at this moment Better an end with horror than a horror without end is a winner. Now that we are fighting against the man who coined it, we ought not to underrate its emotional appeal.

Trump is not like anything we have seen before, and we used up our rhtoric with hyperbole about past administrations we disagreed with.  We must find a language to discuss the threat and dangers of a trump adminsitration to the future direction of our nation and the material and social well being of all of its citizens. 

America is in a most precipitous situation and the forces of reason, science and modernity have been decimated and barely have the tools to even begin to mount a defense. 

The very enlightenment principles of our founding father are at risk, the invective against blending church and state,  governance based in rational and empirical thought, the rule of law, advancement of science are under attack like nothing seen before (maybe Andrew Jackson but he was different, or since the South seceded).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's partially because facebook uses your clicks and likes to curate your feed, the less you engage it the less it knows what to do and the more prone it is to respond to a random click and skew the feed to further irrelevance... engaged people who spend too much time on facebook (my theory is that it's often people with low self esteem who are already unhappy) get a viscous feedback loop of facebook serving up more and more of what they want... makes them feel even less happy (everyone else looks happy, my ex is dating someone better than me,outrage over other people posts etc.) and click more. It's even more insidious than South Park member berries because it serving up real time content. 

If you don't engage it it tries to draw you back in with auto updates on random people or their posts... it's like a drug dealer, trying to get you to have just one more hit to get you to relapse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Brifiengs are hard. It's complex info and not predigested by the media or info wars. Sometimes it's info that you have to file away. It's sometimes self contradictory. It does not work with the fact trump is an intellectual lightweight and has no patience for kearning. They are about groups he never heard of in places he can't find on a map with geopolitical forces at play he does not understand and realities he does not want to accept. 

He likes making snap judgements on actionable easy to digest info on topics he understands. He is not interested in heavy cognitive lifting and making weighted difficult decisions with expert input...

Just like his voter base. They also went by what felt right and did not want to do a heavy lift when it came to voting their interests. 

We see this in r/conspiracy and r/the_donald where liberated free thinkers clang their way to conclusions by making rapid intuitive connections (no matter how tenuous) on predigested sources of dubious provenance that fit their preconceived conclusion iften planted by someone else. They don't want to actually do leg work and sift through documents, read advanced expert opinion, etc (real research) but rather "research" aka flop through 4chan, read blog posts, google random info about people and things that don't like and then cherry pick info from sites they like with no critical scrutiny, to make ultimately ridiculous conclusions.

Trump thinks he is smarter than everyone, that he can intuit complex policy decisions using easy predigested info... basically the richer version of r/conspiracy is going to be president... </TEXT>

Also read the room and let Bernie have a go? There is no evidence Bernie would have won. But honestly the dems made 3 related mistakes:

* 1) believed that americans would find trump so distasteful as a person they would not vote for him. 
* 2) did not make a case to blue collar fly over country voters why the democrats benefit specifically them
* 3) believed the polls showed them winning and focused on pushing other democraic agendas, getting away from the economy.

In debates Hilary needed to agresssively go after trump on jobs, challenge his knowledge and understanding of policy, pull him into the policy weeds... instead she just went after his character.

Turns out Americans heard Trump's impossible promises at every stop... to back space industry in Florida, coal in Appalachia, shipyards etc. etc.

But people were apathetic too, upset Bernie fans needed to fall in line, 3rd party voters needed to sense the stakes of the election, liberals needed to drag friends to polls, young people needed to be more aggressively recruited. Somehow, people did not appreciate the imminent danger and the stakes of this election. 

So sorry, but Bernie was no saint and savior, and we are now in a massive hole. Time to get off the smug what if wagon and get to explaining to voters in states with senate races in 2 years why dems will help them, and time to groom talent for 4 years from now that can recruit America. 

Also, Biden was the best candidate. My turn-isms greatest victim.  </TEXT>

*edit: Some more thoughts*

Yes, the caricature of basement dwelling dudes marrying their pillows is a gross mischaracterization of a nation. But rigid conservative social norms, high work stress, stagnant economy, lag of living space, high cost of living all contribute to a maladaptive patterns among young Japanese that portend undesirable social and economic trends. It is important for the West to note this because some these trends are developing in the West, more in Europe than the US, but among urban educated Americans too. 

In America, I think it is important for us to ask ourselves if the current income disparity, long work hours, digital distractions, consumer culture etc. are really a healthy and sustainable path forward. These are the hidden costs of underemployment, lack of a safety net, inadequate social services, inadequate minimum wage etc. 

In Europe the equation is different, Germany has tons of social services but they still have an anemic birth rate. One must question if western consumer culture is a possible effect. Regardless, in America the maladaptive patten might be more out of wedlock kids raised in single income  households etc...

Regardless, current realities means people in America don't have the time or money for healthy social relationships, dignified life, healthy living etc. If we raised the minimum wage, single payer healthcare, increased worker protections... people would have healthier relationships, better mental health, healthier lifestyles, and also would help the economy because they would spend money on dinners out, movies, clothes, things for their children, etc... more enterapaneurs because starting a company no longer risks no heath insurance etc...

Japan did the opposite, economy stagnated, they doubled down on corporate culture, long hours, etc. Its not working out for them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Ivankas own business is tiny. Trump said she will run his along with his other children.

2) What else is the prime minister of Japan going to say? His staff did complain about the decorum and handling of the meeting.

3) No one was worried about trump being offensive to the Pakistani PM, it was the opposite.

4) Duterte has authorized murder, just as long as people claim drugs are involved. Also, he is going to sell his country out to China.

5) Taiwan is nothing like Crimea. Think of it as a civil war that never ended, The Taiwanese government used to run China and Taiwan is what is left. Until China's rehabilitation in the 70s, the US considered Taiwan as the one true China. Now it's the reverse. The status quo won't change, but it's a historical/ geopolitical reality in diplomatic relations.

Crimea, also a historically sensitive and complicated reality is different because Ukraine is a sovereign independent nation internationally recognized and Russia grabbed a piece of it because it thought it was entitled to it and and didn't like Ukraines pro west stance, particularly economically because Russia regards it as in its sphere of influence.

China also claims a sphere of influence, the 9 dash policy outlining their claims to the South China Sea outside of any international treaties and norms. The US and regional players have agressively opposed this, sending military vessels and aircraft through the area and arming nations in the area. Duterte, who hates America and is upset that they criticized his murder spree want to buddy up to China and give up the Philippines are the sea to china.

The thing is, trump is likely ignorant to all of these realities. He is just improving along like he always does.

Operating as POETUS requires nuance, subtly, deftness and a good team and listening to experts. Trump is not really doing those things. As for American leaders being trampled that's a fox new talking point. Also, teddy had some good advice that Obama seems to be following. Talk softly and carry a big stick.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wasn't that a rallying cry against Clinton? That this was nepotism, Chelsea was being groomed to take over the world, that Hilary was a veritable real life modern day cerci Lannister. Instead trump is merging his personal bussiness and family with the office before he is even sworn in. 

People called Hilary a hawk but he wants Flynn to be the national security advisor, and anti islamist aggressive hawk. 

Clean up Washington? Get rid of wall street croneys? Hire senators and billionaires and a Goldman Sachs and Hollywood affiliated financier to run the treasury.

It's like a joke, trump voters voted for trump for reasons exactly the opposite of what he is going to do. It would be funny if it wasn't so tragic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, polar space launch because aside from the difficulty of handling launch equipment under those conditions it also the least favorable launch location owing to very little assist from earth rotation...

...so you claim the rich are escaping earth from a site where current launch apparatus cannot function, where it's hard to deliver fuel and supplies, where any launch would need tons of fuel because of the unfavorable latitude, to a destination that does not exist because we have not yet developed the technology for long term space inhabitance or interplanetary transit without massive health effects. 

Going to label this one as plausible. 

Edit: before anyone mentions nuke subs with ballistic launches from under ice in arctic, those are small payloads without achieving escape velocity, launched from subs that show up fueled, ready and with climate control on board. A bit different from erecting a man rated launch system in sub zero weather, amid blizzards. Also it's not like the scientists at Amundsen Scott who are largely liberal geogolgists and meteorologist wouldn't notice large scale military proceedings or the scientists and tourists studying penguins and plankton wouldn't notice either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might believe that some in the Vatican leadership are atheists, from where they stand it's got to to be evident to at least some that god does not guide their decisions, or at least agnostic. I doubt they go the satanic ritual route... that seems contrived.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it's complicated. We sell them arms and have a mutual defence agreement. We maintain their right to be an independent entity. But we agreed with China that we recognize one China, the PRC. 

China is hypocritical on this count too. There are direct flights to Taiwan, business and trade goes on as well. 
However, china sees the nearest islands to its coast as a) their territory b) integral to their defense. And so officially they want Taiwan not be recognized as a separate country for geopolitical and saving face reasons.

They being a large trading partner and nuclear power we humor them because the last time things got heated we deployed 2 carried groups to the region, including one full carrier group and all the escorts transiting the Taiwan straight. Do you know which party was in charge of Taiwan, and under whose leadership they were during that cluster? It was the current leaders father and the same party that just came to power.

This diplomatic spat hampered US-Chinese cooperation and relations for a decade. 

With tensions in the South China Sea and Sea of Japan already high, with North Korea  being itself and the South Koreans in political turmoil, now is not the time to rock the boat diplomatically on the Asia pacific. 

Chinese papers are spinning this as taiwans fault and also getting in jabs at trump as incompetent but things could go worse. 

He already has messed up a call from Pakistan, breached etiquette in his meeting with Japan, involved his children who are to manage his money on calls with foreign leaders, praised duterte's campaign of extrajudicial murder, etc...

It's amateur hour at trump tower. Unfortunately, he is playing big league pro poker with all of our lives, money and reputation at stake. </TEXT>
