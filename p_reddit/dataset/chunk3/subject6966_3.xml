	<TEXT> I thing that most people is fed up with the war in Syria. But there is no civil society in Syria that can push for peace. This civil society was developed in a formally free and democratic Colombia, despite the violence and the oligarchs, but in Syria we just have very fragmented Local Councils in rebel territory and rogue jihadist kidnapping activists, and in government control extremely large nets of security services protecting a dinastic military rule by taking control of almost all political manifestation, and brutally trumping the opposition that escapes its watch. There is no direct comparison between the two countries, at least not in a general level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I know, the *guerrilla* never achieved semi-conventional military capabilities similar to the ones of the government, neither the same level of consolidated territorial control. That alone changes the forms that peace deals will take, with Syrian rebels in better position to make demands and bargain with truces and projects to build actual popular support. Plus the Colombian government is, more or less, a functional democracy, more flexible than Baathist Syria when it comes to negotiations and is seen as less toxic. International backers will have a lot more to say in Syria, as the government and rebels are hardliners and have to be "handhelded" through negotiations. </TEXT>
