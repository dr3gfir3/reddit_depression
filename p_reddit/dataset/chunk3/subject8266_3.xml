	<TEXT> I went through a phase after GWB election where I only read pop political science books and some Noam Chomsky. That lasted until I started reading into efforts by the right to curb voting rights (gerrymandering, voter ID, shutting down polling locations, shortening early voting dates, etc.,) and went back to fiction. Took until I was out of grad school, but since 2009 I've been finishing 75-100 books year </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man I loved that book, but I was a big fan of the era when I read it. Love Allen Ginsberg, too, the aesthetic of the group. I was in a real snobbish phase of my life. I would sit in my kitchen, no AC of course, Miles on the CD player, smoking cigarettes, drinking coffee in my underwear, my girlfriend naked and asleep on the couch under a thin sheet...and still I was jealous of the life in that book. The only thing I was missing was the aimless driving. Loved when they were in Mexico and they're driving through the jungle or something, and it's going super slow, and he's just laying down on top of the car watching the stars...that happened yes? Anyway, definitive of an era, evocative writing, interesting style. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read 7, listened to 8, so I did much better than I anticipated, but there's still today and tomorrow, and I think I might be able to finish that paperback soon enough...  
Worst Book: [So Much for That Winter](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114717-so-much-for-that-winter), I found too gimmicky and unlikable. This is the second book of hers I've read and the second book of hers I've hated. 2/5  
  
Best Book: [The Long Valley by John Steinbeck](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11353122-the-long-valley). Man could that man write. Last year, I started a project to read/listen to all the Steinbecks in chronological order, and this is one of best yet. Hard men, strange strange women throughout this collection...my favorite story was about the town...special needs dude?...who could do perfect impressions of everyone in town. He'd spy on people, and recite their most intimate and embarrassing conversations in exchange for whiskey. Great great story. </TEXT>

"The metaphor of the shark. In and of itself...spelled out, but that wasn't enough for DE! Literally spells it out: "All this. The fucking shark that eats the world."

Get it, the shark tank incident is like what the Circle is doing to the world!? IF you didn't get it with the initial metaphor, nor with the subsequent spelling out of the metaphor, DE is there to help you really REALLY get it, like three pages later: "Don't you see that everything that goes into that tank, with that beast, with THIS beast, will meet the same fate?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the problem is that you're thinking too hard about it. If you're not getting something out of the book *you're trying to read for pleasure* move on. Come back to it some other time. If you're trying to find a way into "literary" books, you don't have to start at the beginning. You can start in the now--as contemporary lit is probably a little more accessible. But really, you should read what you want to read and what *you like to read*, not what you think you should for some arbitrary reason. </TEXT>
