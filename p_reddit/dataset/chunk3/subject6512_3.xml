You are taking things out of context and posting a headline in the hope of getting some karma from the community

I did not write the headline nor the article. I run this sub. I am after more subscribers for this sub, which is why I post articles related to privacy in Europe to this sub. Please refrain from personal attacks and assumptions about others and stick to your core criticism. Consider voicing your concerns with the author of the article. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do understand the difference. We appear to be having a misunderstanding.

 Slack actually is free, as in beer. It is NOT free as in freedom because it is a closed source platform,

This is exactly the point I was trying to make. I don't care that Slack has a free tier, because that makes both options free to use. I do care that Slack is closed source, because that's where the difference lies, which is why I pointed it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is great news! It may indicate that it's more profitable for businesses not to use third-party ad networks which track and profile users and trade in their personally identifiable information.  
  
If this experiment graduates to becoming the norm, we can finally have a direct relationship with publishers as readers. Bad ads will be less common, which may end the need for an ad blocker from a security perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Go and delete every single account you can think of that you don't need any more.

A better idea is to change the information in those accounts, then wait 6 to 12 months, and then delete them. LinkedIn for example ditches their archive of your old info after six months, updating it only with the newly entered stuff. If you take the patient approach you make sure your old info doesn't remain in their hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are handing Google an awful lot of power over you by giving them a comprehensive view of your life, your likes and dislikes, your travel patterns, your sleep-wake cycle, etc.  
  
They decide which news stories they make visible to you or hide from you in Google News, for example. They decide whether or not they show you a message asking for you to register to vote, or to go out and vote - or not. (It's something they're currently doing for the U.S. Presidential Election.)  
  
Without being fully aware of it, you are being influenced by them. And they are not being very transparent in how exactly they choose to show X or hide Y.    
  
You're also not just giving *your* data, but the data of all your contacts, people you have appointments with, etc. to Google as well. You choosing to use Google's services impacts other people's privacy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not a good comparison. A person has limited memory and eventually dies. Our data is forever, and will outlive even Google the company, as user/client data is generally auctioned off when companies go bust.  
  
Then there's the ease of access. Intelligence and security agencies can tap Google to track each and every user without their knowledge, something that you can't do with a person.  
  
And then there's the problem of hacking: You can't hack millions of human personal assistants at once.  
  
I would very much prefer a human over Google's version of a PA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's good that you're still going to the gym. This gives you something to build on. Just be happy that you're doing it. Any progress is nice, but try not to get worked up about it if it's not happening right now.  
Make a list with a few things you feel you need to do today, tomorrow, this week, this month, etc. Assign yourself a fixed number of tasks for the week, and try to do at least one a day. Just look into it for five minutes, and you'll probably end up finishing that task for the day. If you succeed, congratulate yourself. If you don't, do not sink energy into beating yourself up about it. Instead, use that energy to start on a different task.  
  
The first obvious task is figuring out what you would need to do to apply to another school. Separate the need to learn how this works from the pressure you feel to actually do it. Knowing how to does not obligate you to do it.  
  
You do seem to be slipping into something of a depression. Feelings of shame can be caused or amplified by depression. Consider getting counseling to get your mind back on track. You're already exercising, so that's good. Consider looking into mindfulness. It's an effective strategy for dealing with stress and negative thoughts.  
  
As long as you have your mom as a safety net take advantage of the freedom that provides you to experiment, to broaden your horizons. Try as many things as you can. If you don't feel like going back to school, it's wise to try to discover what you would like to do instead. You don't have to find something that you think you will like forever, just try to find something that gives you some joy, inspiration or fulfillment right now. You will probably meet a few people along the way who will contribute to this process.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Goldman Sachs doesn't reach as directly into your life and mind as Facebook and Google do. Google and Facebook influence what information you have access to and how it is presented. They learn how you and people like you interact with said information, how it influences you, etc.  
They shape societies, as they partner with public institutions for research, city planning, healthcare, etc. They own large parts of our information infrastructure. And most people are carrying a surveillance device disguised as a phone, which runs Google Android, and one or more of Facebook's apps. And I've not even begun to scratch the surface of their reach.  
  
If you think Goldman Sachs has more influence on society than these companies do, you should really start reading up on them.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your first sentiment, although I would formulate it as: "We've allowed these jackasses to become this powerful."  
  
Your solution may have worked in the late 00s, but now those companies have grown far beyond our individual control. You could try, but not using any of their services is impossible. Media have come to depend on Facebook for income (traffic). Healthcare services are partnering with Google for medical research based on patients' records. Cities are partnering with Google to track and manage real-world traffic. Facebook is still trying to become the network and closed web in developing countries, to rival the open internet. Google owns a significant chunk of the hardware infrastructure of the Internet (undersea cables, etc.). Google also provides many of the libraries used by most of the popular websites to function. And this list is just a mere glimpse. The majority of people with a smartphone are carrying an Android phone, Google's surveillance device that happens to be able to make phone calls and send 'private' messages.   
And even if we don't use their services, our family, friends, the businesses and services we interact with will all share data pertaining to us with them, allowing them to create shadow profiles of us.  
  
They've become so ubiquitous and ingrained into so many levels of society, there really is no escaping them. Yes we should act on a personal level, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that that is all it takes. We will need to organize, we will need to push our representatives to take action, to regulate, to break those companies up.
  
Update: If you're wondering HOW we should organize, others have already begun that work. Start by supporting some of these organizations with your time and/or money:  
  
- [Electronic Frontier Foundation](https://eff.org/) (USA)  
- [European Digital Rights (EDRi)](https://edri.org/) (Europe)  
- [Open Rights Group](https://www.openrightsgroup.org/) (UK)  
- [American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)](https://aclu.org/) (USA)  
- [Digitale Gesellschaft](https://digitalegesellschaft.de/) (DE)  
  
If you're looking for one in your own country, this list is a good place to start: https://edri.org/about/#members  
  
And spread the word! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ### Submission Statement

Google and Facebook now actively influence so many aspects of billions of peoples' lives, and entire societies. They influence what we (don't) think about and how we think about it.  
The've become gatekeepers to our media, arbiters of our speech, and much more. The words we currently use to describe those companies fail to capture their reach and power.  
  
 Characterizing Facebook or Google as powerful media organs  even the most powerful  actually understates their power. Marshall McLuhan, 60 years ago, gave us another, fuller understanding of media. Electric light is a medium totally radical, pervasive, and decentralized that appears to us as media only when constituted into video content. Electrical current itself completely changes our relationship to the world and, in the process, reconstitutes us. A medium is not merely something that feeds us content. It is a condition like air or water, through which we move without noticing.  
  
The analogy captures part of what is happening, but goes even further. Facebook and Google are not only carrying us, but constituting us. We are, in fact, their media. Geared as they are to sharing, clicking and eyeballs, these media do not measure and do not value solitary contemplation, reflection and disconnection. They thrive and pulse on popularity, not veracity. They feed on extremes, not common causes. </TEXT>
