	<TEXT> Yes, that whole primary thing was horrible the way it allowed people to vote and have choices, wasn't it?  We should have meekly accepted Hillary's anointment and started building the temples in her honor immediately. /s

Do you have any idea how entitled and privileged what you wrote sounds?  Do you even care?  

You are the reason Hillary lost.  You have no empathy or consideration for anyone's views but your own and enough people rejected that to allow a lunatic to slip into office.

Even now, you can't accept any fault with candidate or yourself, so you pin the blame on anyone who isn't like you.  Pathetic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spreading lies won't make the hurt go away.  Sanders campaigned non-stop for Clinton in the general election and now people like yourself are so wrapped up in bitterness, you're punishing the guy for doing the right thing.

Why on Earth would the next losing primary candidate campaign for the nominee if they're going to have lies and smears shit out at them for helping? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since everyone else has mentioned that you should NOT bareback, I'll talk about the other bit...

Simply put, you can accept that you're bisexual or gay and be happy or hide it from yourself and be miserable.  Speaking as an older guy who tried to push this side of me aside for several years, I know what I'm talking about.

Accept who you are and don't waste time with guilt and recrimination.  It will lead to self-loathing and fear of being found out.  It isn't worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having no clue as to who was right or wrong regarding your mental health, it was definitely wrong to diagnose you by text.

As for the best way to move on, I'd suggest a clean cut.  Block his number in your phone and try to avoid the places he tends to frequent, if possible.  Also, resist creating mental stereotypes of older men (or men in general) in your mind.  Not every guy will be controlling, manipulative, or spiteful.  Many will be, but that's why you need to take time when meeting men to separate the wheat from the chaff.

Most of all, don't let this guy continue to control your life by making you resentful or bitter.  Accept that he is a deeply flawed individual, like most of us, who has not dealt properly with his issues and move on.  You were lucky to escape so quickly so be thankful for that and learn from it.  That way you can take something positive from this experience.

Good luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's not working but he can't find more time that once per week to see you?  He's 37 years old and not out?  He's spending more time with a coworker who's lonely than his boyfriend who's just as lonely?

These are all major points that you didn't mention before.  They don't make your abusive behavior any better, but they do show that he's been abusive of you as well.

While nothing you've written suggests to me that your partner is cheating on you sexually, unless there are reasons you haven't shared, it does sounds like he is being very withholding of affection, which is also abusive. 

In a young/old relationship, there's a thing called the campfire rule.  The more mature party has a responsibility not to leave a mess behind.  Your boyfriend should be helping you navigate the complexities of adult relationships; he shouldn't be playing games - which it appears he is doing.

So again, unless there's more information that you haven't provided, my advice remains the same.  Let him go, for his sake and yours.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sounds like you believe he may have only wanted your money.  If you're still giving him money or gifts, then perhaps that's true and you should move on, immediately.  If he still wants to hang around you now without a financial incentive, he probably does want to be friends.

What he did in the past was pretty bad, but we all do things we're not proud of at times.  What is going on now if far more important.

That said, he's not the guy for you and you should never get back with him under any circumstances.  Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have to ask how it came up that he'd choose his friends over you.  If you were trying to make him choose, then that was abusive behavior.

Basically, none of what you wrote about your boyfriend's actions sounds improper without more to go on.  How does he talk about his friends and why are you putting the word in quotation marks?  If you truly believe they're really fuck buddies or lovers then you should leave him. 

On the other hand, I took the liberty of reading some of  your other posts last night and it seems to me that the main problem here is that you see each other once a week and that isn't nearly enough for you.  Would I be wrong in guessing that you're really jealous of the time he spends with friends when he could be with you?  

In other words, I'm thinking the problem isn't that he's cheating by having sex with other people, it's that you feel he's cheating you of the time you deserve with him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You didn't post any information on your partner's actions, only yours; so the response you asked for and got pertained to your actions.  

You're right, no relationship is perfect and people make mistakes.  Are you continuing to make the mistakes or are you learning from them and doing something different the next time?  If you're repeating the abusive behavior then let him go so he can have a chance to heal.  

And again, get yourself, and hopefully your partner, into counseling to find out why your relationship is in the state it's in.

	<TEXT> It sounds like you're an abuser because you admit to being jealous and to accusing him of cheating.  

If you can't trust him, let him go.  Whether he's cheating or not, you don't appear to trust him.

Perhaps you have no idea how soul crushing it is to be with someone who is always questioning you or invading your private space.  Maybe you don't understand why someone would resent constantly having to justify his actions and make excuses for where he's been and what he's done.

Putting someone in that position is emotionally abusive.  If he gave you that list, he obviously believes you've been doing at least some of those things.

	<TEXT> I was in the middle of writing a long response to this when I figured I might as well say it like it is.

Let this guy go then get some counseling to deal with your insecurity issues before putting yourself back into the dating pool.  It sounds like you really are an abuser (without quotation marks).

I'm truly not trying to be mean here; I'm trying to give the best advice I can.  I've been in your boyfriend's shoes and it's a miserable existence that he doesn't deserve.  If you care about him, let him go and get help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say his fetishes (and yes, they are fetishes) are both weird and normal.  The whole point of a kink or fetish is that it's not normal but it's also very normal to have them.  Does that make sense?

If your boyfriend's fetishes don't disgust you, take the advice of Dan Savage and be GGG (Good, giving, game).  Then when you discover your kinks (if you haven't already done so), he should do the same.

Most of all, enjoy your adventure! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, this is what happens when someone posts a silly meme that is not accurate then tries to change the subject when called on on the idiocy.  You're meme is patently misleading and a mature person would admit this and fix the problem.

To your larger point, is it your honest belief that the wealthy receive the same amount of services from the government?  Do you actually believe that the police and firetrucks show up as quickly when called from a poor neighborhood as they do when called from a wealthy one?  Do you actually believe that the wealthy do not benefit more from our roads even though they own more vehicles for personal and commercial use?  Do you think they don't get more use from our courts when most of a court's time is tied up with civil litigation from wealthy litigants?  Does our military not protect the properties and assets of wealthy citizens at a greater rate than the poor?

On and on, the examples are glaringly obvious that our system works much harder, and more resources are spent, on taking care of those with the most assets.

Yet you're spending your time crying about a few bucks going into social safety nets as though that doesn't benefit the wealthy as well.

Perhaps spending some time figuring out where the money in this country goes and how it supports various classes would help you see where the real problems lie.

Oh.  And quoting Ayn Rand, the woman who cried about the evils of Socialism at every turn before jumping on SSA, doesn't win you many points.

	<TEXT> This article reads like it was thought out by a pathetic, greedy, old man trying to hold on to the savings in his mattress and written by a highschool freshman who isn't quite as clever as he thinks he is.

In other words, it's your average Ayn Randian rant about taxes.

Let's make this simple for those who might actually fall for the kind of highschool sophism put forth in the article:

We didn't create social safety nets to be charitable or moral.  We created them because they provide stability, which in turn keeps businesses running smoothly.  When businesses can run smoothly they tend to employ people, which in turn reduces the need to spend on social safety nets.

The alternative is more crime, more prisons, more violence, and more waste.  All of these are much more expensive than properly funding safety nets.

How short sighted and downright stupid does one have to be to not get that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand that.  I don't want to make assumptions or put words in your mouth, but to me it reads as though you'd rather not have racist views.  If that's accurate, how do you reconcile the racist beliefs with the desire to be more open minded?

Can you give an example of how you find other races to be inferior culturally, socially, or intellectually that you believe spans the majority of that race? </TEXT>
