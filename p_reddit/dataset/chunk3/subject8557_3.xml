The science was good, if a bit of a stretch at times, although considering our place in the advances in science, I thought it wasn't over the top. The scenes of familial love really hit me hard. Much of my family is like Coop's, rural, grandparents were around, in fact an uncle of mine is quite similar to coop. Just an all around great movie that calls to the conscience of our generations.

	<TEXT> I looked it up. That was written about 100 years after Jesus' was said to have died. There is simply not enough primary evidence to support the conclusion that Jesus Christ was ever a true flesh and bone person. Additionally, Jesus Christ translates from the Greek into the Messiah Joshua and Jews in that region were worshippers of Joshua, who was a figurative representation of peace and love for all mankind. The fact that the first surviving historical literature on Jesus was 40 years after his death is significant as the period of Jesus' supposed life was a period in which a significant amount of Roman Historical authorship was being written. It is peculiar that a man who had done so many miracles and who had caused such turmoil was not even noted in his time of such prevalent Roman historical authorship. Furthermore, all supposed physical artifacts are spurious at best, their finders, and Christians everywhere, are remarkably unscientific in their attribution of authenticity these artifacts. It simply just doesn't add up to a flesh and bone son of god or man to me. Even my professor, with a PHD in classics from Harvard, admitted that the evidence was insufficient to support a definite conclusion for his existence, and that one had to make a leap of faith to believe in the flesh and blood Jesus. Personally, I believe the idea of a flesh and blood Jesus is no different than believing the earth is flat or that it's the center of the universe, the evidence just isn't there. 

Edit 1: typo

Edit 2. It is also interesting to note that so many aspects of jesus fit the "hero motif," Wherein some son of god, or son of man turns into god, is born miraculously, disappears until about 30, performs some miracles, dies under an authoritarian hand, and is resurrected, and some others I can't recall or find on a brief google search. This is shared by Gilgamesh, and about 5 to 10 other myths. 

Edit 3: instead of downvoting, I challenge any of you to disprove what I have written above.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally, as a person who repots orchids often, I would just wait until the flowers are spent and in the meantime focus on making sure you dont overwater and that it's not overwatered now. I write that because it seems a little on the wet side in the pics. The moss that wholesale nurseries use is not the ideal medium for phals, it soaks up and retains a significant amount of water and should never be saturated for orchids(for phals, the orchid bark almost cant be overwatered, given that it's not watered too often). If the moss is saturated, I recommend repotting into orchid bark within the next two to three days(get the fine bark, coarse and medium are difficult to work into the roots). </TEXT>
