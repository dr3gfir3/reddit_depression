	<TEXT> I was watching this show called Gomorrah and one of the characters gets a one-shot 3D printed gun. It was composed of different parts and it generally didn't look like a gun all that much, more like one these devices used for hot-glue </TEXT>

Basically the symptoms of PTSD have been around long before that, but it wasn't until 1980 until it was fully recognized as a disorder, although I think it was studied first around the 50's  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the bassist guy (wait, do we have a name for him? I forgot) is really falling for the woman. I like how he told The Broker to assign him something else because it was getting too depressing. I bet he at least is starting to really care for her. I wonder if he'll come head to head with Mac, but probably not since they work for the same person. By the way, did Mac recognized him as one The Broker's on the dining scene? I don't think but he seemed kinda hostile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seriously don't understand why people make such a big deal out of this series. Yes, it is dense, and obviously I won't get everything out of it on my 1st read, but as someone who's on Dust of Dreams right now, looking back reading this series has been fun and I can't wait to do it again. Even when something complicated happens, I think Erikson gives writes in a way that you are level with the characters. 

Describing this series as a huge puzzle you have to put together turned me off at first, but after starting reading I found out the books are written in a way that you can enjoy them without breaking your head over anything, and the fact that each book so far has had huge ending that feel final and epic helps a lot ( like Memories of Ice, which the last 200 pages of so could very well be the ending of a stand alone book) </TEXT>
