	<TEXT> Ok, I uninstalled and deleted every folder, reinstalled it and now it works again! It's so sad that riot support just didn't told me to do that at first..I wouldn't have to lose a whole week to solve the problem.

Well thank you guys anyways. 
See you in the Rift! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just following Riot support steps. I was being told it was all about the connection and that's why I took 7 days just focused in the network itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually I thought about it at first, but I don't know what would be the difference if the repair could not solve it.
Trying it right now anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After the investment over the Cblol (our LCS) finals at Allianz Park Stadium which supported a crowd of around 15.000 plus the 500k viewers from all country (twitch, youtube, movie theaters), the game is being talked all over the place; from television to radio, and it's really awesome to be a part of all that.             
Congratulations Riot!

EDIT: Guys, it's about support growth, I'm not saying that Brazil is now stronger then other regions (even though + support equals to a stronger cenario over time).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is gold to me. Thanks a lot Triv.
My music is going to reach you one day, and so when that happens, I'm going to say: 

"Do you remember those tips you gave me? So yeah, it's because of you why I could get here". 

Remember that!

	<TEXT> Hey Trivecta, first of all, I'm really proud of being able to discover you through one of your fans (Phaura), because your music inspired me a lot those last weeks, and I'm grateful for that.
Now, the question:
Do you have any tip for a good master (besides the "don't peak" advice) and how do you work around to make these beautiful and well-polished songs of yours?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If he's that good, then why isn't there any Aatrox in queue out there?
What I'm saying is that we already have a lot of champions that do what he's supposed to do, with better efficiency.
