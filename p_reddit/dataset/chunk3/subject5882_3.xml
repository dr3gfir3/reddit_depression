	<TEXT> nah she's my pal. she's pretty hot and super put together, but the guy pretended to approach her with questions about a university she'd previously attended. she was trying to be polite because she understands that sometimes good people have difficulty communicating on the internet. 

dude pushed it a lil far tho. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my pal who doesn't use reddit shared this. this dude was a friend of a friend, and she was trying to be polite, because she is a nice person who understands that sometimes good people are socially awkward or have hard times communicating.

guy is blocked. thanks for assuming, tho. </TEXT>
