	<TEXT> Of course, it's better AND worse.  Being unmarried my whole life and nearing 40, I've traversed dating in both eras.  As you allude to in your latest show, it's so much more common now for people to bail on a date or just go silent and ignore someone when most of your communication is done through texting.  I've seen it more and more as the years have passed.  In fact, it happened to me exactly one night before I traveled to Tulsa to see your show, and it stung a little less laughing as you walked through the exact scenario that had happened to me.

On the flip side of that, knowing how to talk to a girl on the phone is suddenly a huge advantage.  Most of the time.  Sometimes, girls in their 20s almost get creeped out when you call them, like it has somehow become crossing a line too quick.  But generally, it's so much better in coordinating dates and helps establish rapport before you ever meet up.

I'm not knocking texting, it has also saved me from anger and wrath when plans have changed at the last minute.  I remember one particular date before I had a cell phone when traffic and other delays had me so late, I was freaking out the whole time that my night and future chances with her were toast.  Luckily, they weren't.

I think being able to know that much more about someone before you ever meet them in the smartphone era is great, but part of me does miss just showing up at the door for the first date and the mystery of what you were about to experience.
