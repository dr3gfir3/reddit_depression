	<TEXT> If you don't like meleeing a task, but it's a demon task, use a darklight, and if you haven't done so already, upgrade it. The upgrade makes tasks so much quicker, and much more fun imo. You can even use the darklight at waterfiends!
(I love the new darklight) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely do **not** skip out on melee tasks. With the new darklight upgrade, do all the demon tasks, including waterfiends using a darklight and an oh drygore. I haven't used it at wfs yet but I have at black demons, and you can easily one bang </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The quest was a 5/10 on my list, it didn't really grab me at first, and it seemed a bit like a holiday event, but as I was getting into it, I began to get engaged, then the boss fight sort of put me off, all I know is, now that I have the dark light upgrade, I won't be redoing it any time soon </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Ninja Request] Remove Marker Plant left click option </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-22 21:55:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So after being someone who does use portables often, its a common occurrence that people come over and just place a Marker Plant. Its all fine if there are few people there, but when there's a butt-load, it becomes a nuisance having to go all the way down.
 What could be done is remove the left click option for the person who **DIDNT** put the plant down, and have it show for the person who did. 
 Thank you  </TEXT>
