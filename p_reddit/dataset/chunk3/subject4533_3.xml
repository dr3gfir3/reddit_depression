	<TEXT> I just got the M-Audio Av40's today and I set them up and... I am very happy with the clarity of the highs and how they retain that clarity when turned up loud. The biggest problem I am encountering unfortunately is the lower frequencies. I have positioned them properly and it just sounds so 'phase-y'. When I walk around my room there are certain areas when I can really hear the bass. I think my main problem is that I have a huge room (imagine a normal sized bedroom and a kitchen together).
So yeah, the lower frequencies pretty much hurt my ears. Any suggestions? Invest in a sub? Buy better monitors? I got these for 240 for the pair so of course they wont be stellar quality but I want to get the most out of them.
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am looking to buy a decent/cheap pair of monitors. Since I have mainly made music through headphones, I know next to nothing about what I need to get them running and how to treat a room properly to get the best out of them. 

I have quite a large room, with my computer etc. in the corner. My budget is $400-$600. What I need from you guys is the best monitors that are cheap but worth the price for a standard first pair, if i need an audio interface or not, and ultimately, if monitors are worth it if the room they are in isnt treated properly. 

Thank you!
