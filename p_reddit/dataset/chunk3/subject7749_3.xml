	<TEXT> Well i will try to answer some question.

* Try to find a couple of recipes which suit your base setup (e.g. cooking with monster meat and honey etc)
* My trips are usually 1-2 days long, depending on the goal i want to achieve.
* Try to think about, what you really need on your trip. Sticks   flint for more tools, logs and grass for a fire, a weapon amor and food.
* Try to think in seasons. what do i need to survive the winter, what can i accomplish in the rest of that time window. For example, you need wood for the winter to burn. Take one whole day and chop wood, refine it into planks and store it. Or try to start a field of grass/sticks/berry in your base.
* Stone walls are quit useful for a panic room :D

	<TEXT> Yeah i saw the Shining Code 2.0 and the Making of, realy interesting stuff. I saw a very good british dokumentary about Kubricks way of working called "Stanleys Boxes", its even more facinating, because he stored every detail (of his films, made and unmade) over decades in thousands of boxes. There are costume tests for clockwork orange, where he seeks the ultimate evil hat and camera tests for lolita. Beautiful, never before seen footage!

	<TEXT> I think you are absolutly right, i was disappointed too, because i expected more of it. In the End nothing was new for me, because im an avid Kubrick fan, ive saw the Shining Code and read the Ager Reviews alot.

Room 237 knows that there is no finite answer to The Shining ( I searched for the Face too!). But when you look at Kubricks other Films, you will notice that he made nearly no mistakes, he was a master of subtle things. I dont want to say, that he was responsible for the moon landing, and thats the message in Shining, all i want to say is, Kubrick was a highly intelligent Human being and he knew People would search for answers in his films. In my mind he is the perfect troll ;)  </TEXT>
