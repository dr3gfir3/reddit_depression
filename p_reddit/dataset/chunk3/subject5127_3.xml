	<TEXT> While I gather that teaching to tests is awful for kids, I wonder if teachers get away with this less now with all the standardized testing. 

Had the same thing in Ancient and Medieval History in 9th grade. The teacher had Greek heritage. It started out normal: a unit on Mesopotamia, one on Egypt, one on the Hebrews. Then came an Athens unit. Then a Sparta unit. Then a separate unit on the Peloponnesian War. Then a handful of other Greece units. Never got to Rome. Definitely never got to the medieval part.

On the other hand, he was a great teacher in other respects. Learned a ton about the process of doing history, which is in retrospect probably more important anyway than what we actually studied.  </TEXT>
