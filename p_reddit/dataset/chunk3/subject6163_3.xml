I remember they had a seperste classroom for the bridge program (kids from africa) 

My friend went through it one year, then partway through the next year they wante him back in, and tried taking him out of the classroom. 

Also the ridge program would be let out 10 minites earlier than other kids. Very strange.  </TEXT>

My principle went to the hospital to pray over her, and keep in mind this was a christian school. 

My bible teacher gathered a few people in a circle an was shouting "Wake up!" In an effort to revive the person. 

I got the hell out of there and went home. 
She did not come back. She remained dead.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My family we grew up poor. 

We would visit food banks, and shop at value village (which we called vv boutique) I remember going over to my nannys house and seeing a n64 and being so happy. It was the first game system I played. 

Trips to the library were often as you could take out as many books as you wanted at a time, so we filled up a wagon. 

We walked everywhere and it helped instill in me that walking is a great way of getting around. 

Though we were poor, we would often go out for meals to eat at olive garden or mcdonalds. My parents, bless them, they never wanted us to know they were struggling.  </TEXT>
