	<TITLE> Eating at Gyukaku </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-05 20:48:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been going to Gyukaku since last year. They have three locations in New York: Times Square, Midtown, and East Village. During lunch and early dinner, they have happy hour and lunch specials. For dinner, they have group meal plans where a party can have several items for one price.

The food here are cheap compared to other yakiniku restaurants in New York. I have 9 items to choose for lunch special. I get discounts for al la carte items during happy hour.

Since last year, I met a host who transferred to Baruch from BMCC. He knew me because I used my student email to make reservations. I usually have two appetizers, two al la carte items, and the 3-item lunch special. 

I like coming here because the prices are affordable and the choices are wide. If you come alone, it's better to come for lunch as they have lunch special.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Coincidences </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Between 2010 and 2014, I attended a zoned high school that was a mile from my home. During my time there, I found out the mascot from the school is an owl. I didn't mind about the mascot but I made friends from the school.

Currently, I am a sophomore at Baruch college. Thinking about the owl mascot, more than a year ago, I started to subscribe to VanossGaming after looking up gaming videos. Vanoss started his gaming career in 2011, and since 2014 he started using the signature owl mask. Last year, he replaces his logo with an owl logo; a few months ago, he swapped his owl mask with another one with more feathers and his Converse-like shoes with Nike-like shoes with his owl logo.

I realized that this has to be a coincidence. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Having A Dream Where A Hotel is Transformed Into a Senior Living Facility </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-04 18:26:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few years ago, I had a dream where I approached what I believed was a hotel. However, when I entered, it became a senior living facility. I saw that some of the former hotel fixtures were kept. I met a friend of my late grandpa's there. The place was big and is convenient to the bus stop.

After waking up from the dream, I thought to myself, "This might happen." Recently, chef Gordon Ramsay hosts a show called "Hotel Hell" where he visits failing hotel. One of the hotels he visits is Cambridge Hotel in Cambridge, New York. The hotel was owned by ex-serviceman and lawyer John Imhof between 2007 and 2012. After the hotel closed, it was transformed into a senior living facility. I realized that the dream became true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After Senate Democrats elected Nancy Pelosi as their leader, I doubt she can make democrats better. Tim Ryan is younger than Nancy Pelosi and has a better history than Nanci.

Her policies were mediocre at best. However, there are senators that are better than her, i.e. Bernie Sanders and Chuck Schumer. I felt that their policies are good. I like the statements Sanders made during the presidential run. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Featuring the Bernstein Bears in Robot Chicken </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-01 15:24:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Bernstein Bears is a children's book series that features the Bernstein bears. It aired between September 14, 1985  March 7, 1987, and January 6, 2003  September 28, 2004.

Robot Chicken is an animated show aired on Adult Swim. This show contains skits of characters from pop culture. If Robot Chicken features the Berenstein bears, this is what I wanted to expect. But before telling you it, there might be some vulgarity.

In this skit, Brother and Sister Bear are in school. The Sister Bear suddenly is in labor. She later gave birth to a baby boy who looks like gramps. It turns out Brother Bear made a bet with gramps to impregnate Sister Bear. Brother Bear loves the new baby more than Honey Bear, who late becomes jealous. He then kills Honey Bear to show his full love to the new baby. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> During my Freshman and Sophomore years in high school, I took German. The class was difficult as its syntax and pronunciation were difficult.

In the Freshman year, I started to struggle by November 2010. The class itself was complicated.

In the Sophomore year, I was assigned to two German classes. The vice principal helped me dropped the class I took already. It was still difficult.

I completely gave up in German as I am taking Japanese at Baruch. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If I Was a President </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-27 01:39:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here are my policies if I was a president (Caution: May cause butthurt)

Immigration:
It's not that immigration should be closed for people from certain countries. We need better regulations and better border control. We need more border police officers to control illegal immigration. Building a wall will hurt relations, but rather build a bridge with strong security.

Taxes:
The rich should pay more taxes. We need higher taxes to fund programs to fund the needy and to reduce the debt. Lower classes should pay 5%, middle classes should pay 15%, and upper classes should pay 35%.

Education:
If a student wants a good education, schools should provide after school programs and extracurricular programs. The student should be encouraged to do a minimum number of hours of community service before graduation. Public schools should do more to give a good education.

College tuition is free if a student's performance is above the minimun required GPA. Tuition should be $50 for a 3 or 4-credit class in community colleges, $100 for every class in senior colleges, and $150 for every graduate studies and above. Stipends a avilable for studnets to get textbooks and for personal uses. Schools are allowed to give students interns that if they complete them, they can have the full tuition paid in full and have some stipend for personal use.

All students of public school should recite the pledge of allegiance. It's part of the cultural identity.

Sex education should be part of the education curriculum. This class is important if they ever have sex.

Abortion:
Abortions should be legal. If a state doesn't want to legalize abortion, the federal government shouldn't force them to. All abortion clinics are allowed to use weapons, i.e. bayonets, daggers, swords, spears, to give abortions. If a minor is pregnant due to incestual rape, she is allowed to have an abortion if her parents wants it.

Guns:
There should be stronger checks for gun ownership. Gun cause more violence than not having guns.

Health Care:
We need taxpayers to fund the health care system. Middle-class cannot get free insurance and cannot pay for themselves. There should be a universal healthcare system, or Unicare.

Medicare is important. Seniors cannot afford to purchase insurance for themselves.

Internet/FCC:
The internet should be open. We need some form of surveillance. This form of surveillance should only look for suspicious activities.

TV shows are allowed to be mature-themed. If a kid show wants to have vulgarity, i.e. South Park, it should be noted in the rating system. Independent TV shows can be released on Netflix, YouTube, or Hulu, but should have lax regulations that on TV networks.

Showing nudity is highly forbidden. If one wants to show nudity online, it must be self-censored. Using profanity doesn't have to be always censored; kid shows are allowed to have vulgar language, but should be noted in the rating system.

Trade:
Free trade doesn't always work. We need some tariffs for trade. It should be capped at 10%.

Welfare:
Eliminating welfare programs don't work. If a person gets laid off, he can get unemployment benefits. If a person gets a new job, he doesn't have to receive unemployment benefits. If he received all of this unemployment benefits, he can attend employment seminars and should be able to be employed again.

Banking:
Banks should give people insurance in case the bank fails. The money from the bank accounts can be transferred to a new bank of the owner's choice.

Voting Right:
Everyone should have a right to vote. When a person is eligible to vote, he or she should be registered automatically. He or she shouldn't be harassed for voting.

Civil Rights:
Everyone have the same rights. It is okay to speak up if a person's rights were violated.

Environment:
We need to invest in renewable energy. If we use unrenewable energy, the Earth will likely be unsustainable.

Supreme court:
The supreme court judges should support both sides of the political spectrum. This way, both sides are considered.

Porn: 
Porn shall be legal with the exception of unanimated child porn. It helps with the economy. Sexually suggestive content is not pornographic but is considered obscene.

Prostitution: 
Prostitution should be legal. It prevents illegal prostitution and is good for the economy.

Drug Use: 
All drug paraphernalia are illegal with the exception of medical marijuana and up to 10oz of some controlled substance. Studies show that medical marijuana does wonders.

Gambling: 
Gambling should be legal and regulated. It is beneficial to the economy. However, if a person loses all of their money, they should be kicked out right away.

Death Penalty: 
Death penalty should be abolished as it is not a deterrent to crimes. Live imprisonment with or without parole is much more cost-effective.

Nuclear Weapons: 
We need to negotiate other countries. With nuclear weapons, humanity will disappear.

NATO: 
The NATO is important if Europeans countries are attacked by enemy states. The US should use drones to attack enemy strong points.

Terrorism/ISIS: 
We need better intelligence operations. We need to use drones to attack strongpoints.

Murder: 
All murders are punishable to life imprisonment with the exceptions of murdering one's children, especially mentally impaired ones, relatives, anyone who insulted you, and testing a new sword on a person within 1 hour of acquiring it. Such murders need an eyewitness to be justifiable.

Sex crimes: 
All rape are punishable by up to 15 years of imprisonment with the exception of the use of condoms for fornication of corpses, animals, and relatives, and executed people without a condom within one hour of being executed.

Glass-Steagall: 
This policy is important. We need regulations that will prevent another recession or lessen the impact of a recession.

Population Control: 
If the population growth continues with our current trends, the Earth will be unstable. In order to control the population, people should have less offspring or kill others indiscriminately.

Waterboarding: 
Waterboarding is ineffective as it causes harm and is considered torture. To interrogate effectively, we need lie-detection technology and manipulation.

Religion/Freedom of speech: 
Everyone has a right to believe in their own religion. People are allowed to join another religion if they want.

People are allowed to use online forums to have discussions of various sources. 

Email use/Social media use: 
I will use an encrypted secondary email account if the FBI allows and/or use Facebook and Twitter to let people voice their concerns. These emails will be responded by my cabinet members to see what laws and regulations need to be changed or implanted.

Video games: 
To allow violent video games, we need a video game rating systems, not to ban them. This rule applies to tv shows and movies.

Corruption:
Corruption is a crime as people take other people's money for their greed. Anyone committing it shall be imprisoned for 5-10 years and have their property confiscated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Skipping the Senior Trip and Prom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-26 06:29:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In the Senior year of High School, I skipped the trip and prom. They weren't that important to me.

The trip was from January 31, 2014, to February 2, 2014. I chose to skip the trip because the trip started on the same time of the first day of the Chinese New Year, so I chose to stay with my family. In addition, I found out the trip was at a ski lodge in Upstate New York and costs $300. I have never skied before, so I chose to skip it.

The prom was in May 2014. Since I went to the one during my intermediate school year and started regretting going, I didn't want to go. The day before the prom, several of my Law of Government/Economy class students wanted me to go, but I told them I wasn't going as I didn't pay for the prom. Found out the teacher of the class also skipped the prom. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Skipping the 6th Grade Camping Trip Offer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-26 06:18:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> During the 6th grade, my social studies teacher invited me to a camping trip because I was an outstanding student in the class. I have never gone to any camping trip, so I rejected the offer.

Later that day, a classmate of mine, who was also a close neighbor, gave my dad the form to go to the camping trip. Realising he has the form, we filled it out, knowing that he would expect me to go.

After the weekend, I brought the form with me as I was expected to give it to the social studies teacher. The first-period class I had on the day was P.E. Before the class starts, I wet the form in the water fountain and then ripped it up. Later that day, I told other students and teachers that I didn't want to go on the camping trip and am have other things to do. The classmate heard me.

One day, when coming home from the after-school program, the classmate followed me and told my grandpa that I ripped up the form and not going to the trip. I lied to my grandpa that I was going.

On another day, when my dad picked me, my grandpa and the classmate from the after-school program in Woodside, the classmate told my dad that I ripped up the form and am not going. My father tried to punish me but the classmate said that there is school.

The next day, the social studies student gave the classmates who are going to the camping trip a list of what to bring to the trip. Knowing that I was not going to the trip, I kept quiet.

For the next three days, I was in school with substitutes in most of my class. We usually did nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Sophomore year of High School, I was given a ticket in October 2011 telling me to go to the designated room to take the PSAT. However, I wasn't that interested in taking the practice test, so I said I want to wait for next year. I told other teachers that I want to take it next year.

In the Junior year, I received a ticket In October 2012. When I saw the card, I ripped it up right away because I was uninterested in taking the practice test.

On the days that I scheduled to take the test, I originally had to arrive by 7:30 am. However, since I chose to skip the tests, I came at 10:30 am. When I entered the school, I saw the answer sheets of the people who took the test.

My father asked me about my PSAT score, so I lied to him that it was 110. By the senior year, I told him that I didn't take it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This Thanksgiving, we didn't have turkey. There are several reasons why we didn't have turkey.

The first reason is that my dad had to work. Originally, we wanted to cook some lobster noodles, but since he has to work, we didn't cook.

The second reason is that my aunt is in China for vacation. The turkey is large. In previous Thanksgivings, we cut off the skin and put them in Peking duck buns. However, since my cousins aren't coming, we decided not to purchase one.

The third reason why there's no turkey is that we think that turkey isn't that delicious. We prefer roast pork and chicken, which is much tastier. I myself isn't much of a fan to turkey, but a fan of pork. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why a Trump Presidency Will Only Benefit the Rich </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-24 05:15:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After hearing policies of privatizing health care, implanting a school choice system, lowering taxes to the rich, increasing infrastructure, and tax breaks to business owners, I suspect Trump is widening the gap of income inequality.

Privatizing the health care system only works for the rich. Poor people will likely lose health insurance as they are unable to afford it. They can have low-cost insurance plans from other states but have poor coverage. Middle-class families who can't afford to have health insurance should have a plan where they can pay what they can afford and get want they need.

A school choice system gives the rich better college choices. Public schools will likely to be underfunded. Charters schools can reject students from poorer communities. Only rich people would support such a system. This system will lead to school segregation. Common core is important for public schools, as they give an incentive to students from public schools.

Lowering taxes for the rich will very likely widen the gap of the income equality. Such a situation will increase the public debt dramatically, leading to the eventual US bankruptcy.

Increasing infrastructure does not increase jobs. The construction company will likely get richer and leads to alarming rates of gentrification.

Tax breaks to the business owners will make them rich. The money is likely not to be used to create jobs but will lead to greed. </TEXT>

In Japanese class, it's a full class. We also went through what we have to learn.

In physics lecture and lab, it's the same full class. We did what we have to do.

When I entered the train station at 8:20pm, the station was barely crowded. The train was also barely crowded. When I arrived at the Grand Central station to transfer for the 7 train, the train was somewhat full. When I arrived at Roosevelt Ave station to take the bus home, I saw several crowded Q70's. The Q47 that I took was barely full. </TEXT>
