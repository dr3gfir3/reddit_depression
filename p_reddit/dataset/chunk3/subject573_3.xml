	<TEXT> I haven't seen any evidence that this was a mistake, so I will entertain your hypothetical:

Stereotyping three different groups on "mistaken" information is. I don't see how such a mistake should be made; the *bio/description on the twitter account* provides the answer to the very original question in that thread. At least 100 people saw this mistaken information and liked it so much that they upvoted the comment. The comment didn't even provide a source for the very specific assertion that was made so that others could know *why* we know that @lea is an assistant management editor at business insider. Instead, it took on a vague, threatening tone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tesla's PR is also just another department that ignores directly answering an inquiry, but pushes propaganda instead:

Response from Tesla

Tesla proudly employs nearly 6,000 American workers from the Bay Area on the floor of the same factory that had previously been shuttered by NUMMI. These are well-paying jobs, each of which comes with equity in Tesla, and which have helped to transform the automotive industry and revitalize this region's important role in it. Separate from its thousands of employees, Tesla sometimes brings in third party general contractors to do short-term construction projects at the factory where Tesla does not have the expertise or ability to do the project on its own. In these situations, Tesla enters into contractual agreements with its general contractors, which allow them to select the resources they need for the job while also requiring them to hire and pay their workers appropriately.

Or should we be taking this to read that Tesla will resolve this situation by paying all back wages ASAP?

Edit: [Looks like Tesla is investigating and will "ensure that the right thing happens and all are treated fairly".](https://www.teslamotors.com/blog/response-mercury-news-article-hidden-workforce-expanding-teslas-factory)

I felt the ending as a satisfying ending to Alicia's story. We got to see a culmination of consequences for prior actions and we are given the feeling that she will go on to experience the consequences of her actions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know of a service that does this. I would expect to be able to see a real-time count of total resources used system-wide and a real-time count of the resources I used. I could then verify and compute my own costs.

As I imagine it, my actual billed costs should be less (perhaps, much less) than the guaranteed cost, so that should always be a pleasant bonus.

For billing, I think I would want to be able to lock-in a maximum rate for a fixed amount of time. I should be able to move to a new lock-in at any time (not sure about how this could affect the model, but seems reasonable). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I voted for resource billing rounded up to 10 minutes and wanted to post an "other" here in case that it might provoke some discussion. (also, it was getting to be too hard to edit my post in the very small box that I was given to put it in)

I would be interested in billing that pooled the resource costs (say, every vendor billing period) and then allocated them proportionally to my resource usage relative to all other users. This would incentivize the business to highly value efficient resource usage.

You would need to track actual resource usage per application. Idle CPU time and unused storage would be billed equally (or, perhaps, proportionally to actual usage) to all users. The business would need to keep billings for idle resources low, and, as a user, I would feel that I have a fair, collective-ownership of the resources I'm paying for. If the business could attract enough users, efficient usage of resources would make costs very low for lightweight users and heavy users are billed accordingly. Low costs are likely to attract more users, some of which may convert to heavy users, continuing the cycle.

As a user, I would want to be guaranteed a maximum billing for a particular level of resource usage. The business would need to figure out how to calculate what the maximum costs would be for particular time frames, but I think it is possible (to some degree of risk). </TEXT>

 input.reduce((o, {id, tags}) = tags.map(t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o, {})

To lodash, for OP:

 _.transform(input, (o, {id, tags}) = _.map(tags, t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o)

If you can count on `tags` being an Array (and are running with JS 1.6 or newer), you can use the built-in `map`.
 _.transform(input, (o, {id, tags}) = tags.map(t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o)

_.transform is like reduce, but will implicitly create your accumulator as a new `{}`, if you don't specify it.

You can hoist those functions to a higher namespace and add additional parameters, but you eventually end up having to replicate something similar to prototypes to have the equivalent semantics as prototypes.

I don't ever want to use `this` in my code either. It sucks. You could add a com/trans-piler step that adds in `this.` for you though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a good heuristic to go with the "existing (superior) solution" (we are trying to solve things, right?), but it shouldn't be applied as an absolute rule and you certainly shouldn't think that people are smarter than you. The basic problem is that it is near impossible to evaluate at every level of your stack what the optimal existing solution is. You may be able to do it for some well designed specifications, but in general, you won't have sufficient specifications, nor the resources to perform the extensive calculations that would be required to determine the absolute optimum.

Everything hasn't been done and it's very likely that there are better to solutions to most problems and the faster you get to them, the more you benefit. </TEXT>

I use (Fedora 24) the following command to setup the gamepad:

    $ xboxdrv \
      --mouse \
      --ui-axismap X1=ABS_X,Y1=ABS_Y,X1^resp:-2000:0:2000,Y1^resp:-5000:0:5000 \
      --no-extra-devices \
      --trigger-as-button \
      --detach-kernel-driver

You'll need your gamepad hooked up and the `xboxdrv` program. The axismap starts your cursor in the middle of your screen and the resp filters keep the mouse cursor in a small box around your snake. You may need to try the values that are best for you.

	<TEXT> I made my first millions along with thousands of other kids at Microsoft working 120hrs/wk for years.  It was a big sacrifice.

Let's say three million to be at the most conservative end. Let's also assume that the three million is what has been retained at the end of years (7?), so, we allow that a standard $200k salary + benefits all go to personal expenses -- we are just looking for the marginal salary you would need to end up with three million after seven years of 120hrs/wk work at Microsoft.

That's a bit more than $400k/year in additional salary. I would guess you'd need to factor in some raises over the years (maybe the final year's salary was $1.2m, for example), or, perhaps, Microsoft signs thousands of kids at 7-year $600k+benefits/year contracts? </TEXT>

 Edit: I suspect the error you are making is that gag orders on the press usually are unconstitutional, but due to the nature of NSL's I don't think they could get around it, even though Reddit could plausibly argue they are part of the Press.

Which crime, or law, are you referring to?

Defamation crimes stop you from speaking.

Which crime, or law, are you referring to?

Whistle-blowing crimes stop you from speaking.

Which crime, or law, are you referring to?

Non-disclosure agreements stop you from speaking.

Not really. You can make an agreement with someone that you won't say something, but nothing short of altering your body to make you physically incapable of communication or your own free will, can prevent you from ever speaking about it.

Wikipedia's page on "Freedom of Speech in the United States" literally has an entire section on the limitations on free speech in the US. 

Wikipedia also literally has an entire *page* on [Prior Restraint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_restraint) and a whole section on it's status in the United States.

If you really don't think that anyone can stop you from speaking, you might want to take that up with the government directly, because they don't seem to particularly agree with you on that one.

There isn't anything for me to take up, because there is nothing that I am being prevented from saying. Is there something you is preventing you from saying? </TEXT>

No, if you read it carefully, one court said, "the gag order in this law is so bad, we must throw out the *entire* law", and the next court said, "woah, hold on there, we may not need to throw out everything just because this section is bad; study it further".

Edit: gag orders and their ilk, which attempt to prevent someone from speaking, are not valid. This has already been ruled on. The first amendment does apply; NSL's originate from legislation, and the first amendment is very clear that Congress can make no law abridging the freedom of speech (something which is not granted in the first amendment, but is assumed). No law and no court can prevent you from speaking anything that you want to. Yes, there may be penalties if you knowingly state things that are not true that harm others, but you can *still say them*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Freedom of speech is not absolute. This includes stuff like threats, political spendings, defamation, and many other conditional stuff like obscenity. It also pertains to things relevant to national security. If the law decides something isn't covered and its confirmed by the courts, then its legal by this countries rules.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prior_restraint

Its quite possible to pass a law that says 'you cant talk bad about the whig political party' and if the courts confirm it then its a-ok. 

Courts have already denied this.

Though realistically no sane politician would go that far to vote for it, or a president likely confirm it, nor would a Judge likely forgo his expected duty so blatantly. Lastly people wouldn't collectively vote in people for so many years that the judges and majority of house and senate and the president all be O.K with something like censorship in law.

Ok, so, what, we are talking about "no[t] sane" stuff now?

Look, no one can stop you from speaking. reddit can't say whether or not the government has done something to them? hunh? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not a hostage situation. Contrary to the article, ES2015/6/7/8/JavaScript is a decent enough language. Yes, other languages do some things better, and yes, if you don't know about types and many of the other features of the languages that do some things better, you are most likely eventually going to have a very rough time with your code.

The big draw of Javascript is the platform availability. It is unprecedented in users and machines.

If you know what to avoid, you can do some pretty cool things in the language that would take much longer in many other commonly used languages. The problem is that we don't know all of the things to avoid and probably never will. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you should be realistic about your skills with a particular tool and try to get better (including finding and using new tools). My first experience with relational DB's (MySQL) was as just a use for persistence. I'm not even sure I knew that MySQL was "relational"; I just knew it was a database and that it could persist a user's (game player) data between sessions. I never finished the project (was just working on a prototype mmorpg :]) as was mostly expected, but I did get some insight into the idea of databases in general (as a persistence of data mechanism), how it could be useful, and also how to implement a (very trivial compared to what I can produce today) working project.

When I later took a formal course on relational databases, it was quite easy, I believe, because of my prior experience. Everything just made sense; I could see how the things I was learning filled in the knowledge that I had previously lacked when trying to use such a database.

You probably can't learn everything there is to learn in one continuous go at it. Things you learn on one project can be used to learn more things on other projects. If you are learning something new, don't expect to be able to wield your new tool as successfully as others at first, but don't let that stop you from practicing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, prior to this incident, npm policy (and likely code) was that this behavior was not allowed. NPM broke their API contract.

NPM allows users to control their packages and to do with them as they wish. Azer told NPM what his desire was by using NPM's unpublish functionality and NPM's software did what it was supposed to do.

NPM didn't like the result of Azer's legitimate action, so they effectively reversed his action, by un-un-publishing the exact package that Azer told them to remove.

NPM has pretty much 0 credibility at this point. Now we know that NPM will jack your package contrary to their policies (no reasonable discussion among the parties took place according to the parties' accounts), and that they may arbitrarily decide to override documented APIs whenever they feel like it.

On top of all that the `kik` package that was jacked currently has no usable code in it and is being squat (contrary to NPM's written policies) by NPM itself instead of containing KIK's important package they they claimed they needed the name for. </TEXT>
