	<TEXT> At the end of last year, I stepped on a scale with a weight limit of 400 lbs,  and it read error. I decided I needed to do something about it. So I made gradual changes. Two weeks later, I stepped into it again. 398. So now, 10 months down the line, this morning the scale reads 309.

It's possible to do it. It's not easy. It can be fun. I just wanted to say, as someone who is 9 months further along on a very similar journey... good job. Keep it up. It's worth it. And we can high five at the finish line. </TEXT>

I would recommend looking elsewhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I've done some googling. I have this fridge

http://www.sunbeamliving.ca/details.php?c=1 id=1266#

And am trying to find a magnet or a vinyl sticker that covers the entire front of it and gives it an 80's/90's video game theme. Wondering if anyone has seen something like this anywhere? I'd prefer to get something that arrives ready to apply without too much modification.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there...

Firstly, I think you may have some misinformation. The SuperFX chip was an additional chip added to Some 3d intense games to give them some new abilities that the SNES didnt have out of the box.

That being said, you have a dead snes on your hands. What seems to be all the rage right now is ripping out the internals.and tossing either a very small windows pc or a raspberry pi into it. Then you can load it up with emulators and have everything in one spoT.

Bonus points for setting it up to use original snes controllers. Www.retrousb.com sells solderable usb to snes controller boards, so you could hook that up to the original controller ports.

Finally, consider if you want to to look stock or give it a themed paint job!

Hope this helps </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hrmm. I read through that thread. It seems to point out that hs is good for decent hardware.

I have tried all the front ends out there. If you like to leave your cabinet running and looking pretty when not in use, HS is nice. Different strokes for different folks. I don't use HyperLaunch though. Launching exes directly eliminates possible interference.

As for name calling people who disagreed with you... this is a friendly subreddit. Perhaps dont do that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A special offer!
For those of you who missed ReBoot season 3 and have no idea whats going on...

Ahem...
The web invaded Mainframe
Sprite and virus battled side by side
Attempting to reclaim the city
From the rift that opened wide
But Megabyte betrayed Bob
And he threw him deep inside the pit
The pit was closed
And Bob was hosed
And all that he could say was
Noooooo!
Without Bob to protect us
We thought we would have no barrier
From he who would infect us
Except Enzo, which was scarier
The city trembled terrified
From fear of the infectors touch
I guess your fears were verified
I wasnt a protector much

I guess our fears were verified
He wasnt a protector much
I guess our fears were verified
He wasnt a protector much
I guess our fears were verified
He wasnt a protector ector much

It wasnt Enzos fault at first
He only was a little sprite
At best he was the worst
But then he slowly learned to do it right
And just as he was getting skilled
A game came down he couldnt win
I thought for sure theyd both been killed
First Bob and Enzo not again

I jumped from game to game I aged
I grew and lost my innocence
I soon became enraged by each and every bad experience
the sprite you knew was gone
I had become a grim agressor man
I knew from that point on
That I was truly Bobs succesor man

I met up with the webriders
and took the form of interface
I joined my gun with pirate swords
And surfed the seas of cyberspace
and when at last the two of us
were really reunited guys
our shouts of joy did blare
Because we really were delighted guys

We soon made tracks to Mainframe
So our friends could reunited with us
We made it back but Megabyte
Was waiting there to fight with us
When Bob went face to face to face with Hexidecimal
Our chances for survival shrank from small to infintecimal

Bob helped to defragment my head
While Matrix fought with Megabyte
I thought he'd wind up dead
But he put up a terrific fight
I dreamed of this each lonely night
Of doing in this virus trash
But just ad I had won the fight
He engineered a system crash

What Megabyte had hoped to do
Was cause his death to crack us up
I gambled on the user to Reboot
And thereby back us up
It worked, we all were born anew
And rid of things barbaric
And now we're back together
Everything's alphanuemeric
Everything is alphanuemeric! </TEXT>
