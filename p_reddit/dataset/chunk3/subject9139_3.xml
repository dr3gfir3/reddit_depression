	<TEXT> Thank you for your kind words. Many people don't understand that this is in fact an illness, it has taken myself some time to fully accept it.

I will get a second opinion even if I have to ask my husband to physically drag me to the doctor because I don't have the energy to do it myself. Switching meds could make me feel better and anything with that effect would be very welcome, but still this is not a permanent solution. I wouldn't like to be tied to medication forever. Suppose I get new meds and my life goes back to normal and I feel well again, then what? I would most likely want to have a baby, and I can't get pregnant while on the meds! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am sorry if you feel I am waving my "good" life in your face. This was never the intention. On the contrary, I wanted people to know that I value what I have and I know that I am lucky to have it. Maybe that is not the case with yourself. Now I don't know you or your circumstances, but I would assume you have enough energy to get out of bed every day, take a shower, maybe even leave the house and talk to people. If this is the case, I truly envy you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for your support. I wish you and your son the best.

I am now at a point where I have lost hope and I don't really trust doctors any more. I know I should look for a new doctor and start again, but this requires a lot of energy that I simply don't have at the moment. The medication did work well at the beginning, but I think that was a combination of Placebo effect and the fact that I was so far down that anything was an improvement. In the beginning the pills gave me hope, and I think that was more important than the chemicals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do believe happiness is more of a mindset and there are plenty of very happy people who are in much worse circumstances than mine. I think if a person is mentally healthy, the good or happy moments far outweigh the bad or sad ones, and this makes life worth living. As to your first question, I wish I could answer that. </TEXT>
