I also exported into a new table in the Geodatabase.  Looks like all 3000 entries are populated with the new lat/long.  Now to convert from a csv to shapefile. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Using:
 - ArcGIS 10.4.1 Advanced  
 - Full ET Geowizard Platform (wizards, tool, surface)  
  
When you say add the geographic in the shapefile to its table, are you referring to "calculate geometry" to get my X/Y (lat long)?  if so, this has been done.   
  
Edit:  
Centroid shapefile has Zip, Lat, Long in the table.  Lat and Long are in Decimal Degrees.  (No Duplicates)  

Excel Sheet has Zipcodes with many duplicates, but unique data per zip code (such as Age, DOB, etc.).  So I could have 10 different data points, in a single zipcode.

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply.  Unfortunately, that's what I have been trying in various ways.  
  
For example:  
1. I select Join from my centroid shapefile and choose the ZipCode column that the join will be based on.  
2.  I choose the csv file I'm working with  
3.  When I get to #3 "Choose the field in the table to base the join on" the zip code column in this is not showing up.  
  
I have tried to duplicating the column with another name, and still no luck.  I'm thinking arcmap is seeing that my centroid zipcodes only have 200 zipcodes (no duplicates), while my spreadsheet has 3000 with duplicates.  
  
Again my centroid shapefile does have Lat/Long.

	<TEXT> I was surprised at first to hear only 196,000.  It doesn't seem like that many compared to other game systems.  Then I realized it's because Nintendo is notorious about early low run production to create over dramatized hype.  Marketing wise, it's genius.  Nintendo creates the hype, then they can better judge future production quantities. 
  
Don't be surprised if after January there is an influx of NES Minis produced and sold.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got it to work, what I ended up doing was  
- Change the *tick* to a **line**  
- Set the length to 0.1000"   
- Angle 90 (d)    
- X offset 0"  
- Y offset -0.05"    
    
Not sure if that was the best way, but it worked.

	<TEXT> Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid the lone Senator voting to sustain the president's veto. The vote in the House was 348 to 77, with one Democratic member voting "present".  [CNN](http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/28/news/override-obama-veto-911-bill/index.html?adkey=bn)  
  
Josh Earnest said it's the "single most embarrassing thing the Senate has done since 1983," referring to the last time the Senate overrode a veto by such a large margin.  
  
---  

Wednesday's vote put Senate Democrats in somewhat of an awkward position in that even though they backed the initial bill, they had a hand in setting up the first override of the commander-in-chief [NBC news](http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/senate-overrides-obama-veto-9-11-bill-n656011)  
  
---  

Doing so would instead threaten to erode sovereign immunity principles that protect the United States, including our U.S. Armed Force and other officials, overseas, the president wrote. This is why I vetoed the bill and why I believe you should vote to sustain that veto. [CBS News](http://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-overrides-obama-veto-on-911-lawsuit-bill/)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Star Trek = Synthehol.  
Synthehol (a portmanteau of "synthesized" and "alcohol") is a chemical variant of alcohol. It appears to have the same taste and smell as "real" alcohol to most individuals, but none of the deleterious effects associated with alcohol for most humanoids, such as debilitating intoxication, addiction, and alcohol poisoning. Most humanoids have an enzyme which breaks down the alcohol-like compounds in synthehol. According to Data, synthehol's "intoxicating effects can be easily dismissed." (TNG: "Relics").
