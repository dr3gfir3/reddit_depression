sometimes i would be like "We sat kinda near each other in the 4th grade, remember?" or "We used to play together at recess." 

Again, sometimes I would get a crazy look, but quite a few times people would seem to remember and ask how i had been or where i went and i would just kinda make it up on the fly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm with you on this. They have probably been planning out this off-season since the all star break. Keep Karl on until the end of the season, get rid of him and find a coach that is coming out of contract or was fired. I'm sure trading Boogie for a few key players was at one point on the table, but then decided he has been a loyal player who has expressed the desire to stay in Sactown.

All it is now is filling in a few pieces on the roster with the new head coach and praying that he tries real hard to get along with Boogie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it is asking for an estimation.

Let's say you are planning for an event and your boss needs an estimate of people that will attend to be able to buy enough pizza for all attendees. From the last 2 events you have attendance records of 1973 people and 1877 people. Since you want more pizza than guests, you will need to order pizza for about how many people? Without adding and taking the mean, you can round and just say in the ballpark of 2000 people. 

This is what it is trying to teach, that kind of mental math without needing to add the two numbers and dividing by two. This is good for a lot of professions as well as daily life, like only having 20 bucks to spend and keeping track of how much everything costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is just common core math nowadays. It isn't inherently bad, it is just teaching the kids to do math in a few different ways that we weren't taught as kids, which is why you get these pictures popping up on Facebook with Republicans blasting common core. 

It is hard to do this kind of mental math for people that do not inherently "get" math, which is what these problems are getting at. First teach estimation, then tricks like rounding to deal with numbers that are easier to deal with (i.e. tens, hundreds) and then working from there. This is good for practical math, like setting a budget, shopping without a calculator, and dealing with large sets of numbers. 

A lot of the parents still have trouble with this kind of stuff which is why parents are so upset because they don't understand it, and a lot of the older kids that were pushed into common core have a hard time understanding the concepts behind the math. Meanwhile the younger kids that are learning it are able to grasp these concepts a lot earlier which helps in the long run. </TEXT>

EDIT: I found your white whale! The second link gives an error when trying to access the site, but if you take the link and change the number after /fact you can cycle through the entire thing. Also, there are 75 images.


EDIT 2: the link to the imgur dump!

	<TEXT> The Blazers play waaaay better at home though. Unless the Warriors come out playing *EXTREMELY* well, we can put up 2 on them. You have to think that Curry will be limited in minutes and that combined with a home court, I think Portland can bump them for 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Curry will take at least one game to get his strike back though. I think we can win two at home and take this to a game 7 at the very least. </TEXT>
