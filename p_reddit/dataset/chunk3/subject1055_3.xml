	<TEXT> I'd say a lot of people can probably relate to that. I often will have been lying in bed for hours because I'm unable to get up, then a certain thought (usually of something positive someone said about me some time in the past) will pop into my head, and trigger a flood of other positive things that are around me, and I'll be thinking "Come on, it's not that bad! Anything is better than spending your day doing nothing like this!". That usually lasts a minute or so, then I go back to thinking I am literally of negative worth as a human being and will go nowhere in life. This happened for a long time, and I'd constantly ask my mom if I was maybe bipolar and she'd always shrug it off. I had an onset of hypo mania this time last year that confirmed that I am actually bipolar, (though not Bipolar I or II. I'm rapid-cycling bipolar apparently). So it did take a lot to find out that I actually was bipolar. I do wish I'd looked into it properly sooner and gotten medicated, or gotten advice on how to handle it. So I would tell you to definitely properly look into it, even if it's a mild annoyance. It's worth it. 

Also, you say how you've often thought that it's in your head, and you're not really depressed. From what you described it definitely sounds like you are at least mildly depressed, dude. So don't feel bad for seeking a therapist or asking for help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can relate to the feeling of being undeserving of your family's love so much. During periods of my life when I've been utterly unable to function because of this illness, my mom was there the whole time, desperately trying to help me however she could, booking appointments, many of which clashed with school, staying up late to talk, all this. Through all of it, I felt guilty because I thought a worthless, sad excuse for a person like me didn't deserve it; but I realised, and you have to realise, that while you may feel like you don't deserve their love, *they* don't deserve to have to have their world fall apart if you kill yourself. And because they don't deserve that, they're going to do everything they can to be understanding, compassionate, empathetic and supportive towards you. 

I don't know how much your family knows about your struggles at the moment, but I'm guessing that their main concern is that you stay alive. So, right now, you're ticking that box. You're living up to that wish. Now, they probably have others, and I'd say the next one down the line is that you're happy. So that's next. I'm not going to give you some shit of "learn to accept who you REALLY are! love yourself! cut out negative people! u can do it!!1!!!!" because all of those things (though positive in certain situations) are just overdone and often have the opposite effect to the one intended. So I'll just ask you to take a step back, and look at where you are. You've got access to the internet, you've got a house, you've got family. I don't know what led you to where you are mentally right now, but if it's addiction, you can look to others for help; don't try to quit all by yourself, trust me, it won't work. Look to /r/getdisciplined. That sub is also amazing (particularly the top posts/ all time) if you find that you kinda spend all your days getting up late and wasting the day away on escapism. Seriously, it's fantastic. 

Obviously, the end goal is to have you tolerate yourself, even like yourself. I'm not going to tell you that the first step is accepting who you really are and liking yourself, and then implementing changes to your routine/ health/ general life, because chances are, the person you think you "really are" is, as you said, useless and stupid and lazy, and undeserving of love. So yeah, dude, don't go accepting that any time soon. Change comes first. Force it if you have to (you'll probably have to, a lot). If you keep going and persevering, trust me you **will** notice a change in how others view you and how you view yourself. And then you can take this and run with it to fuel other change. This is when you can work on really finding a passion (if you haven't already) that is productive and positive, that you can turn to when you feel low, and that you can start to define yourself by, and ultimately have a better idea of yourself; it could be writing music, writing poetry, working out, anything at all that could be considered creative or genuinely productive. 

So yeah, sorry for the wall of text. Apologies if none of this is any help; these are just things I wish someone drilled into my head years ago, and I really want to help you.

You'll be ok, man. Trust me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, I still love the song. It's not really Radiohead to me (in that I try to think of it as just a song on its own, not in the context of albums like OK Computer), but I love the song as a simple, relatable rock/grunge/indie angsty anthem. It was written when Thom was very young and conveys that apathetic, self hating anger and loneliness really, really powerfully. Obviously it isn't on the level of their subsequent albums in terms of sheer quality but it bugs me to see people blatantly hate on it, or that it "depresses" them to know that the album that it's from exists, when it's the song that initially got them international attention, and a platform to give the world the later material that everyone regards as some of the best music ever. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holy shit, Corey's screams are amazing. And Paolo's backing vocals are fantastic. Matt's leads are sounding better than ever too, and (other) Mat's drumming is spot on, he nails the older stuff, he handles the Shogun stuff so much better than Nick did. I loved Nick but his playing on the Shogun songs was very sloppy at times.

edit: watched more of the videos, and I know I already said it but Mat's drumming is just so fucking solid. I love that he's in the band. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm about 60% shock and 40% sheer joy right now! I got about double what I realistically expected, and all A's and B's, with an A in higher level English, which is insane for me. It was kind of emotional because I've been quite sick in the last three years and missed about two thirds of 6th year because I kind of had an incident this time last year that really messed me up for a while, and missed most of 4th and 5th year because of my illness, but in the last two months before the leaving I really got down to it and just opened every past exam paper online and worked out what is most likely to come up, and learned that off really well; and it worked. I can't believe it. I got 375 points, which is totally average in the eyes of most, but really way more than I hoped for, and I'm so happy about it. 

I (somehow) got 600 points out of 600 in my audition for the School of Music in Cork, so because of that I only needed to get 190 points in my Leaving and two C's at higher level, and I did just that. I got about twice as much as I needed in the LC in order for it to add up to the overall required amount of points to get in, so unless the points go up by about 200, I got my course!

Because of the weird/confused/awful/unhealthy/generally shit state I was in, I was heavily considering leaving school last December and trying to find whatever work I could get for the next few years, and go back and do the Leaving in my twenties, but I'm so glad I pulled through and found the resolve to really get down to it in the final stretch; even if I did only start really working about two years after everyone else, I did it and - even if it sounds kind of arrogant and quite douchey - I'm really proud of myself.

I hope everyone else got what they wanted, and if not, just remember that there are always ways, and when you finally get what you do want down the line, it'll be all the better because you'll have worked that much more for it.

**edit**: Whoever gilded me, thank you so much. This was a really personal comment and I'm glad you liked it enough to be fantastic and give me gold 33 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> John Green writes teen novels, for teenagers. You just said you liked him when you were a teenager but loathe him now - I don't think that's actually a real criticism of him. He doesn't write for adults, so most people here aren't his target audience. Everyone saying he is a terrible writer here doesn't seem to get that he's writing for a certain demographic which, in this day and age, really goes for that style; the sort of pseudo-deep, poetic (in a sort of disingenuous way sometimes) tone. He writes for teens and he's very good at doing that. I just see lots of people on this sub complaining about him, the main complaints being that his writing style seems like it's pandering to teenagers and is immature. It's like criticising Stephen King for his books being too scary and mature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well Neverwhere came before AG, so I wouldn't let your feelings of the latter influence it that much. I don't think Stardust is a follow up to American Gods, but definitely I think it'd be the perfect book to read after getting through all of AG. The shortness and straight forward (but still really cool and interesting) story is perfect after such a long story like American Gods that you have to put a lot of time and thought into. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll keep it in mind for sure! I think I was just expecting a similar tone and feel to AG, not the more comedic style that's actually in Anansi Boys. I liked it, but I didn't love it like I hoped I would. I thought it was really funny at parts, but I thought all the characters, other than Fat Charlie, Spider and Mr. Nancy to be pretty boring and the plot kinda plodding and uninteresting. Definitely would have liked it more if hadn't just come off American Gods.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stardust is short and sweet, a really nice, contained story. I've been trying to wait until I can properly commit to reading Neverwhere because I want to properly enjoy it, as I've heard great things, so I haven't actually read it yet - and the only other I've read is Anansi Boys as it's set in the AG universe. I honestly didn't really enjoy Anansi Boys very much. So I'd say read Stardust, or tackle Neverwhere! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of people seem to find Gaiman pretentious, it seems to be the main criticism of him. I think that that style of writing just fit American Gods' tone, though - I really can't imagine that story being told in a more run of the mill, straight forward style. I think Gaiman was going for a sort of classic story-teller feel - as in, telling this story to a hushed group of people by firelight. So, coming across mysterious and as if something is being hidden constantly, and as if the speaker sees things differently to the listener and has more experience in certain areas, in this case the history of Gods and everything. I'm sorry I'm phrasing all this so terribly (arguing a point is hrd), but I see that sort of criticism a lot and never really get a chance to argue it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was one of those books, for me, where I could get really into it for 30 or so pages, be absolutely hooked and unable to wait for what happens next, and then it would start plodding, I'd have to read every sentence two or three times, and it'd take me another 30 or so pages to get really back into it. I loved it overall but it wasn't the most consistent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I adored the book so much and I'm really interested to see what Spielberg will do with it; he'll no doubt leave his mark on it but it's such an offbeat story. Hopefully they won't have too much trouble getting the rights to most of the stuff that's referenced. I'd imagine things will be a lot easier with him directing, considering half the references were to his movies! </TEXT>

They wouldn't sound out of place in a power metal band, and I mean that in the most complimentary way possible - that really powerful sort of voice that you can tell comes with a lot of work. Beau has said he'd been taking lessons, it seems like they've certainly paid off! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I should say that the post attached to this photo talks about the Limited Edition, so there's a possibility this is just the artwork for that - but I doubt they would release the LE artwork before the official, standard edition cover, and it fits the description of the normal artwork in that recent article on the album, so I assume this is the main artwork. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah it's understandable, they have a different sound to a lot of bands. I just think the energy and anger on this, and Sam's vocal performance, is incredible and it has just the right amount of djent influence and melodic parts to keep it interesting enough, rather than just being a super angry song. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was having this discussion with my band the other day, thought I'd see what people here have to say! Mine would be [I Know You So Well](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sinhi-_i53o) by Immanu El. Obviously it wouldn't suit all styles, but overall I think it's perfect, and certainly the best clean tone I've heard in post-rock. </TEXT>

It's hard to see what you're saying not being the case, so than you for your detailed response, I might focus on something else I'd been planning to read now. Cheers! </TEXT>
