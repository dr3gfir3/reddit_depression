Back up my old phone, restore new one from my backup I just made.  None of my text conversations are there anymore, and noted that some contacts also missing.  It worked fine with my gf's phone for some reason...

	<TEXT> Was a little kid in elementary school eating lunch with a bunch of kids my age.  Everyone was going around in a circle and saying if they had a crush - came to me and I blushed.  Another girl said "Nope" freely and moved on.  Kids started to poke fun that I was blushing and I remember saying "I wish I was black so you couldn't see me blush."  The girl who said "Nope" was African American.  I literally had no idea what I did was wrong at the time.  I was called to the principals office and was like wtf is going on I didn't even do anything bad!??  To this day I still feel like an asshole when I think about it. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yea, true - I think what u/NoDadNot2Nite meant was you must have PP for quads.  For example, AA on AAxxx board and not Ax on AAAxx board </TEXT>

	<TEXT> couldn't agree more w this post.  Don't get in the habit of c-betting just because "you hit" or have a pair.  Nothing wrong w checking and keeping the pot smaller.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Would disagree on H1 and I think betting flop is fine.  Villain who limps the CO rarely has aces in his range as he should be raising them in late pos. You get called by a lot on this board, weak Qx hands, flush draws, etc.  There's a very good chance that youre winning the hand and we have redraws to improve so building a little bit of a pot is fine.


H2: seems like a trivial fold as mentioned. Everything gets there and we're holding middle and bottom 2.  Soooo many hands that crush us completely.  Just fold and find another spot.  </TEXT>
