	<TITLE> For those with Snapchat lag </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I saw a bunch of posts recently about this, so I hope this helps if you need it.

Here's how I fixed Snapchat lag.

Download GLTools, paid on the play store or APK.

Open GLTools and search for Snapchat.

Apply these changes to the settings of Snapchat in GLTools;

- Enable custom settings for this app - On

- Force 16 bit rendering - On (If you encounter a black screen, turn this back off)

- Optimize GLSL shaders - On

- Enable texture decompression - Disable

- Enable texture recompression - Disable

- Downscale textures - Limit to 256x256 (If pictures or text become pixelated, change this to Disable)

- (If available) Lower resolution EGL hack - On

- (If available) Lower resolution GL hack - On 

Restart Snapchat

Props to r/Android for figuring this trick out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Liberals running Canada are making really fucking dumb decisions and ruining our economy further

Trumps stance on NATO has me worried about Ukraine

EXTREME threats to free speech with Bills such as C-16 in Canada

Unusually large number of celebrity deaths 

The pay-to-play discoverances about Justin Trudeau

Canada is letting in 50k Syrian refugees into Ontario ALONE. This is way too many refugees, a couple thousand would be fine, but this is far too much. 

RIP WHATCD </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used Resurrection Remix on my LG G3 for months. It was pretty great, aside from being a little unstable. Now that I have my Nexus 6P, I went to PureNexus Marshmallow until 7.1.1 came out, then transferred to Cortex ROM.

So my question is, how stable is RR 7.1.1 for the Nexus 6P? Is battery life above or below average? Does it use CMTE or Substratum? Who is the best maintainer for the 6P? Does it work fine with ElementalX? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with most of your points, but I disagree with you saying Trump normalized conspiracy theories. These conspiracies weren't against Trump, they were against Clinton, yet Trump still had very little to do with them. Hillary has proven that conspiracy theories are not always false with WikiLeaks and that causes people to start worrying more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not remastered or anything

GTA 5 is completely different on PC than on the 360. It's an entirely different port and had to be developed as a different game entirely.

And even if it was the exact same, your point is still invalid now. "Doubling performance for a 3.5 year old game doesn't matter" Yeah no, GTA 5 is still the third most played game on steam. </TEXT>
