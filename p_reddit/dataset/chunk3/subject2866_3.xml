	<TEXT> Finding the correct treatment can be a beast. I went through four or five different antidepressants to "help" before we found one that didn't hulk me out, or make me feel like I was going through life bubble wrapped.

I hope that you're in a better place now. 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that people are really afraid of getting help, and that mental illnesses are very much stigmitized.I know that I was self-harming and skipping therapy sessions in the beginning of my diagnosis because I didn't believe that there was something "wrong" with me.
   

I was very lucky when I first went in as a 20 year old, just released from the hospital for self harm, that my doctor did not immediately diagnose, then medicate me. I was actually diagnosed with BPD first, and the depression diagnosis came later. I also think that a lot of people self-medicate themselves to try to cope/hide with their mental illnesses, instead of getting therapy. 

In the beginning of my diagnosis, people did not take me seriously, and it harmed some friendships. Through therapy, I learned that it doesn't matter to me what other people think of me (I've been called crazy, attention seeking whore, and so much worse). I've learned that it's up to me to forgive myself, and to hold myself accountable for my actions, and it's not up to anyone else to tell me how I feel is wrong. But it took me 10+ years of therapy to get to this point, and I still have bad days.

Like a lot of people with BPD, I had sexual and physical abuse in my past, and when my behaviors started acting up, a lot of people didn't believe in my past abuse, and that hurt.
