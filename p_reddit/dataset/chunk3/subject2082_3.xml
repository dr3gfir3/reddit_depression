	<DATE> 2016-09-27 18:06:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Status:** UNRESOLVED

**Computer Type:** custom Desktop

**GPU:** Gigabyte Windforce OC (GV-N1060WF2OC-6GD)

**CPU:** Intel i5 4570 no overclock

**Motherboard:** B85M-D3H

**RAM:** 8GB DDR3 800mhz

**PSU:** Cooler Master 500W RS-500-ACAA-B1 (http://www.coolermaster.com/powersupply/g-series/g500/)

**Operating System   Version:** Windows 7 - 64

**GPU Drivers:** 372.90 - I installed them after replacing my old GPU

**Description of Problem:** Crashes when I try to play FIFA 15. Other games seem to be fine. Crash occurs after about 10 mins.

**Troubleshooting:** I tried ramping up the fan (Turbo), but the crash occurs at a low clock speed (1.2Ghz), and with low fan usage (29%) according to GPU-Z. The temperature was 46C. After the monitor goes blank, the fans on my computer seem to ramp up really high and GPU-Z records everything as 0, except for memory usage. The CPU is still running as I can still hear my music playing.

I can run Furmark or the Unigine benchmarks fine. Other games haven't crashed so far.
Any idea what could be happening?

	<TEXT>  Starcraft 1 has a lot of nostaliga behind it but I don't think it holds up that well compared to Starcraft 2, which is why it was so important that SC2 hit the mark dead on.

Actually, I think that SC1 was better than SC2 both for the single player and multiplayer. BW competitive play is kind of making a comeback with the ASL tournament.  It's more interesting to watch than SC2 IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right. I did find out the correct answer for the bright color palette after reading Patrick Wyatt's blog:

"If you consider the artwork of the Warcraft series, youll see that the colors are shockingly loud in comparison to, say, Diablo, where only in a dim room is it truly possible to see the beauty of the art. The bright, cartoony art-style was different from the style of many other PC war games of the era, which hewed to more realistic color palette.

Part of that difference can be explained by the past experiences of our artists, who had worked on several Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis console titles, where games required more dynamic colors since televisions of that era were so much worse at displaying colors than PC monitors. Console games on TVs, which had lower pixel resolution and color bleed, needed high-contrast artwork to show well.

Another reason was at the behest of Allen, who charged all the artists with drawing artwork in bright conditions. Hed regularly stalk the halls of Blizzard turning on lights and opening window-blinds.

His view was that most folks play games in bright rooms, so our artists should be authoring our games to play well in that environment. He argued that its easy to draw artwork that reads well when viewed in a dark room with no outside light can distract from the monitor. But when computer art is competing with bright lights its much more difficult to see. And fluorescent bulbs are the worst form of light available  the cold, flickering glow of their tubes tires the eyes and washes out colors.

So the lights were always on in the art rooms to force artists to compensate for terrible lighting by creating art that accounted for those conditions. These working conditions chafed on some (all?) of the art team, but ultimately led to artwork that stood out compared to products of the day.

Now you know why Warcraft artwork looks like it has been candy-coated!" [source](http://www.codeofhonor.com/blog/the-making-of-warcraft-part-2)

But after WoW, SC2 and D3 both adopted a brighter color palette too. This change was a bit controversial in Diablo's case, but the big problem was in the childish story, not the color palette. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly, the game just wasn't as fun as it should have been. 

I don't remember where I read this, but the most popular sports are team games, not 1v1 games. I feel like SC2's continued reliance on 1v1 doomed them. I always preferred 2v2s, even in SC1, and I think that was probably the case for a lot of casual players. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  WoL definitely ensured I wouldn't have much interest in the other two expansions. Raynor just apparently forgets how Kerrigan being a duplicitous bitch gets Fenix killed, and apparently forgets what amounted to a blood oath to murder the shit out of her if he ever got the chance.

BW ended that way:

*** Kill Fenix ***

RAYNOR:

   Fenix! No!

KERRIGAN:

   What are you worried, Jim? He died the way all
   Protoss hope to: In combat!

RAYNOR:

   He died because you betrayed him. How many noble
   souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied?
   How many more people need to die before you realize
   what you've become?

KERRIGAN:

   You don't even know what you're talking about, Jim!

RAYNOR:

   Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan. For Fenix
   and all the others who got caught between you and
   your mad quest for power!

KERRIGAN:

   Tough talk, Jimmy. But I don't think you have what it
   takes to be a killer.

RAYNOR:

   It may not be tomorrow,darlin'. It may not even happen
   with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man
   who's going to kill you some day. I'll be seein' you."

And then the next thing we see is that Raynor wants to save Kerrigan. Why?

Also, Kerrigan had won at the end of BW, and she wanted everyone killed, including Raynor:


 Duran :
 
    And what of your allies here on 
    Korhal, my Queen? What would you
    have done with them?
 
 Kerrigan :
 
    They are of no further use to me.
    Though they have proven
    themselves useful, it might be
    dangerous to allow them to live.
    Without the services of General
    Duke, Mengsk will be easy to deal
    with. But Raynor and Fenix are
    uncannily resourceful. They must all
    be eradicated."

So why did she mysteriously spare everyone after BW and peacefully pull back to Char? That was never explained and is basically a giant plothole that started SC2 on the wrong foot. 

And also, most of WoL is just about collecting artifacts for money, which is the worst kind of story. Let's earn money. Yeah. </TEXT>

    Korhal, my Queen? What would you

	<TEXT> I think their biggest mistake was basing SC2 on a Kerrigan/Raynor love story which only existed in fans' minds. They never really have time to fall in love in SC1 and then Kerrigan betrays Jim at the end of BW really hard. 
Here are their parting words:

*** Kill Fenix ***

RAYNOR:

   Fenix! No!

KERRIGAN:

   What are you worried, Jim? He died the way all
   Protoss hope to: In combat!

RAYNOR:

   He died because you betrayed him. How many noble
   souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied?
   How many more people need to die before you realize
   what you've become?

KERRIGAN:

   You don't even know what you're talking about, Jim!

RAYNOR:

   Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan. For Fenix
   and all the others who got caught between you and
   your mad quest for power!

KERRIGAN:

   Tough talk, Jimmy. But I don't think you have what it
   takes to be a killer.

RAYNOR:

   It may not be tomorrow,darlin'. It may not even happen
   with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man
   who's going to kill you some day. I'll be seein' you."

And then, at the end of BW, Kerrigan somehow spares humanity for no clear reason. She has won a decisive victory, but then she pulls back to Char, presumably so that they can have a story for the second game. They seemed to have planned an attack by the Xel'Naga/hybrids at the end of BW, which would have led to Kerrigan's defeat. This would have been better than her just mysteriously pulling back. Here's the end of BW: 

"Alone, floating on a dark platform above the burnt-out planet of Char, Sarah Kerrigan, the Queen of Blades, sat and lorded over the ravenous Swarms. Unable to shake the feeling that a great threat loomed just over the horizon, Kerrigan could only stare off into the vastness of space where she beheld a great void. Or perhaps a reflection of a hollow victory and of the trials yet to come..."

Her mysterious pulling back after BW is pretty much just a big plot hole. </TEXT>

A political story is much more complex than one that's just about defeating a single enemy. "Let's all be friends and join together to defeat the evil demon" is a story for kids.

	<TEXT> He created a lot of the Blizzard lore. So, he obviously was very important to the company.

But, he had arguably outlived his time at Blizzard. I think that most people would say that the writing has been one of Blizzard's weaknesses in the past ten years. They've been putting out these really simple good vs evil stories. There's a bad guy who's red and taunting the player.

Apparently, Blizzard doesn't have a well structured process for writing. It was his job as VP to ensure the quality of the writing and he hasn't really been doing that. He's not a professional writer and rose through the ranks at Blizzard. I respect all the good work he did, but maybe it was time for Blizzard to make some changes. </TEXT>

I don't know how kids would react if they read something like that, from the Starcraft manual:
"Project Purification. This genocidal crusade was the Government's final solution to the matter of cleansing humanity of its more degenerate facets. UPL troops scoured every nation on earth, rounding up dissidents, hackers, synthetics, the cybernetically enhanced, tech-pirates, and criminals of every kind. This planet-wide culling resulted in the eradication of nearly 400,000,000 people. The world-media, now under the strict control of the UPL, downplayed the horrific violence and kept the general populace of Earth unaware of the scope and atrocities being committed." </TEXT>

[Terran History: The Decline of Western Civilization](http://archive.rpgclassics.com/subsites/starcraft/thistory.shtml) This is the story from the original Starcraft manual. 

"As the manipulative sciences of cybernetics, cloning and gene-splicing rose steadily into the public forum, militant humanist and hard-line religious groups challenged the rights of private interest corporations who profited from genetic experimentation. Multitudes of people were being augmented with cybernetic implants while others began to minifest slight physical mutations ranging from heightened senses to advanced telepathy. These dramatic changes within the human gene pool caused widespread panic amongst many of the fundamental humanist factions.

Technology continued to evolve and spread, and population rates soared. Near the end of the twentieth century, there were six billion people upon the earth. Within three hundred years, the population had grown to an estimated twenty-three billion. Pollution and a lack of natural resources and affordable fuels added to the fire as world leaders sought ways to stem the growth of their nation's inhabitants. Popular sentiment held that the world was plummeting towards an inevitable catastrophe as overpopulation and genetic alteration swept across the globe.

Meanwhile, as tensions rose around the world regarding the use the capitalization of cybernetics and genetic mutations, many core international economic systems folded in upon themselves and shut down. Horrific acts of terrorism and violence erupted between the corporate sector and the humanist factions, resulting in forced police actions across the globe. Irresponsible media coverage of these atrocious police actions spurred the already rampant civil chaos in many of the larger countries. Ultimately, the precarious balance of world power exploded into international pandemonium."

Seems like something out of Deus Ex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it was luck. RTS became really popular in the 90s when they were a new genre. They allowed a completely new type of experience that older games couldn't match. Warcraft II was released in 1995, one year before Quake I. There weren't that many other compelling games at the time. 

Their popularity continued for a while, but they sort of peaked in the late 90s as gamers transitioned towards other genres. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fallout:New Orleans is rumored to be in development.

That being said, who knows how good their next game will be? They had a lot of freedom to make Pillars of Eternity and it was somewhat disappointing.

The team that made Kotor 2 and FO:NV probably isn't there anymore. Avellone was the lead designer and he left the company. Of the two other designers, Michael Chu is at Blizzard and Kevin Saunders is working on Torment: Tides of Numenera.

Part of the brilliance of KOTOR2 is that Chris Avellone continued some themes from Planescape Torment. Kreia is apparently a continuation of Ravel, as he said [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20071224183531/http://www.starwarsknights.com/fullstory.php?id=386).

I suspect that there were [tensions between Josh Sawyer and Avellone](https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/71076-lets-get-gossipy-friction-between-avellone-and-sawyer/) at Obsidian, and that Sawyer won. All of J.E. Sawyer's games (where he had a leading role in the writing), are much more conventional in their stories. This includes NWN2, PoE and the Icewind Dale games. It seems like he's a fan of vanilla, plain Jane, Dnd fantasy. Avellone always wanted to subvert things and throw them around on their head, which I appreciate much more. So a Star Wars game by Obsidian might not be as unique. 

Avellone went crazy and read everything he could about the SW universe before making the game (in a very short 14 months timeframe). That's probably not something that anyone else would do. </TEXT>

That being said, some places WILL have legit Windows 7/8 OEM packs or retail boxes that they want to get out of inventory. OP's recommendation is good for situations like that.

Buy from reputable vendors, or run Linux."

	<TEXT> The answer came down to "Theres a cost to everything when it comes to development."

Bethesda is a pretty scrappy developer. Fallout 4 was developed by [just over 100 people](http://gamerant.com/fallout-4-development-team/), which is small for a game that sells this well at AAA prices. They could probably afford 300 developers, and maybe even more. 

But, their games sell well, so why change things? The benefits of increasing their costs are doubtful. The market will probably need to punish them before they decide to change anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's well written, but I still don't really understand what's going on. 

It seems that PPC has 4 BAT registers, which point to 4 memory blocks that are 128 Kbytes to 256 Mbytes in size.

These registers seem to be a way to create 4 large sized pages that can be adressed without doing a full page table lookup.

Short explanation [here](https://www.usenix.org/legacy/publications/library/proceedings/osdi99/full_papers/dougan/dougan_html/node3.html):
" The PowerPC also offers an alternative translation from logical to physical that bypasses the TLB/hash-table paging mechanism. When a logical address is referenced, the processor begins the page lookup and, in parallel, begins an operation called block address translation(BAT). Block address translation depends on eight BAT registers: four data and four instruction. The BAT registers associate virtual blocks of 128K or more with physical segments. If a translation via the BAT registers succeeds, the page table translation is abandoned. "

It seems that Clone Wars rewrites those registers at runtime to point to different memory locations. Is that a way of reducing memory access time? I'm not sure what the point of this is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. Since you seem to understand this, what's the point of this trick? Is it just to adress the extra 16mb of audio ram?

My understanding is that they reference invalid blocks of memory then use the exception handling to rewrite the pointer to point to the audio memory, which they couldn't do before.

That's the right word. SC1's visuals were, IMO, influenced by Aliens and Starship Troopers which were very gretty and dark. SC2's continue the cartoonish style implemented by Blizzard in World of Warcraft. One reason, IMO, is that cartoonish art styles look good even with flat lighting. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anecdotally, I've playing a bit of SC2 Mass Recall (SC1 campaign remade in SC2) and SC1 arguably looks better. SC2 has a brighter and more cartoony art style. 

SC2's engine is also a bit dated by now. It doesn't use any dynamic lighting. The shaders aren't always the best. They tend to be a bit too shiny. 

There's something to be said for the artistic control that 2D gives you. Compare [SC1](http://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/0/2883/46149_full.jpg) vs [SC2](https://media-curse.cursecdn.com/attachments/23/446/ff28c6733990938b6540de5c0acc20b2.png). BW looks handcrafted. 2D also leaves more to the imagination. ([early SC2 bunker as a bonus](http://www.sc2blog.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/bunkers.jpg)) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They really changed to a bizarre pretty vanilla Space Marines Shooting Stuff type scenario. Why did we have to work for Cerberus? 

There's certainly a perception, true or false, that military fantasy type games sell better. The target audience for AAA games are young men. The perception is that they love shooting at stuff, and they love badass marines.

Bioware was trying to grow at the time and sell itself to EA. So, it needed to show that it could play in "the big leagues". With Dragon Age 2, they also moved towards more of an action game and they changed the design of the world to be more edgy. Everything became grey, spiky and more violent. It seems to have worked okay for them.

The Mass Effect and Dragon Age games grew from the relative "niche" of RPGs to a more mainstream action/RPG hybrid. The Mass Effect story moved towards a military space fantasy. Dragon Age always had a standard "kill the evil demon" story, but the wrapping was what made it interesting. A lot of that was sacrificied in later games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now, the mechanics mimic what flying a WW2 airplane is like. Orbital mechanics are very different. In orbit, your speed is related to your altitude. So, boosting your speed like we do now to reach another spaceship could send you on a weird orbit and if you just aim at the other spaceship, your encounter with it would be very brief. Try docking things in KSP or watch Scott Manley doing it: https://youtu.be/srsiLZLPiv0. It's very tricky. This would probably not be fun as none of our intuition about how to fly a plane would work. Dogfights wouldn't be possible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I think that a small number of players like min/maxing, but everyone else just wants to roleplay a certain character. I want to be a thief or a fire mage, or a duel-wielding fighter, but I don't really care about the math behind it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wasteland 2 having 3 different persuasion skills seemed completely pointless to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if it's just me, but I've never really cared that much about builds in RPGs. They're more of an annoyance than anything else. When playing a Dnd game, you basically have to look up an FAQ or you risk not being able to complete the game with your character.

In PoE incidentally, my character was underpowered and I wish that I could have respecced him to try out different spells. But no, this is an old school RPG and I'll have to accept being stuck with soul whip for the rest of the game.

I just want to experience the story and the world and not bother about combat systems. 

I know that Josh Sawyer is a huge fan of combat systems and the whole game revolved around it. I guess that's why it didn't appeal to me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of those points were kind of unfair. Palmer was very open and active on Reddit. That means that he's of course going to be caught changing is opinion on things. It's not a failure. You start thinking that X is good and Y is shit, and as you develop your product, you change your mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't. There's nothing interesting in the game right now. Everything is glitchy and there's not guarantee that it will be worth buying when it comes out in a few years. Buy a game that you can play now, like Deus Ex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The game looked like that: http://lparchive.org/Dwarf-Fortress-Boatmurdered/Introduction/

You couldn't go up or down. There were no "Z-levels". </TEXT>
