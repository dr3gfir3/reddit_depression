Feminists say something mild, like "theres no reason for a fantasy game to have no black people" or "theres no reason for games to feature disproportionate violence against women" or "we would personally like more women protagonists" and gamergaters lose their shit like someone is legally trying to censor them </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have studied the crime in Chicago, and the correlation between crime and poverty is much stronger than crime and race.

I'd be interested to see this, as this sort of thing is always an interesting read!

BLM was founded based on cops killing unarmed black men at high rates, but has also targeted over policing, over convictions, and other things contributing to the cycle of young black men getting sucked into a life of crime.

The conversation we need to have is about race. Maybe not solely about race, and certainly not exclusively blaming race for every arrest ever made, but there is a race conversation to be had </TEXT>

	<TEXT> again, I wont call you a racist. but these numbers do not tell a full story. It ignores the poverty inflicted on these communities, which is what led to the gang violence we see today. Yes, these communities have a violence problem, which stems from over charging minor offenses (creating cycles of poverty and violence).

Itd be interesting to compare these statistic to statistics for urban, poor white communities. However, much of the poor white communities are in rural areas, and thus do not face these issues (whats an rural gang gonna do) </TEXT>

I was joking, sorry, should have dropped an /s in there. I was joking because comply or die is a policy some communities now. it wasnt my best joke

I was saying the cops should comply or die, since thats their policy to others. obviously, I do not want anyone to be in a position of complying or dying, because it is a bad policy </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you explain that race relations is now at the lowest point it has been since at least the 90's?

an end to race relations complacency. problems never went away, but social media + 24 hour news cycle + everyone now has a camera means that the establishment is more easily held accountable. 1998, if a cop shot an unarmed man, its his word against no ones'. 20 years later, we have body cams, bystanders with cell phones, facebook live, and a ton of tools to show whats going on.  The racism never went away, it was just hidden. Now its out in thew open. and people are pissed, upset that they didnt know what terrible stuff was happening in their own backyards. 

It also helps that programs to help minorities, such as bussing programs, were ended in the 80s, and we are feeling the effects of broken schools, perpetually impoverished communities, and increasing gentrification.

the solution to race relations is fighting for equality, not ignoring it as a means to keep the peace.

As for people calling you racist, you dont seem racist. However, you do not seem interested in programs to fix broken communities, and do not seem to feel that we, as white people, have benefitted from programs historically designed to help us and hurt ethnic minorities. and that IS racist  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would disagree with you there, mainly because I dont consider what the left is doing to be "identity politics". After the civil rights movement, there were still (and are still) a number of injustices towards ethnic/religious/sexual minorities. For a while people kind of just buried it while saying "racism is dead".

So now we combat that, and it can kind of look like judging people based on their skin, but its to combat the injustices still inherent in the system 

EDIT

the left isnt making "identity" a defining feature as to your future. The left is acknowledging that identity is still being used as a tool for discrimination, and in identifying it, are able to combat it.  </TEXT>

but besides, are comedies expected to only show good and acceptable behavior? If so, how is this show your target? are you rallying at FXX for "its always sunny".

	<TEXT> the bussing program totally worked though. the achievement gap was nearly closed after a generation of bussing, and it came back as soon as bussing programs were ended. People, having gained an education and employment, would be best situated to fixing their communities through self betterment. 

I live in the city. I dont know if it would impact me. I might find myself wanting to drive into a suburb one day. for any number of reasons. I have a job, I pay taxes, so it is my right to drive on roads I am a partial owner of. 

Actually, I like driving and walking through nice neighborhoods. I enjoy looking at cool houses, especially old ones. My girlfriend and I always pick out our favorites and judge people for their odd paint choices, and talk about what we would do differently.  So I would be affected

River west sounds like a nice neighborhood for you if you're not there already

I enjoy parts of riverwest, but I like living near the lake. not sure what your point was with that.

	<TEXT> So it's ok for apartments to do it. Clubs to do it. But not suburbs.

Yes. private property is not public space. You can stand on the sidewalk, but stay off my lawn.

This just strengthens the resolve of my argument. Suburbs should be allowed to restrict entry based on residence. Crime will drop.

There is no legal precedence for suburbs to have this power.

This sets a bad example for future laws.  I mean, it would never happen, it wouldnt be a huge jump to "if you live in x area, you need a pass to leave that area" to contain crime.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> clubs are privatly owned, and have a right to control membership. Same reason I have a key for my apartment, and not yours (or anyone elses). I have permission to enter private property, shown through a key.

Roads are public property. They are publicly funded, and are jointly owned by all of us. If you want a pay-to-play suburb, find a gated community, or gated apartment complex. If you live on a publicly funded, you don't have that luxury. 

EDIT
If you have no business being out in the burbs then why would you go? 

none of your business. Maybe I am walking my dog. maybe I am crashing with a friend, or hoping that a side road could help me avoid traffic. Its the same old "law abiding citizens have nothing to fear" slippery slope that I would rather not see in public places in America.

In short, clubs can maintain membership and be exclusive or open. who cares. a gated community requires permission, because its also private property. A suburb is build on public streets, and access cannot be restricted. End of story

	<TEXT> how would this work, logistically? roads would have to be totally blocked off with checkpoints. consider how many entries a lot of residential communities have, and how many suburbs would need to be covered. seeing as this would need to be 24 hour, or at least covering a night shift if we dont worry about daytime crime containment. So a ton of people to be hired, trained, etc. huge budget increase, unless we remove them from patrolling roads (letting drunk drivers and active criminals drive away free).

So now you've blocked off all side roads leading into burbs. How would we deal with the traffic increase, due to funneling people using nearby commercial areas ?

How do we prevent some level of racial profiling in the screening of who can or cannot enter the area.  

This sounds a lot like some old timey south african "show me your papers" policy, that will ultimately just restrict the movements of poor people  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> its not about social commentary. Im not saying LaLa land had to be about race relations in southern California.

as for the call back bit, I've seen old musicals, and did not feel that this held up. but thats just an opinion. Look at singing in the rain. Its goofy plot line is elevated by inspired dance scenes. Look at 7 brides for 7 brothers for the same thing. Look at Guys and Dolls, which has no dancing, but superbly written and performed songs. LaLa land has some inspired moments (the opening, the griffith park scene, the end) some good songs (emma stone's auditon, her and ryan gosling looking for her car) and some good scenes in it. 

LaLa land is good, but its *just* good. a solid 3.5/5, that id recommend to friends once its out on dvd/streaming </TEXT>

Wow. find where I said that? I don't think I even implied it. 

Hopefully the historically white sport of hockey never has a movie where a black guy is the lead. Right?

I cant think of any hockey movies with black people in major roles, and its silly to protect the representation of a group that is already heavily represented in media </TEXT>

	<TEXT> is that innately racist

it isnt just that gosling and stone are white. Its the whole depiction of LA. very few hispanic people in side or even background roles. If Chazelle lives in LA, then his surrounding world is filled with people of color in a variety of roles, even if they arent part of his inner circle. We don't see a lot of that throughout the film.

	<TEXT> no.

As I said, the movie itself isnt racist for that. It does contribute to a larger trend of whitewashing aspects of traditionally black culture, it leads an erasure of a part of black history.

the societal shift and erasure is racist. LaLa land itself is not </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i can speak towards the racism bit.

The movie takes place in LA. in fact, its right in the title. LA has a large non white populations, which arent well represented. By that measure, it does a poor job of representing LA and the racial makeup of the area.

As for the Jazz bit, jazz has historically been played and enjoyed by black people (though now its very popular with no one). Its not racist that he is a white guy wanting to play old jazz, but it does contribute to a sort of erasure to the history and culture of jazz, and that erasure (on a large scale, not just lala land) is racist. 

more on topic, I thought the film was fine when I saw it, but compared to other films (such as manchester by the sea, or even rogue one) I didnt think it was the best film I have seen, by a long shot </TEXT>
