i dont own a X so im just assuming here but the fan speed might be less with the bio mode, which would be the only reason i can think of for having 3 modes controlling outside air or inside air. unless its just so they can have the cool icon... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> bioweapon does should not, it would just be serious mode re circulation. read my post again. the X has 3 modes, outside air, re circulation and bio. the only mode that would take air from outside into the car and then exit back outside would be the first mode, outside air. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ok, thought i would respond here again after what happened to me today. last night i removed the USB from the car to edit some IDv3 tags. had some difficulty getting a grip on the drive do the wife putting it in slot 1...   anyhow did my edits, popped the drive back in slot 2 and while music showed... nothing would play. just sit and spin. so i though, awww rats. formatted the drive, copied everything back on. still nothing. tried a different drive, still nothing...    so looked up how to reboot the center screen and, TADA! the original drive now magically works.    double wheel hold for the win.    perhaps try that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> took my two muts on a short notice trip to the dog beach a few weeks ago. ended up just buying waterproof bed liner of amazon prime and having them sit in the rear hatch. while they were ok in back and no accidents, they were REALLY warm, even with 40% UV tint and the AC at max. also tried the roof open but it did not seem to help. ill try the 4Knines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> just like any car, its sucked into the filter and on to the blower motor where it escapes into the cabin again. unless one has the outside air mode turned on, then the car builds positive pressure and "generally" exits out a little rubber flap in the rear bumper.

but bioweapon mode should just be filtering the air in the car only. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i park my car outside, but leave the Smart Preconditioning setting on. it tries to remember when i drive the car and keeps the interior temp lovely.

sadly it does nothing for the door handles which get surprisingly hot after being in the sun all day.

also, as /u/majesticjg said, the pano roof REALLY moves air if you want to fast cool the cabin. </TEXT>
