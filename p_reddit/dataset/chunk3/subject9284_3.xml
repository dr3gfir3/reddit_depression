Also read:

Media reports that the plane went down in poor visibility are untrue.  The Tower manager at Martha's Vineyard (where the plane went down) say there were stars out and that visibility was between 10 and 12 miles that night.

The NTSB concluded that JFK Jr was described by his trainers as an "excellent", "methodical" and "very cautious" pilot.  If he was such a careful pilot why, when he got into difficulty, would he not have engaged the autopilot that was capable of flying the plane to within 100 feet of the airport?

JFK Jr was actually a highly experienced pilot with enough hours under his belt to qualify for an instructor's license.

The mysterious flight instructor.  Early reports of the accident said there was a flight instructor on boardthen all of a sudden the flight instructor disappeared from accounts of the accident.  It is just not a reasonable conclusion that Kennedy did not have a flight instructor on board.  He had flown a total of 310 hours and of those, 55 hours were at night.  He had only flown 45 minutes of those 55 hours at night without an instructor.  He was very cautious and had his wife and her sister on board so it just doesn't add up that he didn't have an instructor with him.

The logbook is missing.  The logbook would have recorded the presence of a flight instructor on the plane but has never been recovered.

The US Coast Guard reports that JFK Jr had contacted the tower on his final approach.  FAA regulations require that a search begins immediately when a plane hasn't landed within five minutes of reporting a final approach.  Why did it take a staggering 14 hours then for a search to commence?

The FAA went on to claim that there was never a communication from Kennedy to the tower despite all the immediate news reports to the contrary.

It took five days to find the plane. How come the Emergency Locator Transmitter which sends out a beacon signal in the event of a crash didn't alert the rescue party?  
Nothing in the NTSB report was mentioned about the ELT so we don't know if it was missing or even disabled.

The presence of a black box.  No other private non-jet plane in service at the time had a black box (the flight recorder), yet Kennedy had one installed on his plane. Why? Even more suspicious, the battery had been removed from the black box, meaning there was no record of any conversation in the cockpit.

The fuel valve. According to the NTSB report the fuel valve had been turned to OFF.  This could not have been done by accident.  Obviously the fuel valve is highly important and would never be turned off mid-flightdoing so at full speed would result in the engine dying in 45 seconds.  

Therefore the valves are fitted with a safety release button that must be pushed down and held while the valve is being turned.  Kennedy wasn't committing suicide so who turned the valve off?  The non-existent flight instructor </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Media reports that the plane went down in poor visibility are untrue.  The Tower manager at Martha's Vineyard (where the plane went down) stay there were stars out and that visibility was between 10 and 12 miles that night.

The NTSB concluded that JFK Jr was described by his trainers as an "excellent", "methodical" and "very cautious" pilot.  If he was such a careful pilot why, when he got into difficulty, would he not have engaged the autopilot that was capable of flying the plane to within 100 feet of the airport?

JFK Jr was actually a highly experienced pilot with enough hours under his belt to qualify for an instructor's license.

The mysterious flight instructor.  Early reports of the accident said there was a flight instructor on boardthen all of a sudden the flight instructor disappeared from accounts of the accident.  It is just not a reasonable conclusion that Kennedy did not have a flight instructor on board.  He had flown a total of 310 hours and of those, 55 hours were at night.  He had only flown 45 minutes of those 55 hours at night without an instructor.  He was very cautious and had his wife and her sister on board so it just doesn't add up that he didn't have an instructor with him.

The logbook is missing.  The logbook would have recorded the presence of a flight instructor on the plane but has never been recovered.

The US Coast Guard reports that JFK Jr had contacted the tower on his final approach.  FAA regulations require that a search begins immediately when a plane hasn't landed within five minutes of reporting a final approach.  Why did it take a staggering 14 hours then for a search to commence?

The FAA went on to claim that there was never a communication from Kennedy to the tower despite all the immediate news reports to the contrary.

It took five days to find the plane. How come the Emergency Locator Transmitter which sends out a beacon signal in the event of a crash didn't alert the rescue party?  
Nothing in the NTSB report was mentioned about the ELT so we don't know if it was missing or even disabled.

The presence of a black box.  No other private non-jet plane in service at the time had a black box (the flight recorder), yet Kennedy had one installed on his plane. Why? Even more suspicious, the battery had been removed from the black box, meaning there was no record of any conversation in the cockpit.

The fuel valve. According to the NTSB report the fuel valve had been turned to OFF.  This could not have been done by accident.  Obviously the fuel valve is highly important and would never be turned off mid-flightdoing so at full speed would result in the engine dying in 45 seconds.  

Therefore the valves are fitted with a safety release button that must be pushed down and held while the valve is being turned.  Kennedy wasn't committing suicide so who turned the valve off?  The non-existent flight instructor </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm getting a little lost in the Wikileaks Vault 7 Hierarchy.

Example is that some programs have full code (good idea?) and some have just name or text like this Taxman

I don't think anyone was surprised by the content message of 'CIA is collecting data'.  

Sure some of the tools are surprising.  

Some of the naming conventions are awesome! (project FaceDancer, RickyBobby, FightClub, RainMaker, MaddeningWhispers,)

But what should we, Based Pedes, be DOING with this data?  Any advice? </TEXT>
