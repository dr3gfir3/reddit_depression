	<TEXT> Wrap dress all the way! I have a few and they are great for nursing on the go. You could wear one with a crop tank underneath for some extra coverage.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lazy me checking in. I just buy the boxed chocolate chip cookie mix. The kind that you just need to add one stick of butter and 1 egg to. I melt the butter instead of soften it, and mix it with 1 cup old fashioned oats. I let that sit for 10 mins then add the egg, cookie mix, about 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup flax seed, 2-3 table spoons Brewers yeast and just enough water to bring it all together.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Had the same deep crack when LO was around 2 weeks. His pediatrician recommended applying a mix of 50% Desitin (really any diaper rash cream with zinc oxide) and 50% bacitracin ointment (found in the first aide aisle next to the neosporin). I used this after each feed and wore breast shields (the big ones that keep your clothing from touching your nipple, not the ones for feeding) to let the crack air dry. Blisters healed up nicely and we're still going strong at 7 weeks.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (recipe) Cheddar Lactation Biscuits </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Recipe for "Lactation Biscuits" that I made...for when you can't eat another lactation cookie! Let me know what y'all think! 

Ingredients: 
1 cup all purpose flour
1 cup old fashioned oats
1/4 cup flax seed
3-4 Tb Brewers Yeast
2 Tb dried parsley (optional)
1/2 tsp old bay seasoning (optional)
1/2 tsp Salt
1 Tb garlic powder

1 stick butter (cold-- cut into cubes)
4 ounces extra sharp cheddar (use more if you like it cheesy!)
1 egg
1/4 -1/2 cup cold water or milk

Directions:
Combine the dry ingredients in a food processor. Pulse until well combined and oats are almost pulverized. Add cold butter and cheese, and pulse until dough resembles wet sand. Beat egg with 1/4 cup water until well combined. While food processor is running, slowly add egg/water mixture. Add more water as necessary to get dough to combine until just sticky. Drop by the spoon full onto a greased cookie sheet and bake at 350 degrees F for 15-20 minutes, depending on size of biscuits.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm right there with you! 14 days pp, and DH is only home on the weekends for this month due to a mandatory job training that's only offered once every other year. Least he can do is take the 3rd diaper change during the night shift, but noooo... He's in bed next to me, kTFO'd.

Also, during my emergency c-section, I complained to DH, and the entire surgical staff present "Next time, we're just getting a puppy!"  </TEXT>
