	<TEXT> Therapy isn't free and I am working a minimum wage job. I can't afford it. I feel like a lot of my anxiety comes from having a low paying job and knowing I can do better; a few of my job interviews have rejected me for being 'too good'. Not overqualified, just too good. Whatever the fuck that means. So why won't anyone take me on?

I kind of got a bit off topic there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There actually is a system for this in the UK. You can do A levels which typically are the progression for goinh on to university, or an alternative is going to college. In the UK we have community colleges that teach vocational skills that directly equate to a profession, such as hairdressing, woodworking, plumbing, electricianing and stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have so many. My biggest at the moment is people that cough without covering their mouths. I just started a new job and the guy that sits next to me is a non-mouth-covering-heathen, and he's spluttering away constantly. It's like I can feel the bacteria being projectile launched from his mouth onto my face. 

Give it a week, I'll have the fucking worst cold; I am taking this incubation period to give thanks for the time I don't have utterly blocked sinuses and disgusting goop leaking from my face holes. </TEXT>

edit: so I stalked you and found that you're a 3D artist living in London. I am nearly in tears thinking about how shit my life is. I am 23, living in Sheffield and no-one will give me a job; I'm temping at minimum wage doing the most mind-numbingly boring data entry, wondering if maybe ending it all is the better option because I feel like it will never improve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What will voting do about house prices, realistically? They all say they'll build more houses and try to restrict buy-to-let. But what will any of it do? 

There should have been action taken years ago, before it got to the point that no-one can take on a house without getting into crippling debt, but the people it eventually mostly ended up affecting were still only in school at the time. </TEXT>
