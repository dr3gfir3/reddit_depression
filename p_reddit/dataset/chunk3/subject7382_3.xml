	<TEXT> Man I've had a hard time finding the right group for vICP farming. Best we've gone was bringing Ibomez down to 10% before the flesh enrages. Xbone. 
  
I agree about the traits on end game gear. To some extent that is how it's done, I think. I haven't gotten a training spc piece or anything like that. I do think that ZOS wants us to sprint around everywhere though. Everything is well-fitted. This game and its development boggles me man.

When it comes down to it. Dual wield for pvp. Destro for pve. Destro pvp works great too. Just tweak your bar skills to something like this: for pvp

	<TEXT> You're going to want to level as dps before going full on tank. Tank 1-VR16 would take ages. We don't want dis. Level tanks skills up while you're dps-leveling. And when you're ready for some mid-end-game content respec a few skills and Passives to focus on tanking. Say VR3 or so? Depends on player. As for race/class/build- all are viable. Some better than others for endgame...also depends on if you want full on tank, tank with some dps, dps with some tank, heals with tank yadayada...PVP?PVE? NB tanks are great for dps tanking and are very capable for end game content. DKs are the assumed tank class. Sorcs are less seen as tanks but are very,very, capable. Temps are heal tanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey again. I've experimented with both. Right now it's the ranged version as dps and tank. If I'm not currently engaged but I can summon the shade it will spawn on me and not begin attacking until I initiate. The teleport ability is quite nice in some boss mechanics and adds a layer of mobility that is really fun and intriguing to play around with. The teleport works from quite far away too, and I think is available for the majority of the ability's duration (only 1 teleport per summon).  In pvp it's also quite fun. As I like to 1vx, when say 3 reds pile on me I'll teleport off 20 yards or so and completely confuse them. Regain my composure and reinitiate my smackdown. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Been trying to acquire spell power cure and brands of imperium sets. RNG hates me. What would be more efficient, play on vet 16 for 16 gear at higher rates but lower completion time or normal 16 for 15 gear, lower drop rates and faster completion time? We finish it very quickly on normal. Done it around 20 times recently - 3 spell power drops and 2 imperium drops. For some reason it's also almost always well fitted. This game is fxking ridiculous with RNG. Plenty of harvest dirks and lost hatchets tho! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is true. They both work great though. Do what you feel is best for your personal enjoyment and growth. I respeced my stamblade at vet9 to a nightblade Magicka tank. And the best part is? I can respec back whenever I want. Just need around 13k gold which is easy to come by. Just do you homie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That structure isn't made of wood. So it's definitely made of concrete and steel. It's a 1A because of how tall it is... There aren't many applications where you can get that tall without sprinklers. NYE drunk now will be more thoughtful later kthxbai I luv u </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The main intent of fire sprinkler design ( or any life safety feature) is  limiting the time it takes for the fire to spread, therefore increasing the time for evac. Not to extinguish. Corridor fireproofing isn't necessary (tmk) unless is is explicitly part of the egress enclosure. 
  
This fire shouldn't have spread the way it did. This building type is non combustible IA construction. There must have been a significant problem with fireblocking and insulation type. One that would allow it to jump levels as quickly as it did. There really aren't that many combustible materials in this structure, crazy how fast it was all engulfed.

Ninja edit- sprinklers are req'd. Adding sprinklers allows for building height and area modifications. Ex- non sprinklered 3a construction (light wood) is maxed out at 65' high, 4 stories, and an area I can't remember off hand. With sprinklers it is allowable at 6 stories and 85' in height. Same concept applies to tall IA structures. </TEXT>
