	<TEXT> Posting this as my 1 month reflection on my AWSS. 

I was worried that this flashy piece of hardware would become a distraction at work. In fact it has kept me away from the smartphone.

Furthermore AW has become an integral part of my running regiment. A quick change of the band and the entire attitude of the AW changes. The versatility of this device leaves me very satisfied with my investment.

	<TEXT> I had this issue too when using strava. It appears to be fixed by changing the AW wake screen setting to "resume last activity." You just have to renter strava before you continue. Hope this helps!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you mean it goes back to watch homescreen when you raise your wrist? If so there is a setting for this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This frustrates me as well. Has anyone tried running strava and AW workout simultaneously?  </TEXT>
