But sure, the left will have to change a lot. Maybe try and understand why the hell Democrats didn't get off their asses to vote will be a good starting point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, do that. Ridicule him and his voters. Dismiss the possibility of him getting re-elected. Ignore the fact that almost every single poll got it wrong. Exactly as we did it in Italy with clown PM Berlusconi.
