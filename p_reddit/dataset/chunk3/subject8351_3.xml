	<TEXT> It's because the people that voted for the President ONLY care that it is the Republican party because the Democrats are full of "demons and gargoyles". Additionally, they are not thinking about the future, all they care about is the NOW and not their kids, or their kid's kids, and so on and so forth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Late to the party but remind me of when I went to Borat in the theater. 

There was an old couple in front of me, about 65-70 years old I bet, and they lasted only a few minutes of the movie before they walked out in a huff and puff. Might've been the part where Borat is talking about his sister. I don't think they realized it wasn't a documentary.

Good times.
