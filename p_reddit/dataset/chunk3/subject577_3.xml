	<TEXT> imgur.com is an image hosting website, originally created by a redditor. It's one of the major image hosting sites on the internet. By contrast, I've never heard of in1.ccio.co, and neither has my [web of trust](https://www.mywot.com/), which leads me to believe it is a very small website.

A mirror is just that, duplicated content hosted elsewhere. You can have a video on youtube, for example, mirrored to vimeo or other places. Mirrors are useful, because some people are at work or school, and the firewalls allow some websites through but block others.

Mirrors also hold sites accountable. For example, in /r/exmormon, many people maintain mirrors of the church essays, so if the church changes the essays, there is a record. This is because the mormon church is surprisingly duplicitous, and has no problem pretending that some things in the past never happened, and that the way things are now have always been. It's very *1984* ish. </TEXT>

There are prescribed medications that will make you grow taller, but only before your bone growth plates fuse. May want to talk to your doctor if your height really bugs you. Since you're 15, time is kind of of the essence, since most growth is done by the time you're 15/16. </TEXT>

Absence of *expected* evidence is good evidence of absence.

If I claimed I had a brontosaurus in my backyard, there is certain evidence that you would expect. Crushed trees, large piles of stool, giant lizard, etc.

Lacking that evidence would be evidence that my claim is false. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello,

Today, when I woke my computer up, my mouse worked just fine, but the keyboard was all fucky. The function buttons worked, as did the 9pad. However, all letter keys went to shortcuts. "S" brought up Cortana, "w" brought up the announcements, etc. One key locked the computer.

I removed the batteries, replaced, turned it off/on, etc.

I found a fix by copy/pasting "run" into Cortana, and running "osk" to get an on-screen keyboard. Typing on the on-screen keyboard, followed by the physical keyboard, fixed the problem.

What the hell happened? How can I prevent this from happening in the future? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, sorry, that's wholly incorrect. The Church Handbook of Instructions reads: 

A husband and wife who were married outside a temple *may be sealed* **after one full year** *from the time of the civil marriage.* However, this one-year waiting period does not apply to worthy couples in the following cases:

1. The temple in which the couple will be sealed is in a country that requires a civil marriage and does not recognize a marriage in the temple.

2. The couple live in a country where there is not a temple and the laws of the country do not recognize a marriage performed outside the country

3. An unchaperoned couple's travel to a temple will require one or more overnight stops because of distance.

4. The couple could not be married in a temple because one or both had not been a member of the Church for one year at the time of their civil marriage. They may be endowed and sealed any time after both have been members for at least one year.

5. The couple were married in a civil ceremony while awaiting the processing of an application that had already been submitted to the First Presidency for (a) the cancellation of the wife's previous sealing or (b) the husband's sealing clearance. The couple may be sealed any time after they receive notification from the First Presidency that the cancellation or clearance was granted. They must present the letter(s) at the temple in which they will be sealed.

In the first three cases, worthy couples should receive their endowment and be sealed as soon as possible after their civil marriage.

	<TEXT> If you have a ring ceremony, the LDS church says the following: 

Exchanging rings is not part of the temple marriage ceremony. However, couples may exchange rings after the ceremony in the room where the ceremony takes place. To avoid confusion with the marriage ceremony, couples should not exchange rings at any other time or place in a temple or on temple grounds. However, after their temple marriage, a couple may exchange rings at locations other than the temple. If such an exchange is made, the circumstances should be consistent with the dignity of their temple marriage. **The exchange should not appear to replicate any part of the marriage ceremony, and the couple should not exchange vows.** </TEXT>

That is a bad idea, legally speaking.

a rental agreement just with a list of rules, like tenant takes care of the yard, no loud parties, rules about pets, etc.

Sounds like a lease? How long does the rental agreement say you'll be there, or are you month-to-month? Does this rental agreement say that your roommate is obligated in any legal way to help fix the place up? </TEXT>
