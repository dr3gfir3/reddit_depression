	<TEXT> I have gamed on TVs for about 5 years now. I play all games on max difficultly and encounter no handicap or noticeable lag. anything tiny you probably compensate for unconsciously.

You seriously dont notice a difference and anyone who argues they are unplayable has never tried. I imagine if your a pro gamer you may have different opinions but pro gamers dont play in their living room. for everyone else it would be awesome. 

I look at people with these mind blowingly awesome rigs and tiny screens and I dont understand it. </TEXT>
