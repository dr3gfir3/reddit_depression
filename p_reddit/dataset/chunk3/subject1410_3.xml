When someone on my friends lists starts playing a game, the notification pops up and I press it - the chat opens.

But if my friend INVITES me to the game and I click the notification, nothing happens and I have to manually open the chat and accept.

I feel like it should either be switched around or both should open the chat. </TEXT>

I can ignore steel and m0e since... well, more toxic players is hard to find on the NA scene, but everyone else? As I see it they are mostly just getting completely trashed by him.

So, why the hate? </TEXT>

We have three different kinds in our shop at the moment. Two of them are just regular beans that are roasted to be released around the holiday with a special label on it and the third one has flavors added to it.

Thank god the last one comes pre ground in the bags. It's flavored with cardamom, cinnamon and orange. I find it horrendous to drink, but people seem to like it.

So, what about you guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, at the tea and coffee shop I work at, we get maybe one or two calls a day from people who have ordered stuff and haven't received it yet. In nine out of ten cases it is quickly solved by telling them that we don't have what they ordered in stock at the moment. But not this time.

*Me*: Welcome to *company name* it's subject1410.

Customer on the phone: Hi! I ordered a grinder from you a while back and haven't received it yet. I was just wondering when it's going to arrive.

*Me*: Alright, alright, let's see what we can do here. 

Him: Yeah, because I ordered it two years ago.

*Me*: ...excusemewhat?

Him: Yeah.

*Me*: Tw... two years ago?

Him: Yes. And I haven't received it yet.

*Me*: Uhm.... Ok. Let me write down your name and number and I'll see what I can do.

I stood there with the phone in my hand for a few minutes before I got to my senses and went back out into the store and told my boss. He just sighed and said "I know who it is. Just ignore it. I don't get why he keeps calling, we've done everything we can." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Very long time before chunks load? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-18 01:09:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Since the update (maybe even somet time before) I've had major issues with chunks taken a huge amount of time before loading when joining a new world.

If I, for example, join a world for a challenge, the first 50x50x# chunks loads fine (except when using rally blade), but it takes without a doubt 30-45 seconds before the chunks in my direction loads. So I can be stuck with my mount in an invisible wall for a period of time before being able to continue.

If I use a rally blade and end up at the same place as the rally blade is placed, I am placed in some kind of "limbo" until the chunks load.

Anyone else having this problem? </TEXT>

And I don't want to go to the restaurants around the area and buy my lunch since it's quite expensive in the end. So I wonder, what are your best suggestions on lunch to bring to job?

	<DATE> 2015-10-30 12:24:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few months back, I met this fantastic girl. She's beautiful, she's smart, she's quirky, we clicked instantly. We met a few times before we decided to go exclusive. Not a real relationship, but it was the two of us. She made me feel better. A lot better. With her, most of my anxiety was gone and I didn't want to hurt myself.

She had moved to my city because she was sick of the town she grew up in and wanted to get away. So she got a job here and moved in to a room that she rented. After a while, the job didn't go so well, her boss was being an ass to everyone and she had more anxiety going to job than she had had before. So she quit.

No job means no money which means she can't pay rent. So she's decided to move again, to her sister. And that is like 400 miles away from here. And she's leaving today. Her train leaves in like 3.5 hour. I don't know if we'll ever see each other again. Because neither her or me can handle a long distance relationship, so we decided to not continue anything.

And I just don't know what to do. I'm almost out of tears, I don't know what the fuck to do. I just want to go away. Just do bad things to myself that I've promised everyone that I won't do again. Shit, fuckfuckfuckfuckfuck. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After seeing [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Damnthatsinteresting/comments/3f8ypy/normal_vision_vs_redgreen_colorblind/) and [this youtube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBbCsNS8nco), I wonder - how is it possible for people with normal color vision to know which colors a color blind can and can not see? And how can we know that *this* is how it looks like to a color blind person?

And then - how can we correct their vision (as in the youtube clip)? How do glasses like that work and how can they "correct" the vision? Since we can't explain orange to someone who doesn't know what it looks like, we can't know if the person is seeing orange as we see it when getting a "correction", right? </TEXT>
