	<TEXT> I'm basically at the same point as you. But I also think that SF, especially the online mode, doesn't let a beginner realize what he does wrong. I'm still pretty new (~60 hours) and I'm getting destroyed by cross-overs, just jump-in spam or shoryouken shenanigans. It's so frustrating to lose to those people dominating you with these gimmicks, which work most of the time because I'm a beginner... :( Also Tech-Attempts and when the timing for grabs is, is really non-understandable for noobs like me. Often a frustrating game to learn. Whereas a MOBA rewards you constantly even if you're losing. And if you're not such a good player, your teammates can help you out and give advice. No need to learn combos or frame data. If you just play enough, you'll get it eventually. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also if you really want to go for parries I wouldn't suggest a Buckler/Dagger setup. When I see those people I always play super carefully or spam jump attacks and guard-breaks. I personally like to parry with a) Rapiers because I'm used to the frames by now, and b) Fast Small Shields. According to the frame data these things gave so many frames, fast startup and fast recovery. Good for Backstep-parrying, Setup-parrying and the "Double Parry-bait". Of course you can also parry on prediction and most importantly, they do not scream "I really wanna parry you!", so enemies will play more recklessly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree to some extend. But there's one thing I don't get about people complaining about humanoid, magic res and uncreative enemies and bosses. What can FROM do to be creative? They have a lot of bosses in DS2. Making each of them completely different is just plain impossible. If they don't make the enemies overpowered in some way, any experienced DS player will rush through all the DLCs and their bosses. But I still find that they shouldn't copy-paste bosses like the Smelters or the Asylum Demons from DS1. That's just lazy. :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rapiers are slower than the parrying dagger but have more frames. Parrying dagger is more like a medium shield with more parrying frames which start earlier. Correct me if I'm wrong.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but the "crazy challenge" was often too random, you could spawn in a shitload of enemies and then it's basically over if you don't have the gear to deal with it... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zone 3 is insanely annoying, sometimes you spawn with like all the monster aggro + Blue Dragon. Then there's nothing you can do most of the time... When I approach it non hardcore, I try to get a Weapon ASAP. Preferably a Rapier, a Bow or a Longsword/Spear  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well it led to me having to use the Jesters Armor because I get backstab fished all the time. Also Super heavy Str Weapons are way worse than daggers after the nerfs. 50% of the people I meet only BS fish with them. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The DLC Weapons are crazy good for PVP! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Mainly the Sanctum Crossbow, with minimum requirements and the 2 handed special attack it deals massive damage, it homes, it's freaking fast and people always roll too early or not at all because they don't expect it. Finishing people off with it is so satisfying. The Puzzle Sword has a nice moveset but it can be parried. So be careful with all the (Monestary) Scimitar shenanigans going on right now. Yorgh's Spear is hard to play because it's rather slow but it's fun nonetheless. Sanctum Shield is just a better Black Witch's Staff but the defense values are nice too. I couldn't really try the Sanctum Mace so maybe you guys can tell me if it's any good. Not really happy with the DLC spells apart from Dark Greatsword which is great.

Edit: Apparently the Black Witch's Staff is better than the Sanctum Shield so sorry for that. </TEXT>
