	<TEXT> I dropped acid a few times back in college. Made me a little more socially awkward, but oh my god did it open my mind. I'm absolutely the last person to advocate taking drugs but I learned so much about the universe and life during those trips. 

I have some stories if anyone is interested. 

/u/MirrorVision and /u/frenchybop have requested some stories so here we go. 

First Trip:
My first one was done out of a vape pen and it hit quick, there was no waiting for the come up. It was one and done. It was my only day trip and the colors were unbelievable. I felt silly, smiling for the entire duration with my room mate at the time. During that time I started to realize that there was so much left within the spectrum of existence that we couldn't comprehend in our normal consciousness. My most vivid memory was the trees being straight up BLUE and they all seemed to sway together. Beautiful. 


Best Trip:
This was my first night trip and I was with one of my best friends. He and I took it normal (blot sheets) and once it hit, the stars were so bright that I remember just going outside and staring at them and realizing we weren't alone. We couldn't be. The odds were too great for anyone to disagree. It was at this moment that I came to the greatest realization of my life. Cows. Cows brought me to tears. Because I thought about how we use every part of the cow to its fullest extent (except maybe bones but idk) and we breed them to consume in their entirety. 

Then I thought about how other planets way out in space must have some kind of harvester animal and I tried to imagine it but I couldn't! It was the craziest shit in the world and it blew my mind. The whole concept of "Space Cows" sounds so outrageous but there's no way they don't exist. My brain couldn't even picture them either, like I couldn't comprehend them. They could be in 4 or 5 other dimensions that humans can't even perceive. 


Worst Trip (and my last one):
Rather than the apartment setting of my previous trips, this one was in a large old house (essentially a trap house) built in the 30s. Visuals were very mild, with some wavy textures that gave an indication that everything was vibrating (at least for me) and I just remember the girl we were with having the most intense trip of her life, and it scared me. It was like seeing what can happen when you do acid every weekend. It took me to a place where I honestly couldn't talk. I couldn't think of anything to say. I've researched it out and I'm pretty sure I experienced what's called an [Ego Death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_death). 

I remember my buddy trying to get me to be more social by asking me, "Hey man those shoes are cool where'd you get them?" And I just couldn't respond. I shrugged and mumbled something incoherent then went to the stairwell to lay down (I don't know why). Laying down and closing my eyes only made things worse as I could now hear constant, very loud whispers of what I thought were words but I couldn't understand them. 


Sorry for the wall of text here guys lol. It does feel really good to get this stuff out there. I've never told anyone this. Not sure if this was the place to do so but ohhhh well. 

TL;DR: LSD can lead to anything from the discovery of Space Cows, to hearing voices of a 1930s trap house.  </TEXT>
