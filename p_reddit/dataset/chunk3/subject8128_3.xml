	<TEXT> They don't run into the vehicle to be aggressive. They probably do it because they are confused and aren't able to accurately judge the speed of the vehicle. Bright lights doesn't help either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, I'm sure they would like to but it doesn't really make sense for police to use them as regular patrol vehicles for a few reasons which I can maybe reason out because I spent a few years as military police.

1. You're supposed to be licensed to drive those vehicles (at least in the military). It doesn't make sense to waste the time and money on an officer just so they can cruise around in a vehicle they don't need. 

2. Those vehicles can be difficult to maneuver in civilian traffic. They have major blind spots, the turning radius can be horrible, you also may not even realize it if you cause minor damage to property or injure someone. Don't even start on parking.

3. They require specialized repair. I don't think Bubba's garage is certified to repair those vehicles so again it's going to cost time and money to do even minor repairs. They probably aren't even capable of doing a tire change locally. 

The only time I ever used those vehicles in a stateside mission (not training) was to guard a downed tank from a training accident and to guard checkpoints in the time shortly after 9/11 and we had the capability to repair easily and most everyone was licensed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They probably wouldn't be using an APC as a patrol vehicle though. Presumably just in riot control or as a SWAT vehicle.

They may 'be intimidating but they serve mostly as protection. </TEXT>

clarification - this was years ago, before SHARP became a big thing so it may be different now. </TEXT>
