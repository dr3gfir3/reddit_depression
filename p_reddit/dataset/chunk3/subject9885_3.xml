	<TEXT> I applied a tool I learnt at work to my happiness, outcomes based accountability. Where you figure out some broad, generic outcomes that you want to achieve: to be more healthy, happy and productive in my case. And then work back to what you should do to achieve these: exercising for at least 200minutes a week, seeing friends regularly, setting aside time for hobbies etc etc.. And then defining how you will know if you have achieved these (measurable indicators, so easy for minutes of exercise, a bit vaguer for social and happiness indicators but you can get quite good proxies) it's pretty dry, but it really helped me focus on the steps I needed to take to get to my broader outcomes. There's more you can do with the tool over time - after building a solid baseline you can be more reflexive for example about habits / patterns </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For casual sex they don't need it any more than men - that being said, in western culture in general men and women see an emotional connection as important for a long term relationship, so depending on what someone is looking for it is more or less important. I guess it's about context  </TEXT>
