	<TEXT> I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in a crowded train station and I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>
