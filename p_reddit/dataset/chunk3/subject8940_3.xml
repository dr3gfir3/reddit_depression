	<TEXT> There is a series by Susan Wittig Albert - The Cottage Tales of Beatrix Potter.  The story is not told completely by the animals, but they do play a large role in the stories. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Robin Hobb's Assassin's Apprentice might be up that alley.

The Temeraire series by Naomi Novik if you don't mind some dragons and alternate history.

If you like Ranger's Apprentice and haven't tried Rick Riordan I would suggest him.  All of his series are pretty fun and engaging. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To Kill a Mockingbird was one of my favorites and I loved it in high school.  I actually liked a great many of the books we were required to read, but I was the oddity that had read most of them before we were told they were required.  Jane Austen, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dumas, Animal Farm, Dracula and Frankenstein...  

I did not love Turn of the Screw and I still hate having to read plays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever tried Christopher Moore?

Also would suggest Douglas Adams.

Slightly further afield but you might like to try Martha Grimes' Richard Jury mysteries.  Jury ends up with Melrose Plant and some very British humor accompanies the investigations. </TEXT>
