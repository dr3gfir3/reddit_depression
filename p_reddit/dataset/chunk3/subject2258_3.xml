	<TEXT> Working on an inbound call center for small business customers with a "major telecommunications" company! Hated every single minute of it. I actually had a panic attached one day with the thought of logging on to that phone. I left that day and was under a dr's care for stress induced depression and quit one month later once my dr released me. Never regretted quitting for one moment!  </TEXT>
