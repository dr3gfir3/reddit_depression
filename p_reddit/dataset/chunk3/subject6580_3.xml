	<TEXT> Oh. All the males on both my parent's sides were Chicago tradesmen; plumbers, electricians, linemen, etc... and I grew up with a "buy it to last" ethic. I also moved to semi-rural Wisconsin seven years ago, where boots and jeans are considered casual wedding attire. I work in an office and wear slacks and wingtips to work, but when I'm off, I'm still very much of a Levi's and Thorogood kinda guy. When I go to "nicer" family functions in a polo and some Sperry's, I still get the occasional "What are you, a fag?" but that may just be my family. Point is, well, I don't have one. :/ </TEXT>

The sole will be great for those long hours, they don't look half-bad, and if you treat the leather, it'll resist a lot of those fluids and you can get more than a couple years out of them.

	<TEXT> For the price, they're not worth it, in my opinion. They are nicely-styled boots, of which I've had two pairs - one harness, one side-zip. The leather tended to crease quite poorly, had too much loose grain, and the stitching was sub-par for the price. If you find a model of theirs that you like, chances are you can find a similar style made by a better manufacturer for a better cost. </TEXT>
