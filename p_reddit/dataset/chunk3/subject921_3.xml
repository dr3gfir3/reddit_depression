	<TEXT> **Spicer stopped short of suggesting that the Obama administration deserved blame** for re-upping Flynns clearance in 2016 despite his paid speaking gig in Russia. 


Because Trump's die-hard supporters will do that for him.


But **he did explain that the Trump administration had not run its own check on Flynn, assuming that the Obama-era security clearance would have been sufficient.**


What was it you were saying about Donny's "intuition"?


We trust that when you were cleared the first time, if you were cleared on December 15th or January 20th, that you were still -- that your background check still cleared. Every individual [who] came into this White House either applied for a security clearance or had one. Spicer said. Why would you rerun a background check on someone who was the head of the Department of Defense intelligence agency that had and did maintain a high-level security clearance?


Do you and Spicey also feel this way about Hillary's security clearance? </TEXT>
