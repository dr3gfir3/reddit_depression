	<TEXT> Good concept! Watch your sentences, though:

"the old lady with the uncomfortable scent boisterously claimed"

That's a helluva load of words in one sentence. Try to break it up and move it around a little:

"Aren't you the cutest little baby in the world!" the old lady cooed. A stench clung to her like a second skin.

Something like that, to break it up and give the readers something to work with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your help! And I'll definitely keep everyone updated.

I've decided to write an original story with some familiar themes. I thought about it and realized that my idea was just a springboard for an entirely new story- while the story will take cues from some of my muses, it will be a stand-alone.

And I won't give away the story it was supposed to be, but once my story drops...let the guessing games begin! Thanks again for your help; I appreciate the input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm considering (with the author's permission) writing a story based on his own r/nosleep story. It would make no mention of the connection and would be 100% in character. Would that have a place on the page, or upset the delicate balance of what is "believable"? Thanks all!

	<TEXT> My all time favorite is FireRed/LeafGreen. It has all of the nostalgia of the original games, but with better mechanics and more Pokemon.

It terms of newer games, Black/White is a step up from the others because it succeeds where Diamond/Pearl/Platinum failed. Interesting graphics, a more compelling story, and new Pokemon.

EDIT: HG/SS also rocks my socks. </TEXT>

*GO RAVENS*!
________


Dawn.


The sun peeked through the windows as I stood at the altar of the church, smoking a cigarette. The cigarette tasted disgusting, but I looked like an absolute badass so I was struggling through it.


The monster was due to appear any minute now, and I had my shotgun at the ready. If my plan worked, it would be the most epic day of my life. I could write all of my college essays about it. The birth of my first-born child would be welcomed with an apathetic nod, because nothing would be as beautiful as this moment. If my plan didnt work, Brewster and I would both be dead. You win some, you lose some.


There was the loud bang of a slammed door somewhere from within the church, and I whipped around to see Garden Tool slinking from the front of the church, black eyes shining. He wore a massive grin of needles. That hunched, gray form was nothing human or animal and he dragged something along behind him in one of his claws.


He was dragging an unconscious Brewster behind him, my best friend completely out but otherwise unharmed. For a minute I thought he was dead, but then I saw the copious amounts of drool dribbling from his mouth. Typical Brewster sleep behavior.


As Garden Tool neared me, his eyes flickered and he noticed the shotgun in my hand. He hesitated for a moment before leaving Brewster behind on the floor and slinking closer.


You never said no weapons, I said nervously, as if using logic would appeal to a gray dog-human monster.


He hissed a laugh. *I fear no weaponnn. Prepare for deathhh*.


Garden Tool tensed, looking ready to pounce, and I released an incredibly pathetic whimper of fear. I caught myself, attempting to remain stoic.


This isnt a regular gun, I managed, relatively close to peeing myself in fear. Garden Tool suddenly seemed to notice that I had modified my gun with something. Dont ask, Im in AP Engineering. I call this baby the Baptizer 2000. Not only does it shoot bullets, but holy water too.


*Your pathetic religion wont kill meee* Garden Tool hissed with laughter once more, squinting in delight. He moved from his crouched position, and my fear dampened. He was amused. *God is dead*.


Dont worry, Im an Atheist.


*Everything after death is nothinggg. Darknessss. Life is meaningless*.


You know, Ive been doing a lot of thinking. I paused to exhale smoke from the cigarette, attempting not to choke and start tearing up. Ive been contemplating life.


*Sucideee*? he asked, hopefully.


No. Ive been thinking about all of the joys of life, and what makes all of our struggles meaningful. You couldve heard a pin drop; Garden Tools expression became slightly confused. I know that religion might not hurt youbut you know what will? I paused, letting it soak in.


Love. Love will kill you.


Although he tried to hide it, I saw his expression flicker into one of absolute fear, and then switch immediately back to an expression of amusement. *Love? Love? Emotion is nothingggg*.


You keep on saying that things are nothing. Youre wrong. Love is everything. Back in my house? The shotgun and armchair hurt you because Brewster and I were protecting one another. Mildreds rosary worked because her grandfather gave it to her. A lot religious items work because people feel a sense of love within religion.


As I ended my speech, Garden Tools eyes widened. Damn, I shouldve written my thesis paper on that shit. It was pure gold. Looking forward, this speech weighed more importance than whatever theses I was planning to write in the future.


Garden Tool, youre right. Religion wont hurt you. But you know what will? I cocked the gun. This, and 100 pounds of explosives. Filled with love. Platonic love. Bro love.


Garden Tool didnt react; I knew that he didnt want me to see his confusion. I cocked my head at the Jesus statue behind me. He glanced at the statue, its arms held out in a welcoming gesture arms now full of dynamite, dynamite that I bought using my mothers credit card at a shady downtown Baltimore weapons shop that Ray Lewis probably frequented. The dynamite gathered in a string that lead down to directly in front of me. Garden Tool couldnt contain his shock; he whipped his head at me with an expression of pure fury. His nostrils flared.


He lunged at me, claws out and jaws agape, and I shot him square in the mouth with a combination of holy water and bullets. Garden Tool seemed to freeze and drop in mid-air like lead; crumpling on the ground and frothing from the mouth. An inhuman gargle ran from his jaws. He attempted to rise; I shot his back and he crumpled up, howling.


I stepped up to him, tossing my gun aside. I daintily held my cigarette in my fingertips. I was glad to stop smoking it; smoking tasted like shit.


Youre reign of terror is over, Garden Tool, I said. Never again will you prey on people who steal Pokmon games from other people.


Through his gurgling and writhing, I saw something slip from one of his eyes, as clear as day. A tear.


My heart fell. I wasnt as badass as I wouldve liked to think I was, despite the despicable nature of the creature. I blotted out the cigarette out on one of the chairs and aimed the gun at Garden Tools head.


*Au revoir*, asshole, I said. It was the best I could do.


After the deed was done, I set about removing Brewster from the church. I was planning on triumphantly carrying him from the church, the building blowing up behind me, but after my change of heart on blowing up a church and my little to none arm strength, I ended up pulling his dead weight by his foot. I had to bump the door open with my back and drag him through, but as I was doing so the door accidentally closed on his head and he woke his a start.


He held the door open, sitting up and blinking groggily at me. Dude? He suddenly snapped back into consciousness and jumped up, crushing me in a massive hug. BRO! YOURE ALIVE!


We pulled back. Ive never been more alive!


Tears sprung up in his eyes. And you saved me, bro.


We fist bumped. Hey, Brewster. Thats what I do best.


We walked out from the church and to where Mildred was waiting outside, leaning against Brewsters car. After taking a tour through more of the unsavory parts of Baltimore, trolling for explosives, she wasnt exactly happy with me. She studied us.
All of those Reddit weirdos want you two to become a couple.


Excuse me? I asked. Were just brothers from another mother.


She sighed and cocked an eyebrow. So, did you kill him? I thought there was supposed to be an explosion and you walk out of the church triumphantly.


Hes dead, but no explosion. I paused, shrugging. I really didnt want to blow up a church. Also, I guess Im not one for theatrics and death in the same situation.


She frowned. Tell that to those weird nosleep people.


Suddenly, the church exploded behind me, filling the air with a massive boom and an upward rush of smoke and fire. The three of us jumped behind the car, watching the churchs frame burn and crackle.


My eyes widened. That wasnt supposed to happen!


Brewster patted me on the back. Yo, dude, dont worry about it. The Korean people can fix it. Mildred glared at him.


We sat back against the car and all took deep breaths. I nodded at Brewster. Well, buddy, everything turned out okay.


He nodded in return. It totally did. Want to go back to your house and play some more Pokmon?


Most definitely, brother.


I want my game back after youre done, Mildred snapped. And I want another pineapple.


So the three of us drove Brewsters completely destroyed car back to my house, stepped through the busted-in front door, and sat down to play Pokmon. Even though our adventure amounted to several million dollars in damage and probably months of therapy for Brewster and I both, I had my friend by my side. And Mildred, I guess. And when it comes right down to it, religion or no religion, afterlife or no afterlife, good life or bad life, the people you love are all that matter.


At that moment, life was good.


I looked up from the Pokmon game for a moment to see Brewster on the other side of the room and looking out my busted up front door.


Yo, dude, he said, scratching his head. Why is your neighbor wearing a suit?


THE END


______
*Well, thats a wrap! Thank you, thank you, thank you for staying with me through my crazy adventure and supporting my friends and I. Like any good tale of life, my story must end with this. Although Ive been on more adventures, I relinquish a quote to you you either die a hero, or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. Im not Batman or anything, but you catch my drift.*


*I have a couple of friends who might need a throwaway Reddit account for their life experiences, so I may hand this account over to them, but well see. Regardlessthank you! Brewster and I will be inviting you to our weddingPSYCH! Ha. You wish we were more than bros.*


Thats all, folks,
