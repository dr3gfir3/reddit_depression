	<TEXT> I have some friends in Poland an that is absolutely true. One of my friends is working in factory and they have a lot of Ukrainians there. But guess what, they have the same roots and culture and are very hard-working and they like living in Poland. On the other hand, Poland took muslim refugees and you know what? They fled couple days afterwards to Germany and France because they had to WORK and not live on welfare.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've read an article about poverty in USA. It stated that we are spending one trillion dollars on anti-poverty measures and yet 40 million people live in poverty. Also this quote made me think: "By that measure, the War on Poverty has been a huge failure. Despite $24 trillion in anti-poverty spending, self-sufficiency has not improved in 45 years". That just shows in practice that Reagan was right. Welfare and handouts make people lazy. That made me into a conservative.  </TEXT>

In left talk shows like TYT they hate money in politics, yet Soros is giving billions to left wing organizations, gave 24 million dollars in order to defeat Bush in 04. He made his fortune on currency manipulation and wants to abolish countries and we know and calls himself a "Messiah".  </TEXT>
