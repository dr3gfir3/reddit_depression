	<TEXT> I can kind of relate, I get nervous when I'm on the bus too. But even more than that, when im walking on a busy street I think everyone in their cars is looking at me. It's terrible. When I hear a car honk, I think they're honking at me, and I get startled and scared. Of course they're just beeping at a car in front of them or whatever, it just sucks. What kind of strangers did you talk to? What did you say? Where were you whe you did this? I'm sorry if I'm asking a lot of questions, I just really want advice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it's easy to say "calm down," but for someone who has gone several days without talking to anyone, this is a big deal for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played three different intramural sports. No one just really seemed like taking the next step. I'm sure there's something else I could be doing but it's really hard for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're probably right. I, being about 4-5 years younger, probably looked a lot less intimidating to approach than someone his own age.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do it. I understand it isn't easy. It doesn't make someone a bad person if they don't do it, just realize it can make a huge impact that people not in the no friends situation don't really understand.  </TEXT>
