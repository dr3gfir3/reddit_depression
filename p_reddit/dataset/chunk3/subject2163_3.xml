	<TEXT> Thanks for the quick reply! Glad to know that it's most likely a software issue and not a bad ssd. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After I install Windows updates and restart I get the Unmountable Boot Volume Error. The only way I found to fix the issue was to revert to a previous build. I have Windows installed on a RAID SSD if that has any relevance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The wendler I follow is a 5-3-1. Meaning you take percentages of your max and use those each week with a different rep scheme. First week is 3 sets of 5 of gradually increasing weight. The 2nd will be 3 sets of 3 with slightly heavier weights gradually increasing and then your final week would be 1 set of 5, 1 set of 3 and then your very last would be an AMRAP (The last set of every lift will be an AMRAP). You can use that system for your bench, squat, dead and OHP. After each of your main lifts you'll do accessory movements. For example, after squatting you can do RDL's and Bulgarian split squats. I do back, chest and shoulders the same day after my OHP. Considering you have shoulder problems, and I'm not a PT, I don't want to suggest anything as far as your shoulder days go. As for your core you are correct, doing things like reverse kettle bell crunches, barbell rollouts and pallof presses are just a few. Core strength is what is going to make all your lifts go up. Just sharing what has been successful for me! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would look into a wendler program. As a beginner, I think you should seperate your squat and dead. Your bench, squat and dead are very important. I would really focus on building up your base strength and really improve your main lifts. Don't forget about core either! Good luck! </TEXT>
