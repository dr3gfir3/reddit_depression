	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, obviously this is a hypothetical question. Last night, I had a dream that some lovable scamps broke into a fenced-in area of my property, and were getting into my glittery purple El Camino. I caught them and wouldn't let them leave while I called the police and waited for them to arrive. I didn't restrain them, but I yelled or something. 

At some point, it occurred to me that I might be crossing the line. I figured it was false imprisonment or kidnapping or something. But when I woke up, I was curious- if someone (especially a minor) breaks into your home or property, what are you legally allowed to do with them (when self-defense isn't applicable)? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The power went out in a portion of my house today, so I went to check the breakers. All the breakers were fine, but when I tested the AFCIs, one of them tripped and smoked and the other wouldn't reset. Those suckers are expensive, but replacing both restored the lights and some of the outlets. But the GFI was tripped and wouldn't reset. 


There are three outlets (including the GFI) protected by it, and none of them work. I tried disconnecting the load from the GFI, and it still didn't reset. I tried replacing it, and I could see that it's getting power (the new one had an LED- neat!), but it's still not resetting. I'm out of ideas, any advice? 

edit: I just replaced the batteries in my multimeter; I'm getting 123VAC coming from the line.

**edit 2: I'm really not sure why it's working now, but I took EVERYTHING apart (took out the breakers, removed the GFI, checked the connections and cabling) in frustration and put it back together, and it's working now. Thank you for your help!**  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hope this is a good place to ask this question; I'll happily delete the question if I'm wrong.

I just landed my dream job in the DC area, but I own my home in California. So of course I'll need to sell my house- hopefully before the move, but I'm not holding out hope for that. I've done some research online, but I really can't make sense of the conflicting advice that I'm reading. 

So I hope you all won't mind the stupid question, but how do I sell my home? Do I just call a couple of realtors and "interview" them before signing on? Do I have to pay anything up front, or do I pay them (and the fees and stuff) out of the proceeds from the home? 

Thanks for any answers or tips. I'll be moving my wife and kids after the sale, so I really don't want to screw this up or cause unnecessarily delays.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [California] Traffic accident; errors in police report that favor the other party. What do I do about that, and what does the law say about such accidents? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-10 07:18:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A week-ish or so ago, my wife was in a traffic accident. She was in the primary lane, and another vehicle was in the merging lane and was driving roughly parallel to her. Traffic was heavy, but my wife was maintaining a constant speed. The other party sped up and tried to swerve in front of my wife, but hit her twice on the front/right fender, leaving marks in two spots in the side of her car. The officer correctly notes in his report that the other car sideswiped her. The other car then entered my wife's lane halfway, then pulled over. When she rapidly entered my wife's lane and braked, they collided again, but there's nearly no damage from that one since they both reduced their speed immediately.

The police report (http://imgur.com/a/Fw6mJ [1] ) lists my wife as the cause of the accident. The officer seemed to take the other driver's story at face value, but it doesn't seem to explain how the damage could have happened to the side of both cars. The officer also took at face value that the other car was ahead, which isn't factual; that would indicate that my wife intentionally rammed the other car.

I feel that CVC 21658a is very clear, when it says "A vehicle shall be driven as nearly as practical entirely within a single lane and shall not be moved from the lane until such movement can be made with reasonable safety." The other driver did not signal, did not check her blind spot and turned into my wife.

The deputy will (hopefully) be calling me tomorrow to discuss my perspective. Are there any issues with his report that I can address? Can he document the other driver's statements as fact, even though no witnesses stopped and the officer didn't see what happened? Both drivers have differing statements; how can the officer make a definitive statement of what happened when he only has two conflicting stories?

**TL;DR: Car swideswiped my wife while merging; officer said it's my wife's fault.**

The dad in me wants to restrict that and make him go outside or find other things to do, but I really don't know what's the best thing to do in this case. We try to understand that he might feel withdrawn, but we're not sure if allowing him to actually withdraw is causing more harm.

We just want to help him, but we're not quite sure how to best do that. He wants to be social, but doesn't seem to feel comfortable in social situations- he's gotten a lot better after the diagnosis and treatment started, but he still struggles with it. I'd really appreciate any thoughts or advice. If nothing else, it's good to talk about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know those scams you get in your email? The ones where someone wants you to smuggle millions of dollars out of Nigeria, just by giving them your bank account information? I fall for those all the time.

It's called scambaiting, and it's a fun game. But it can also be beneficial. Basically, you're keeping the scammers busy so they can't target someone that might ACTUALLY fall for their tricks. And you'd be surprised what they'll do, if you promise them enough money! I've had scammers sing to me, send me pictures, convert to "The Church of the Holy Phallus"... anything to carry on their scam. 

/r/scambaiting will help people like us bait the lads more effectively by sharing tips, resources and stories about some of the best exchanges. It'll be a place to swap photoshopped identification and western union receipts, plane tickets- anything that you might need to keep them on the line. I need a few mods to help me get the sub off the ground. Let me know if you're interested; I'll just need you mother's maiden name, bank account number and PIN.

	<TITLE> "You looking at me funny, private?" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-26 22:45:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Years ago, I was in the army as a private; I was an E-nothing, so I had no rank and even less authority. So I was on convoy with this Sergeant- an E5 that had some chip on his shoulder for several not-very-good reasons. But he outranked me, so I did what he said. The convoy was at home-station, and it was simply moving equipment from one part of the post to another. It wasn't a combat convoy, and there was no traffic to worry about. 

The problem was, the guy was a dick. At that time, I was going through some rough times at home. My wife had severe medical problems and we just had a baby. So, naturally, I was tired as hell. While we were driving, I nodded off. I tried, I really did, but missing so many nights of sleep took its toll. He slammed on the brakes and proceeded to chew me out for falling asleep. Fine, I can take it. But he decides that it's not going to end there. When we got to our destination, he gave me another ass-chewing and had me doing push-ups to the point of muscle failure. Okay, maybe a little overboard, but it wasn't my place to argue. And, after all, I **did** fall asleep. So I took it, let him do what he wanted, and moved on. 

But he wasn't done. Every time he saw me after that, he found or manufactured a reason to 'smoke' me in the same way. One time, it was because I looked at him funny (He had this way of drawing out the words... "You looking at me funny, private?"). One time because I *didn't* look at him at all (apparently ignoring him). Sometimes, it was just because he thought I needed extra PT. I tried to avoid him, but he always managed to find me. And then one day- one glorious day- he left the unit. Moved on, went somewhere else. I was free. I moved on and moved up; got promoted a few times until I had my own stripes (I was in the transportation corps. We got blown up a lot, so promotions happened pretty rapidly). 

One of the duties of an NCO (Sergeant or above, on the enlisted side) is to do what's called 'staff duty'. It's a 24 hour duty where you sit in an office and answer phones, go to the clubs during closing to make sure no one's trying to drive drunk, checking doors, etc. You have a runner to help you out, but you also get some of the trouble-makers; the people that have gotten in trouble and gotten extra duty as part of their punishment. While I was getting briefed, they warned me about one in particular; he had gotten busted down a few times for hitting his wife, and attacking the MP's (military police) the second time they came out to break up a fight. Maybe not everywhere, but my unit didn't take very kindly to spousal abuse, and the other soldiers tended to take it upon themselves to make sure the abusers learn their lesson. And then he walks in- yup, that former Sergeant was now a private, just like I was. Those tables had turned. I wish I could say that I took the high road and maintained my bearing as a professional; but all that time of being hunted by this man came back to me. I probably could have let that go if he hadn't beat up his wife. I'd met her- she was a sweet, tiny little thing that didn't deserve what he did to her... twice. Sure, he got busted down in rank, but I felt that she deserved a little bit of petty revenge, which she probably couldn't get on her own. 

Our eyes met. He remembered me. He saw my rank, and his eyes opened wide. I smiled. "You looking at me funny, private?" </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My third grade son is preparing his science fair project, and he had a question that I couldn't answer.

The experiment is regarding the effect of music on a rat's ability to learn. In this case, we have two rats and will make three mazes. We'll expose the rats to different types of music for a day each, then see if they can learn the maze more quickly.

At what point can we determine that the rat has learned the maze? Is the right metric the number of times they can run the maze before they can do it without a wrong turn?

Do any of you have any advice on how we can improve the experiment?

Thank you!

Edit: I'm sorry, we don't read very much in this house. There is no such error message. Per the rules, I will not be deleting this post; now everyone can know that it's legal to own a spear in California- useful knowledge. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-11-27 18:26:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm writing an article about the effectiveness of different advertising methods, but wanted to mention some of the legal considerations of using flyers in certain cities. I see a few news articles saying that it's illegal to put flyers on cars in New York, but I can't find the law itself. Do any of you folks know where I can find that? I searched through the site, but couldn't find anything specific.

Also, are there any considerations regarding posting flyers in public areas or handing out flyers on public property?

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not basing this on anything, so this is just my wild prediction.

I thought Judith was going to die from the disease. Sure, there's still time, but I think she's pretty safe where she is. Sooner or later, the group is going to be on the move again, and they'll no longer be relatively safe in the prison. I predict that they're going to find themselves hiding from a horde, desperately trying to keep quite and avoid detection, when Judith is going to start fussing.

Then, she'll cry. 

The walkers around them would hone in on the sound and starting looking for them, while Rick and Carl desperately try to quiet the baby. Everyone else will watch in horror as they fail to do so, and everyone will realize that they're going to die if the child keeps making noise.

Rick or Carl will have to smother Judith to save the group. They'll hope that she'll just pass out and they can revive her, but it won't happen. And that's when we'll find out if those born after z-day come back after they die. 

This was done on MASH, and it was a very emotional scene. I wonder if the TWD writers could do that? 

Edit: [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sYjy7uUn7fc noredirect=1) is the scene in MASH. </TEXT>

How do some groups charge a fixed donation, and how is that legal? I see it a lot in the context of "pancake dinner, $5 donation" or something like that.

What's the difference between a set price and a defined donation (without the word "optional" anywhere to be found)? </TEXT>
