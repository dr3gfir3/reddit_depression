	<TEXT> Ah well then congrats on getting that Joshua! We're so far off from getting to the top 3 given how many pay to win factions there are. It's ridiculous. My factionmates get all the luck; some do 10 pulls and actually get 5*s. Another did a single and got 5* Sophia. It's never me. :( I've gotten to 60k supply points now though so when Andrea pops up in the depot I'll have her. Keeping my fingers crossed it's an extreme sale though.

By the way I asked support if we could switch servers and was told we couldn't. The only way was to start a new game on that server. Lol

P.S. Putting an asterisk italicizes the text. So when you mention "5-star", the following characters turn into italics until you put another asterisk.  </TEXT>

http://vk.com/twdrts_game

I practically stalk this site everyday and give word to my factionmates when there's a faction event going on. 

I didn't know we could ask for transfers! Do they move all your characters? I'm kinda iffy because with Scopely you never know what you lose and you may never have them back again. lol

I'm 950 down right now so I'm ahead of you by a 100. :P I'd race you there if we were getting the same amount of crates lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh I see! I love Angela! She's so pretty! Haha. I've seen the war prizes on the Russian site and they're finally giving out a fast toon now! Also war will start in about 7 hours! First place gets yet another new toon, second gets fast Sophia and third gets blue Mark. I hope you guys do extremely well this war and win another 5*!

I'm keeping my fingers crossed that I magically end up in your region. Haha. Our region seems to be taking in new players a lot though so I don't think it'll be ours you will merge with. :(

They're giving out crates containing tokens as part of the prizes but it's nowhere near 10k! It's a mix of 5* (400 highest) and 4* toon (300), and 4* weapon tokens (300). It's going to take a looooong time to get that 5* off the tokens. </TEXT>

How'd you know Scopely is merging your region? I bet it wouldn't hurt to get some more friendly competition unless the other region has even more whales than your current one!

Aww the people in your faction are the best! Now I wish you guys were merging with our region so I could sign up for a spot for a 5*... lmao Where are your other members going though?

I wonder who the prize for the upcoming war will be. Probably another new character with an Execute skill. :( A full team revive would just be too much, though if I had one I wouldn't complain. haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh wow that's great! Our top scoring faction had 107k points and the second one had 93k. Top faction NEVER loses anything to anyone lmao. They've stayed on top for the 2-3 months I've been playing. 

And aw that is awesome of you to do! I wish top factions in our region would do the same, but I don't think they have room for weaker players, which sucks. Plus I don't think the members would want to give up their spot for someone else. I'm already convinced that I'll never win a 5* from a tourney unless they increase the range of the prizes, which is super unlikely. But oh well, I still find fun in the game and that's what matters. 

And yes, he is! I am so jelly of my factionmate but I am glad to have him around. Our leader decided to take in newbies (level 14   15) who were the only ones scoring for their former factions and who had an Omid and the OP Hershel, said we'd help them get the gear they needed to make their toons stronger. Great guy, our leader. He took me in too when I was a newbie and I am forever thankful.

Yeah I'm not a fan of the longer AR charges either. I've decided to only pull using my coins from the 30-day pass when there's a toon I really like with 44/45 rush. 

You never know what Scopely will come up with. Haha. Before Hershel I thought the catsuit Mirabelle was too OP with her stun, but then they released OP Hershel. But anyone more powerful than Hershel would be too much of an overkill. I hope they don't take that direction. </TEXT>

More than faction level up, I'm super stoked for war! I barely get any sleep when it's live but I don't care haha. Also we got 3 new members today! We're finally 30! One of them has the super OP Hershel and I got to use him as faction ally and I am sooooo jealous!!

It sucks when Command isn't used properly by the AI. I've seen him use Command on a character that doesn't have his rush fully charged so that was a pity lol. Maybe I can keep Olivia first for my defense team instead of Chad and then eventually replace her with red Abe once he's leveled? Does an all-attacker defense team (the irony, I know) work? </TEXT>

I've done a bunch of other pulls but haven't been lucky enough for any other 5*. My defense team consists of 4* Andrea, Jesus, Abe, Olivia (for attack I switch her up with 4* Lori) and then the blue 5* Lori. I tried going for Alicia in a solo level up tourney before but I only placed 21st. lol. I'm working on my Chad too and thinking about adding him and taking out red Lori/Olivia, because I've seen a lot of people using him (plus he is sorta cute lmao), but I'm a bit iffy about the loss of a turn on a character after Command's been used.

There were two factions in our region who put together top player in less than a week and climbed the leaderboards. As if we needed more factions with players who spend a lot on the game.

I'm glad to know about the messaging app you're making amongst yourselves. I hope it works out for the best!

Also, just out of curiosity, who are the characters on your main team? :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hope the same as you for your region. It's going to suck if the environment remains that way and no new people are joining. Population will wither until it really won't be fun at all anymore.
I'm sure you'll be able to keep your faction thriving. You've come a long way after all!
No progress on the merge and it looks like we won't be pushing through with it anymore. We ranked 11th which is our best so far, considering the factions ranked above us were big spenders/whales, and we're like rank 25 in terms of combined faction rep. I gotta say this was our best run so far despite there being 5 people who scored 0 points. One of the top factions even messaged our leader and said that we were doing a good job on the leaderboard and that upper factions have noticed the effort. That was really good to know. I also got promoted to co-lead! So it's really been eventful! How did your faction do? </TEXT>
