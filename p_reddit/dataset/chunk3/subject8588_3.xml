	<TEXT> Clear your mind..feel better by changing the environment this article brings to mind..extinction...think about how asteroids have us in their sights. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, so they're not here to talk about this problem. We are, and we have the power to do something about it. I don't want to be the embarrassment of the galaxy, to have had the power to deflect an asteroid, and then not, and end up going extinct.

	<TEXT> When it comes to the river, there are few simple answers. Yes, its a myth that the river is hopelessly polluted  the days of dumping raw sewage into the river are long gone. But, theres still a lot of bad stuff that makes it into the river without being treated. And ironically, that bad stuff comes directly out of our water treatment plants.

Disinfection of the water discharged from our water treatment plants is the next step in making the Chicago River even cleaner. Even healthier. And unless certain agencies follow through on that next step, the river and all of its related waterways will continue to run with a lot of untreated toilet water. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought it rare to even know of such a creature, even smiling at the surrealistic statement that "oars do come in pairs". 

Just found out that the oarfish is also called 'king of herrings'   though rarely seen in the wild, their numbers are thought to be abundant enough that they are currently not considered to be endangered.

	<TEXT> I feel pretty much the same way after my last relapse in April. I was bothered by these things you described until after that. It's weird but I am so glad to have come across this post. It didn't make sense until knowing another has felt like this. I have become a social outcast of sorts just by me not wanting to face situations... </TEXT>
