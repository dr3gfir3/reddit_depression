	<TITLE> Going from 2010 iMac to 2016 MBP = gaming downgrade? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-06 15:30:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all. I have a 2010 iMac with 12GB ram and an Ati Radeon HD 4670 with 256 mb vram. I managed to get Windows 10 installed on it and occasionally will boot up in windows to do some gaming. I was wondering if upgrading to the 2016 base model Macbook Pro laptop and using my iMac as a second display would be a step up or a step down graphically for gaming. I realize typically laptops have much weaker graphics cards and I don't want to break the bank with a souped up version since I'm a pretty casual gamer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my mom has a new Ting android phone, which uses TMobile towers. Unfortunately our block is a dead zone and she gets zero bars while at home, meaning no calls or texts go in or out. However she can connect to the home wifi. I'm looking for a way that I can text her cell, and it'll come up on her ipad or something. Or a way she can text me through her phone wifi instead of cell network. I thought Google Voice might be a perfect solution, but it isn't helping at all. Her texts dont go out and mine don't come in. Suggestions? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2012 Elantra - extremely bumpy rear suspension </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-15 01:54:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all. I've had my Elantra for two years, but in the past couple months have noticed it becoming a very bumpy ride on my commute. Little bumps in the road are very noticeable and potholes have lifted me off my seat. Everything I've been reading about shocks and springs and struts seems to indicate that the car should feel much floatier and bouncier when the suspension is getting worn out, but my ride is instead getting way stiffer and bumpier. What could be causing this?

Edit: I want to add that I haven't noticed the car favoring any particular side or wheel. Additionally I had two rear tires put on a few weeks ago after noticing uneven wear on the rear driver side tire. They replaced the tires, did a wheel alignment, and reported nothing else unusual.  </TEXT>

Maybe it's always been this way, but it seems kind of unusual to me. Anyone else notice? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Their first appearance was great, with a lot of parallels to the Outsiders in WCW. Two guys that don't belong showing up with uncertain motives. But the mystique was quickly ruined by backstage promos, buddy buddy interactions with AJ Styles, and now their first match is happening already on a random Raw? They could have stretched this out for weeks and made it really unclear why they showed up and who's side they're on. Refuse to do interviews and keep showing up and causing chaos. Keep them unpredictable until they finally beat up Reigns and side with AJ or vice versa at Payback. 

The way it stands now, it's like AJ invited his two loser buddies over to WWE. They're already second fiddle and seen as his side kicks.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all. I had some bad acne in my teen years and early 20s, and now am left with skin that looks damaged and weathered, along with some rolling scars and large visible pores.

I'm looking for advice on what products could best repair my skin to grow anew and cover up the old damage. I'm not concerned about active acne because I know that will come and go, but the damaged skin never seems to improve.

For a while I used a retinol cream at night, and now I'm testing out an MSM cream. I've also experimented with needle rolling, but I'm not sure it really works. I moisturize daily in the morning with an spf 30/moisturizer and occasionally use benzoyl peroxide on active pimples.

	<TITLE> The late 2000s were such a terrible time for talent development in WWE </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-14 03:48:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Despite some great main event storylines, the period from about 2007 to 2010 is characterized by WWE trying to make stars out of

Carlito
Shelton Benjamin
Mr. Kennedy
Brian Kendrick
Ezekiel Jackson
Vladimir Kozlov
Kizarny 
Lance Cade
Trevor Murdoch
The Highlanders
Jesse   Festus
MVP
Elijah Burke
Kevin Thorne
Sylvester Terkay

All of which fizzled out and left the company within two or three years (or much less). Though we got a few long term stars in Santino, Kofi, CM Punk and Natalya during this period, it was generally a stagnant period for talent development. Why do you think that is? Was it just a case of bad luck or were WWE putting their money on the wrong talents? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-08-29 17:57:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know a lot of this sub tends to train for looks more than function, but I'm hoping some experienced athletes or couch potatoes-turned-athletes can lend some advice. Though I've never been overweight, I've led a mostly lethargic life for 25 years. Now I'm training to be a pro wrestler, up to six hours a week and the biggest thing holding me back is cardio. Even after nearly six months of training, my cardio is lagging far behind most of the class and I get completely gassed to the point of collapse way too quickly when running drills. I know I really need to spend more time running and sprinting at home, but I'm wondering if there's anything else I'm neglecting. Maybe I need more protein? Is cardio mostly just genetic? Any advice is appreciated.  </TEXT>

This is a very important show for us on the PWS roster and we're hoping to sell it out. If we can sell out Starland, we'll have the leverage to expand further into Philly, New York and beyond.

	<TEXT> I mean it's a 3 hour show. It would be cool if every week the person to open the show with a promo was really random. Maybe one week Fandango opens the show and cuts a promo. The next week it's Miz. The next it's Sheamus or Team B.A.D.

I just don't like how pretty much only Cena, Lesnar, or The Authority are allowed to start the show. It'd be nice to have more unpredictability and character development with other talent. </TEXT>
