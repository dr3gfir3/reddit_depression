	<TEXT> Firstly this isn't excluding people from public spaces based on the color of their skin, and it has nothing to do with gay or queer people. This is about schools and letting kids use the alternate bathroom based on how they identify. This is such small potatoes compared to the CRA. 

I personally don't think we should be encouraging kids to be identifying as anything besides how they are born until they are adults and can make 'reasonable' decisions. Then they can be whatever they want or are.

	<TEXT> My wife and I are working class parents and this would be huge for us. The economist the article sites says that it would be beneficial for almost everyone with kids.

Economist Alan Cole describes the proposal as "generous and broad," noting that "almost everyone with young children will get some benefit from it." However, he cautions, "the largest benefits will go to relatively affluent dual-income families using paid child care." In other words, the people spending most on child care, who need the least help affording it, will be the ones to benefit most. 

but then the author says;

In accordance with all her father's stances, this plan would benefit the rich and do virtually nothing for working class parents, who suffer the most under America's current child-care crisis. 

This does not line up with the economist's analysis and it certainly doesn't line up with what my experience would be in my working class household. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Very interesting thanks for posting.

I particularly liked this part

Democracy works only if those who have the money or the power to opt out of public things choose instead to opt in for the common good.

I don't think that more money is always the answer to improving our schools, currently, but a sense of civic pride and duty could go a long way for the coming together of our Nation. The school choice issue is ecspecially important for kids in poor neighborhoods getting access to a quality education but it is not a solution, only a bandaid.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol. I never said it was nuanced I said he was speaking conversationally and left information out. 

I can appreciate the example from Obama because it shows what can happen when you take people out of context, it happens to people left and right up and down. Look at the WSJ with PewDiePie from YouTube they used a clip from a video of him saying people take stuff out of context to criticize him to criticize him out of context. 

Don't change you standards for me though, do you, who cares if some rando internet stranger thinks your immature.  </TEXT>

I think people are willing to not even challenge the corporate media giants simply because they are reporting on Trump and focusing on negative things. I didn't trust corporate media long before I supported Trump, look at how they treated Bernie in the primaries. 

There are legitimate things to criticize Trump for, but we can be critics of the media too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I did not make a fake news argument but I will show an example, below of an article representing opinion as fact and applying motive to people(suspected motive, again portrayed as fact).

This came right from the front page of this very sub:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/21/trump-is-set-to-introduce-a-new-muslim-ban-this-one-is-nonsense-too/?utm_term=.4c5224f704a8

First thing is the title. There is no muslim ban, but low and behold the Washington Post will call it that.

Secondly, from the article:
2) Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller has flatly stated that the White Houses real goal here is to establish to the media and Trumps political opponents that his power to act (nominally) in the interests of our national security will not be questioned. In other words, the White House has left little doubt that it views the battle over the ban as crucial to a bigger goal: establishing that our institutions cannot constrain Trump.

The author is attributing that goal by taken past comments from Miller and using them to apply motive to the discussed order. Miller did not state that this is the goal of the order.

So in this example the author establishes a premise with the title and opening section that is based off of mislabeling the order and then attributing motive by reading into comments made previously. So it may not be 'fake' but it is more opinion than news. 

Since I am quickly trying to reply at work I will provide an example someone else has put together specifically about CNN:

I don't mean to imply the MSM is a monolithic bad actor, just that they have agendas beyond just giving the straight news.

	<TEXT> There is a steady stream of criticism for Trump, and I am not saying that is bad, but I've seen a lot of out of context quoting.  I do think that some major outlets have misrepresented him pretty consistently, especially CNN. 

I do not blame him for not being happy with those outlets. I mean the NY Times article about people close to him and in his campaign having frequent contact with Russian intelligence was all headline. Not to mention the entire campaign when CNN allowed people to say Trump said all Mexicans were rapists every single day.

Unfortunately for Trump not bending the knee to these outlets means even more misrepresentation or quoting out of context.

	<TEXT> But this isn't some terrorist group. It is the President of the United States, if they have actual evidence that proves he is crooked they need to follow proper channels and take action, not leak details to the press. 


What they are doing now makes it look like they don't have any provable case but they don't like him so they are being purposely vague so the press can use their imaginations to build an interesting story. 


Trump said he would restructure the CIA and end regime change policy, I could see some career intelligence officials not liking that. Trump is a game changer and we should also consider the possibility that there are some people in Washington who don't want their game changed. 


Either way rooting for the unaccountable 'deep' state to undermine our elected officials is not a safe bet to make.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess it depends because if my daughter comes up to me and says, "Give me a Popsicle!" She is definitely not getting a Popsicle. However, if she says "Please may I have a Popsicle" she just might get it. 

People react proportionately to how they are addressed. I think this is important to point out because you are implying that Trump supporters do not have civilized behavior and that just isn't true of them as a whole...maybe some, but not all. Also if we hold the metaphorical mirror up to Democrats there are some who are uncivilized as well...I mean just look at the name calling in this sub for anyone who is pro Trump.

This is a strategy that can be applied to all interactions, not just Trump supporters or Democrats or politics, etc. If you open the door swinging fists, you will probably be met with fists in return. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the problem is you are applying your perspective to other peoples. If we are going to treat this as an honest thought exercise you should strip your biases and approach from a different point of view. 

So if you place yourself in the shoes of a Trump supporter my point will look different to you. So while Some Trump supporters are more than willing to discuss legal or ethical issues as presented they are not going to do so with someone who implies they are the human embodiment of poor schooling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think misrepresenting his intentions, his supporters and his actions are what i am referring to. So while you can set up your specific straw man to challenge my concept I don't want to get caught up in it.

I am talking at high level about the outrage culture that is surrounding people opposed to Trump. Like applying race to everything he does or misrepresenting his statements, or implying what Trump supporters care about is somehow not important.

So as he is attacked for literally everything, his supporters are hardened in their resolve to support him.

This is the problem as I see it; there are so many rumors and accusations flying about a very serious topic that people are on their jump to conclusions mats, myself included, rather than knowing the truth.

	<TEXT> Thank you for the specific response. I doubt the RNC was working with Russia, that would be really deep level conspiracy.

I can see your perspective on it, but I think the fact that the material that was released was true adds an interesting element, so it isn't just social engineering but exposing the DNC and Clinton Campaign. Also, there was so much bad news coming about about Trump as well(some of it self inflicted) I wonder if they scaled were balanced out?

I also think it was much more ant-Hillary than pro-Trump, meaning they were not trying to get their guy elected, but to prevent Clinton from being elected.

That is judging me by one facet on my online persona. It isn't about thin skin, it is about calling out someone who is willing to discount someone else's opinion based on their political alignment. 

I am here as a concerned citizen about the power of our intelligence community being unchecked. I am not trying to provide policy prescriptions, rather pointing out that rooting for unchecked power is a dangerous game. 

I have been alarmed since the Patriot Act allowed our government to detain people unconstitutionally. I have been concerned since Snowden revealed the extent to which our government spies on us. But, since i post on T_D you again are assuming my intent. 

Don't get upset with me for pointing out your bigotry, if it is something that upsets you, you alone are in power to change your ways. </TEXT>

If you want to have a real discussion then leave the cheap put downs out of it. It isn't about a fan club it is about our out of control intelligence community. I saw you had another comment pointing out that I use T_D as if that is some argument against me.

	<TEXT> If what you described were true I could understand your point. 

What specifically from the hacking caused Trump to win? 

What has he done to demonstrate he is actively trying to destroy the country? 


If the intelligence community is really going to make a stand then they need to put all the evidence on the table and let the country decide, this isn't their decision alone. I know they have to keep things secret to protect their methods but this is a very big claim and it needs to be proven. But since it was an anonymous source no one will be held accountable and it will all be treated as true. 

If the intelligence community can back up the claims that Trump is working for Putin then that needs to be published.  </TEXT>
