	<TEXT> It was a computer game we were allowed to play in school. This was around 1990. Your character lived in trees and had to find food and eat/sleep enough or your day would start over. I can't remember what the objective was, if there was one. I remember the character would sort of travel diagonally when moving up or down in the tree. It's been driving me crazy!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The eyebrow cake powder duo. I love that it comes in grey/black which you don't see too often in western cosmetics, especially drugstore brands.

I also like the waterproof mascara top coat. When combined with an eyelid primer, it helps keep my mascara from smudging which I had a huge problem with before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like their eye shadow primer. It's great for keeping my lids matte so my mascara doesn't smudge at all during the day. Also they have a green concealer that I use occasionally that helps with redness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seconding the concealer brush! I also use it with acetone to clean up nail polish and it's the only brush I've tried with a perfect shape and it doesn't lose bristles (my last non-ELF brush lost all its bristles after 2 uses). </TEXT>
