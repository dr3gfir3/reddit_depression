	<TEXT> We have a similar rotation where I work.  

1.  Primary on-call page

if no acknowledgement within 15 minutes...

2.  Secondary on-call page

if no acknowledgement within 15 minutes...

3.  Manager Page

Basically...you don't want to be a dick to your buddies/coworkers/peers and you definitely don't want your manager to get a page...so your goal is to never roll a page to the next guy and if you need to be out of pocket for a bit, the secondary will cover for you.

Once you complete your primary on-call rotation, you move to secondary on-call.  

It's about respecting those you work with and for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome from Chicago.  I'm originally from Rockford and also lived in Chicago for a few years after college (UNL Grad).  

There are games that air occasionally on the weekends that can be blocked out, even on MLB.TV (Cub fan here).  In my experience those have been ESPN weekend night games, but there could be others.  It is only a few games a season.

If you feel it is must see, you may just want to slowly sip a beer at a local bar who is airing the game.  There are a number of sports bars that you can call ahead and they can put the game on for you during that time frame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> prices can vary but certainly 4k is crazy unless it's "brand new".  Typically I see them anywhere from 250 to 900 but there are so many versions and quality can vary so price is always hard to know.  Also I dont know the first thing about those units, not really my thing.

Just set yourself a budget and stick to it.  Find a good Craigs List app for our phone and configure it for "arcade" in your area and when you see one pop up, respond right away, check it out and don't be afraid to walk away if it is in poor shape.  

I drove 250 miles to get my Double Dragon for $200 so there are bargains to be had, just have to be super patient. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see one of those units on Craig's List more often than any other.  If I were you, and there is no time constraints, then I'd watch there for a few weeks or months until you find exactly what you need.

If you live in a more rural area, maybe look at Ebay and search within a specific range, like 200 miles.  

Additionally, you can look on the "arcade museum" site and their forums:   [LINK](http://www.arcade-museum.com/) .  On the main page, you can "search" for specific machines, click on the one you want and I believe it will indicate how many or their users have one for sale.  OR you can go to their forums and look under Video Game sales.  You do have to donate a few dollars to the site for use of their forums but is worth it. </TEXT>

Here is the relevant section:

* Firstly, for existing paid members, nothing much will change except youll be part of a larger community. You wont have to repurchase a licence, be forced to use steam, or anything like that. Youll still be able to log in with non steam credentials.

* For existing free members, your access will be limited to classic KAG only. You will have to pay for the game through one of the many available means to access the full version.

* For server hosts, youll still be able to host servers with the normal methods, but may have extra options for steam specific things, like filtering players out via VAC.

* For people whod like to buy but cant due to payment method issues, youll have access to all the payment options of a large, well supported platform like Steam!

* More money for us, which will mean were less stressed about being able to pay rent, food and bills and able to focus more on finalising KAG and working on other games! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I purchased this game last march...I play every single day...I'm not sure why I love it so much but once you "get it" it becomes really competitive and a lot of fun.  Some matches are 32 v 32 and are nuts.

Also, the "beta" is out, which is quite a bit different then the classic "alpha" version but is also loads of fun.  You can download that from the forums if you own a copy of the game.

They are coming to Steam at some point as well and Steam keys will be provided if you have already purchased it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got my DD about a month ago.  I got a manual with mine but really it didn't have enough to guide me if I would of had to take it completely apart.  Thankfully mine was in really good shape on the interior and just needed a new buttons, cleaned up and some exterior work (still in progress).

*IF* I had to take it apart, I would label every connection so that reassembly would go smooth.  As mentioned by Zomza, get some Simple Green or "Mean Green" at the dollar store (which is what I use) and clean the exterior surfaces.  I'd then take off the control panel.  That is where the joystick and buttons are.  On DD there are clampy things on the inside you have to unfasten.  Once that is off, this will allow you to remove the plexi protecting the monitor.  Remove that and the bezel and clean the monitor   plexi with glass cleaner.  THIS alone made a huge difference for me.  I thought I was going to have to recap my monitor but removing 26 years of grime made it look almost new (tear).  

I'd also consider replacing your buttons   microswitches, at the very least, so that they match and it will def. play a bit better.  I bought 6 new buttons and micro-switches and with shipping it was around $11/$12.  [http://groovygamegear.com/webstore/](http://groovygamegear.com/webstore/)

Then from there it depends on how far you want to clean it up.  You can buy new control panel art pretty easily but I'm having some problems locating side art but I'm sure I'll track something down or will have it made.  Once I confirm I can get new side art I will move forward with the complete cabinet restore.

Good Luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's difficult to say.  Location, sellers knowledge, demand in the market, condition of the machine all play a factor.  I'd set a spending limit, which you have, but keep that to yourself.  I'd set up an e-bay alert as well as a Craig's List one specifically for "arcade".

I'd also spend the $2 and sign up for the KLOV/VAPS forum.  I watch the "For Sale" subforum like a hawk.  There is a Qbert on there now someone is selling for $900.

[KLOV - QBert](http://forums.arcade-museum.com/showthread.php?t=280330_)  If you don't live near that seller then at least use them as a gauge for price.  In that example, if you lived near them, say, "hey, I'll give you $700 and I'll pick it up tomorrow and get it out of your way".  Don't be afraid to haggle a little and don't over pay just to have it.

You can also setup a profile on their main-site and you can configure your profile to list any Arcade Machine you are looking for.  I wanted to get a Double Dragon and I was contacted by a seller through that site.  He offered it for a fair price but then one popped up on Craig's List for $100 cheaper so ultimately I found what I wanted by being patient and keeping my eyes open.

Best of luck and I hope you find what you are looking for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to emphasize how much of a difference cleaning the monitor can make, on my double dragon I recently got, I thought there was an issue with red objects on the screen.  I was trying to determine if it was a problem with the monitor or the board but nothing helped.  Finally had time to take it apart to clean and to assess what I needed to buy for my restore.  I cleaned the monitor and the plexi and magically my red came back and my monitor looks amazing.  

I was shocked how much those 24 years of dust affected the screen.  I wish I would have thought to take pictures.

Thanks again for another great video John.  I'm learning a lot...as a new hobbyist, you are certainly making me feel more comfortable around these machines. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was lucky enough to catch Brad in concert once.  There were literally 7 people there, and 4 of them were with me.

It is still one of the best show's I've ever seen.  I got to visit with Stone after the concert and he was incredibly nice, signed our Green River cassette (welp) and asked us how we liked the show.

Afterwards, we were eating at Perkins up the street and their tour bus pulled up in front.  They ordered some food to go and were just sitting there in the lobby.  My friends and I couldn't resist so we sat with Stone and Shawn Smith and geeked out a bit.  I'm certain I asked a bunch of dumb-ass questions and if I could go back, I have so many things I'd want to talk about.    According to google, this was in October of 97...yikes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's been said on here a few times, but I have no issue with Mame cabinets at all.  I plan to build on myself at some point soon, but from scratch.

The true problem, in my eyes, is that when I see an old cabinet come up on Craig's List.  There are several of us in my area that want to buy and restore these iconic cabinets but there are an equal number of "flippers" that will beat us to them. 

  They take these great old cabinets, gut them, put mame or a 60-1 in them and then resell them a week later for $500-$1500 more.  It must be a great business model b/c they sell quick but why ruin a classic unit.  

Just last week there as a table top Donkey Kong about 2 1/2 hours away for $150.  Needed a little TLC and it'd be as good as new.  I didn't feel like driving that far but I should have b/c a few days later, back on craigs list, with a 60 in 1 in it and for $550.

I certainly can't blame them, obviously they are making good money on them and it's better than seeing them get tossed into a dump.  It's kind of a travesty to me but it's just how it goes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used a rasberrypi to make a little retrobox for my kids.  I had an xbox USB controller and purchased a second one to use.  We now have a nes/snes/geneis/psx console.  It has more emlulators on there but haven't had the time to hunt down more roms.  Works great, we all love it.

	<TEXT> I picked up my "holy grail" machine last night.  I know it's not as thrilling as some others out there but when I was a kid, my best friend and I used to spend a lot of time and money on this machine.  I am so excited to have it in my garage.

[Double Dragon Album](http://imgur.com/a/FbbUo).

Redditor [/u/yatzr/](http://www.reddit.com/user/yatzr) deserves a huge thanks and some sort of medal for enduring the 5 hour round trip with me, through some pretty nasty thunderstorms, to secure this machine.  

We unloaded it around midnight last night, discovered all the manuals inside the cab and Yatzr used his Arcade Kungfu to determine 2 stuck microswitches were causing some control issues.  The cab is actually in great shape.  There are some scratches and a damaged corner at the bottom but other than that, its pretty good.

The guy I bought it from also had a non-working Robocop in a bit of a generic cabinet.  He also had a nintendo cabinet that had been converted to a NEO GEO with Metal Slug X.  Due to the bad weather, I had to take our van so I couldn't make it fit.  The monitor was a little flakey but I'd taken it if I had my truck.

Overall, I'm really excited.  Going to order all new microswitches and buttons today, just because and spend fathers day kicking ass with my kids. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The frustrating part is that there are true gamers out there that WONT be able to buy this unit that would normally want to.

My father for example, is retired and has trouble getting around.  He is a pretty antsy fellow and his XBOX 360 gives him something to occupy his time.  I realize a 60 year old man isn't their demo, but that dude buys more games than I do and I'm in my 30's with 3 kids.

My dad cant do "always on" simply b/c they dont need internet for anything else and spending the additonal monthly fee for broadband plus the xbox gold (or whatever) is a huge add-on.  When he has to update his 360, he's bring it to my house.  He also buys and sells used games.  Not always, but often.  

My Dad was really excited about the new XBOX but when I explained to him this may not work for him, he was bummed.

Yes he can keep using his 360 but the point is, Microsoft lost a new console sale b/c they somehow believe this is a reasonable long term strategy.  And seeing how the console is around for about 8-10 years, that's a lot of dollars he may have spent over that time period.  Some of their philosophies from their software side are now showing up in their gaming division.

I've had pretty much all of the consoles, Atari, NES, SNES, Genesis, Playstation, Dreamcast, PS2, Wii, PS3, XBox 360.  I don't have a loyalty, I go where I feel I will get the most value and return on my investment.  The Original Xbox seemed to play off the, "we don't play by the console rules" sort of rebel vibe.  Now they've grown old and adopted policies they would have rejected back then (Hippy turned Yuppie).   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I finally found my first cab, Sega Out Run! </TITLE>

[Manual](http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/O/Outrun%20Upright%20Parts%20Manual.pdf)

I've been hunting for a cab (or two) to do a restore on and teach myself more about these great icons from my childhood.  I've been searching for several months and just came across this Sega Out Run for $80.

I picked it up last night, and with the help of fellow redditor [Yatzer](http://www.reddit.com/user/yatzr) who I recently learned lived just 2 blocks down the street from me, we unloaded and started to try and resurrect this gem.

The previous owner said it was working fine and recently when he was playing the screen shut off and it started to hum.

The outside is pretty rough but nothing too serious.  Will need to be sanded and painted, and new side art applied.  The gas petal is pretty rusty but the Marque looks perfect and when I saw it light up, I got pretty giddy.

The cab powers on but it hums (I believe from the speakers) and you can hear some very faint squiggly voices on the speakers but it's just jibberish.  The marque and one of the coin slots lights up and there is a red light on the PCB that lights up as well.  

There is no video nor does the monitor appear to "power on".  The previous owner removed the original monitor b/c it didn't work right and sold that a while back on Craig's List for a $1 :( .  He replaced it with a smaller monitor that we are still trying to learn more about it.  It's a Mitsubishi something or another, I'll need to look closer this weekend.  I believe the original though was a 19" Hantarex display.

We tried the test buttons but nothing happened.  We also dropped a few quarters in the coin slot but alas, no results.

Looking over the PCB it appears to be in good shape. I removed then reattached all the connectors and that didn't improve things. 

The bottom of the inside is a bit dirty and we thought perhaps the first item that needs attention is the power supply.  The manual for this cab (listed at the top) does a great job of detailing the somewhat intimidating layout of that area.  I'd like to go through this whole area and clean it up, maybe that will help or lead to more answers.

I've only had a few brief hours with it and just started my cursory hunt for more information.  It'd be great if there was an easy way for me to test these components but I may just need to get dirty and try and figure it all out.

I appreciate you all letting me share my excitement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I too am in Lincoln/Omaha area and I too scan CL every single day.  I am sad that I have to compete with a fellow /cade person for so few items.  I'm looking for my very first arcade to restore with my son who just turned 9.  I've been looking for several months and I'm just going to be patient b/c I think most of the folks around here are wanting an inflated price and obviously are getting it in some cases.

I responded to that $75 Street Fighter 2 as soon as it was posted and my heart was crushed when I didn't get a response.  I then saw that same machine as a 60-1 and I was puzzled.  You are right, flippers are beating us to this.

I've also seen a lot of ads where they have 8 machines, 2 work, but they will only sell them as a bundle for some ridiculous price.  The 2 that work are usually two I'd never want so I couldn't justify even if I wanted to consider them.

Yatzr, I wish you the best of luck.  I'm really new at this and I'm excited   to get my first box.  I've also been watching E-Bay a lot and between the two I hope to have success. </TEXT>
