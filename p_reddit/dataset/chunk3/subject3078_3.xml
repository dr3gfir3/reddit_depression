	<TITLE> Creative commons photos being resold as commercial stock.. Any thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-26 13:12:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I put out a fair amount of photos under creative commons attribution licenses and am starting to run into a bit of an issue with stock image providers offering them individually, without attribution and without the relevant CC license, and charging for the privilege.

To be honest I'm a bit stuck as to what to do, so far when contacting the providers, they offer to remove them, but given they claim that they came from a variety of third parties who in turn claimed that they were their photos, it seems almost impossible to take any action to prevent it reoccurring.

Now my ideal solution would be for them to simply add attribution, if they want to sell them, that's fine with me even if I'm not getting a cut (so far it's all about images I want out there without a cost anyway) but that doesn't seem to be a possibility. That leaves me with a cycle of takedown requests and conversations without real resolution.

Has anyone else come across this and if so, how are you dealing with it? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I ended up having a chat on the train with a random passenger whose laptop bore the same damage as many of mine so I thought I'd share:

I've been using and looking after a small fleet of X2xx's (first 200's and 201s, now 220's and 230's) and one thing that I noticed early was that if you had nothing in the cardslot, inevitably cracks develop. 

Now you can replace the palmrest easily enough, and you can keep doing that as it happens again and again but it seems a bit silly, so way back when I decided to grab the cheapest card available (USB ports, smart card reader etc.. I'd love a blank but they don't seem to exist..) and keep it in the machine.  No more cracks, no more breakage, no more replacing the palmrest.

Anyway, thought it might be useful to someone here, although given it's incredibly obvious I'm sure I'm not the only one... Or maybe my kit just ends up getting more abuse..

	<TITLE> I like Jeremy Corbyn's EU, but I don't think it's possible.. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-21 03:52:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The title pretty much says it all, but I'd like to flesh it out a little here.

Watching the various debates and the Sky Q A session from today, I find myself (probably not unsurprisingly..) very much in support of the sentiment that Jeremy is putting forward on the EU, just not the position it is supposed to support. 

The Sky Q A really hit home that I'm essentially taking a leave position on issues that Jeremy also seems to be pretty concerned with, I'd probably scatter some concerns about the fact that if we leave, and do see significant reform (not that I think that terribly likely..), it'll be Tory led reform that goes in the opposite direction that I'd prefer

A socially positive, progressive EU that works for everyone, ensures that governments can act on behalf of their people, that promotes an open and just society and protects the weakest would be great, but it doesn't seem possible. At the same time an EU that decidedly doesn't work is the status-quo and potentially a more hostile and less able and willing to protect workers seems far more likely.

And yes, I recognise that there will likely be a near term economic cost to leaving the EU, and no, I'm not terribly happy with the idea of a future government pushing hard to utterly dismantle free movement either, but the risk the EU poses, and the benefits of being able to act outside the EU without being linked to the project in its current form (and potentially after another round of integration..) seem to balance that out. 

What I'd have liked to have seen was something a little more compelling and substantive about how we might get the changes we want, and what sort of time frame we'd be talking about. I'd also have liked to have heard more about how we could mitigate the issues we do face, and indeed why there is value in remaining in an EU with an often regressive and sometimes dysfunctional regulatory system.

We go to vote on Thursday, and result aside, I think everyone involved has done a pretty crappy job of both pushing the debate and making their respective cases, even on the doorstep the arguments have been less than stellar, and that's one area where you do have time to have a bit of a conversation.

Anyway, I'd just like to add that I like the idea of Jeremy's EU, I don't think we can build it out of what we have at the moment, so maybe if we leave we should talk about how we go about building something like that in the UK, and then beyond.. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I managed to [smash the screen on my swift](http://i.imgur.com/zW8yfOh.jpg). The damage was the result of a drop from desk height onto a wooden floor, and landing dead flat and screen down.. It happened whilst I was setting myself up to take a photo of the VR goggles that I found worked well, and is the result of me not paying attention, so that's nice.

Anyway, first things first, the wileyfox case obviously doesn't protect the screen in any way (it doesn't extend past the  front of the phone) although I think it does make the phone easier to hold (and looks good..) I do wonder if without the case it might have fallen more randomly and not landed flat, but hey, not the cases fault.

However, I suppose it does give me the opportunity to test out the screen repair service and to outline how the process runs.  Now, I've never broken a phone screen before (And don't intend to again for that matter..) so I have nothing to compare it against like for like, however so far I've been pretty impressed with the people at Wileyfox.

I called their support number and the first person I spoke to was able to deal with everything end to end (which is always nice..). I had screen protection anyway, so it was a simple matter of confirming some details having the return process outlined (pack, include email and post..) and waiting for an email. As it happened the email came whilst I was still talking to the customer service person.. All in, it was painless, efficient and quick.  

I did ask about turnaround time and was told that they wouldn't give a firm commitment, but that they process repairs as quickly as possible. Frankly I was reasonably happy with that over being promised something that doesn't quite happen, but a worst case/maximum period would have been nice to know.

In any case, I just posted the phone (so it went out today) and it will arrive with their service centre tomorrow morning. So, it'll be interesting to see if it remains plain sailing from here or if there are issues, as well as how long it does take.

In the meantime, I'm back on my LG which means less battery time and quite a lot less performance... Although without a scratch or crack in the screen over the last few years, so i'll do for now.

I'll update this as stuff happens, if stuff happens! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Battery life after the Swift cyanogenOS 13 update </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-15 20:16:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I saw that a few people had issues with the update, and quite a few others didn't see much difference afterwards, so I thought I'd throw in a quick (and positive) observation on battery life.

I only switched to the Swift a while ago and was pleased at the battery life compared to my older LG (which had a relatively new after-market battery in..), essentially I went from having to charge my phone briefly during the day to it lasting from when I got up, to when I went to bed.  So that was a nice, although frankly an expected plus.  So all of last week with my nice shiny new phone, I'd have my phone charged to 100% as I got up and it'd be down to about 20%/30% when I was done for the day.

However since the update, the amount of power being used by the phone when it's asleep seems to have fallen quite dramatically (based on the power usage graphs anyway). It's a bit after 7pm here now after a day of admittedly light usage, but no additional charging, and the battery is still reporting 85% full [You can see the graph here..](http://imgur.com/HbHiLU2). 

Given I get notifications via KDEconnect on my laptop the phone does appear to have been doing it's thing with emails and so, it's been hooked to my company VOIP all day too, and I've had it in my hand more often than I would have my old LG (mostly because it has been dying slowly..) but it's looking like the 'standby' periods have been quite a lot less draining than previously.

Now, obviously it's a correlation, and I'll see what it looks like over the week, but even a moderate improvement in battery usage when the phone isn't directly being used would be a huge boost..

Anyway, keeps me happy, has anyone else noticed anything interesting?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Media players whilst sticking to Cyanogen OS? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I just replaced my (no longer quite so) trusty LG P880 with a swift. The LG was running Cyanogen Mod and I was pretty happy with the 'Eleven' music player. 

However, given I have a nice new phone that's running what appears to be a solid OS, and a promise I've made not to mess with it (so that I have it in a working condition all the time...) mean I've hit a mild issue in that the apk I have for Eleven, whilst working, results in semi regular crashes during playback and general unhappiness.

So I wondered what people were using that plays nicely with audioFX, is reasonably simple and works.. </TEXT>
