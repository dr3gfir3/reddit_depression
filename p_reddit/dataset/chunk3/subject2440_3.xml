	<TEXT> What worked for me and got rid of my dyshidrosis is a potassium permanganate solution that I dip the affected areas in at night for 15 mins before I go to sleep, then Diprolene ointment applied after that, then I apply ointment again after I wake up. And whenever I wash my hands I apply unscented hand lotion to moisturize. Now I only get a flare up if I touch garlic and opinions without gloves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ODed on GHB two years ago. I remember passing out in my friend's car, woke up 10 hours later in a hospital with a tube sticking out my nose and they put me in a diaper. Stayed in the hospital for a week. Never touching that shit again. 2 years later and I feel like my brain is not as sharp as it used to be. My short term memory sucks. Now I stick to wine.  </TEXT>
