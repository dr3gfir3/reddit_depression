	<TEXT> That was me.

Raised a jehovahs witnesses i stood out.

Big nose. Shit hair. Spots. Socially awkward.

I was a prime target for bullying.

Until I snapped around about 14 or 15. I started fighting back. Started taking drugs smoking and drinking etc. Anything to distance myself from the former me.

Still was weird only now a bit crazier. I left school with no qualifications.....went on to graduate university. I work two jobs have two beautiful kids. Don't do drugs etc and am a decent guy....still ugly though!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got banned from school.

It was frowned upon when I took LSD before an exam.

It was also frowned upon when I spread the rumour that suzy wanked off her dog.

And for setting off fireworks in the corridor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Wire is clearly top 3 material of any list of good programmes! 

I think Oz was underrated. It was brilliant to watch back in the day !

Penny Dreadful was great and cannot believe it's finished...

Malcolm in the Middle was easily one of the funniest  comedy series ever but seemed to be underrated  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can do it crew and invite sessions but you can't do it solo cos you need a public sessions to do CEO work.

Its also only accessible after getting the CEO office and doing the special cargo deliveries for a bit.

Do you have the CEO office? Don't bother doing motorcycle club ever just do this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. Basically you have to find the car and take it to your warehouse.  Once you claim it usually you get pursued by a shooting helicopter or some pricks in cars.. they might shoot up your car and you have to pay to have it repaired. The same happens when you go to deliver the car to a buyer.. any damage is deducted from the final payment. Its usually a few thousand out of a hundred thousand pay out. Plus other players get a notification to destroy your car for RP and money.

I personally wait until I end up In an empty lobby to sell my top end cars! </TEXT>
