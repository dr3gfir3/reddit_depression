It should have been Kiss a few months earlier but about a week before the concert, one of those travelling preachers came to town and our church arranged for him to speak to a group of parents. All the usual stuff Kings in Satan's Service; they consecrate (desecrate?) a guitar to Satan before the show and then leave it at a pawn shop to corrupt some poor innocent child, etc. 

After that, my dad bought my ticket from me and tore it up. Still pisses me off nearly 40 years later. </TEXT>
