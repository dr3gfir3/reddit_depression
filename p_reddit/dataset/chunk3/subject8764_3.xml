	<TEXT> I think this video shows why he's waited so long. It's a lose-lose decision emotionally for LeBron. He either upsets his home-state for the second time or he upsets two of his closest friends. They've been tight since the 2008 Olympics. They came out of the same draft class.

Roster-wise, I think Cleveland's the better chance. But you cant underestimate friendship. Emotionally it's a tough decision.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the Broussard smile is one of two things:

1. He knows he's going back to Cleveland. This is a great story for NBA writers. The whole "LeBron is going home" theme will generate massive attention and journalists like that type of thing. It means more ratings, more clicks, ect. 

2. He knows 'Melo is somehow going to Miami. This would also generate excitement about the league he covers for other reasons. 

That said, it was unprofessional on his part.  </TEXT>

- LeBron goes back to Cleveland
- Carmelo goes to the Lakers
- Chris Bosh to Houston
- Kevin Love is traded to Cleveland later this month. 

All four of those predictions could easily be wrong. Regardless, I wish everyone's fans luck in the next few days. One of the very few things I'm happy about as a small-market team is we're not part of this drama too often. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think David Aldridge made a great point - LeBron knows how Cleveland is handling this speculation. He's worked hard on repairing his image after the 2010 deal and I just don't see him flushing it down the toilet. Part of it is media speculation, but if he honestly wasn't interested in Cleveland, I think he would have said so early on in the process. 

I thought Melo would stay in New York, but the longer this drags out, the more I think it favors the Lakers. Plus, if they can keep Gasol, a Kobe-Carmelo-Gasol-Randle lineup could be fun, though lacking defense.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that the longer this goes, the better for the Heat. 

That said, I think the fact that he's meeting Riley face to face means his future is clearly up in the air. If LeBron has a decision to announce to Riley and if his decision is to stay, why do it face to face? Why not just call, text or whatever so Riley can continue building his team? I think LeBron learned a lesson about how to exit gracefully after the 2010 deal. 

But who knows. I've went back and forth on this and I'm honestly at 50/50. There are "tea leafs" to read from both sides.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Overrated: Kobe

Underrated: Shaq

Both are all-time greats, but whenever I see some Kobe fans argue he's better than LeBron because of having five rings, they conveniently leave out the fact Shaq was the best player for three of them. Substitute LeBron for Kobe on those Laker teams and LeBron has five rings too. 

I think Shaq has become underrated in recent years in part due to jumping teams. Shaq's the only player in my life time who made a 30-point, 20-rebound game feel boring since he did it a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 1993 Suns, the 2002 Kings and the 2007 Mavericks are the three best teams to not win titles in the last 20 years. The '93 Knicks were also pretty good.

	<TEXT> The Billups-Melo Nuggets team in 2009 was the best one. Unfortunately, they ran into one of the top ten players of all time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lived in Denver when I started following the NBA. Moved to Kansas City but I still proudly support the Nuggets.

While I don't have a "second team", I generally root for the Western Conference in the finals ---- even the Lakers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand why Cleveland fans are nervous, but Josh McRoberts and Danny Granger don't exactly strike fear in my hearts. 

Hell, I'd HATE it if the Nuggets signed Granger. Don't care about the price.  </TEXT>
