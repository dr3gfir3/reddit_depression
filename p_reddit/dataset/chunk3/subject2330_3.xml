This is the set in question and I suppose you're right, it doesn't have the logo of the film on it. I'm guessing parents wouldn't have been happy with the word 'suicide' on the box. The set does contain Killer Croc, Katana, and Capt. Boomerang who are characters in the film but I guess that's just coincidence.  
Also it should be pointed out the Batmobile in the set does not match the footage we've seen, but I believe the Joker chase is a flashback. Not sure when SS is set but as we know bat's car was destroyed in BvS, so maybe new design for upcoming solo film? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  theory has been on here alot and popped up when we got the trailer for BvS and Suicide Squad. Also recently (Suicide Squad possible spoilers) [Red Hood is in the new Lego set for Suicide Squad.](#spoiler)That may not be confirmation but recently Giant man was in a Lego set before Captain Americanized Civil War was released.

It's interesting but as I said it was brought up a lot around here.

	<TEXT> I live on the east coast of Massachusetts. In a 20 mile radius there are about 7 theaters near my home. I believe that one was playing this film. I wanted to see it but honestly I didn't feel like driving further than my usual theater. I'm not surprised it's not doing well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to slightly add to your theory, Ozymandias says his 35 minute line at 11:59pm(New York time and one minute to midnight ;) ) meaning he launched his attack at 11:24. John 11:24 says  "Martha answered, 'I know he will rise again in the resurrection at the last day.'" Adrian's plan was sort of to ressurect peace from his massive destruction.  

We could do this all day and find hidden meanings in any numbers but I thought it was fitting. </TEXT>
