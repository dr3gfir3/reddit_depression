It shows carelessness and lack of attention to detail....and it renders anything said moot....talking shit like a bigshot, but writes like a 3rd grader.  Suddenly, everything said means about ten times less. Thats just my IMHO.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know, right?  I am going to assume that Marlow pawned it to Prop Joe, for an insultingly low price, and then never paid off the pawn.  So Prop Joe sold it, at a nice profit, to the local pedo for use in the childrens bathroom at the elementary school.  

Later, a drunken McNaulty, somehow tracked it down and, after months of "off the clock" work, managed to make a federal case out of it despite his superiors orders that he drop it and return to the boat.

	<TEXT> former police officer here. IF you want to be a cop, shop around.  The departments in my area hire you FIRST, then pay you full salary to go to the 18-week academy.  It seems unreasonable to do it any other way.  Of course, you have to sign a 2-year contract work for the agency that pays for your academy.  Starting pay here is average 35k, but you can totally make it on that salary here.  Get some some experience and then go wherever you want.  Its an awesome job!  Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> we had a satellite dish, not the small ones like you see now, but a 10' fiberglass (not mesh) dish in our back yard.  We could pick up every channel known to man....and in the early years NONE OF THEM WERE SCRAMBLED.  Toward the end nearly everything was scrambled though.  Man those were the days.  

I would tape hours of porn(VHS) and sell or rent to my classmates.  It was a nice little business.  I still have some of the worn  tapes around the house.

Awesome memory.  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not the way to go through life.  Having a 'stick it to him' attitude just shows arrogance and ignorance whether you are a believer or not.  I hope he learns to think for himself and puts a stop to being used to fight your proxy battles.

	<TEXT> is this the uncle who touches you?  Just curious, because we all have at least one.  Anyway...this may infuriate you, but according to believers, of which I am one, YOU wouldnt he here if it were not for Him (God).  One logic behind the statement is that you couldnt possibly have made that life-saving observation had He not CREATED YOU.  So, yeah...'good on you' for calling it...but you didnt do it alone.

Its actually very similar to the story of Corinthians.  Paul was driving his rented mule through the streets of downtown Corinth when he was temporarily distracted by some street-whores.  This caused him to gallop right though a stop sign and nearly wreck into a bus carrying the local girls varsity volleyball team.  At the last minute, one of the girls on the bus noticed Paul, galloping full speed, toward them.  They were able to alert the driver, who was able to stop the bus and avoid what would have been a horrific accident, the likes of which downtown Corinth hasnt seen since the Wells Fargo mule crashed into the beer mule.

Apologies for the made-up story that wasnt near as funny as I thought it was. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um.....what?  Your  post makes no sense at all..and I cant even believe I am commenting on it.  Dont get me wrong, I'm all for your right to just talk and talk and talk and bash whatever you want, but it needs to make sense.
 

The second sentence in your first paragraph, the one that begins with 'for example' is not an example at all of the "fake niceness" that you mention.   Being nice has nothing to do with faith that God will save your burning ass.

...and God doesnt tell Christians to "be happy."  The Bible does not mention that...anywhere at all.  "Thou shalt wear upon your face a smile to show all..blah blah...."  Nope, not in there.  Christians, along with everyone else on the planet, should be and are very concerned with whats happening in the world.  They arent pretending to be happy despite this.  Your post makes zero sense.

Also, FYI - Christians do not refuse to flee from burning buildings, they dont refuse to wear their seatbelts because of "Gods Will,"  they dont play Russian Roulette with 6 rounds in the chamber. 

My thoughts on this:  You need to form your own opinion, an educated one.  Stop listening to your cool friends. </TEXT>
