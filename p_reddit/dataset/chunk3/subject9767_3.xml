	<TEXT> I do agree with YourRealMom. 

Something I've always done was acclimate them as well. I'm very cautious about leaving them in full sun when you first get the plant. I leave them for an hour one day. Two the next. Each time I'll put them in a shady spot. Eventually I leave them out all day. YourRealMom hit the nail on the head.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not the company that sends these out. From what I've heard, this vendor is actually really great. It's the stores that carry them that give them absolutely no care. They sit, sit and sit without any water or sun. Each one of these plants that come in usually end up dying because most of them I've looked at are dead while in store so they just push the dead ones to the back. When they get new plants in, these plants are healthy, so that's what I mean by "save". It's the store's fault, not the vendor in my case.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here are the fly traps: http://imgur.com/ubSiUJV they seem to do be doing very well. It's gonna be sad watching these go dormant, lol! 
Here are the pitchers: http://imgur.com/ewWjTP1 is it normal for these to start to get reddish brown at the top? If you zoom in you can see the it starting to form at the top of the pitchers. I figured it was almost dormancy time and thought this was normal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought I was alone, lol. Absolutely. I watch my kids like a hawk. Not only the money invested into the pots, soil and plants, I just like to pay close attention to their growth and see changes and how they thrive. CPs will forever be my favorite type of plants.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends, I believe. What I have done to successfully achieve dew:
I keep mine a lot more moist than the pitcher plant and Venus fly trap. I have mine growing in pure spaghnum so it dries out a lot more quickly, so it has an increased watering schedule. I have my plant in full sun, and that's the key factor. Enough light! It gets 6 hours a day. Also, I just got this plant so it took a week or two to spring back to life!  </TEXT>
