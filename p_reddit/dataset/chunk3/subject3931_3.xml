	<TEXT> If you are low health ... you do not keep trying to rush the enemy 1v6. I am honestly not sure what you expect to happen in such a scenario, except for your hilarious death. 

Seriously, what is it about this type of game that compels players to do the most insane shit just for a kill, when a logical person would say "Hey.. this is really dangerous." </TEXT>

I know DB Super introduces yet more forms of power like Super Sayian God and this weird blue haired thing - are the transformations leading up to the fights, and the fights themselves, short and snappy like DB or are they long and drawn out like DBZ?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is probably an embarrassingly stupid question. But I've been trying to get into Infra Arcana and Sil, and I'm used to Brogue and TGGW where you don't see this.

So let's say it's 2d5. Is the easiest way to think of this that the number on the left, in this case a 2, is the least damage that can be done and then the maximum is 10, just multiplying them together? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've watched quite a few reaction videos of episode 56, and I'd say 80% of them mouthed out "Mr Perfect Cell" when he kills the interviewer before Cell even says it himself. In a lesser show, I'd say this is lazy writing. But with something as consistently as good as DBZA, it's almost comforting that they'll occasionally deliver on the badass one liner or hilarious joke that you'd expect. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've watched three and a half seasons of Mad Men. While I liked some of the episodes a lot (The Suitcase is as good as everyone says it is), it's never been interesting to make me want to binge watch it. Of course, binge watching something isn't required to enjoy something.. but.. you should at least have that anticipation, "I can't wait to see what happens next." Especially after The Suitcase, I feel like.. you know, that's already some good closure and I'm kinda bored now. I'm a few episodes after that one now, but just lost interest. When you start browsing reddit during a TV show, I think that's a signal that you should move on to something else.

Anyhow, yeah this is a lot of deliberation about something ultimately silly. Does anyone else feel this way, like, "maybe I have bad taste if I don't like something everyone says is great"? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Caves of Qud is the first roguelike with a world map that's ever interested me, mainly due to the setting, the mutations, and the interface. Despite that, there's still a reason I've always avoided these things: how much is there per screen? Will there be a lot of use of the autoexplore because "well nothing interesting here, let's press this button until the computer tells me it's found something"? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm thinking about maaaybe adding DCSS on to the small list of roguelikes that I play. One of the things that's always put me off is that the autoexplore seems a bit brainless. Why does it exist? Is it that the first levels are so easy you can coast through it or is it because the floors are so big that you need to autoexplore to travel through them?

Bonus question: how do I make the map larger in the ASCII version? It's so tiny, surely there's a way to make it show more of the map. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of the reason I'm wanting to ditch Dota and try out Starcraft is that matches in Dota can go to *ridiculous* lengths. 60+ minutes is not uncommon down at 1k mmr, for various reasons. 

I've heard that Stacraft matches are much faster, and that's certainly true for the handful of pro games I've watched. But what about matches for normal people or newbies? What's the longest a match will go? What's the average length? Does the ability to call "gg" alleviate any potential problems here? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Among the basic concepts of Dota that aren't mentioned in the tutorial: denying, pulling, and stacking. There are other concepts that need to be addressed, too, but we need to start somewhere. It's actually a little insane that players at low MMR don't even know about these mechanics because the game doesn't tell anyone. Using outside resources to learn how to play a game isn't okay.

	<TEXT> Reading about this game's features over the years, I've always been a bit intrigued. But every time I consider buying it, I hesitate because of the open world. A big reason I prefer story-less roguelikes such as Brogue is that I don't enjoy the idea of hitting up the same NPCs over and over and over and over, which is something you WILL do in a genre where death comes early and often. Do they have the same lines every time or is the story also randomly generated to keep it interesting? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've tried the series multiple times over the years because the concept *sounds* interesting. In practice, I feel like the mechanics are a jumbled mess. If it were only military or only culture, I'd be having a blast. But I've never been able to grasp how the two interconnect, when to focus on one and when to focus on the other.

As an example, I've always wanted to attempt running a civ as peacefully as possible, just spreading my culture throughout - however, I'm not sure that's actually possible. I know I should probably have a balance of the two, but again I'm not really sure how to do that.

Honestly, I'm wondering if I should give it up and just take up two separate series that represent what Civ tries to accomplish. I could play Age of Wonders 3 for the combat and .. I guess Tropico or something for the culture because city builders like that don't seem common anymore. Unless someone could give me some insight here, or am I overcomplicating things? </TEXT>

I decided to mention this on the game's subreddit and someone got mad about it, said "do not EVER mention cheating here again."

I've not played an FPS in quite a while, so my aim is also bad. I've found I really like Mercy because you don't necessarily need great aim most of the time, just good decision making. There are a few other heroes I like, too, but mostly Mercy. Is there anything "wrong" with just playing the same hero over and over? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I've never done it, but I've just had the idea, you know, why not? You can cry about spoilers all you want, but novels like Don Quixote and Huckleberry Finn had short descriptions of what would happen for each chapter in the table of contents. Knowing what will happen can a lot of the times really make things even more enjoyable, because you've got a bit of grounding and you're wondering what scenes will fill in leading up to the key points. 

Maybe that's just me. Has anyone tried this? Do you feel it was a good or bad idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now, I'm usually fine with a slow burn. My favorite scenes in Breaking Bad were the slower ones like when Walt was talking to Crazy Eight in Jesse's basement. But there was also real conflict behind that. Better Call Saul doesn't really seem to have much moral dilemma. Maybe there would be if I didn't know about Saul's future, but I do. There's no "will he or won't he?" We know he's going to be a shady crook. 

So I mean.. as much as I want to like this  - the cinematography really is as fantastic as you'd expect from the people who did Breaking Bad - the story just seems inconsequential. I find it hard to believe this Sandpiper case is why Jimmy becomes Saul.  </TEXT>

Are these two games similar in that regard? Or do the common popcorn enemies take shorter to kill? My perfect twin stick shooter would be enemies that are easy to kill, yet at the same time you're just as likely to BE killed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're not doing anything to help by upvoting all these threads about LPQ to the front page. In fact, I have this theory that LP is working just as intended. Dota is such an addictive game, and they know this, so they want you to have even more of an incentive to be addicted. If you get in LP and somehow have the misfortune to stay there for a while, you're playing right into their hand. That's a guaranteed five games that you're playing for Valve. The longer you stay in their player base, the more likely you are to buy their cosmetics. And really, as long as you do that, they don't give a fuck about fixing the game.

Do you know the easiest way to fix this? Uninstall Dota. Vote with your wallet, so to speak. Show Valve you've had enough of their shit, and just uninstall. If enough people leave (and I'm sure quite a few people have already left for other reasons, whether due to Peruvians or disliking 7.00 changes or whatever), they'll be forced to take action. </TEXT>

Is there anything in the options menu that I should really have turned on or off, for a quality-of-life kinda thing? As an example, "Select All Larvae" seems like a good idea and is enabled by default - is there any reason I'd want to disable it?

A more general question: how often is SC2 patched, does Blizzard still support it, or have they quietly abandoned it in favor of Overwatch/Heroes of the Storm/Hearthstone? I've never seen any such accusations, but I have a hunch this may have happened. </TEXT>

So I was thinking, you know, the alternate floors in the original Rebirth are harder than their counterpart and the chance that they can randomly spawn as your first floor doesn't seem logical to me. Why not make it so it's unlocked only if you didn't take any damage on the first floor of a chapter? Would anyone like that idea? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something I loved about this game and haven't found too often in other games is the interactivity of the maps and what they can mean for the gameplay. You've got a level where the screen is scrolling up and you're kinda platforming while you're fighting; you've got one where submarines dive and resurface and dive down again, each one with different weapons and gimmicks; you've got a level set in the air where you can knock your opponent off the edge. I'm pretty sure I remember a level where you're also platforming to dodge obstacles before you get to a final arena.

I think Smash Bros does this a bit, but is there anything else? Doesn't necessarily have to be a fighting game, either.

I don't want to throw money at something blindly. For the most part I'm *pretty sure* I want to buy this game, but there's one more question.

I know this one is a little biased because you're all on this subreddit and will probably respond positively but I'll ask anyhow. How replayable would you say the maps are in Overwatch? The most fun part of any shooter is that the maps stay the same (obviously) and a million different situations arise within that map because of different players. Is the fun mostly in the 23 different heroes and how they counter each other or is the map architecture just as exciting as the gunplay?

I don't know if that was clear, sorry. Hopefully someone can make sense of it. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could never really enjoy Torchlight much because, when I first started playing it, I was new to PC gaming and all the different abilities and hotkeys (10 of them!) really blew my mind.

So this got me thinking back to Torchlight. Is it at all efficient to make a build that's only like 4 to 6 active skills and have everything else be a passive? That would really strike the perfect balance for me, but I'm not sure if it would screw me over in the end. </TEXT>

All I want is a game where people actually want to communicate instead of playing the blame game *before the runes even spawn*. 

Should I just keep muting all chat? Should I auto-mute everyone on the enemy team? Should I give everyone "a chance" and mute them only if they say something? Though usually I get tilted from the first comment and the game is already ruined because I try to argue back with them. 

Is it too much to ask to have teammates who acknowledge they suck? I know I suck and I'm fine with that. I'm sick of my mid or carry giving tons of reasons why we lost, even though they played just as badly as me. And this is even in unranked, there is no escape from the whining just by "not playing ranked".

	<TEXT> So I was looking through [this post on the Steam TF2 discussion board](https://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/364040797996275899) where someone lists what they believe to be the pros and cons of each game, and then in the cons of Overwatch, this is written: *meta team comps, I have noticed if a team has chosen all the highest tier heroes the team becomes impossible to break down, think 12 engineers on turbine levels of defence with no uber available, I have studied tier lists and discussions and conclude that indeed a comp of certain heroes can beat any other team and this is a major downfall as it stops people playing a hero that they enjoy over a hero that will win.*

Now, this is from May 2016. So it's possible they were right and now this has been balanced. Or is this still true? Or was it never true in the first place?

There's also this one: *has a growing amount of hackers in game and with no vote kick there is no way to remove cheaters from your game.* Are hackers still an issue, did Blizzard do anything to combat them?

	<TEXT> I've not played TF2 for about half a year. I quit mostly because the game was pretty laggy, for some reason, not because I didn't like it. (Well, that and the campy engineer sentries got real old real fast... so I guess I didn't like that part.) The 6v6 of comps appeals to me, though I've never tried it.

K, so I tried out the Paladins beta and thought it was cheap and unpolished - despite that, the basic premise piqued my interest to try out Overwatch. The thing is it's $60 and that's a lot of money these days when I play free games like Dota and TF2.

This is a pretty vague question but.. which one has more strategy and replay value? TF2 competitive mode or Overwatch? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And no, this isn't another plea for HL3. I don't give a shit if that game is ever made.

As much as I like Dota, CSGO, TF, I'd love to see something new from them. L4D3 is probably the most logical step (or maybe a TF3 to compete with Overwatch), but what I'd really like is a genre they've never done before.

I'm not sure what that would be. My biggest hope would be turn-based strategy game kinda like Advance Wars or Chess. Maybe their take on a card game. Maybe an entirely new kind of game with their VR tech. All I know is I'm itching to see what creative new ideas they might have. </TEXT>

But instead, he is bad just like the rest of us.

Apparently he reported me and I'm now in low priority. Cool. I think the lesson I've learned is to mute all chat and to keep it that way. I shouldn't ever say "it's been off for a while, I should turn it back on."

Earth Spirit is listed as an offlaner when I swear he's been played as more of a support for a while now.

And in general, not much of their information is new to me. Like yeah, I'm 1k trash and can't put a lot of this into practice: but a lot of this is stuff I've learned from other people on YouTube for free.

	<DATE> 2017-01-06 17:38:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> OK, my third post in 24 hours. Sorry. :x

This is probably the deciding factor on if I'll keep playing League or not. The thing I love most about playing support in Dota is the ability to use TP scrolls to turn around tower diving ganks. Just as the enemy thinks they've got the kill, I'll swoop in and save my carry from death AND possibly kill the enemy. 

League, as far as I know, doesn't have the ability to teleport consistently to a tower. There's the summoner spell that lets you do it every 300 seconds... but that's not nearly often enough to help out other lanes.

So, I suspect that there is a different early game meta for supports in League. What is it? What am I supposed to do, is it really just babysitting my carry and that's it, or is there opportunity to roam and gank? Even the concept of warding seems different in this game since everyone gets them for free and they last only a minute. (Then there's the fact there are like six or seven different types of wards.. makes my head spin, I'm a little confused.) </TEXT>

Now that I'm starting a new game, I'm similarly intimidated without some guidance. Or are Riot's default item builds better than Valve's? (though that still leaves me with the question of skill build)

For example, I tried playing Sona last night and I REALLY didn't feel like I had any impact. I feel part of this is the skill build, because I didn't know what the hell to level up. And then there's the fact that I don't have any runes/masteries because I'm new: how important are those things, really?  </TEXT>

In broader terms, I like heroes who can save cores and/or catch the enemy out of position and punish them for it (Venge's swap is my favorite skill in the game for this reason) </TEXT>

As far as I can tell, every champion has their own innate skill that is always active from level one. Is this correct? For example, Nami has this one: "All allied champions touched by any of Nami's abilities gain 60 (+ 20% AP) bonus movement speed for 1.5 seconds." 

Is that something you need to level up or is it indeed always active? If it's the latter, I think that's the coolest shit. </TEXT>

I'd never liked playing him much in the past because of early game mana problems. But now with the shrine, that's not so much an issue.

I see a few people on every thread about Peruvians saying that you're xenophobic or racist if you don't enjoy playing with them. But the fact is their play style is inherently detrimental to winning a game of Dota. This is probably unrealistic, but the root of the problem is the cyber cafes and their odd little rules and prizes. If anything, there needs to be something done about this shit more than the players themselves. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need help making my hero small yet diverse </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-01 00:12:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've tried this once before and then tried to diversify again.. and yeah.. I feel like playing too many heroes just stresses me out too much making me think "this hero counters that one, but this one synergizes more with my team, and blah blah blah." I know these are important things to consider, but generally at 1.5k mmr there are other *more important* things like positioning and item choices.

OK, so there are three heroes I know for a fact I'll choose to be part of my pool: **Ogre Magi, Treant Protector, and Vengeful Spirit**. These three have been my favorites ever since I started playing the game a year ago, and I don't see that changing any time soon.

* Venge - Fantastic at taking people out of position, great at reducing armor and the aura is great
* Treant - the tower healing usually lets us stall their pushes and gives us map control for a long time, also he's great at rushing a gem and countering people like Mirana and Riki (especially in 7.00)
* Ogre - tbh ... I'm not sure what he's "good for" other than the RNG on his ult being funny, though I do like to pick him when there is someone like a Sniper or Tiny on my team so the Bloodlust machine can be even more helpful

After those three, I'm a little unsure. Crystal Maiden is probably also definitely going to be included because my win rate with her has always been around 60%. 

I would love to practice more Abaddon for the heal/purge/slow that he provides, but I'm hesitant about melee for solo supporting (I realize Ogre and Treant are melee, but they're also either a. tanky as fuck or b. hit like a truck)

That leaves the following heroes: Bane, Dazzle, Jakiro, Lina, Rubick, Shadow Shaman, Silencer, Skywrath Mage, Undying, Venomancer, Witch Doctor

Which of these heroes overlap a bit too much and I could throw out? Which one of them are just bad at solo supporting? Basically what would be the smallest group that potentially counters the most lineups? (example, Dazzle and Venge really seem to serve similar purposes to me, same for CM and Jakiro - but I could be entirely wrong so please help me if you can)

And are there any other supports that would be decent at solo supporting that I might want to reconsider? Lion and Lich bore me, btw

Also when it comes to the rare case that there are already two supports on my team, I tend to go with Faceless Void in either offlane or safelane or Death Prophet mid </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can someone please help me on dewarding? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-31 00:13:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd say 8 times out of 10, when I look at the post-game scoreboard, I'm the only one who's bought wards on either side. So I don't really know how to deward because it's never been an issue. Lately, I've been running into people who will deward and it's so frustrating.

Sentries seem like a waste of money because it's 200 gold and you might not even find anything. How am I supposed to have any idea where they warded? Personally, I like to ward behind the towers that I want my team to take in the near future. But how am I supposed to know that's what THEY'RE doing? If I try to deward where makes sense, it's just as likely I've wasted money.

Is there some trick to doing this or is it just an annoying part of the game I need to deal with? If this were just the eye spot high ground wards, I wouldn't be so pissed off and I'd realize I need to find better spots that don't get dewarded. The thing is I've also been getting dewarded at spots that baffle me that they'd even put a sentry there, leading me to believe I'm dealing with a smurf or map hacker or something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Disclaimer: I play only support, if that matters to this discussion.

I remember hearing a few people say a lot more heroes would build a Midas in this patch to get talents more quickly. I don't think I've ever actually built a Midas on any hero.. ever. The typical advice I've always heard about it is "Build one if you know the game is going to go late", which is worthless to me because I never know when games are going to "go late." Maybe that's every game for me since they're often 40-60 minutes long?

If I do build one, should it be my first item after boots? Or am I usually better off getting the typical support-y things like force staff/medallion/glimmer/etc? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For as much as I've played Treant in the past year, I could probably count on one hand the number of times I've bought this thing. Part of it is due to the fear they'll end up countering me with a mere 1100 gold (gem and quelling blade) in comparison to the 4200 gold that I spent to get one.

But that's no longer my only concern. I feel like Treant is versatile enough that you can either stack him with auras or disables (Atos, Euls, etc) and he'll be just as useful in different ways. Personally, I don't see the point of an Aghs unless your enemy has some highly elusive heroes like Tinker, Ember, AM, Monkey, etc. </TEXT>

Also, there seem to be a lot of people who don't understand heroes have been reworked, most notably Techies. Those who play Techies will sometimes still put mines in the river, not understanding you can now see them at all times. Those who play *against* Techies will sometimes buy sentries in the laning phase, not seeming to know that's now a waste of gold unless he's got remote mines or stasis traps set up.

Really, the front page should have had bullet points that listed major changes instead of highlighting ONLY Monkey King. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I loved Treant when I first started a year ago, thought the ability to heal towers and teammates across the map was so cool. Typically I'll just stop tower pushes and give us more space to farm, because we'll have more map control than the enemy. This was admittedly a bit too passive, just a gamble that my teammates would get some farm and win the game.

Now with the new bash out of invis, I've become even more passive with him. I'm scared to even come out of the trees because I'm thinking his full potential isn't being used if I don't use the bash. Is this the wrong approach? I mean, with most supports I'll roam around the map looking for kills or harassing them a lot, but with Treant I'm always afraid to do it in this new patch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Steals all your intelligence, and his ult already does so much to you even without that. Try to get in place to stun him, he's just going to do that annoying astral prison bullshit - seriously the most annoying spell in the game. He hits like a truck at all points in the game. What are you supposed to do?

	<TEXT> I'm always a bit tempted not to even ward against an NS because his ult makes your wards useless anyhow. Is the tiny bit of vision still helpful? Are there specific ward spots good against an NS? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's absurd someone can report me for practicing support Riki or carry Venge and assuming I'm the sole reason that we lost the game for trying something a little unconventional.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Valve, can we please get the option to announce our intended position in the pre-game? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-12-25 23:30:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This wouldn't force us to choose a specific set of heroes, rather it would simply be an announcement of intent. "I plan to carry." "I plan to support." etc etc

This would be especially helpful for those who prefer to mute all chat and communicate via chat wheel or pings. If I were to choose Riki and want to support or if I were to choose Venge and want to carry, there is little reason for them to assume either of those things based on the way they're most typically played. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More and more lately, I've seem popular ASMRtists, who used to use the 3Dio, experimenting with different mics that sound just as good. Do you think this is a case of diversity for viewers or is the 3Dio not really the best binaural mic out there? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We trashed a Meepo in lane, the guy died like six times before the first tower fell because of overextending. But once he got levels and could do the mass poof bullshit, we didn't kill him again. Does it even make a difference to "shut someone down"? Is that still a thing?

	<TEXT> I've tried this a few times and won every time so far, whether due to luck or whatever. I'll go arcanes, aether, drum.. and we usually win by that point. Assuming I come into the gold somehow, what else should I build on a roaming CK? Maybe auras, maybe solar crest? Maybe something else? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 
For 5650 gold, you can get a hex like Lion or Shaman.

For 2720 gold (and more for additional Dagon recipes) you can get a nuke like Lion or Lina.

For 5200 gold, you get Tinker's Rearm ult.

For 4500 gold, you get Sven's cleave on any melee hero.

	<TEXT> If I get the entire team whining in chat, now I need to actively take myself out of the game to mute them. Seems like the best thing to do now is just to leave off chat permanently if they're going to make it this cumbersome.  </TEXT>
