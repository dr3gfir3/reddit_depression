Large-scale design of robust genetic circuits with multiple inputs and outputs for mammalian cells

Benjamin H Weinberg,	N T Hang Pham,	Leidy D Caraballo,	Thomas Lozanoski,	Adrien Engel, Swapnil Bhatia	  Wilson W Wong

Abstract:

 Engineered genetic circuits for mammalian cells often require extensive fine-tuning to perform as intended. We present a robust, general, scalable system, called 'Boolean logic and arithmetic through DNA excision' (BLADE), to engineer genetic circuits with multiple inputs and outputs in mammalian cells with minimal optimization. The reliability of BLADE arises from its reliance on recombinases under the control of a single promoter, which integrates circuit signals on a single transcriptional layer. We used BLADE to build 113 circuits in human embryonic kidney and Jurkat T cells and devised a quantitative, vector-proximity metric to evaluate their performance. Of 113 circuits analyzed, 109 functioned (96.5%) as intended without optimization. The circuits, which are available through Addgene, include a 3-input, two-output full adder; a 6-input, one-output Boolean logic look-up table; circuits with small-molecule-inducible control; and circuits that incorporate CRISPRCas9 to regulate endogenous genes. BLADE enables execution of sophisticated cellular computation in mammalian cells, with applications in cell and tissue engineering. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Obesity-associated insulin resistance plays a central role in type 2 diabetes. As such, tyrosine phosphatases that dephosphorylate the insulin receptor (IR) are potential therapeutic targets. The low-molecular-weight protein tyrosine phosphatase (LMPTP) is a proposed IR phosphatase, yet its role in insulin signaling in vivo has not been defined. Here we show that global and liver-specific LMPTP deletion protects mice from high-fat diet-induced diabetes without affecting body weight. To examine the role of the catalytic activity of LMPTP, we developed a small-molecule inhibitor with a novel uncompetitive mechanism, a unique binding site at the opening of the catalytic pocket, and an exquisite selectivity over other phosphatases. This inhibitor is orally bioavailable, and it increases liver IR phosphorylation in vivo and reverses high-fat diet-induced diabetes. Our findings suggest that LMPTP is a key promoter of insulin resistance and that LMPTP inhibitors would be beneficial for treating type 2 diabetes. </TEXT>

Selective Entrainment of Theta Oscillations in the Dorsal Stream Causally Enhances Auditory Working Memory Performance. 

Neuron, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1016/j.neuron.2017.03.015

Link:
http://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(17)30198-8

Highlights

Dorsal auditory stream supports auditory working memory manipulation
Theta power and phase locking in the dorsal stream predict manipulation abilities
Rhythmic TMS over the IPS selectively entrains ongoing theta oscillations
TMS-induced behavioral enhancement is causally related to theta entrainment

Summary

 The implication of the dorsal stream in manipulating auditory information in working memory has been recently established. However, the oscillatory dynamics within this network and its causal relationship with behavior remain undefined. Using simultaneous MEG/EEG, we show that theta oscillations in the dorsal stream predict participants manipulation abilities during memory retention in a task requiring the comparison of two patterns differing in temporal order. We investigated the causal relationship between brain oscillations and behavior by applying theta-rhythmic TMS combined with EEG over the MEG-identified target (left intraparietal sulcus) during the silent interval between the two stimuli. Rhythmic TMS entrained theta oscillation and boosted participants accuracy. TMS-induced oscillatory entrainment scaled with behavioral enhancement, and both gains varied with participants baseline abilities. These effects were not seen for a melody-comparison control task and were not observed for arrhythmic TMS. These data establish theta activity in the dorsal stream as causally related to memory manipulation. </TEXT>

Breastfeeding, Cognitive and Noncognitive Development in Early Childhood: A Population Study

Lisa-Christine Girard, Orla Doyle, Richard E. Tremblay

Abstract

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: There is mixed evidence from correlational studies that breastfeeding impacts childrens development. Propensity score matching with large samples can be an effective tool to remove potential bias from observed confounders in correlational studies. The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of breastfeeding on childrens cognitive and noncognitive development at 3 and 5 years of age.

 METHODS: Participants included 8000 families from the Growing Up in Ireland longitudinal infant cohort, who were identified from the Child Benefit Register and randomly selected to participate. Parent and teacher reports and standardized assessments were used to collect information on childrens problem behaviors, expressive vocabulary, and cognitive abilities at age 3 and 5 years. Breastfeeding information was collected via maternal report. Propensity score matching was used to compare the average treatment effects on those who were breastfed.

 RESULTS: Before matching, breastfeeding was associated with better development on almost every outcome. After matching and adjustment for multiple testing, only 1 of the 13 outcomes remained statistically significant: childrens hyperactivity (difference score, 0.84; 95% confidence interval, 1.33 to 0.35) at age 3 years for children who were breastfed for at least 6 months. No statistically significant differences were observed postmatching on any outcome at age 5 years.

 CONCLUSIONS: Although 1 positive benefit of breastfeeding was found by using propensity score matching, the effect size was modest in practical terms. No support was found for statistically significant gains at age 5 years, suggesting that the earlier observed benefit from breastfeeding may not be maintained once children enter school. </TEXT>

A roadmap for rapid decarbonization

Johan Rockstrm1, Owen Gaffney1,2, Joeri Rogelj3,4, Malte Meinshausen5,6, Nebojsa Nakicenovic4, Hans Joachim Schellnhuber1,5

Science  24 Mar 2017: Vol. 355, Issue 6331, pp. 1269-1271

DOI: 10.1126/science.aah3443

Link: 
http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1269

Summary:

 Although the Paris Agreement's goals (1) are aligned with science (2) and can, in principle, be technically and economically achieved (3), alarming inconsistencies remain between science-based targets and national commitments. Despite progress during the 2016 Marrakech climate negotiations, long-term goals can be trumped by political short-termism. Following the Agreement, which became international law earlier than expected, several countries published mid-century decarbonization strategies, with more due soon. Model-based decarbonization assessments (4) and scenarios often struggle to capture transformative change and the dynamics associated with it: disruption, innovation, and nonlinear change in human behavior. For example, in just 2 years, China's coal use swung from 3.7% growth in 2013 to a decline of 3.7% in 2015 (5). To harness these dynamics and to calibrate for short-term realpolitik, we propose framing the decarbonization challenge in terms of a global decadal roadmap based on a simple heuristica carbon lawof halving gross anthropogenic carbon-dioxide (CO2) emissions every decade. Complemented by immediately instigated, scalable carbon removal and efforts to ramp down land-use CO2 emissions, this can lead to net-zero emissions around mid-century, a path necessary to limit warming to well below 2C. </TEXT>

Abstract

 DNA repair is essential for life, yet its efficiency declines with age for reasons that are unclear. Numerous proteins possess Nudix homology domains (NHDs) that have no known function. We show that NHDs are NAD+ (oxidized form of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) binding domains that regulate protein-protein interactions. The binding of NAD+ to the NHD domain of DBC1 (deleted in breast cancer 1) prevents it from inhibiting PARP1 [poly(adenosine diphosphateribose) polymerase], a critical DNA repair protein. As mice age and NAD+ concentrations decline, DBC1 is increasingly bound to PARP1, causing DNA damage to accumulate, a process rapidly reversed by restoring the abundance of NAD+. Thus, NAD+ directly regulates protein-protein interactions, the modulation of which may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 BACKGROUND

 Each year, rotavirus gastroenteritis is responsible for about 37% of deaths from diarrhea among children younger than 5 years of age worldwide, with a disproportionate effect in sub-Saharan Africa.

 METHODS

 We conducted a randomized, placebo-controlled trial in Niger to evaluate the efficacy of a live, oral bovine rotavirus pentavalent vaccine (BRV-PV, Serum Institute of India) to prevent severe rotavirus gastroenteritis. Healthy infants received three doses of the vaccine or placebo at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age. Episodes of gastroenteritis were assessed through active and passive surveillance and were graded on the basis of the score on the Vesikari scale (which ranges from 0 to 20, with higher scores indicating more severe disease). The primary end point was the efficacy of three doses of vaccine as compared with placebo against a first episode of laboratory-confirmed severe rotavirus gastroenteritis (Vesikari score, 11) beginning 28 days after dose 3.

 RESULTS

 Among the 3508 infants who were included in the per-protocol efficacy analysis, there were 31 cases of severe rotavirus gastroenteritis in the vaccine group and 87 cases in the placebo group (2.14 and 6.44 cases per 100 person-years, respectively), for a vaccine efficacy of 66.7% (95% confidence interval [CI], 49.9 to 77.9). Similar efficacy was seen in the intention-to-treat analyses, which showed a vaccine efficacy of 69.1% (95% CI, 55.0 to 78.7). There was no significant between-group difference in the risk of adverse events, which were reported in 68.7% of the infants in the vaccine group and in 67.2% of those in the placebo group, or in the risk of serious adverse events (in 8.3% in the vaccine group and in 9.1% in the placebo group); there were 27 deaths in the vaccine group and 22 in the placebo group. None of the infants had confirmed intussusception.

 CONCLUSIONS

 Three doses of BRV-PV, an oral rotavirus vaccine, had an efficacy of 66.7% against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis among infants in Niger. (Funded by Mdecins sans Frontires Operational Center and the Kavli Foundation; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02145000.) </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objectives To investigate the association between alcohol consumption and cardiovascular disease at higher resolution by examining the initial lifetime presentation of 12 cardiac, cerebrovascular, abdominal, or peripheral vascular diseases among five categories of consumption.

 Design Population based cohort study of linked electronic health records covering primary care, hospital admissions, and mortality in 1997-2010 (median follow-up six years).

 Setting CALIBER (ClinicAl research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records).

 Participants 1937360 adults (51% women), aged 30 who were free from cardiovascular disease at baseline.

 Main outcome measures 12 common symptomatic manifestations of cardiovascular disease, including chronic stable angina, unstable angina, acute myocardial infarction, unheralded coronary heart disease death, heart failure, sudden coronary death/cardiac arrest, transient ischaemic attack, ischaemic stroke, intracerebral and subarachnoid haemorrhage, peripheral arterial disease, and abdominal aortic aneurysm.

 Results 114859 individuals received an incident cardiovascular diagnosis during follow-up. Non-drinking was associated with an increased risk of unstable angina (hazard ratio 1.33, 95% confidence interval 1.21 to 1.45), myocardial infarction (1.32, 1.24 to1.41), unheralded coronary death (1.56, 1.38 to 1.76), heart failure (1.24, 1.11 to 1.38), ischaemic stroke (1.12, 1.01 to 1.24), peripheral arterial disease (1.22, 1.13 to 1.32), and abdominal aortic aneurysm (1.32, 1.17 to 1.49) compared with moderate drinking (consumption within contemporaneous UK weekly/daily guidelines of 21/3 and 14/2 units for men and women, respectively). Heavy drinking (exceeding guidelines) conferred an increased risk of presenting with unheralded coronary death (1.21, 1.08 to 1.35), heart failure (1.22, 1.08 to 1.37), cardiac arrest (1.50, 1.26 to 1.77), transient ischaemic attack (1.11, 1.02 to 1.37), ischaemic stroke (1.33, 1.09 to 1.63), intracerebral haemorrhage (1.37, 1.16 to 1.62), and peripheral arterial disease (1.35; 1.23 to 1.48), but a lower risk of myocardial infarction (0.88, 0.79 to 1.00) or stable angina (0.93, 0.86 to 1.00).

 Conclusions Heterogeneous associations exist between level of alcohol consumption and the initial presentation of cardiovascular diseases. This has implications for counselling patients, public health communication, and clinical research, suggesting a more nuanced approach to the role of alcohol in prevention of cardiovascular disease is necessary. </TEXT>

Association Between Direct-to-Consumer Advertising and Testosterone Testing and Initiation in the United States, 2009-2013

J. Bradley Layton, PhD1; Yoonsang Kim, MPH, PhD2; G. Caleb Alexander, MD, MS3,4; et al Sherry L. Emery, MBA, PhD2

JAMA. 2017;317(11):1159-1166.

Abstract:

 Importance  Testosterone initiation increased substantially in the United States from 2000 to 2013, especially among men without clear indications. Direct-to-consumer advertising (DTCA) also increased during this time.

 Objective  To investigate associations between televised DTCA and testosterone testing and initiation in the United States.

 Design, Setting, and Population  Ecologic study conducted in designated market areas (DMAs) in the United States. Monthly testosterone advertising ratings were linked to DMA-level testosterone use data from 2009-2013 derived from commercial insurance claims. Associations between DTCA and testosterone testing, initiation, and initiation without recent baseline tests were estimated using Poisson generalized estimating equations.

 Exposures  Monthly Nielsen ratings for testosterone DTCA in the 75 largest DMAs.

 Main Outcomes and Measures  (1) Rates of new serum testosterone testing; (2) rates of testosterone initiation (in-office injection, surgical implant, or pharmacy dispensing) for all testosterone products combined and for specific brands; and (3) rates of testosterone initiation without recent serum testosterone testing.

 Results  Of 17228599 commercially insured men in the 75 DMAs, 1007990 (mean age, 49.6 [SD, 11.5] years) had new serum testosterone tests and 283317 (mean age, 51.8 [SD, 11.3] years) initiated testosterone treatment. Advertising intensity varied by geographic region and time, with the highest intensity seen in the southeastern United States and with months ranging from no ad exposures to a mean of 13.6 exposures per household. Nonbranded advertisements were common prior to 2012, with branded advertisements becoming more common during and after 2012. Each household advertisement exposure was associated with a monthly increase in rates of new testosterone testing (rate ratio [RR], 1.006; 95% CI, 1.004-1.008), initiation (RR, 1.007; 95% CI, 1.004-1.010), and initiation without a recent test (RR, 1.008; 95% CI, 1.002-1.013). Mean absolute rate increases were 0.14 tests (95% CI, 0.09-0.19), 0.05 new initiations (95% CI, 0.03-0.08), and 0.02 initiations without a recent test (95% CI, 0.01-0.03) per 10000 men for each monthly ad exposure over the entire period.

 Conclusions and Relevance  Among US men residing in the 75 designated market areas, regional exposure to televised direct-to-consumer advertising was associated with greater testosterone testing, new initiation, and initiation without recent testing. </TEXT>

Abstract:

 Platelets are critical for haemostasis, thrombosis, and inflammatory responses1, 2, but the events that lead to mature platelet production remain incompletely understood3. The bone marrow has been proposed to be a major site of platelet production, although there is indirect evidence that the lungs might also contribute to platelet biogenesis4, 5, 6, 7. Here, by directly imaging the lung microcirculation in mice8, we show that a large number of megakaryocytes circulate through the lungs, where they dynamically release platelets. Megakaryocytes that release platelets in the lungs originate from extrapulmonary sites such as the bone marrow; we observed large megakaryocytes migrating out of the bone marrow space. The contribution of the lungs to platelet biogenesis is substantial, accounting for approximately 50% of total platelet production or 10 million platelets per hour. Furthermore, we identified populations of mature and immature megakaryocytes along with haematopoietic progenitors in the extravascular spaces of the lungs. Under conditions of thrombocytopenia and relative stem cell deficiency in the bone marrow9, these progenitors can migrate out of the lungs, repopulate the bone marrow, completely reconstitute blood platelet counts, and contribute to multiple haematopoietic lineages. These results identify the lungs as a primary site of terminal platelet production and an organ with considerable haematopoietic potential.

	<TEXT> Hi Professor Dumyati and Dr Dobson - thank you for spending time with us to carry out this AMA.

I applaud your efforts in reducing antibiotic use in primary care and other health settings. But unfortunately, there is a lack of control of such antibiotic usage in many third world countries where antibiotics can be bought over the counter. In addition, there is still rampant antibiotic use in livestock and farming around the world, contributing to the development of resistance. 

What's your view on how these issues should be tackled?

In relation to new and emerging therapeutics, what's on the horizon from your point of view, that is most promising?

Lastly, are we really going to be faced with a post-apocalyptic future of people dying from sore throats and superficial cuts because nothing works in the future (okay, I'm sensationalising now, but there are doomsayers who fear this outcome) - your view?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

Youre Fired, Says the Robot. The Rise of Automation in the Workplace, Technophobes, and Fears of Unemployment

Abstract

 The rapid adoption of new technologies in the workplace, especially robotics and artificial intelligence (AI), has motivated some researchers to determine what effects such technologies may have. Few scholars, however, have examined the possibility that a large segment of the population is apprehensive about the quick pace of technological change and encroachment into modern life. Drawing from economic projections about the future of the digital economy and from literature in the sociology of technology and emotions, this article explores whether certain fears of technology exacerbate fears of unemployment and financial insecurity. Using data from Wave 2 of the Chapman Survey of American Fears (N = 1,541), I find that there exists a sizable population of technophobes or those who fear robots, AI, and technology they do not understand. Technophobes are also more likely than nontechnophobes to report having anxiety-related mental health issues and to fear unemployment and financial insecurity. With advances in robotics and AI, the threat of technological unemployment is discussed as a real concern among a substantial portion of the American population. </TEXT>

Mitogenomes and relatedness do not predict frequency of tool-use by sea otters

Published 22 March 2017.

Abstract

 Many ecological aspects of tool-use in sea otters are similar to those in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins. Within an area, most tool-using dolphins share a single mitochondrial haplotype and are more related to each other than to the population as a whole. We asked whether sea otters in California showed similar genetic patterns by sequencing mitogenomes of 43 otters and genotyping 154 otters at 38 microsatellite loci. There were six variable sites in the mitogenome that yielded three haplotypes, one found in only a single individual. The other two haplotypes contained similar percentages (33 and 36%) of frequent tool-users and a variety of diet types. Microsatellite analyses showed that snail specialists, the diet specialist group that most frequently used tools, were no more related to each other than to the population as a whole. The lack of genetic association among tool-using sea otters compared with dolphins may result from the length of time each species has been using tools. Tool-use in dolphins appears to be a relatively recent innovation (less than 200 years) but sea otters have probably been using tools for many thousands or even millions of years.

Abstract:

 The flagellar beat is extracted from human sperm digital imaging microscopy and used to determine the flow around the cell and its trajectory, via boundary element simulation. Comparison of the predicted cell trajectory with observation demonstrates that simulation can predict fine-scale sperm dynamics at the qualitative level. The flow field is also observed to reduce to a time-dependent summation of regularized Stokes flow singularities, approximated at leading order by a blinking force triplet. Such regularized singularity decompositions may be used to upscale cell level detail into population models of human sperm motility. </TEXT>

Intravenous fluid rate for reduction of cesarean delivery rate in nulliparous women: a systematic review and meta-analysis. 

Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, 2017; 

DOI: 10.1111/aogs.13121

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/aogs.13121/abstract;jsessionid=137DC0EDADA5A64536A08CD51447DFB1.f02t03

Abstract

 Introduction

 The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine have emphasized the need to promote vaginal delivery and have offered recommendations to safely prevent primary cesarean delivery. However, there has been limited discussion regarding management of intravenous fluids and other aspects of labor management that may influence labor. Therefore the aim of our study was to determine if an intravenous fluid rate of 250 vs 125 mL/hour is associated with a difference in cesarean delivery rate

 Material and methods

 Searches were performed in Medline, OVID, Scopus, ClinicalTrials. gov, the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library for randomized controlled trials. We included all randomized controlled trials comparing intravenous fluid rates of 125 mL/hour vs. 250 mL/hour in nulliparous women in spontaneous labor at term with singleton pregnancies at  36 weeks. Studies were included regardless of the type of intravenous fluids used and regardless of whether or not oral intake was restricted during labor. Studies including multiparous women or women whose labor was induced were excluded. The primary outcome was the incidence of cesarean delivery. We planned to assess a sensitivity analysis according to type of fluids used and according to restriction of oral fluid intake

 Results

 Seven trials including 1,215 nulliparous women in spontaneous labor at term were analyzed. 593 (48.8%) were in the 250 mL/hour group, and 622 (51.2%) in the 125 mL/hour group. Five studies used lactated Ringer's solution, one used normal saline in dextrose water, and in one study it was unclear which intravenous fluid was used. Women who received intravenous fluids 250 mL/hour had a significantly lower incidence of cesarean delivery for any indication (12.5% vs 18.1%; RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.92; 7 studies, 1,215 participants; I2=0%) and for dystocia (4.9% vs 7.7%; RR 0.60, 95% CI 0.38 to 0.97; 5 studies, 1,093 participants; I2=18%) and a significantly shorter mean of duration of labor of about one hour (mean difference -64.38 minutes, 95% CI -121.88 to -6.88; 6 studies, 1,155 participants; I2=83%) and of length of second stage of labor (mean difference -2.80 minutes, 95% CI -4.49 to -1.10; 899 participants; I2=22%) compared to those who received intravenous fluid 125 mL/hour. No differences were found in the other secondary outcomes. There were no maternal or perinatal deaths and only one woman, in the 125 ml/hr group, developed pulmonary edema. The findings persisted regardless of the type of intravenous fluid used. No significant reduction in the incidence of cesarean delivery was demonstrated in women with unrestricted oral intake; however, this was limited to only 2 studies evaluating 254 women

 Conclusions

 In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that the duration of labor in low-risk nulliparous women may be shortened by a policy of intravenous fluids at a rate of 250 mL/hours rather than 125 mL/hours. This could also lead to a reduction in the incidence of cesarean delivery. The number needed to treat to prevent one cesarean delivery is 18 women. Our data support for increased hydration amongst nulliparous women in labor when oral intake is restricted. Further study is needed regarding risks and benefits of increased hydration among women with unrestricted oral intake, those undergoing induction of labor, and those with medical comorbidities. </TEXT>

Abstract

 Introduction:

 Sleep is a plausible target for public health promotion. We examined the association of changes in sleep with subsequent health and well-being in the general population.

 Aims and Methods:

We analyzed data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, involving 30594 people (aged  16) who provided data on sleep and health and well-being at both Wave 1 (20092011) and Wave 4 (20122014) assessments. Predicting variables were changes in sleep quantity, sleep quality, and sleep medication use over the 4-year period. Outcome variables were the General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12) and the 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12) mental (MCS) and physical (PCS) component scores at Wave 4. Linear regression on each outcome was fully adjusted for potential confounders and baseline values of the relevant predicting and outcome variables.

 Results:

 Better outcomes were associated with an increase in sleep duration (GHQ:  = 1.031 [95% confidence interval {CI}: 1.328, 0.734]; MCS: 1.531 [1.006, 2.055]; PCS: 0.071 [0.419, 0.56]), sleep quality (GHQ:  = 2.031 [95% CI: 2.218, 1.844]; MCS: 3.027 [2.692, 3.361]; PCS: 0.924 [0.604, 1.245]), and a reduction in sleep medication use (GHQ:  = 1.929 [95% CI: 2.400, 1.459]; MCS: 3.106 [2.279, 3.933]; PCS: 2.633 [1.860, 3.406]). Poorer outcomes were on the other hand associated with a reduction in sleep duration, a decrease in sleep quality, and an increase in sleep medication use. Changes in sleep quality yielded the largest effects on the health and well-being outcomes.

 Conclusions:

 Changes in sleep were temporally associated with subsequent health and well-being. Initiatives that aim to protect a critical amount of sleep, promote sleep quality, and reduce sleep medication use may have public health values. </TEXT>
