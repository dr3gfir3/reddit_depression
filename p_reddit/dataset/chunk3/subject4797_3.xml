	<TEXT> i was going down wikipedia pages for certain administration councils or whatever and nobody is hired.

No assistants are listed. It's pretty ridiculous how nobody is there if it's accurate and i wonder how far along in hiring were past administrations, how full or empty their staffs were. Because this one seems to be the barest of bones. </TEXT>

  then why was DWS fired for rigging the primary?

She was not. She was fired because she acted inappropriately as DNC chair as evident through emails. She spoke of doing things and favor a candidate which is against the rules of her organization.

Why was Donna Belize fired from CNN for rigging the primary?

She was fired for sharing questions with the campaign(s). Not rigging an election.

Why did DNC lawyers argue that Bernie supporters had no leg to stand on when they sued because they should have known the primary was rigged? 

Why are Hillary sycophants still lying and saying the primary was not rigged, after the DNC already admitted it was rigged?

Rigged? No, presence of a DNC rule-breaking bias? Yes.

For example, Rick Washik, donated to the Sanders Campaign between February 2016 and June 2016, months after posting a link to a petition that claimed that Congresswoman Wasserman Schultz was biased. Catherine Cyko, FAC  19, donated to the Sanders Campaign between February 28, 2016 and June 30, 2016, after she posted an article accusing the DNC of bias.  Marlowe St. Cloud Primacy , made her first reported donation to the Sanders Campaign on March 8, 2016, several days after posting an article accusing the DNC of bias.Rosalie Consiglio,, made her first reported donation to the Sanders Campaign a week after posting an article accusing the DNC of bias

This sample demonstrates that, aside from not being actionable, Plaintiffs theory that donors relied upon Defendants statements about neutrality to make donations they would not have otherwise made is not plausible

What the DNC argued is that somebody gave money to the DNC after the fact they were aware of the idea that DWS has a bias and using it to affect things professionally. It make's a bit of sense, if you think something is corrupt and your money might not be going where it should be, why the fuck are you still giving them money, and then you expect to get it back? Seems silly but i would also think things through and not donate to an organization that seems shady or at least not 100% transparently truthful but i digress.

because Hillary and her cronies prevented the best people from having a shot.

It's never Bernie Sander's fault or his campaign' fault right? It's not his fault he didn't expand his base and pick up minorities early on that would have won southern states? It's not his fault his campaign was disjointed and poorly run according to those who actually worked on in some places.

Bernie Sanders' didn't get the nomination because he was running in an unwinnable race or at least a highly unwinnable race for numerous reasons. From reasons related to the experience and strength of the opposing campaign, to the name recognition of the opposing campaign, to biases from people who were in positions to push the needle. From his own campaign's faults as well.

There is no single reason Bernie Sanders' lost.

The division of the Democratic party is not the fault of HRC or Bernie Sanders, its the fault of, ignorance, gullibility and fake news or not wholly accurate reports.

**How privy he will be to what's going down at WrestleMania:**

If I wanted to know, I could know everything. But I don't want to know and especially at WrestleMania. A perfect example was last year with the Undertaker and Brock Lesnar. **When Undertaker's streak was ended by Brock, oh, my God, I was as shocked as the people sitting at the stadium that night inside the [New Orleans] Superdome.** I had know no idea in a million years that was going to happen, and that was the reaction you got out of our call hopefully. I was expecting The Undertaker to kick out and I did one of my normal "One, two" and I was expecting to say kick out and all of a sudden it was three. **I looked at John and he looked at me and I mouthed to him off-air, "Is it over?" His eyes were big and wide and I said to myself: "Okay, the streak is over." I want those moments to happen.**

One of my favorite WrestleMania matches to call was the first time Rock and John Cena met in Miami [at Wrestlemania XXVIII]. I didn't know what would happen and it was such a great year-long build. It makes that moment so much better. At the end of the day, just like anyone else who calls any sport, we are fans of the product and we want to be as intrigued as everybody else.

**Who is in his ear during RAW:**

So this is the fun part of my job. People think I sit down in a chair and I look at the ring and say, "Okay there are two guys fighting and this is what they are doing" and call the match. That is, and I swear to God, so far from the truth. I sit down and in my headset when I am calling Monday Night Raw for three hours, **I have my executive producer, I hear my audio technician, I hear whoever is producing us backstage whether it is [WWE Chairman and CEO] Mr. [Vince] McMahon or Triple H or whoever it may be at the time. I also have two guys I have to listen to that I am working with so we can have a conversation on the air. So at any given time I have my voice, the two guys at ring side, audio, the executive producer and whoever is producing that night. So I sometimes have six voices in my head at once while we are on the air on live television.** While that is going on, someone might say that the number one trend in the world on Twitter is this and we have to hit on it. Meanwhile, don't forget to tell people why Paige is doing this to Nikki Bella. Then John may be telling me a joke and Booker T might be laughing and I have to keep all this going and keep the train on the tracks. I am a traffic cop.

**How hard it is to do three hours of RAW:**

When 11:15 p.m. ET rolls around, people have said to all of us, "You guys look like zombies. And it's true. It is mentally exhausting. And it is physically exhausting, too. I sweat through my suit sometimes. When I am done, I get in my car to drive to the next town and I completely zone out for two or three hours. But it is also rewarding every week. I love it.

**What he considers the greatest match he's called:**

I have done a lot of thinking about this the last couple weeks as we get ready for WrestleMania. **I think the number one match for me professionally and personally was Eddie Guerrero and Brock Lesnar in 2004.** Eddie had gone through a lot in his career and I was very close to Eddie. That night was a really special moment for me. I'd also pick the Mick Foley call the night he won the championship [in 1999] during the Monday Night Wars. Was it a great call? I don't think by any stretch of the imagination but what made that call special to me was the emotion in my voice. That was a special moment. Mick and I have been real close over the years because of our connection to Bruce Springsteen. We are both huge Springsteen fans and we both know Springsteen's guitarist, Nils Lofgren. That's sort has been our bond, and Mick gave me for my birthday one year a harmonica that Springsteen had used in a concert. Rock-John Cena I is up there too. That was one of my all-time favorite calls. And in retrospect, I would put last year's Lesnar-Undertaker match because of the historical significance and the surprise factor.

**Sting in WWE:**

He's a great guy, number one. Number two, I thought I would ever have the opportunity to do that. In my career I have called matches of some of the greatest guys of all time and Sting is one of those guys that I don't think any of us who have been all WWE all the time ever thought we'd have the opportunity to say, "Oh, my God, it's Sting."?

To be able to call him and Hunter (Triple H) at WrestleMania is going to be an absolute thrill.

**Paul Heyman:**

He is an absolute genius. Paul Heyman, a lot of people don't know this, used to be the head writer on SmackDown when I was cutting my chops as a wrestling announcer. He taught me so much about this business. If it weren't for Paul, I probably would not be in the position I am in. He is a genius.

*Something I found interesting in the SI article is as follows*

SI - *Let me read you something you said in an interview with prowrestlingnet.com that I found interesting: "People don't understand the amount of pressure that's on us as commentators to serve so many masters. First off there's the hardcore fans who have been watching for 20 or 30 years who want their old school wrestling. They want you to call a wrestling match; they want you to call every single hold, so you've got to please that. You've got to try to do your best. You also have to please your kids who are 50 percent of your audience and your women who are a large part of our audience too, so you're talking about different stories when it comes to those demographics. We're obviously in a PG era now, so you can't get away with a lot of things you could get away with 15 years ago."
So how do you take care of all these factions in a broadcast?*

MC - Honestly, you are never going to please everyone. It is impossible to do. We have to do what is best and asked of us. What people have to understand about our product is that we are entertainment. There is no ifs, ands or buts about it. We are an entertainment television show, just like watching Walking Dead or Better Call Saul. We are an entertainment show so we have to entertain. And we need to entertain a wide variety of people. Again, you have your hardcore fans that want it to be complete wrestling like it was back in the 70s and 80s. We dont do that anymore. That is not what we do. 

MC - Now obviously the way that I talk about our product and I will be dating myself: I harken back to the old television show Taxi. The show was based in a taxi garage and that is where the conflicts were ultimately resolved. But what was interesting about the show was everything that was happening in these people lives outside of the garage. It is the same thing that we do in WWE. Our conflicts are resolved in the ring but what is interesting is everything that is going on around that match to get us to that point. So it is hard to serve all masters and we just have to do what we can do. The other thing is, from the standpoint of women who watch our product, that demographic is growing immensely over the last number of years. It is one of the reasons the "Give Diva A Chance" revolution has started. Women watch our product so you have to serve that master. You have to serve kids. You will never please everyone but you have to go out and try do what you can to at least please the majority of the masses.

	<DATE> 2015-02-17 02:40:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Having posted a thread not to long ago about podcasts I finally got into listening to some podcasts.

My question now is about comic books. I like to try and diversify the media I consume to try and have my hand in a bunch of different pots, looking for things i like. Which is why i wanted to get into podcasts, it was one form of media that is getting really big that i wasnt into yet.

I read my first comic book last week **Superman Red Son** as I thought was a good starting off point. Its a stand alone story that i can read in one go. I followed that up by looking for a Batman one and found **Arkham Manor** which sounded cool and I read all the issues and will continue to as long as new ones are coming out. Lastly, I started the **Guardians of the Galaxy (2013- )** series and have throughly enjoyed what i've gotten through.

Personally what makes me feel overwhelmed is all these crossover things. Like can i just read say a series in the New 52 without having to read 12 other series or ones that don't interest me despite having like these crossover things. 

I also am having trouble understanding the Marvel comics and how to read the ones that are coming out now. I understand that DC's 52 is a restart so you start at #1 for all the series and continue on (except Green Arrow which ive see that starting at #17 is better).

Other than the overwhelming feel i get trying to figure out reading orders or how to read a series or events/crossovers i feel good about the comics. I find DC to be a lot easier to start with their 52 rather than Marvel because even though i'm reading GOTG they still talk about thigns that happened in the past that i have no idea what they are.

----

I also plan to read the following

- Green Arrow (52)

- Green Arrow Year One

- Batman Year One

- Batman Killing Joke

- Batman Long Halloween

- Batman Dark Victory

- Gotham by Gaslight

- Gotham Noir

- Batman Master of the Future

- Skullkickers

---

Along with all that i'm looking to other characters or series to get into, i heard about the Suicide Squad film and that sounds like it would be an interesting comic story. I think i'd like the "bad guy group." But also i'll look into Deathstroke and some other DC series. But i don't know if i can figure out Marvel as ive said before.
