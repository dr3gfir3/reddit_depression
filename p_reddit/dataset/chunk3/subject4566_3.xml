	<TEXT> I'm saying this even though it has Hillary ahead in all their swing states except, implausibly, Pennsylvania. I saw their leader on Vice News and alarm bells went off. First, he claimed as a given that men and women vote 50-50 when women in fact vote more. Then he kept misreading his own numbers by factors of 10 without realizing he was talking crazy until the host kept correcting him. He claimed Hillary was at 4.4% in Colorado instead of 44%, while Stein was at 72% instead of 7.2%. The guy also said they weren't tracking North Carolina because they didn't realize it was an important swing state in September when they chose states. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The writing will be on the wall well before then, but the winner won't be declared by the news networks until states totalling 270 electoral votes have been called for one candidate.

For example, by 7:30, Florida, Virginia, Ohio and North Carolina will all close. [Put any three of those states in Clinton's column](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/upshot/clinton-trump-paths-to-win-election.html) and you see what happens: Trump has no path to victory. News outlets only wait till 270 to keep viewers watching longer, and to not get accused of depressing turnout in Western states that haven't finished voting. </TEXT>

Maricopa County, where the long lines happened, has four Republicans and one Democrat on the Board of Governors. The Democrat is Steve Gallardo, who [endorsed Sanders](http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/news/bernie-sanders-gets-more-endorsements-from-arizona-latino-leaders-8040287).

	<TITLE> Oregon ballot returns: Dems ahead of GOP by bigger margin than 2008 or 2012 so far </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-02 14:14:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> According to early Oregon ballot return figures, 46.4% of statewide ballots returned so far are from registered Democrats, compared to 31.8% from Republicans. That D +14.6% margin so far compares to D +8.2% in 2012 and D +12.7% in 2008.

If you calculate the vote split between just Democrats and Republicans each year, it was D +14.4% in 2008, D +10.8% in 2012, and is D +18.6% so far in 2016.

The actual results in the Oregon presidential race have been D +16.4% in 2008 and D +12.1% in 2012.

But the people who vote early aren't necessarily representative of those who vote in the final week. For example, in other states, the earliest absentee ballots tend to come from an older demographic, while last-minute ones skew younger. But in-person voting on election day tends to skew more Republican than early voting. I'm not aware of a pattern for Oregon ballot returns.

Here are links to the numbers, plus math:

  **[2016](http://www.electproject.org/early_2016)** (to date)  
  D: 339,586 / 732,179 = 46.4%  
  R: 233,083 / 732,179 = 31.8%  
  Margin: D +14.6%  
  Two-party split: 59.3%40.7% (D +18.6)

  **[2012](http://sos.oregon.gov/elections/Documents/statistics/november-2012-voter-participation.pdf)**  
  D: 752,722 / 1,820,507 = 41.3%  
  R: 602,090 / 1,820,507 = 33.1%  
  Margin: D +8.2%  
  Two-party split: 55.6%44.4% (D +10.8%)  

  **[2008](http://sos.oregon.gov/elections /Documents/statistics/participation-stats-11-2008.pdf)**  
  D: 929,741 / 1,845,251 = 50.4%  
  R: 695,677 / 1,845,251 = 37.7%  
  Margin: D +12.7%  
  Two-party split: 57.2%42.8% (D +14.4%) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that you're angry, but swearing at me is counterproductive, as are snotty claims that your opponent must not know things that are unimpressively basic.

As the chart indicates, the current blocking of bills is a historical aberration. For example, [filibustering has skyrocketed](https://tcf.org/assets/images/blog_images/2013-11-21-filibuster-reform-updated.png), and the filibuster itself has mutated into something new. The filibuster used to simply ensure that the minority's views could be heard. Senators used to speak for hours to block a bill like Strom Thurmond's record 24-hour blockade of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and then when the filibuster ended, the normal simple-majority vote took place  no supermajority required. The filibuster was simply about ensuring the minority was heard.

Now, we have this weird mutation of Senate norms where virtually all legislation requires a 60-vote supermajority, as if the Senate is "the chamber that requires a 60 percent supermajority." That was never the case. It's an aberration. And now simple motions to proceed are being blocked, meaning *no debate takes place at all.* We've gone through the looking glass to where a filibuster ensures no voices get heard, instead of ensuring all voices get heard. That's literally the opposite of a filibuster.

And that's hardly all. The bottlenecking of routine judicial appointments has gone absurd. Just the difference from [Bush to Obama](http://www.pfaw.org/sites/default/files/images/Average_Days_Chart.jpg) is extraordinary, and if you recall, Republicans were apoplectic at the much shorter judicial approval wait times under Bush. Imagine the outraged "Up or down vote!" chanting that would be going on today if this stall-everything approach was happening under a Republican.

Other tactics, like where a single senator places a hold on legislation or a nominee, have gone off the charts, and now those holds are indefinite instead of temporary. One ambassadorial nominee even [died waiting](http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/282448-obama-nominee-died-after-waiting-two-years-for-confirmation) over two years. There was no actual objection to her. Sen. Cotton just wanted to personally punish the president by blocking an old college friend of Obama's until she died of cancer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your first paragraph acknowledges that bills are being blocked. You can come up with ad hoc criticism of any bill imaginable, so "show me a bill I can't criticize" is a pointless challenge.
Your second paragraph claims I'm wrong to say bills can't get passed, because Congress is still naming post offices and recognizing Rosa Parks' birthday, and sometimes during an election year you can shame Republicans into passing Zika funding without a poison pill because Florida is a swing state. But there are clearly many bills that can't get passed, hence the dropoff. </TEXT>

 Whether it was becoming the first Republican Senator to co-sponsor the Equality Act, co-sponsoring a bill to help schools combat anti-LGBT bullying or supporting marriage equality, Senator Kirk has demonstrated time and again that he believes in full federal equality, said HRC President Chad Griffin.

They also criticized Mark Kirk and called on him to [withdraw his comments:](https://www.twitter.com/bllorenz/status/792027308743856128)

Mark Kirk's comments were wrong and inappropriate. HRC endorsed Senator Kirk based on the strength of his record on LGBTQ equality, and while that remains unchanged, we believe he should rescind his comments immediately. </TEXT>

Comey grandstanding, attacking a candidate of the other party who he had no case against, and commenting days before an election, is not what the FBI does.
