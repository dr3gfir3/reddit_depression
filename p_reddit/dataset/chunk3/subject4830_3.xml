[Another source](http://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/20/donald-trump-says-hed-absolutely-require-muslims-to-register/). It's all in how you parse Trump's statements. Personally, I don't think he would try to get US citizens to register.

I still think the whole registry idea is just PR talk. We already know who gets visas to enter the US. We know what countries they are coming from. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They need to relax the driving restriction on Pokestops. I commute by car and counted on grabbing some pokeballs on my commute. Sure, it's not the smartest idea, but I was careful. There is plenty of slow stop and go traffic. Now pokestops work only if I have been sitting still for a few seconds.

Lately, I've been passing on most Pokemon I see, in an effort to stock up on pokeballs for when gen 2 drops.

To make matters worse, the one pokestop near by office has been unreliable due to the GPS not working well indoors. That's probably nothing to due with Pokemon, but it's been a real pain. </TEXT>

If Trump gets some credit for that, that's fine. If he can actually help some of the 'white working class' voters that he appealed to, that's great too.

Greatest Fear: That Trump and the Republican Congress actually implement some of Trump's far right ideas. If there were another 9/11 size terrorist attack, how far would Trump and Congress go? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Twitter seems like a hard way to communicate any meaningful information. YouTube videos are a good idea, and longer form text social media.

Even if Trump isn't standing at a podium in front of the White House Press Corp, the press will still be an important part of all this. We still need experts to review what Trump is saying, point out where his ideas are not economically feasible, or even potentially violating the law.

This could just end up being an odd way to communicate with the press. Where Trump says something directly, the press write about all the ways it won't work, and the Trump tweets at the press in response. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One issue with nationalism, even the version that includes the diverse background of everyone in the US, is what happens in the world when the US pulls back and takes an inward focus? We have a great deal of influence all around the globe. Some of that is due to our economic strength and some is due to our military strength. There is no reason that global reach needs to continue, but it would be foolish to turn inward without looking at the very real problems that would cause elsewhere in the world. Who would try to solve thos of problems? What old scores would be settled if we weren't there to stop them? Before you say, "who cares, that's not our problem" first look at what happened in the Balkins after the fall of Communism, or the Middle East after the Arab Spring, or even them Middle East since the first Gulf War. These situations have a tendency to become our problems whether we like it or not. </TEXT>

For all this hatred of "Washington Insiders" the idea that he can put together an entire administration made up of people who never worked in Washington and have no idea how Washington works, that's just plain bat shit crazy. There need to be some grown-ups at the table. I'm not a fan of Reince Priebus, but at least he's a grown up and looks to be Trump's Chief of Staff. That's a smart move. If he gets enough of these folks, and is *willing to listen to them* (that's a big if), then they can help get him through the learning curve without making too big of a mess along the way. </TEXT>

I'm not seeing a legal argument that could be used to take same sex marriage case all the way to the Supreme Court and over turn it. The cake baker argument doesn't seem to be enough to overturn all same sex marriages. At best, the court could allow someone to refuse service to a same sex marriage couple, but "separate but equal" doesn't tend to work with the court. Have any of the legal folks who want to overturn the Court's decision share what the strategy would be? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently, Trump has one spot to fill. Even with a super far right nominee, the court will still have the same balance as it did when Scalia was on the court. If one of the liberal justices steps down while Trump is President, then we are screwed. Unless the Democrats can take control of the Senate at the mid terms and then play the same stalling game the Republicans played on President Obama. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the case of a baker, wouldn't they only have standing to bring a case to say it's okay to not bake a cake for a same-sex wedding?

A same-sex couple suing for the right to marry, to have equal protection as heterosexual couples, I see how that legal argument works, and why they won.

I'm not seeing how the anti-same-sex marriage argument works. Stuff like "it's against my religion" wouldn't get them very far. If you don't think you should marry someone of the same sex, don't. Suing because you are personally offended that two dudes got married, that's argument is going to get thrown out. That's been the problem with the anti-same-sex legal issues, they never came up with a legit legal argument.

* Have sex to create babies, if you are married
* or, don't have sex.
* no birth control.

It's untenable. People may try to follow the rules, but almost everyone eventually gives up and just tries to enjoy the many joys of human sexuality.

I sure hope this Priest gets in trouble with his superiors and they don't pat him on the back and encourage this type of behavior. </TEXT>

If he keeps at it on Twitter and especially if he starts a new network, he can keep on spinning conspiracy theories, calling for more investigations, impeachment, etc. There may not be much in the way of facts to back up his assertions, but that's never stopped Trump before and his antics during the campaign have hurt Hillary's reputation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have [this set of joysticks and buttons](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00WAZK5K8/), with a Pi 3 and Retropie. I have been having trouble getting the joystick to work in games.

The buttons are wired up as described [here](https://github.com/libretro/retroarch-joypad-autoconfig/blob/master/udev/DragonRise_Inc.___Generic___USB__Joystick__.cfg). I copied the full config file onto my Pi. The joystick up/down/left/right works fine when navigating around the RetroPie menus. When I start a game, Ms. PacMan for example, the joystick doesn't work right. I can go left right, but not up down. Similar behavior with the Colecovision emulator.

A few questions:

* Is there additional configuration needed for each emulator to map the joysticks and buttons?
* How do I configured one set of joystick/buttons for player 1 and the other for player 2?
* How to configure games like Robotron where both joysticks are used? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Abortion would be legal.

Abortion and guns are where a new party platform will get tricky. I suspect many conservative Catholics and other conservative religious folks wouldn't be comfortable voting for a pro choice candidate.

 Gun rights? I would think their best bet would be full gun rights, no restrictions.

Being pro choice and even more pro 2nd Amendment than current laws, that could also be a difficult platform to bring people together on.

There have been polls that show most Americans, even gun owners and NRA members support the modest gun regulations that Democrats are pushing for (no fly/no buy, universal background checks, magazine capacity).

 The real question is how to keep the alt-right out.

This one seems a little easier. Have a candidate who takes a strong stance against racism and zenophobia. Make it clear that anyone is welcome, no matter their religious or ethnic background. </TEXT>
