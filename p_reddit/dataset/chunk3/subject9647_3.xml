	<TEXT> Thanks, I appreciate it! Adulting is hard as fuck but it's better than what my parents put me through. I'm moving into my first apartment tomorrow so I'm officially Not Homeless! But Publix is fantastic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I moved out of my parents' house earlier this year to get away from the abuse, I used to go get a sandwich with fresh meat and lots of veggies and a drink at the deli, or hot soup for dinner. It was nice to have a substantial, fresh, healthy meal for free instead of spending a dollar on a McChicken every day.

Honestly, I think publix kind of assumes the best in people. I sometimes feel a tiny bit bad lifting from them, because everyone there is so genuinely friendly and helpful.

But fuck yeah. Publix is a goldmine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That could work, but be careful where you put the spider wrap. Best bet is to make sure no one else is in the bathroom and then put it in one of the ceiling tiles </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't ditch the item in the bathroom because when they look at footage they'll know it was you, unless you had it concealed first. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice review, also super accurate...I work at a Nordstrom and LP is SUPER tight. They don't fuck around.

We have a button on the register that pages LP to our area instantly. There's quite a few plainclothes, tons of PTZ cameras, no shelves, and we have a code name for LP so over the intercom you'll hear "(Codename) to (insert department here)"

Be careful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At my school, they had these gross, plastic wrapped brownies that were 50 cents in the lunch line. I had a friend who had just gotten into smoking and was always bragging about it and annoying the fuck out of everyone. So one day, I unwrapped a brownie from the lunch line and gave it to him, telling him it was a pot brownie. He believed me, and he made a big show telling everyone he was "so fucking high (he) didn't remember where he was, LOL". Made himself look like an ass in front of everyone. </TEXT>
