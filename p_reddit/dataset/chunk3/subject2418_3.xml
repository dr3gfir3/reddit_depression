	<TEXT> Correct. It reeks of hypocrisy, as their leader Xi Jingping has taken on a *massive* corruption campaign, specifically where finances and priveliege of office is concerned. Around [100,000 low to mid-level officials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-corruption_campaign_in_China) have been charged, and graft chasers tracked down [330,000 people](http://www.economist.com/news/china/21695923-his-exercise-power-home-xi-jinping-often-ruthless-there-are-limits-his) *last year*. So that people at the very top are going without paying their taxes is an astounding lapse in Xi's cult of authority.

Sacha is a once in a lifetime contender for this role. No one will ever be able to do it better but somehow Queen, who know, can't understand that Freddie was much more than even on on-stage God, he was a very, very complicated person, and also, [he loved cats](https://queenphotos.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/freddie-with-cat-1985-1986.jpg). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there-- thanks so much for your kind words, and I think you're right. I always had kids come up to me after saying I was the "cool sub" and that was my mentality that they should have fun and I would try to challenge them with the materials as much as possible. Thanks for taking a moment out to spread that appreciation, made me feel a touch different looking back on all that. That was really nice of you. Cheers mate-- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a sub for two 1/2 years. Thanks for feeling. I was really popular with the kids cause I just hungout and made jokes but it was torture...It wasn't the kids so much as this nomadic life... never being in the same class twice, never seeing the same students, making absolutely no connections... it was such a waste of life, you can't even imagine fam-- to be such a no one. To exemplify, I don't have a single Linkedin or Facebook friend from that time. I was literally a ghost.  
  
I'd go home everyday after 8 hours of doing nothing, and write up resumes and cover letters that no one would read. Then repeat. Drive an hour there and back contemplating the worth of the mortal coil. Dreaming of a horizon of hope. Nothing ever happened. Repeat, repeat, repeat.     
  
It was so damn depressing, brutal, and seemed it would never end, but I never gave up hope and everyday I'm inching closer to my dream. I'm so close now.. I been waiting for my dream to come for *7 years*, and i *still* believe it will.
  
edit: somehow through synchronicity just a few minutes ago I got an email confirming I'm just about there-- anyone else who's wondering if they should give up a hope-- don't you damn dare. 7 years didn't stop me, how long would stop you? thanks all you supporting that means a whole ton, for real </TEXT>
