	<TEXT>  The decision from U.S. District Judge James L. Robart is a modest blow to the state of Washington, which had sued over the ban, because the quickest path to success would have been getting the judge to declare that Trumps new order was affected by the freeze he imposed previously. But Robart declined to do that only for procedural reasons and did not address the merits of any arguments.

 Neither side, he wrote, had filed a motion for him to consider, and the states previous complaints were directed at an executive order which is now revoked.

 Accordingly, the court also declines to resolve the apparent dispute between the parties concerning the applicability of the courts injunctive order to the New Executive Order until such time as an amended complaint that addresses the New Executive Order is properly before the court, Robart wrote.

Probably the correct decision as it's on procedural grounds.  Temporary setback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apparently he paid $50 million more than it was worth, and $13 million more than the previous most expensive home in Palm Beach.

 In 2008, Rybolovlev characterized the purchase as a company investment: This acquisition is simply an investment in real estate by one of the companies in which I have an interest, Rybolovlev said at the time through a spokesman for Uralkali, the fertilizer company he previously owned.

 Rybolovlev added that he didnt plan to live in the United States.

 Nonetheless, he went ahead and paid an exceptionally high, $50 million premium to Trump, then a real estate tycoon and reality TV host, for a property he never sought to live in, not even on a part-time basis.

 ...

 In 2011, court documents in his divorce stated that Mr. Rybolovlev has not purchased or managed any real estate in Florida for investment purposes, either directly or indirectly, according to a motion filed in the divorce case.

 That was news to Trump.

 Somebody paid me $100 million, Trump told a Palm Beach Post reporter in February 2011.

 Trump made a hefty profit on the flip: He had scooped up the estate for $41.35 million in 2004 out of health-care magnate Abe Gosmans bankruptcy filing. In essence, Trump sold for more than double what he had paid four years before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Oh I totally agree. I guess my point is the mocking is real, and as you said rightfully so, so they aren't wrong to feel discriminated towards (although I'm not agreeing it's more than muslims).

Wow, that totally went over my head initially.  I didn't think about it from that angle, although I still think they are being willfully ignorant.  But, I actually take that point and understand more then how they'd feel that way, yet still that degree of discrimination is wholly different than Muslims whom get their mosques banned from being built by clever zoning maneuvers in some towns (like in Bernards Township, NJ), mosques burnt down, get discriminated against in the job market, denounced by the President and his advisers, get banned from entry into the US if they were born in one of 6 countries, receive distrusting and hostile looks just walking down the street, and get consistently harassed by the TSA despite them catching 0 terrorists.  People, usually Christians, talk about Muslims sometimes like they are some sort of disease or cancer on our culture, not realizing if the 3.3 million Muslims which lived in this country were actually just that, things would be a little different.  And also not realizing that some of their closely held beliefs stemming from their interpretations of Christianity can lead to just as costly and harmful social policies as some aspects of what you may see in Sharia law.  If we were governed by the code of Deuteronomy, well, my word.

 But I might be naive, as I also feel republicans should be the most vocal in denouncing trump and standing up for their "religion" and what they want it to represent. Perhaps this is me still wanting to believe in the good in everyone :(

That's a good quality to have actually, and I think it's justified to think Republicans, based on what they proclaim they believe in, would have denounced Trump's rise and rhetoric consistently and forcefully. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just don't understand how you think one legal case defining one segment of the EOP as 'not an agency' means it automatically applies to parallel segments in the EOP.  It doesn't seem like it has any bearing.  You've convinced me there's more legal substance to your argument than I initially though so thanks for continuing to engage me to figure this out, but I still think it's incorrect.  But it's muddled legal territory, because every reference to EOP I find lists its agencies, including on the federal register and academic journals.  It cannot be considered an an absolute parochial usage of the word when it's in the federal register, no?  I mean, it's not coming from some blog.  Maybe the academic journals and encyclopedia can be discounted, but the federal register?  

Also, what about Nixon defining the Counselor to the President as a cabinet-level position?  Do you think that has any bearing on this?

I need to find the statute defining the EOP, that would probably help.

EDIT: I see your edit about my second question about the cabinet-level.  Thanks.  I need to find the defining statute. Shaub has read the legal guidance you cited from Jan 20 and he disagrees.  He has to have a good reason for doing so and I think it's because this reliance on the word agency is weak and can be overtaken.  Unfortunately I do not have the full justification at the moment as you have certainly thrown a (welcome) wrench into all of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Using your legal argument, the other departments under EOP are not covered by ethics laws or Title VII either, including....

* Council of Economic Advisers
* Council on Environmental Quality
* National Security Council
* Office of Administration
* Office of Management and Budget
* Office of National Drug Control Policy
* Office of Science and Technology Policy
* Office of the United States Trade Representative
* Office of the Vice President

You think the ethics laws don't apply to these?

One segment of a hierarchical department can be considered 'not an agency' for legal purposes while other segments of it can, I would presume.  See this: http://www.encyclopedia.com/history/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/federal-agencies

 President Franklin D. Roosevelt created the EOP in 1939 to manage a dramatic expansion in the size and responsibility of the executive branch. The **EOP established agencies** to perform highly specialized services for the president. Each president has altered the composition of the EOP to some extent. **Some standard agencies**  within the EOP include the White House Office, Office of the Vice President, Council of Economic Advisors (CEA), Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ), National Security Council, Office of Administration, Office of Management and Budget (OMB), Office of National Drug Control Policy, Office of Policy Development, Office of Science and Technology Policy, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative.

Or: http://www.vanderbilt.edu/csdi/Sourcebook12.pdf

 The EOP is best understood as a warehouse that contains many distinct agencies and offices rather than as an agency in its own right.  ....
 Among federal agencies, **EOP agencies** are usually the most responsive to the President....

Moreover, Kellyanne works as the Counselor to the President, which is a cabinet-level position, all of which are covered by ethics laws. </TEXT>

I'm aware.

Since you bypassed my argument to try to teach what a colloquial definition is, I'll restate my position again.  The case you presented defined the Executive Residence of the White House as 'not an agency'.  It did not define the Executive Office of the President as 'not an agency'.  You keep saying the 'White House', which is a broad term and narrowly defined in that case as the Executive Residence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  But Bannons transition to a more professional role has reportedly been accompanied by a shift to pragmatism that has unnerved the loyal coalition of white nationalists who are the backbone of Breitbart and who helped elect Trump. On two of the foundational hardline platforms of Trumps campaign, immigration and health care, Bannon has reportedly become a moderating force in the White House.

 [Buzzfeed News](https://www.buzzfeed.com/adriancarrasquillo/steve-bannon-helped-preserve-daca-but-democrats-and-activist?utm_term=.mu0EYg9n1#.jeLmzOeYK) reported that two administration sources pointed to chief strategist Steve Bannon as the man who preserved the current iteration of DACA, the executive action signed by former President Barack Obama to defer the deportation of undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. as children. Bannon reportedly battled against other administration officials, like Attorney General Jeff Sessions and senior policy adviser Stephen Miller, to slow down Trumps promise to end the program on his first day in office (a stark difference when compared to Breitbarts anti-immigrant coverage).

WTF?  

 Bannons effort to save the measure backed by members of both parties is less of a turn towards moderation and more of a strategic ploy to engender goodwill for future immigration battles, Buzzfeed reported.

Ah, he's a patient extremist. </TEXT>

 Crime rates in the United States remain near historic lows, Sessions was scripted to remark. We have won great victories against crime in America.

 But instead, Sessions focused his entire address on doom and gloom, expressing near certainty that the spike in crime was not a blip but that it represented the beginning of the trend.

 Criminologists say this prediction of a long-term crime increase has no evidence to support it.

	<TEXT>  Ethics experts have told NPR that the White House's argument that "many" ethics rules don't apply to EOP employees may rest on the definition of the word "agency."

 A number of ethics rules state that they apply to employees of government "agencies," so this definition is a crucial one in determining which rules apply to whom. Indeed, Passantino had said in a footnote that the White House Office, a subsection of the Executive Office of the President, is not an "agency."

 Shaub disagreed with that as well.

 Painter told NPR last week that hinging the argument on the word "agency" could be a losing fight. "I am not sure this argument is right so I never would have tried it and would not recommend that the White House do so," he said.

 Likewise, Obama administration ethics official Norman Eisen said he believes the Trump White House's approach here is wrongheaded.

 "This is nonsense. There are debates about whether for other purposes the [White House] is an agency," Norman Eisen wrote in an email to NPR. "Never before for ethics purposes."

	<TEXT>  When Rohrabacher asked Ilves to provide examples of Russian military aggression, the former president referred to the border incident. Rohrabacher was unimpressed: "So you had a situation of corruption at the border, one of your border guards disappeared. I mean military aggression? Has there been any cross-border, at all, military action on the part of the Russians in Estonia?"

 "Well, we have constant violations of our border by military jets, that's one thing, and that's consistent," Ilves said, adding these incidents have "massively increased in the last four years."

 Rohrabacher explained that he had visited the Baltic States after hearing stories of Russian military aggression and found "not one report of actual military aggression." He added that the US has sent "our tanks up there, having B-52 mock raids on Russia, over Estonia, toward the Soviet capital, in the name of stopping Soviet military aggression that never existed. This has got to stop or we're going to end up in war."

Members of the GOP have an extraordinary ability to dismiss any piece of information related to Russia not being so friendly to us or our allies (or Trump's ties).  I wonder if this guy wants Trump's Obama claims investigated?  And why is he calling them Soviets?

 Rohrabacher also compared Putin to Richard Daley, the late mayor of Chicago, saying that Russia is "being run by tough guyssort of like Mayor Daley, in Chicago, is transported over to Russia."

 Connolly then addressed Rohbacher's comparison of Putin with Daley. "I went to school in Chicago during his mayorality," Connolly said. "I didn't know him, but I assure you, Vladimir Putin is no Richard Daley. Richard Daley did not have his political opponents assassinated. He didn't send them into exile. He didn't put them in prison. He didn't silence the press. He didn't assassinate members of the press. He didn't exile members of the press. He sparred with them, and sometimes he was bestedThere is no comparison, and I think we do ourselves a disservice by not recognizing on a bipartisan basis the gravity of the situation we face."

I'm still not sure why Putin apologists cannot understand this, instead conflating actions the CIA or our military may have taken in the past in other countries with Putin's consistent degradation of human rights domestically over the past 17 years of his rule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Page is at it again.

 A former foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump has written to congressional investigators claiming, without evidence, that his mobile phone may have been tapped last year.

 Carter Page, a businessman, suggests this would support the view that the Trump campaign headquarters at Trump Tower in New York was under surveillance, since he works nearby and was a frequent visitor there.

 In a letter addressed to Richard Burr and Mark Warner, chairman and vice-chairman of the Senate intelligence committee, Page notes media reports that secret court orders were issued last October to allow the FBI to conduct surveillance of US persons in an investigation of possible contacts between Russian banks and the Trump Organization.

 Having spoken in favor of some of Mr Trumps policies on other Fox News Group programs during the 2016 campaign as a campaign surrogate and given the peaceful relationship I have had with Russian citizens since my years in the US Navy, it may be understandable why I would be an associated political target if such sick activities had indeed been committed as alleged in the previously cited media reports, he writes.

 For your information, I have frequently dined in Trump Grill, had lunch in Trump Caf, had coffee meetings in the Starbucks at Trump Tower, attended events and spent many hours in campaign headquarters on the fifth floor last year. As a sister skyscraper in Manhattan, my office at the IBM Building (590 Madison Avenue) is literally connected to the Trump Tower building by an atrium.

 Page continues: So if prior media reports may be believed that surveillance was indeed undertaken against me and other Trump supporters, **it should be essentially deemed as a proven fact** that the American peoples concerns **that Trump Tower was under surveillance last year is entirely correct.** </TEXT>

 But the source said Obama "is much more concerned by President Trump kicking people off health insurance, **not staffing the government**, not being prepared for a crisis, rolling back regulations so that corporations can pollute the air and water and letting mentally unstable people buy guns with no problems whatsoever."

 "He cares about all those things much more than what President Trump tweets at the TV each morning," the source told NBC News.

	<TEXT> This is a really good article.  I especially like this part describing the Republican's political MO:
 In a very accessible column, Jared Meyer of Economics21 lays out two ways the spending side of the Affordable Care Act hurts growth. One is that by giving low-income families generous subsidies that phase out as their incomes rise, it reduces their incentive to work more hours or find higher-paying jobs. The other is that the ACA makes it easier for workers in their late 50s or early 60s to retire early, by ensuring they dont need to maintain a full-time job to maintain their health insurance.  
 ...  

 When the Congressional Budget Office came out with the report that provided the basis for Meyers assertion about early retirement, practical Republican Party politicians were overjoyed.

 Just yesterday, said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the Congressional Budget Office found that Obamacare will cost millions of Americans their jobs.

 Georgia Rep. Phil Gingrey said the law creates unprecedented uncertainty for job creators that, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, will leave millions of people looking for work in the next few years.

 Minnesota Rep. John Kline was even blunter: The president's health care law is destroying full-time jobs.

 This is not what the CBO said, as fact-check columns from the Washington Post, PolitiFact, and elsewhere pointed out. But that didnt stop incumbent Republicans from saying it. Nor did it stop Republican challengers like North Carolinas Thom Tillis from saying it in their ads. Running against Kay Hagan in 2014, Tillis charged that the health care law Hagan had voted for would cause 2 million Americans to lose their jobs, according to the CBO.

 That wasnt true, fact-checkers said it wasnt true, but it was a good ad anyway, and Tillis narrowly defeated Hagan.

 The striking thing about Republican use of the CBO report on the Affordable Care Acts labor supply impact is that Republicans werent exaggerating. They werent just making things up, either.

 They were taking a completely genuine conservative policy critique of the law  that it was making things a little too cushy for people, so they might decide to quit working  and turned it into roughly the opposite argument, that the Obamacare jackboot was going to prevent people who wanted jobs from finding work. The habit of doing this repeatedly  not just saying things that arent true, but refusing to state Republicans actual objections to the law  is what has painted the Republican Party into a corner.

And that closing...

 Its a question of whether Republicans should try to deliver on their ideas or try to deliver on their promises, in a world where their ideas are antithetical to what theyve promised. And theres no way out. </TEXT>

Compared to Trump, I would accept Hillary including your slightly delusional description of her.  I would accept a random person out of the phone book.  There's no cognitive dissonance when there's two options, and one is better than the other.

 You may very well have not been old enough to actually vote, so its cool m8. I would try to get your info from a more diverse source than just the reddit comment section.

Again, you know nothing.  You can reply to this and disparage me with your fantasy description of me all you'd like if you want to, though, if it makes you feel better.

EDIT: Just to help you out, here's the actual assessment from our intelligence agencies that I read, which is where I got the main source of my information on the hack on the election.  Read it for yourself, and it's dated **two weeks** after your article.  Jesus, man.

 [We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US
presidential election. Russias goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process,
denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess
Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We
have high confidence in these judgments.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3254237/Russia-Hack-Report.pdf)  

 [We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trumps
election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her
unfavorably to him. All three agencies agree with this judgment. CIA and FBI have high confidence
in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.](https://assets.documentcloud.org/documents/3254237/Russia-Hack-Report.pdf) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you're telling me you can re-read what you just wrote, and it makes complete sense to you?  No amount of criticism or rational argument can dislodge the notion from your mind that Hillary would be a worse President than Trump?  No amount of reasoning and perhaps missing knowledge could convince you that the election actually *was* influenced from without to favor one candidate?  And if using the phrase "to hack the election" is doublespeak when it concerns actual external influence on our election process, then how do you describe the communication coming from the White House?

Oh and good job, saying "if you're old enough to vote" betrays your motivations in how you are approaching this dialogue, by the way. </TEXT>

If you think a foreign power hacking one party and dumping it out to help the other is cool, is nothing to worry about, that's on you, not me.  If you think the phrase "hacking the election" is not the appropriate phrase to define what happened, fine, but nevertheless, a foreign power did exert influence on the election, and hacking is often used in the sense "to modify" or "a creative solution to a problem or limitation".  But go on, feel good about yourself by saying I'm using "doublespeak" as if I'm part of the problem even though I'm rationally laying out a clear explanation of everything I'm saying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Troubled waters these days is right.  And likewise.

For #1, no dispute from me there, I don't know one way or another. 

For #2, I agree up to a point.  That thought also ran through my head.  But it's difficult for me to extrapolate how I remember meeting people to how a candidate for President would remember meeting people (especially foreign dignitaries) because every move of theirs is scrutinized and watched and they are just meeting different types of people than a layman.

For #3, that's a reasonable fear, but I don't think an investigation would hurt more than it would help in that regard.  But more to the overall point, I think the issue is again just the simple dissonance between Trump saying he's never met a Russian official during the campaign, and this report.  Like you I'm not convinced this meeting was nefarious nor that Trump even remembers this, but the dissonance is still there nonetheless.  And dissonance needs to resolve in one way or another.

As for your last candid statement, I can empathize, but for myself I can only say that I wish it was much ado about nothing.  Perhaps it is.  But having a foreign power (especially one adversarial to us) inject themselves surreptitiously into the political debate going on in the country during the election, and now possibly being intertwined in our government at the highest levels, really disturbs me.  And this is completely separate from how Trump himself or his policies may or may not disturb me, mind you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I take your point of view on that, I think the issue is that Trump has never disclosed this when asked if he has had any contacts with Russian officials during the campaign, and we're only learning about it through reporting.

Also, it was a invite-only meeting, and they did shake hands, so it wasn't just that they were in the same room together.  Not to mention JD Gordon has said explicitly he talked with the ambassador about relaxing relations during the campaign, so it's not some crazy stretch to think something similar could have happened here.  Either way, I get your point, and this may indeed be as innocent as you represented it.  

But I don't think it should just be explained away by anyone other than Trump, really, and I wish Trump supporters would welcome an investigation to clear this all up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's bizarre that I replied to people's questions to me?  Since you looked at my post history, it's a shame you didn't see this is actually the first time in a while I've responded to almost every reasonable question in a reply that was put to me, and admittedly a couple that annoyed me.  And if you read my replies in this thread, you would see I was more than reasonable and conceded multiple points to multiple people.  It's called having a discussion.  

Am I paid to be here and what's my agenda?  Seriously?  It's this simple, if my single comment didn't get so many replies and if it wasn't the evening, I wouldn't have this flurry of activity in the last hour.  

What's your deal?  Are you paid to be here? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It says it right there in what I quoted.

 A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and **three other foreign ambassadors** who came to the reception.

And *no one* thinks Russia hacked the election machines to rig the vote.  No one.  That is not the suspicion.  That is an easy strawman to pick apart, though, so I see why you choose it, but again, it's not the argument here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, there's multiple questions there.  I agree the key issue to press is why he did not disclose this, and I'm sure if we look through the record he has categorically denied meeting any Russian officials.

But what is wrong with warming up with Russia?  Nothing in isolation, but when Russia is responsible for invading two sovereign nations in the past 10 years and annexing their territory, undermining democracy in Eastern Europe for a decade or more (and now pretty much all of Europe), intervening in Syria to change the tide for the Assad regime and it's accompanying war crimes as documented by the UN and at least a half dozen NGOs, it's culpability in the downing of the MH17 flight, and most importantly, it's interference in the domestic political affairs of this country by committing what has to be the largest cyberattack in our history, warming up to a Russia without *any* recourse from them is a major problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Crucial parts FTA:

 Trump personally met with the Russian ambassador on April 27, 2016, prior to a major foreign policy speech. The Wall Street Journal, in a report that was [little-noticed](http://americablog.com/2017/03/newsmax-trump-met-russian-amb-kislyak-last-april-despite-denials.html) at the time but was recently picked up by AMERICABlog News, [reported the meeting last year](https://www.wsj.com/articles/donald-trump-goes-his-own-way-with-vladimir-putin-1463172396).

 A few minutes before he made those remarks, Mr. Trump met at a VIP reception with Russias ambassador to the U.S., Sergey Ivanovich Kislyak. Mr. Trump warmly greeted Mr. Kislyak and three other foreign ambassadors who came to the reception.

 Kislyak, according to multiple contemporaneous news reports, was [seated in the front row](http://www.rferl.org/a/us-trump-foreign-policy-speech-russia/27702091.html). It was an invitation-only event.

This seems like an important revelation.

 Trump used the speech to call for warmer relations with Russia.

He has used every speech to do this, though, to be fair. </TEXT>

His answers are better than Sessions' answers, so far, and he keeps saying, "In terms of Russia v US, you know which side I'm on".  And he just said Sessions' written recusal may not be sufficient, so my reactions to him have been up and down.

On another note, Cornyn and Hatch can't come ever seem to speak without complaining about Democrats and whitewashing their (R) colleagues' problems. </TEXT>
