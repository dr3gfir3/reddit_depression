	<TEXT>  proof that the camera was inspected

I guess that's the obvious reason, but not precisely my point. A seller may be honest and sell a a camera meeting his description. In this case it is completely understandable that the seller wants to prevent invalid claims by the buyer. However, the seller may also be dishonest and eventually make the invalid claim that the camera was OK when it was sold by showing the video. If a damage is very obvious, but overlooked by the buyer, the latter may eventually work.

The question is, how common the video taping is in the buyer's country. I am fine with a seller accompanied by a second person, but I have never seen or heard that someone was video taping a potential buyer before (apart from cameras in shops). If the video taping is as unusual as it is here where I live, this shall make the potential buyer suspicious indeed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I fully agree that Epicureans and Stoics certainly should not be enemies any more and I am interested in both philosophies myself. I further agree that one may take what one likes from both, but at the end one may be neither Epicurean nor Stoic, in which case one should at least be honest and not call oneself Epicurean or Stoic.

Looking closer, Epicureanism and Stoicism have more in common than ancient rivalry may suggest, but in a way they are necessarily opposed, though. For Epicureans pleasure is the highest good, while for Stoics it is virtue being the highest good. No matter how much Epicureanism and Stoicism have in common, pleasure and virtue cannot be the highest good at the same time.

By the way, even ancient rivalry was not unambiguous. Seneca and Marcus Aurelius mentioned Epicurus positively. I remember reading somewhere that Marcus even reopened the Epicurean school in Athens, but I have forgotten the source, so take this with a grain of salt. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being familiar with Stoicism, we know that in reality it's mostly our imaginations, our emotions, and our thoughts we are anxious about. Unfortunately, we cannot just decide to be Stoic sages having everything under control, but we can learn how to improve our control step by step. We may not be able to stop struggling completely, but we can improve. Don't be angry with yourself or sorry about your struggles.

Thinking about what a Stoic sage would do has shown to be helpful. Most times the biggest problem is just to do what I am anxious about. But as soon as I simply do it and focus at the moment and what is virtuous to do, things are not nearly as bad as imagined and nothing to be anxious about. Start with simple things, reflect on your day in the evening, maybe imagine what a Stoic sage may say. Again, don't be angry with yourself or sorry about your struggles.

 Has anyone else had to overcome similar troubles?

You have just become familiar with someone struggling with Stoic thought and practice: Marcus Aurelius. He wrote many of his strong affirmations because of his struggles and failures! I think that keeping a philosophical diary like Marcus' Meditations helps a lot and you may do the same. </TEXT>

 In an effort to distance himself from the Democritan conception of the atomic particle, Epicurus posited three essential characteristics to explain the movement of atoms in the void - mass, velocity and something that has puzzled ancient and modern thinkers, called the klinamen. This occurrence was an hypothesized shift in the linear trajectory of an atom at an entirely unexpected and random point in time, and explains how compounds came to be formed in the Epicurean universe, where atoms fall unhindered in parallel to one another. I argue that the klinamen is not an entirely random occurrence but is instead a phenomenon predicated upon the laws of modern physics, the Newtonian laws of motion and gravitation in particular. I further posit that the klinamen is an entirely necessary aspect of the development of the universe from its initial origins of atoms and void (Epicur. Phys. 1.13,14; Ep. Hdt. 39). </TEXT>

 In this article, the monistic ontology of the Eleatic school of ancient Greece is examined in juxtaposition with the nondualistic Advaita Vedanta philosophy of India. The Eleatic ontology is studied through the texts of, firstly, Melissus of Samos, and, secondly, Parmenides of Elea. The characteristic features of Advaita doctrine are gathered from Upanishadic texts and the writings of Sankara. This comparative treatment demonstrates that Being, as described in the Eleatic fragments, is practically identical to the Self (or atman) which lies at the heart of Advaita doctrine. So close is this identity that the two ontologies, the Western and the Eastern, can for all practical purposes be treated as one. In the absence of convincing historical evidence to show that the one ontology exerted a direct influence upon the other, the ineluctable conclusion is that knowledge of the One Being or Self, the immortal essence and true common identity of every creature, was attained independently if not indeed contemporaneously by sages in archaic Greece and in ancient India. This conclusion, moreover, has vital practical significance at the present time: the Eleatic-Vedantic ontology is arguably the key to healing many ills which beset our age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marc Bekoff wrote an article for the Huffington Post criticising the killing: ["Ridiculously Gorgeous Rare Bird" Photographed, Caught, and ... Killed by Researcher](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/marc-bekoff/ridiculously-gorgeous-rar_b_8201720.html)

His conclusion:

 Killing "in the name of conservation" or "in the name of education" or "in the name of whatever" simply needs to stop. It is wrong and sets a horrific precedent for future research and for children. Imagine what a youngster would think if he or she heard something like, "I met a rare and gorgeous bird today ... and I killed him." Even if this handsome male were a member of a common species, there was no reason to kill him. It sickens me that this practice continues and I hope more people will work hard to put an end to it right now, before more fascinating animals are killed. </TEXT>

The *Letter to Menoeceus* is a short and very understandable introduction to the ethical part of Epicurus' philosophy and you may want to read it soon. The *Principal Doctrines* are a great read, the *Letter to Menoeceus*, however, is a little bit more systematic.

In your case I'd finish reading the *Principal Doctrines* (I second /u/ErraticVole's advice) and continue with the letter, unless you are still having a hard time, in which case I'd interupt to read the letter before finishing the *Principal Doctrines*. </TEXT>

[**Individual Aesthetic Preferences for Faces Are Shaped Mostly by Environments, Not Genes**](http://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2815%2901019-2)

by Laura Germine, Richard Russell, P. Matthew Bronstad, Gabrilla A.M. Blokland, Jordan W. Smoller, Holum Kwok, Samuel E. Anthony, Ken Nakayama, Gillian Rhodes, Jeremy B. Wilmer

 **Summary**

 Although certain characteristics of human faces are broadly considered more attractive (e.g., symmetry, averageness), people also routinely disagree with each other on the relative attractiveness of faces. That is, to some significant degree, beauty is in the eye of the beholder. Here, we investigate the origins of these individual differences in face preferences using a twin design, allowing us to estimate the relative contributions of genetic and environmental variation to individual face attractiveness judgments or face preferences. We first show that individual face preferences (IP) can be reliably measured and are readily dissociable from other types of attractiveness judgments (e.g., judgments of scenes, objects). Next, we show that individual face preferences result primarily from environments that are unique to each individual. This is in striking contrast to individual differences in face identity recognition, which result primarily from variations in genes. We thus complete an etiological double dissociation between two core domains of social perception (judgments of identity versus attractiveness) within the same visual stimulus (the face). At the same time, we provide an example, rare in behavioral genetics, of a reliably and objectively measured behavioral characteristic where variations are shaped mostly by the environment. The large impact of experience on individual face preferences provides a novel window into the evolution and architecture of the social brain, while lending new empirical support to the long-standing claim that environments shape individual notions of what is attractive. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Tolkien was Anglican.

Most Christians in England are Anglican indeed. However, [Tolkien was a devout Roman Catholic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._R._R._Tolkien#Religion). The Wikipedia article cites his grandson Simon Tolkien:

 I vividly remember going to church with him in Bournemouth. He was a devout Roman Catholic and it was soon after the Church had changed the liturgy from Latin to English. My grandfather obviously didn't agree with this and made all the responses very loudly in Latin while the rest of the congregation answered in English. I found the whole experience quite excruciating, but my grandfather was oblivious. He simply had to do what he believed to be right.

	<TEXT> For us outsiders that's hard to understand indeed, but looking at the details reveals some significant differences, though. Two conflicting doctrines cannot both be true. The bible contains several books by different authors who lived at different places and at different times. There is no single right way to interpret texts like that.

Denominations also differ in how important tradition is: in Catholicism tradition is very important which is even part of their doctrine, while protestants acknowledge only the bible as source of authority and tend to deny that tradition should play such a big role (although that's far from what is true in practice).

At the end of the day, there is no objective way to decide who is right. Fundamentalists, however, cannot accept that and think they know the whole truth and consequently all others have to be wrong.

 Along the same lines, aren't Jew's very much the same kind of Christian?

Judaism is a very different religion than Christianity, although there are some common doctrines, though (Christians and Jews share the same god, for example). Also don't forget the long history of antisemitism and persecution of the Jews by Christians. Jews may acknowledge Jesus being a Jew, but he wasn't the messiah. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going through these quotes is painful indeed.

I've read Laozi several times in different translations and some of these "quotes" sound somehow familiar. However, even those familiar ones have been translated tremendously free, such that I am very uncomfortable with calling them translations. If some of these quotes actually mean what Laozi wrote, then this may certainly be by chance. </TEXT>

Human sacrifice is murder and therefore it is also prohibited as religious practice. However, Porteous' teachings on marriage seem to reflect current marriage law. One may discuss, if current marriage law discriminates some people and therefore shall be changed, but agreeing to valid laws can't be forbidden. </TEXT>

Julian Porteous is being accused by one person who does not like Porteous' opinion. This is a campaign by Rodney Croome, who is spokesman for Tasmania's Gay and Lesbian Rights Group and National Convenor of Australian Marriage Equality, which unfortunately has found huge media attention.

I assume that it is possible for everyone to accuse anybody of violating the Anti-Discrimination Act. That does not mean that one is automatically guilty or that the state wants to punish one as soon as one is accused by someone.

That being said, this is crazy nevertheless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem to be right indeed. I have consulted the chronology of *The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide* by Christina Scull and Wayne G. Hammond and according to them, Tolkien was familiar with Finnish to some degree, but apparently not enough to translate it. Tolkien wrote some papers about the Kalevala, but he certainly *retold* the story. They also cite a letter from 1955 to Auden in which Tolkien writes:

 I never learned Finnish well enough to do more than plod through a bit of the original. </TEXT>

Not being a rational person is no crime and we don't know enough about her to know that anyway.

[**Enceladuss measured physical libration requires a global subsurface ocean**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515003899)

by P.C. Thomas, R. Tajeddine, M.S. Tiscareno, J.A. Burns, J. Joseph, T.J. Loredo, P. Helfenstein, C. Porco

 **Abstract**

 Several planetary satellites apparently have subsurface seas that are of great interest for, among other reasons, their possible habitability. The geologically diverse Saturnian satellite Enceladus vigorously vents liquid water and vapor from fractures within a south polar depression and thus must have a liquid reservoir or active melting. However, the extent and location of any subsurface liquid region is not directly observable. We use measurements of control points across the surface of Enceladus accumulated over seven years of spacecraft observations to determine the satellites precise rotation state, finding a forced physical libration of 0.120  0.014 (2). This value is too large to be consistent with Enceladuss core being rigidly connected to its surface, and thus implies the presence of a global ocean rather than a localized polar sea. The maintenance of a global ocean within Enceladus is problematic according to many thermal models and so may constrain satellite properties or require a surprisingly dissipative Saturn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, there is a major error indeed!

 The article also incorrectly calls the mayapple a Himalayan plant when it's an American plant native to eastern North America.

Let's have a look at the [original paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1224) and the relevant part of the abstract:

 We used transcriptome mining in *Podophyllum hexandrum* (mayapple) to identify biosynthetic genes in the podophyllotoxin pathway.

*Podophyllum hexandrum* is the Himalayan mayapple. Thus, the phys.org article has got the photo wrong, but is right about the plant being Himalayan.

edit: according to the [original paper](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6253/1224) tobacco plants were used. </TEXT>

 In this essay I explore the nature of Deleuzes commitment to an affirmative naturalism that is based on certain Epicurean principles and insights. The essay is divided into two main parts. In the first part I bring to light some of the key features of Lucretiuss great poem on the nature of things, and I do so with the aid of Bergson and his reading of the teaching as fundamentally melancholic. In the second part I switch my attention to Deleuze and show how he links together physics and ethics as a way of providing an emancipatory and affirmative philosophy of life and one that aims to defeat sadness. In the conclusion I return to the question of melancholy and indicate how the problem might be best negotiated.

	<TEXT> John Sellars starts his article with

 A recurring theme in popular discussions of Stoicism is a perceived affinity between Stoicism and mindfulness techniques adapted from Buddhism.

and then

 I want to suggest that the Stoics did have their own version of mindfulness but that it was quite different from the modern version adapted from Buddhism.

I have no clue why you write

 I appears to me that an attempt is being made to brand stoicism as a western buddhism.

in regard to this article because that has nothing to do with this article. Have you read it? </TEXT>

[**Abstract**](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/349/6252/1106)

 Growing up on a dairy farm protects children from allergy, hay fever, and asthma. A mechanism linking exposure to this endotoxin (bacterial lipopolysaccharide)rich environment with protection has remained elusive. Here we show that chronic exposure to low-dose endotoxin or farm dust protects mice from developing house dust mite (HDM)induced asthma. Endotoxin reduced epithelial cell cytokines that activate dendritic cells (DCs), thus suppressing type 2 immunity to HDMs. Loss of the ubiquitin-modifying enzyme A20 in lung epithelium abolished the protective effect. A single-nucleotide polymorphism in the gene encoding A20 was associated with allergy and asthma risk in children growing up on farms. Thus, the farming environment protects from allergy by modifying the communication between barrier epithelial cells and DCs through A20 induction. </TEXT>

 In this essay I examine the relationship between Sartre's phenomenological description of the "self" as expressed in his early work (especially *Being and Nothingness*) and elements to be found in some approaches to Buddhism. The vast enormity of this task will be obvious to anyone who is aware of the numerous schools and traditions through which the religion of Buddhism has manifested itself. In order to be brief, I have decided to select specific aspects of what is commonly called the Theravadin tradition as being representative of Buddhist philosophy. By choosing to look primarily at the Theravadin tradition, I am by necessity ignoring a vast number of other Buddhist approaches. However, in my view, the Theravadin sect presents a consistent Buddhist philosophy which is representative of many of the major trends within Buddhism. </TEXT>

As zoom lens you may prefer the 18-105mm to the 18-55mm, if you can, because the 18-105mm is significantly better and offers a very nice zoom range. A used 16-85mm may be within your budget, too. Add the Nikon 1.8/35mm DX and you have everything you need. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Abstract**](http://www.sorenkierkegaard.nl/artikelen/Engels/019.%20Human%20insufficiency%20in%20Shinran%20and%20Kierkegaard.pdf)

 Shinran (1173-1263), the founder of the Jodoshinshu of Japanese Pure Land Buddhism, and Soren Kierkegaard (1813-1855), the Danish father of Christian existentialism, belong to very different eras, cultures, and religious traditions. Yet there are striking similarities between their religious philosophies, especially in how both offer theistic views emphasising faith and grace that see the person as radically insufficient to attain complete self-transformation. Both claim that the human person is so radically insufficient that no one can attain Buddhist enlightenment or Christian salvation through his or her own power, but only through divine power. I will argue against some commentators that although the Deity accepts and transforms this insufficiency, even the power of the Deity does not eradicate human insufficiency in this life for the person of faith. I will also argue that Shinran and Kierkegaard differ significantly about the role of human freedom in faith, and that this difference expresses the central difference between Mahayana Buddhism and Christianity regarding the relationship between the person and the Deity. </TEXT>

There are subs about spirituality, there are subs about debating religion, asking questions about religion and many more.

There are not a lot of people who actively engage in interfaith discussions apart from debating. Creating more and more tiny subs for a rather small group of people has turned out to fail many times in the past.

When this sub was founded, people had concerns about a sub just for pointing out how stupid people are. These concerns were answered by explaining that this sub is for educational purposes. The reality is, that this sub has turned out to be about circle jerking for being better than those arrogant Westerners who believe to know everything better than all Asians and scholars. These arrogant Westerners exist and their crap should be pointed out indeed, but if this sub was meant to be for educational purposes, this circle jerking subverts the original porpose of this sub completely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is no opposition or contrast, in fact, between poetic mythology and religious philosophy...

For the interested: this is a quote from [Roman Society from Nero to Marcus Aurelius](http://archive.org/stream/romansocietyfrom34122gut/34122-8.txt) by Samuel Dill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's so sad, but unfortunately also much too common.

I still remember the time when there wasn't anything like mobiles. We had a very good time then. I have refused using a mobile for a long time, but finally I bought one about three years ago. It isn't a smartphone, though. It's just a tough mobile which is shock- and waterproof, since I love hiking and being in nature.

I am very concerned about many people around me being absorbed by their smartphone while walking and even driving. That's very dangerous for them, but unfortunately also for other people. A world without mobiles seems to be completely incomprehensible for a lot of people. I often see a couple sitting in a caf or restaurant and both of them are absorbed by their smartphones.

There does not seem to be a world without smartphones for more and more people. Life seems to run away from them without being noticed and they do not consciously miss anything. Many of these people are like zombies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I have heard that Buddhism influenced Greek philosophy or vice-versa: this may be a spurious claim though.

There were some philosophers who accompanied Alexander the Great to India. Two of these were Anaxarchos, after whom I chose my user name, and Pyrrho of Elis, who was the founder of the school of skepticism which is called *Pyrrhonian skepticism*. They certainly had contact with philosophers and Buddhists and were influenced by them.

It is said that Pyrrhonian skepticism was significantly influenced by Buddhism, there is even a book about this (*Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism* by Adrian Kuzminski) and several papers and other sources which are mentioned [here](http://www.dharmawheel.net/viewtopic.php?f=102 t=7969) at Dharma Wheel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  From what I understood, my friend believed hell to be more like that described inThe Great Divorce, by C.S. Lewis, where hell basically a normal, every-day existence, where you go on with your day-to-day life, but you growing ever more distant from your neighbors and friends and with a constant feel of something missing (a spiritual hunger, say).

When I read this, I thought that this actually describes the life of many living here on earth quite well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This video, at least the three minutes you are pointing to, is horrible. Not only does he fail to understand Stoicism, his position is a rather ideologic, religious one. Scientism is an ideology and has never been a rational position. The ancient people had nothing, he says, Marcus Aurelius did not even have a play station. What is this guy smoking?

He thinks that science is going to solve all problems, he even talks about changing one's neurons in our brains to solve problems... What he seems to wish is very similar to some dystopic scenarios we know from science fiction films where the evil guys argue exactly like this one in the video.

 Okay, I have to agree that Stoicism was in fact a method of coping with a shitty existence in ancient times.

I do not agree. Stoicism has never been a method. Stoicism is a philosophy. Stoicism is certainly a philosophy which also offers methods for coping with the bad sides of the human condition, but it is first and foremost a philosophy. </TEXT>
