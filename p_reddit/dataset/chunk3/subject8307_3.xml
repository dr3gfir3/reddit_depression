	<TITLE> Day six: skin is excreting crazy amounts of oil </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm on day six of a fast. Mostly water, but I have been sipping on a little Gatorade here and there. No food.

Feel great. Energetic, alert, sleeping less etc.

One crazy thing is the amount of oil that is exuding from my skin. Mostly on the face and my scalp. In fact it's almost all the face and the head

Last night I took a shower scrub down my head and face really well, and then hit it with some isopropyl alcohol to try it out

This morning my face feels like somebody slathered coconut oil all over it

Anybody else experienced anything like this? </TEXT>

Oral beta-hydroxybutyrate supplementation in two patients with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia: monitoring of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels in blood and cerebrospinal fluid, and in the brain by in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopy.

Abstract

In persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy, ketone body concentrations are abnormally low at times of hypoglycemia, depriving the brain of its most important alternative fuel. The neuroprotective effect of endogenous ketone bodies is evidenced by animal and human studies, but knowledge about exogenous supply is limited. Assuming that exogenous ketone body compounds as a dietetic food might replace this alternative energy source for the brain, we have monitored the fate of orally supplemented DL sodium beta-hydroxybutyrate (beta-OHB) in two 6-mo-old infants with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for 5 and 7 mo, while on frequent tube-feedings and treatment with octreotide. Near total (95%) pancreatectomy had been ineffective in one patient and was refused in the other. In blood, concentrations of beta-OHB increased to levels comparable to a 16- to 24-h fast while on DL sodium beta-OHB 880 to 1000 mg/kg per day.

 ***In cerebrospinal fluid, concentrations of beta-OHB increased to levels comparable to a 24- to 40-h fast, after single dosages of 4 and 8 g, respectively.***

 High ratios of beta-OHB to acetoacetate indicated exogenous origin of beta-OHB. An increase of intracerebral concentrations of beta-OHB could be demonstrated by repetitive single-voxel proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy by a clear doublet at 1.25 ppm. Oral DL sodium beta-OHB was tolerated without side effects. 

***This first report on oral supplementation of DL sodium beta-OHB in two patients with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia demonstrates effective uptake across the blood-brain barrier and could provide the basis for further evaluation of the neuroprotective effect of beta-OHB in conditions with hypoketotic hypoglycemia.*** </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> if you Google "how long does it take to reach ketosis?" The accepted answer seems to be at least two days with no more than 20 g of carbohydrates

How precise is that?

Today the only sugar/carbs I consumed was a 7.5 ounce can of Coca-Cola which has 25 g of carbohydrates. so because I went slightly over that 20 carbohydrate number, the clock on reaching ketosis starts over?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> dateline did an update on the Russell Faria case. He was originally convicted of killing his wife, then the conviction was overturned and he was exonerated

http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/russell-faria-s-wife-was-stabbed-times-but-was-he/article_dd93f262-594e-5b88-b53f-097fc10033c8.html

Here's my observations about the case

1. Pam Hupp is so obviously either the killer herself or arranged the murder. How anybody can't see that is beyond me. Her smirking face while being questioned is what evil looks like. Her lies upon lies upon lies became more ridiculous as the case went on.

2. The police blatantly lied about evidence that did not exist, and then suppressed evidence that would have been good for the defense. How can you sleep at night when you do that?

3. The judge hamstrung the defense and made what can only be described as bizarrely favorable rulings for the prosecution. Unreal. How is the defense not allowed to cross examine a prosecution witness?

4. The prosecution's own theory about how the murder took place was flat-out ridiculous and absurd. How and why the jury believed that I will never understand.

5. If you are a husband whose wife gets murdered God help you! The police WILL come for you. Overwhelming evidence of your innocence will be irrelevant.

6. the prosecution Implicating Russell's game night friends in the murder was unconscionable. Especially considering they had zero evidence to do so.

7. The defense's decision to forgo a jury trial the second time around and do a trial by judge was brilliant. Best decision they made.

overall it was a great episode. If you can watch it without commercials I highly recommend it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The jury in the "Badlands Texas" case has blown my mind yet again </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "Badlands Texas" is a show on National Geographic about the murder of Glenn felts

http://www.outsideonline.com/1922521/murder-terlingua-texas

I previously posted about comments the jurors made after they voted to exonerate the man who had clearly committed murder

https://www.reddit.com/r/UnresolvedMysteries/comments/3znx37/anybody_watching_badlands_texas_im_sorry_but_holy/

so as our story turns the jurors continue to be interviewed, and now two of them are saying The accused is 100% guilty and they regret having voted not guilty!

Apparently they are both now completely and totally convinced the accused is absolutely guilty. Why did they vote guilty? I still don't understand. They simply did not explain in any coherent semblance whatsoever why they voted not guilty.

one of the jurors actually sounded pretty guilty about the whole thing. Doesn't sound like he's sleeping well at night and whatnot. Another of the jurors had some kind of breakdown and had to get a hold of the judge in the case and have a counseling session with the judge which was weird. Something I've never heard of before.

Actually kind of feel bad for the jurors now.

the accused had to movehundreds of miles away to a completely different state because he was getting death threats.

The whole thing is so bizarre I don't even know what to make of it

But the sides, at least for the sandwiches, are ridiculously small. When I first got my side of potato salad I thought I was being punked. It's literally 2 spoonfuls of potato salad. Not joking. same with the couscous.

Is this supposed to be like a diet restaurant? or like a low-carb place? never in my life have I seen a side so microscopically small

Also what about tipping? You order at the counter, you get your own water, but they do have a little bit of table service. So are you supposed to tip or not? I have no clue

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "Badlands Texas" is a show on National Geographic about a murder in bfe rural Texas. a well-known and beloved local figure, and bar owner, was stomped to death outside his own bar at 3 AM. His best friend was arrested. His best friend had blood all over his boots that he admitted he had worn to the bar and acknowledged he had got in a fight with the victim at closing time.

Bloodied boot tracksAll over the murder scene matched his boots. There was a whole host of other physical evidence that linked him to the crime including the fact that he himself admitted he got into a physical fight with the bar owner. He said the bar owner was alive when he left.

Anyway open and shut case right? Wrong.

SPOILERS!

Jury comes innocent. Town is in an uproar.

The interview the jurors.

Remember now this guy died from a brain aneurysm from his skull fracture. Juror says reason he voted not guilty with because there wasn't enough blood out in the sand. A skull fracture can be completely bloodless. No bleeding at all and you can still die from it. juror admitted there was quite a bit of blood around the body, but apparently it "wasn't enough". Wasn't enough for what? I have no clue

The blood on the accused boots? Apparently "it could've come from anywhere". And also "I don't know It just seemed like more stuff was going on you know?" What the fuck does that even mean?

and on and on it goes with one bizarre rationalization after another.

 these jurors were shockingly stupid and ignorant and obtuse. The crap they were saying wasn't even making any sense. Somehow the decided this guy didn't do it based on absurd fantasies in their own brains.

Dear God, if I ever commit murder I am going schedule it to do in Texas.

	<TEXT> Would the holy Grail be considered a McGuffin?

What about Jason's Golden fleece?

What do you think the earliest example of a MacGuffin is?

In fiction, a MacGuffin (sometimes McGuffin or maguffin) is a plot device in the form of some goal, desired object, or other motivator that the protagonist pursues, often with little or no narrative explanation. The specific nature of a MacGuffin is typically unimportant to the overall plot.

Examples in film include: the meaning of "rosebud" in Citizen Kane (1941),[15] the priceless statue in The Maltese Falcon (1941), the NOC list in Mission: Impossible (1996) or the Rabbit's Foot in Mission: Impossible III (2006),[16][17] the briefcases in Pulp Fiction, several Coen brothers films, and Ronin, the rug in The Big Lebowski, the Heart of the Ocean necklace in Titanic,[18] the mineral unobtainium in Avatar (2009),[19] and the One Ring in the Lord of the Rings trilogy.[20] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> James Jones is literally covered 100% of the time. All the time. There is never a time when he is on the field when he has broken coverage and is open. Ever.

The only time I can remember him being open the season was when he caught a touchdown against the Raiders and it was a total defensive breakdown and blown coverage.

I don't really see what value he brings to the team quite frankly. I do not want to see him on the team next year at all even for veterans minimum.

Janis, great on special teams, essentially sucks as a wide receiver. but I have to believe he would be open at least 15% of the time which is 15% more often than James Jones is.

that's my New Year's Eve grumpy rant.

Bah humbug, Go Pack,  and happy new year to you all!

	<TITLE> This is what's wrong with the Packers passing offense this season. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-22 16:23:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> after Jordy went down, the Packers did not have a true number one receiver. Instead they had a few very green not ready for primetime receivers, and a couple of slow possession type receivers, and one quality slot receiver.

this offense is predicated on receivers being able to break man-to-man coverage, timing routes, and yards after the catch. With this wide receiver group you simply can't run that offense.

Adams was drafted to be James Jones' replacement. That's why Jones was cut as soon as Adams was drafted. Jones and Adams are both somewhat slow, possession type receivers. In the offense the Packers run your possession receiver is usually the quarterbacks third option. the Packers have repeatedly put 2 slow possession type receivers on the field at the same time. Doesn't work.

Think about this. Many times this season the Packers have had Jones, Adams, R. Rodgers and Randall Cobb on the field at the same time. Adams is already slow plus he's dealing with an ankle injury which makes him stupidly slow. Jones has always been slow and has even lost a step in old age. Richard Rogers is one of the slowest tight ends I have ever seen playing the game.

So you've got three stupidly slow receivers who can't break man-to-man coverage and can't get open on their own, plus you have one quality slot receiver. When defenses know you don't have a deep threat, safeties can cheat down and cover your slot receiver. That's why Randall Cobb has been shut down most of the season.

this is also why the Montgomery Injury was huge. Even though he is a rookie, and doesn't know the playbook, at least he has speed and he could break man-to-man coverage. I saw him break man-to-man coverage repeatedly earlier in the season.

watching Aaron Rodgers dropback, watching the O line give him awesome protection, and then seeing him with ABSOLUTELY NOBODY to throw to is just maddening. And that's what we've seen down after down, series after series, game after game this year.

I'm sorry to say but this is not a Super Bowl caliber passing offense right now.

	<TEXT> reminder: the down vote button is not a disagree button!

This is not a Super Bowl contending team. Right now it just isn't. It got manhandled by a legit Super Bowl contender who was the Carolina Panthers, and for three quarters it was manhandled by the Lyons completely until they decided to Lyons it up.

beyond that this team DESPERATELY needs help at both left tackle and right tackle.

Bulaga is a great player when healthy He's just never healthy! Let's get real. The guy just can't stay healthy for a full season, or even a half a season.

Bahktiari is probably a second string level talents to be honest. WAY too many penalties, and his run blocking is atrocious.

tackles are a very very valued commodity in the draft.

Personally I'd rather lose a few more games this year and for once draft at least in the middle of the first route instead of always drafting at the end of the first round. Let Ted address our glaring needs on offensive line, and come back next year strong and ready to compete for another Super Bowl ring

	<TEXT> so I went to this restaurant over by target on the Eastside called the journey. It's a buffet style. They specialize in seafood and specifically sushi.

First off the sushi was NOT fresh. It sits on these plates under the warm lights and even though there is ice underneath the plates the plates are essentially warm because of the lights and the sushi basically stays warm for God knows how long.

I sampled a bunch of the different sushi rolls and the quality ranged from semi-okay to really not good at all. Several tasted just on the verge of going bad. I've had better sushi at Hyvee. 

but honestly how can you leave RAW fish under warm lights for hours at a time? How is this even legal?

some kind of stuffed crab dish also was off. Tasted like it been sitting out for the last seven or eight hours. Possibly was.

Did I just go at a bad time? It was Saturday afternoon and fairly busy

maybe things are better if I get there as soon as they open up?

They moved the project completion date to spring of 2016, but now it's looking more like June 2016. If they're lucky.

Again, this is what I heard from somebody who claims to know. If anybody has different info Feel free to chime in. Honestly though, if you just take a look over the fence at their progress it is glaringly obvious There's no way in hell are going to be done by the end of this year, or even close to it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live on the north side, restaurant selection here is crap.

Manna Caf: Excellent food, but serving size is occasionally ludicrously small. Ordered a brisket sandwich (small but delicious), the side of potato salad was literally 2 spoonfuls. Literally. Paid $12 for lunch (with tip), left hungry.

Generic Chinese restaurant: don't know the name, it's in the same complex as Manna. The tiny corncobs they put on taste like they spilled pesticides on them. Complained, was told it was taken care of. Ordered again a month later, same problem. Never again.

Wiggies: known drug dealing location. Often has sketchy weirdos hanging out in parking lot. No thank you.

Northside family restaurant: everything I've ever gotten here was slightly disgusting

QQ Chinese buffet: no longer in business. But when it was it had a rotting ceiling tiles, moldy carpet, food sitting in buffet for hours on end, and a completely indifferent staff

Benevenutos: perfectly good food, way way overpriced.

Coffee Gallerie: good coffee, terrible food

Habanero's: good Mexican food, no complaints.

Kavanaugh's Esquire Club: never actually been there, I think they turn you away If you are under 65 years old

Jim's meat market: darn good food, take out only. Seriously the best burger you'll get anywhere in Madison for $7. also, good fish fry.
 
I think that is literally every restaurant in the north side, aside from corporate chain restaurants like McDonald's or whatever.

I could go on but you get the picture. Restaurant selection in this neck of the woods is just terrible </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's called the The PB pill (pyridostigmine bromide) and was given as a anti-nerve agent pill.

Does anybody remember this was a pill that was only consumed if  the unit was suspected of being under immediate nerve agent attack? Or do they give it as a prophylactic (i.e. preventative measure) Even if no chemical attack was imminent?

I'm trying to figure out if I ever consumed this or not. It's recently been implicated in Gulf War  syndrome.

I was in 1990  1995. My unit was scheduled to go to the desert. We did all of the preps and were ready to go, then at the very last second, they only took half my unit. I stayed. I can't remember all of the shots or pills or whatnot that I took

	<TEXT> I've got a list of right-wing blogs and various websites that I go to. I peruse the headlines, and I specially like to look at the comment sections.

I've been doing this for years and years. Let me tell you something Never ever ever ever have I seen these people freaking out like they are right now. I'm serious. If you've ever wanted to see an entire group of people totally and completely melt down now is your chance.

First it was the Confederate flag and how they're stealing our heritage and Are going to be coming for the American flag and how they're destroying the Constitution blah blah

Then it was Obama care. And how Obama care is part of some insanely diabolical left-wing conspiracy to give us all healthcare which will eventually result in some kind of totalitarian socialist communist nightmare

And now gay marriage. Holy shit! The rainbow colors on the official White House website are causing these people to absolutely flip their lids.

They're talking about gathering all their friends together and marching on Washington and finally "taking back the country." A phrase they repeat ad nauseam

I'm completely serious. These people are utterly and completely losing their ever loving minds

In a way it's funny. In a way it's entertaining. In another way it's just sad. I view all these things as social progress. They view Obama as literally Satan incarnate, and all these issues as the fall of the Roman Empire

	<TEXT> so I went to rising Sons on State Street.

The good: they achieved the classic Thai coconut curry taste. It definitely tasted pretty good.

The bad: Menu said served with egg noodles, was actually served Ramen noodles. I mean the squiggly Ramen noodles that you get the store for 39 cents. Complained to waitress and she looked me in the eye and straight said those were egg noodles. Funny thing is on yelp, other people are complaining of the exact same thing. What a joke.

Also,the coconut broth is EXTREMELY watered-down. Almost to the point of being ridiculous. Again others on yelp are complaining of the exact same thing.

so, where can I get good quality Thai coconut curry in the downtown campus area ?

Thank you for any suggestions </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Note: I asked this question last week and got no response. So I'm reposting it. Hopefully that's okay? Don't want to break any rules

1.

If you look at the Wikipedia entry for assassins, they make a strong case that the word is actually derived from the word hashish

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins#Etymology[1]

But then it seems to contradict itself later on with this quote from a historian

The truth is different. According to texts that have come down to us from Alamut, Hassan-i Sabbah liked to call his disciples Asasiyun, meaning people who are faithful to the Ass, meaning "foundation" of the faith. This is the word, misunderstood by foreign travellers, that seemed similar to "hashish".[10]

so which is it? Is assassins derived from hashish? Or is it derived from Asas? 

2.

Hassan-i Sabbh, the man who founded the original assassin order, seemed to be VERY fervently religious. Is there any actual evidence to suggest that he encouraged his disciples and/or operatives to consume hashish?

Or is it possible this is a kind of historical urban legend with little or no substance to it? Or maybe it was part of a smear job by pro-Crusader historians?

Note that its expressed in terms of  mg/100 mL. In other words you lose X mg of nutrient Y per 100 mL of semen.

You can also see that the different studies found different results, meaning you don't lose an exact perfect amount of nutrient X every time you ejaculate. Rather there's a ballpark on how much you lose

One subject that study did not look at was the hormones you lose to ejaculation. If somebody has that study please post it </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-05 16:04:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> lost Horizon was originally a short novel by James Hilton (also wrote goodbye Mr. chips), then a movie (1937-great movie), and a remake (1973, Goofy movie)

The original movie was actually done by Frank Capra, famous for making it's a wonderful life and many other classics.

the story is about a small group of British diplomats escaping an uprising in India, who then get kidnapped by mysterious figures. They are brought to a secret city hidden away in the Himalayas called Shangri-La.

The city is perfect in every way. There is peace and harmony, everybody gets educated, and most noted people don't seem to age when they are there.

Long story short, the main character eventually decides to leave. It's only when he's left that he realizes how amazing it was and he tries so hard to get back but he can never get back. He's been kicked out of heaven and he can't get back in.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_Horizon#Plot_summary

This episode is about the main characters being kicked out of Shangri-La - or in this case sterling Cooper -- and being thrown into the real world. And it's only once they are there in the real world do they realize how good they had it at sterling Cooper.

but here's the thing - once you leave Shangri-La you can never go back!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> so I was told that the only way to make french fries (from raw fresh-cut potatoes) that are crisp on the outside and tender on the inside is that you have to blanch them in cold water first.

But I was watching diners drive-ins and dives the other day, and one of the restaurants was making fries with fresh cut potatoes. They deep-fried them for a little while, then remove them from the oil and let them rest, then they fried them some more. Allegedly this is a way of making crisp on the outside tender on the inside french fries .

 Does anybody know  if that technique works and how long you are supposed to cook them the first time and the second time and how long to let them cool/rest in between? </TEXT>

What about the same thing with a moderately priced camera like the Panasonic HC-X1000?

	<TITLE> Monster of Florence: GREAT book about Italy's most notorious, unsolved, serial killer case. Highly recommended, fascinating read. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-20 18:04:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> if you are into unsolved mysteries, this book is right up your alley. The monster of Florence  is/was by far and away the most famous serial killer case in Italian history. To this day it, technically, remains unsolved.

I say "technically" because it's highly likely the authors of the book did in fact solve the murders - at least in my humble opinion. Unfortunately the Italian justice system doesn't see it that way.

It's also really interesting because this all ties into the Amanda Knox case. The prosecuting attorney in the Amanda Knox case is also the one that's currently handling the monster of Florence case. And this guy's a world-class nutcase. Once you realize just how crazy this guy is you understand that Amanda Knox was and is completely and totally innocent and was jailed in a grand miscarriage of justice.

You also get a  deep insight into the Italian criminal justice system, and let me tell you it's scary. They will jail you for five years just on suspicion of a crime alone, then when you have been found innocent they let you go after your life has been ruined.

anyway, GREAT book. Highly recommended.

	<TEXT> so apparently these monkeys got their hands on magical guns. These magical guns never jammed, they didn't have any kind of a safety feature (brand-new guns always come with tthe safety on, and are always stored with the safety on), and most of all they had magical ammo clips that never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ran out of bullets and never ever ever ever need to be reloaded.

I'm sorry it's ridiculous!

If this was one small tiny part of the movie I would just overlook it.

**But the entire freaking movie turned on this one utterly ridiculous magical guns premise!**

there was that one ultra warrior monkey who, during the main battle, got on his horse with two fully automatic machine guns blazing away, and blazing away, and blazing away and blazing away

Whatever. Apparently not too many other people were bothered by this because I haven't read anything about it.

	<DATE> 2015-02-03 22:36:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not saying the show itself is bad, I'm saying the format is terrible and doesn't work and here's why.

1. One half of a 30 minute show is to short for a panel discussion

The nightly show seems to be following in the footsteps of the bill maher show and/or The Cycle on MSNBC. In other words a group of four or five people sitting around discussing the hot button issue of the day.

The problem is 4 different people can't throw out an opinion and then discuss that opinion in just a few short minutes. And one half of a 30 minute show is very short time.

For instance last night 4 people plus Larry were discussing obesity. all four were barely able to get one point across, and none of those points got really discussed in length at all. How could it? One half of a 30 minute show is what Maybe nine minutes in actual airtime?

It's too damn short for a panel discussion. That's all.

2. Everybody's too nice

So far they're getting together 4 enlightened liberal super nice super courteous people to discuss things.

There's not enough disagreement!

Last night somebody said obesity was a disability because most diets fail. Nobody bothered to call her out on her bull shit, because everybody's being courteous and nice and PC and accommodating.

You know what I call a discussion where nobody disagrees with each other? Boring!

So far the first half of the show has been okay, but the second half in my opinion has fallen flat and the format will not work. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-01-28 17:53:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> there's been multiple posts recently with people struggling with book cover art.

My suggestion for those is to look at movie posters. The people who design and create movie posters really know what they are doing. They have the whole thing down to a science.

they know how to grab your attention, and they know how to draw your attention to specific elements in the design, they know what good title placement is, they know where to put the title and what type of font and how big to make the title. Etc. etc.

Of course it's not exactly the same thing because movie posters want you to pay attention to it the actors themselves. Where is a book cover will not have that.

But the basic elements of design are the same. The use of negative space and the ability to draw your attention to this specific place or that specific place is all the same.

Anyway I thought some people might benefit from the suggestion.

However!

When I go to actually print, it doesn't show that I have any printers available. (picture #1) Then when I select "find printer", it doesn't show that my printer is there and available to be selected (picture #2, 3,)

allegedly in 'printers and devices' you can right-click on the printer you want and then select to set it as your default printer. However! When I right-click on it does not give me that option as you can see picture number five

I downloaded the driver directly from the Canon website

I cannot print from it. The computer simply doesn't recognize it at all. iin fact it says I have no printer connected to this computer at all.

I've used advanced printer setup and it still will not recognize the printer

Any ideas?

EDIT: in "devices and printers" the image class printer is listed there, but it has a yellow triangle with a exclamation point in it

So I'm assuming that's bad

EDIT:  so apparently the yellow triangle means you got an error code. Here's the weird thing, in my device manager it lists 2 printers - 'canon MF 3010', and 'MF 3010'.

one is listed as working fine, the others listed as not having a driver loaded. 

I tried to uninstall both of those thinking I would reinstall the correct driver. No luck. I have uninstalled them three times now and every time I start my computer there they are again. One listed is working fine the other listed is not working because it doesn't have a driver.

Meanwhile my computer does not list a printer option at all when I click print </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Opinion: The 49ers are doing the RIGHT thing by firing Jim Harbaugh. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-25 17:47:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You can call it being fired. You can call it being let go. You can call it refusing to renew his contract Whatever you want to call it.

The fact is he's probably gone.

I would say about 99% or more of the comments I've seen pretty much everywhere are people saying the 49ers are stupid and dumb for allowing him to walk. And given that they were crap before he got there, and he led them to quite a bit of success, that's a perfectly reasonable opinion.

But I disagree. Here's why.

**Personnel Decisions**

Imagine you work for a small company. There is one employee is just Incompetent. He doesn't really know what he's doing, he does most of his work half assed, and just generally isn't up to par. The problem is that he makes EVERYBODY ELSE have to work harder to make up for his crappy work.

Just for fun we will call this person "Roman". So everybody goes to the boss and says "you really have to fire Roman. He's incompetent and he's making everybody else's life more difficult."

And the boss ssays to you all "no! Absolutely not! He's my buddy!  No way I fire that guy!"

"Yes but He sucks! He doesn't do his job well! He's making everybody else's  job more difficult!"

"Tough shit! Too bad! Now shut up and do your jobs!"

Would you like to work for a man like that? Of course not. A person like that has no concept of what a tough and yet smart personnel decision really is all about.

In this little story "Roman" represents the 49ers offensive coordinator. He sucks. In case you're confused about the issue, look at the playcalling in the fourth quarter of the Super Bowl. You can make an argument he lost that Super Bowl for that team.

Nobody likes to fire their friend. Nobody likes to fire their little buddy.. But sometimes when you're an adult in a position of authority you have to make difficult choices and do the right thing and fire your little buddy.

Jim Harbaugh refuses to do that. It's indicative of a larger problem wherein Jim seems to act like a little tyrant and lack the maturity to do the right thing. I'm sure there are other cases that are hurting the team where he takes the same attitude.

 **Colin Kaepernick has REGRESSED under Harbaugh**

there is no position in the NFL more important than quarterback. The 49ers made the right decision by trading Alex Smith and going with Colin. However, under Jim Harbaugh's tutelage Colin has regressed in darn near every phase of the game.

Instead of looking at Collins game, emphasizing his strong points and making him a better quarterback, Jim has tried to be an authoritarian and force his own view of what a quarterback should do and how a quarterback should act down Colin's throat. It's been a miserable failure.

A good coach adapts to the players he has, he emphasizes their strengths and makes their weaknesses better. A bad coach tries to force players be something they are not. Jim Harbaugh right now is a bad coach for Colin Kaepernick.


and once again we see that he acts like a tyrant, a big boss nobody better question, somebody unable to be flexible and roll with the punches. That's just not a recipe for success.

****Inability to work well with others****

sounds kind of stupid perhaps? I mean he's the coach right? Shouldn't other people try to work with him instead of the other way around?

But the fact of the matter is EVERYBODY in a position of leadership must form cohesive relationships with other people in that organization in order for that organization to be successful.

Jim Harbaugh doesn't seem to be capable of doing this. He doesn't seem to be capable of having anybody else have any input or say so or control in any way shape or form.  He seems like a person who is incapable of taking any criticism from anybody.

Again, this is not how you become a long term success in ANY organization anywhere.

***In my personal opinion*** , even if Jim were retained beyond this year his success would likely be minimal. The 49ers have likely rode his coattails to as much success as he's going to have with that organization. Being passionate and intense and being a GREAT motivator (which he is), only gets you so far. Beyond that you need more qualities to remain a long-term success in this league and Jim Harbaugh does not have those qualities.

***In my personal opinion*** Jim Harbaugh should become a college coach. College coaches are encouraged to be tyrants. That's okay! People are actually fine with that. Players never are allowed to talk back to them. People treat them as virtual gods. That's what Jim Harbaugh needs. That's where he should go. </TEXT>

trying to read the Wikipedia article on it and it has such sentences as this

NGF binds to high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptor TrkA. TrkA dimerizes and autophosphorylates its tyrosine kinase segment, which leads to the activation of PI 3-kinase, ras, and PLC signaling pathways. Alternatively, the p75NTR receptor can form a heterodimer with TrkA which has higher affinity and specificity for NGF.

Which means absolutely 100% nothing to me. I'm finding that for medical subjects Wikipedia is often written at a PhD level and is worthless for the average person

One young devoted fan smuggles a recording device into were one of her concerts and records are. He does it strictly for the love of the music. But of course people find out about the recording suddenly everybody wants it

Music industry bigwigs, Mafia people and a few other people I cant remember are all trying to get their hands on the tape.

	<TEXT> anyone know about this sterling silver Starbucks card that is going on sale tomorrow?

Last year they had that metal card, limited-edition. Sold out in like five minutes.

http://www.eater.com/2013/12/6/6318279/450-starbucks-metal-gift-cards-sell-out-in-seconds

This year they're doing a sterling silver card.  It cost $250, and that includes $50 worth of credit on the card.

Anybody know how limited this limited-edition sterling silver card is? I called the 800 line, and the lady didn't know. Last year's card they only made 1000.

Anybody have any info on this?

I would like to buy one but I need to know if I need to sit there on the website like a panther pouncing on its prey? Or can I just wait and still get one? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> looking at 4k cameras and I notice a lot of people are complaining about a fixed pattern noise problem which is basically some kind of lines appearing on the video feed. Wondering if anybody's had that problem?

Also many people are complaining about weird image choppiness while panning with 4K cameras. Anybody have that issue?

somebody on Amazon describe the problem thusly

Because this is a 30p camcorder at 4K, panning or moving the camera from side to side, will produce choppy motions. This includes being in a playground capturing my daughter on a merry-go-round or just running around the house chasing her. This may seem tolerable when uploaded to YouTube or Vimeo since they are inherently a 30p streaming service, but this choppy motion gets magnified when burned on Blu-Ray which must now convert a 30p footage into 60p. The result is even worst. And this is using professional grade software such as Final Cut Pro X and Adobe Media Encoder CS6.

Thanks for any input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [No Regrets]: If you don't feel bad 

it is one nightmare after another after another after another after another with these people.

I can't take it anymore. The latest round is me trying for two weeks just to get my doctor to call me back. One stupid freaking phone call. A phone call. Two weeks. They finally called me back today to set up an appointment for three days from now. This is just a simple follow-up phone call. It will literally take 3 to 5 minutes.

The entire VA system is perpetually criminally negligent of our veterans and I'm done. I've had enough. I fight these people, I argue with these people, I make complaints, I go to the patient advocate, I confront VA workers, I confront my doctors, etc. etc. etc. etc.

It does no good. No good whatsoever. Nobody at the VA gives a shit if I live or die. In fact I get the overwhelming impression they would rather see me dead so they wouldn't have to put up with my crap anymore. They prefer veterans who never complain, who roll over and take it in the ass without any lip.

the latest doctor I've seen literally doesn't know what the function of an x-ray is, what you can and cannot diagnose using just an x-ray, and is an all-around idiot. An actual bona fide complete total moron. in one 15 minute visit he told me three egregiously wrong things that were overwhelmingly proven incorrect by simple Google searches. I told another doctor what he said and that Dr. just sat there blinkin with a blank look on his face, and eventually acknowledge that perhaps the doctor had given out incorrect information.

I have fantasies about running him over with my wheelchair, again and again and again, as I shout "HAVE YOU FIGURED WHAT AN X-RAY IS YET YOU DUMB MOTHER FUCKER?" 

this is all just the tip of the iceberg. It's one story after another after another after another. The entire system is rife with incompetence stupidity and uncaring assholes.

somehow or another I swear to God I'm going to get together the money and get myself some private insurance and never ever ever go back to the VA again as long as I live.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've got tall raised bed gardens. They are 22 inches tall made of cedar. I'm planting mostly wheatgrass for juicing

Every time I plant the crop of grass it grows absolutely beautiful, but at some point (usually when the grass is 4  6 inches) after a few rains it develop some kind of slime at the very base of the plant by the soil, I'm assuming the slime develops in the root system and is climbing up. The slime eventually kills the grass


What can I do to address the situation?

I plant the grass very close together and thick. You think I should planted much thinner to give it better airflow?

maybe just drilling a whole series of holes along the base of the planter will be good enough?

Or maybe I need to take out all of the soil, lay down a layer of gravel on the bottom of the bed, put landscaping cloth on top of that, and then put my soil back on top of that. Would be a lot of work and expense but maybe that's the only way to deal with it? </TEXT>

Relit the pilot light, everything seems okay. Later that day no more hot water, go back to light the pilot light again, this time it will not light at all

What do you think? Thermocouple? Igniter? Seems like if it was just the igniter the pilot light wouldn't be going out like that in the first place

Also the little drain thing on the side is leaking just a bit suddenly today. Is that related?

plumbers want crazy amounts of money just to show up and diagnose the problem, if I pay them back, then I pay them to fix the problem I'm damn near paying what I would pay for entire new hot water heater!
