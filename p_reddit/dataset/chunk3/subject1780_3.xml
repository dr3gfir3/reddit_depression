**Christ, Matthew:** "-aining time should be used constructively, not on trying to pursue false hope. We are here. This is our life now. Why can't these cretins understand that?

**Thomas, James:** "I mean, wouldn't you want to try to surface again if you were in their position? They don't know what we know, Matt. They just woke up to the alarms and were forced underground."

**Christ, Matthew:** "That's all they need to know!"

**Crashing. Aggressive yelling.**

**Christ, Matthew:** "What do you think these *fine* people would do with the knowledge? Hm? Panic - that's what. Fucking aliens, man. No one would know how to react. The government spent billions convincing everyone they didn't exist and then - boom - some come out of nowhere and drive an entire city underground!"

**Thomas, James:** "re you still going on about the aliens?! Jesus Christ! We. Don't. Know. That. As. Fact. What if someone heard you saying that? They'll think you're a madman!"

**Christ, Matthew:** "My point."

**Thomas, James:** "You know what? Fine. I don't care about that anyways. What are we going to do about this 'light' situation? Chamber 3 has been breached and the people are whispering."

**Christ, Matthew:** "Kill the shovel. That will shut everyone up."

**Thomas, James:** "You genuinely don't care if you're hated, do you? There's going to be an uprising. One day. You watch it happen."

**Choking.**

**Christ, Matthew:** "Kill the shovel. Have Cer 3 close off. Try not ^ cross me again."

**Thomas, James:** "Wh...ugh...are y-you?"

**Christ, Matthew:** "I ~ God."

Rob always had a way with words. Once Snapchat came out it was a blessing for him. All he needed was a sentence and a shirtless pic. 

*Ping*

She hit him back. Purple icon - she was about to make it clap.

Rob clicked on the snap, feeling his pants getting tighter and tighter by the microsecond. It was exactly what he thought. She was twerking in the mirror, no panties and all oiled up. 10. 9. 8. 7. 6. 5. 

Rob dropped his phone. On the fourth second, a little turd fell from between her cheeks. She didn't even know.

Rob still hit it though. </TEXT>

He was left with two options:

Face his wife and his loses, or disappear so they could never collect.

	<TEXT> Immersion aside, I feel like this is simply good advice for writing in any form. 

It really only takes a few minutes to fact check yourself when you don't know about a place, culture, or history. With writing on the internet, stories are available to almost anyone in the world. Sure, Mexicans might not know much about New Zealand culture but the New Zealanders who read the story will, and errors that a writer felt were insignifcant might completely ruin a story for anyone in that country who reads it. 

Don't look at it as catering to your audience, though. Look at it as expanding your reader base. 

Or maybe I'm wrong about all of this and my opinion is invalid. Either way, I agree with your points. </TEXT>

**88.21-16**

It's official. We're going to try and find the source of the light in Chamber 3. Christ has been slaughtering people that oppose his decision to reunite the city with it's ancestors. Well, *he* hasn't done a damn thing. God forbid he actually gets his hands dirty for once. The Digs were created by all of us while he sat in a tiny little panic room and directed his little army of "supervisors" through notes and whispers. He's a worthless shithead. Whatever.

We're going for the light. That's what matters. Keegan, Marco, and I. In less than a day. Either we'll make it our die as traitors.

-----

**88.22-16**

There's something comical about dying for a greater good. On one hand, you're sacrificing yourself for the betterment of many. On the other, you're trying to help people who don't even know your name.

Keegan and Marco are gone. 

Well, I believe they will be. Christ put guards in front of Chamber 3 and they attacked them so I could sneak through. Why me? They were equally as capable.

Regardless, I found t light. I was anticipating a difficult climb, but it wasn't nearly as high as the rumors spoke of. I dug a nice opening and climbed into the source...a tunnel. Sort of like t pneumatic tubes we used to have on the surface. That's where I am now. I'm pretty sure it sealed behind me, so I'm going to rest and continue tomorrow.

-----

**88.23-16**

I've been crawling for what feels like hours.Ev now and then, I swear I can hear voices. I don't know what they're saying. It's a foreign tongue, that I can say for certain. 

What concerns me more is that something might be alive outside of the Digs. Christ lied to us.

-----

**88.24-16**

I saw something in the tunnel with me. I don't know what it was. It was white, fat, and covered in wrinkled skin. I yelled at it and it ran away. Since then the voices have gotten louder amd more frequent. The tunnel walls have also begun lighting up from time to time. 

What have I done?

Not anymore. 

I have a new system now - way more effective than any of those "red pill" pick up methods I learned in those classes. This is foolproof. 

Three strikes. That's all I'm going to give them. 

**Strike One** - If I ask one out and she laughs at me. 

**Strike Two** - If she screams when I break into her house and take her to mine.

**Strike Three** - If she disturbs the others.

I'm tired of being the joke. It's time they start to take me seriously. </TEXT>

He's the man who has lost it all tonight. Standing there, cigarette in lips - his arms too weak to hold it. A metaphor for what got him here, no doubt. 

"When was the last time you slept?" I wonder to myself. The bags under his eyes are unbearable to witness. 

"What about food? Don't you eat?"

I know these answers. Once a man has gone through this kind of loss - through an extraordinary pain like this - insomnia and starvation no longer exist. 

Eyes still locked. Smoke still burning. I break the mirror. </TEXT>

Twenty-four years of ups, downs, and in betweens. She's always been there for her, and the favor was always returned. There was never a lack of support.

	<TEXT> It was definitely a challenge growing up. I got made fun of a lot - forunately nothing too drastic. The pronunciation of my name sounds a lot like a staple of Asian cusine (to everyone, ever - I don't quite get it) so that was the most of it. I actually got bullied more for drawing, writing, and always being lost inside my notebooks. Kids used to steal them from me and go show everyone. That hit me hard every time.

Anyways. One thing that was cool was that during roll calls I never had to pay attention to listen for my name because every single teacher, administrator, etc. would stop and ponder before calling it. Nice little perk haha.

Like you, I've grown into it. It's an awesome conversation piece and I've built some good connections with people that all started with questions about my name!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Every person is different. Just because one alcoholic can down a fifth of gin and go drive a semi doesn't mean that everyone else can. Also, alcoholism isn't defined by how much you drink. It's defined by your ability to control your cravings for alcohol. It's just as much mental as it is physical.  </TEXT>

**88.10-66**

We...tried to save it. What was left, at least. Chamber 11 didn't house much more than the beggars and their pets but they still deserved to live. Being crushed to death is a fate no one should have to suffer through. Dammit! The only crime those people were guilty of was not being willing to pull their fair share of the work. Regardless, Christ should have gotten their Chamber the structural support it needed. 

He's fucking with us.

---

**88.14-66**

Since the collapse of Chamber 11, the Digs have been overrun by disgruntled murmurs - most questioning the validity of Christ. Luckily for the survivors, dirt walls don't echo. Or maybe they do. It's been over a year since the Contamination. A year since I lost my mouth. I wrote to Christ again recently in regards to getting approval for surgery to reopen the skin, but he replied with his typical bullshit verse: 

**Proverbs 17:7**

*Eloquent lips are unsuited to a godless fool - how much worse lying lips to a ruler!* 

Who the fuck even responds like that? It probably took him more time to dig through that torn up book collection of his to find that than it would have to just write a quick rejection. Being underground has taken a toll on the entire city - I get that. The Contamination killing over half of us really shook the population to its core, too. But how can a "leader" consider himself fit to stay in power if he can't even reject a simple request? 

---

**88.15-66**

I don't mind that the takeover happened. While it does suck being in an underground "city," there's significantly less expectations to live up to.

---

**88.18-66**

There's rumors that someone spotted daylight! A shovel in Chamber 3 claims that he got blinded by a small ray from the ceiling above the food stores. 

If he's telling the truth...that means we might finally be able to surface! It's been so long since I've seen any real light.

---

**88.19-16**

What the fuck is this "reunion" Christ keeps referring to? First, that shovel from Chamber 3 goes missing. Now, Christ keeps saying we're all due to be reunited. I'm pretty sure he's lost his god damn mind.

I fear that he's planning something. Christ has always been a bit loose, but since the light was discovered he's gone completely mental. 

I've spoken with a couple of the other cooks, and we're debating on pursuing the light ourselves. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Name is Mikey Knutson </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-19 21:51:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My name is Mikey Knutson. Yes, it is short for Michael. No, I don't go by Mike. My grandma, [Eva](https://i.imgur.com/wcJvtyS.jpg), gave me the nickname when I was a kid. 

I grew up in some of the...less than desirable parts of Cleveland, Ohio. "Ghetto" wouldn't be the most accurate word to describe my neighborhoods over the years, but everywhere I lived was about two gun shots shy of being able to earn that label. Living in places like these never bothered me. My mom is physically disabled and was unable to work anymore after giving birth and because of that, and the fact that she was a single parent, she had to make due with what the government was willing to offer in assistance. Its hard to live in a nice neighborhood on a few hundred dollars a month. That's life - it happens. I never have and never will hold that against her.

Life was rough growing up, I won't lie. Public transportation was the only means for my mom and I had to get around unless we walked, and the weather here in Cleveland varies so wildly there was never an ideal time to get from A to B. Our apartment on West 89th was so badly infested with roaches that if I woke up in the middle of the night to pee I could feel them crawling under my sleeping bag. Hell, on the last day of every month we would have to leave the building for the day so the exterminators could come in and spray the place down. That was kind of an inconvenience to have to deal with as a young, disabled white woman in a neighborhood full of drug dealers and an extensive range of other criminals. 

Despite our living conditions, the one thing we never struggled for was food. My grandma, being the saint she was, would come over to our house every two days before heading to work at the Cleveland Clinic and leave us bags of food in front of our door. A lot of people look forward to the excitement of opening Christmas gifts once a year - I got to feel that every couple days. The gifts were never bountiful and mainly consisted of the essentials - milk, eggs, bread, etc. Every once in a while though, maybe once a week, she would leave us a pack of these delicious, fruit covered croissants. The pack was always two of each: cherry, lemon, orange, and blackberry. My god, the ecstasy I would experience when we would eat those scrumptious little treats is a feeling I'll never forget.

Aside from ensuring my mom and I never went hungry, my grandma also would take me out to do things every weekend. Sometimes it would be the zoo, other times it would be a museum, and every now and then she would take me to various events around the city. It gave my mom some free time to take care of things she needed to do alone and it allowed me to experience things I never would have otherwise.

Looking back on it now, it must have been hard on her to make time for me like she did since she was a full-time RN working for one of the nation's leading hospitals. I didn't realize it then, but there were plenty of times when she would pick me up in her scrubs and we would go straight out to do stuff. I always thought it was just a cool thing to do...not that she was working a full twelve hour day and still coming to take me out. I wish I would have realized then what I do now.

One day when my mom and I woke up the food wasn't at our door.

My grandma was at work when she began having trouble breathing and subsequently collapsed. The hospital admitted her for one day presuming that it was just dehydration mixed with a bit of exhaustion. I can understand it. She was a sixty year old woman staying as active, if not more, than most twenty-four year olds. After they released her and she went back to work after her mandatory week off, it happened again. This time, though, she was admitted for an extended stay in order for the doctors to run tests and find the cause of her issues.

**Cancer.**

Breast cancer, specifically. I didn't know this back then, but it runs very strongly in the women in my family. Every one of them has gotten it and it was expected that my grandma would get it too. It was her turn, I guess.

I didn't understand much of what was going on in the following months. I didn't see my grandma as much as I used to because of all of her appointments, but she still made time for me when she could. Even the food started coming again! It was just in in a different pattern now. Sometimes we would get food everyday for three days. Other times it would be four or five days until we got something. I remember one week she brought us those fruit croissants four times and I was the happiest kid alive. I never really thought about how we also got four gallons of milk that week - way too much for us to consume.

December came that year and I was more excited than ever. My mom, her new boyfriend, and I just moved into a new duplex in Old Brooklyn a few months prior and I was going to be a big brother! Plus, Christmas! It was going to be the first time that I got to have a real Christmas celebration thanks to my mom's boyfriend, who had a pretty decent factory job. Life was perfect, rapidly on the upswing...until my mom got the phone call.

Every year, my grandma would host a Tree Trimming Party for the women at her church. The ladies would gather and drink some wine, share some gossip, and ultimately trim and decorate the tree. It was a tradition that my grandma felt very strongly about and had been hosting the party for about eight years. This year during the party, my grandma ran out of breath again and fell. 

She didn't get back up.

The next couple of days were a blur to me. An explanation never came. I was told my grandma was sick again and that she was going to stay in the hospital for a bit longer than last time. 

A couple weeks went by until we got a phone call from my grandma. December 17th, 2001. This time she only wanted to talk to me, which she had never done before. Usually it was her and my mom conversing for a while with the conversation ending in my mom telling me grandma says she loves me and my mom relaying that I love her too. When I got on the phone this time I could instantly tell something was wrong. Eva, my grandma, her voice was...weak...like she was struggling to get her words out. We didn't talk much, maybe five minutes in total. She told me that she should be out of the hospital really soon and then when she got out she would take me to Zoo Lights, a Christmas-themed event at the Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. I was excited. The zoo was our thing and I always wanted to go to Zoo Lights. I had hope.

The next day my mom and I went to go see my grandma in the hospital. I had just talked to her last night and the doctors figured she was finally healthy enough to have visitors. To be honest, I couldn't really contain how happy I was to go see her. Since she got admitted, it was the longest time I had ever gone without seeing her in my entire life. I walked through the hospital with high spirits, ready to tell grandma all about school and my new friends - I even brought her a handwritten copy of my Christmas list.

My grandpa was waiting for us when we got to the ICU. He told me to go sit down over by the nurse's station so he could talk to my mom. After a few minutes, my mom waved me over and said we could finally see my grandma. Adrenaline bursting from my pores, I ran over to the room like a cheetah who just found a lone gazelle. List in hand, I went into the room ready to blurt out every possible combination of words I knew. 

What I experienced instead is a scene permanently soldered into my memory. Images I still have nightmares about.

My grandma was lying there in her hospital bed, surrounded by a few members of my family, tubes down her throat, hooked to a wall of machines. She was conscious, though. My mom walked me up to her side and told me to go ahead and talk to her. That she could hear me but she just wouldn't be able to say anything because she needed the tubes to help her breath. I put my Christmas list on her lap and told her I loved her and I couldn't wait until she got out so we could go to Zoo Lights. Although she couldn't say anything, she had a look in her eyes that said everything she needed to. It was happiness, mixed with just a touch of sadness and confusion. It also had that feeling that you get when you know you'll never see someone again. 

That's when everything finally set in. I understood what was going on - my grandma was going to die. 

I lost it. I began screaming and crying in hysterics and I ran out of the room and sat in the chair by the nurse's station. My grandpa came out to talk to me. He told me I needed to be strong. That my grandma loves me and I need to be strong and not let her see my cry so she doesn't get upset. That I should want her to remember me happy and smiling. He took me back over to the room and walked me up to the foot of her bed. My grandma, on the verge of death, was trying to reach her hand out to me to try and tell me that everything was going to be okay.

We went home. I didn't speak.

*December 23rd, 2001.*

My mom got the call at about 5 a.m.. All I remember about it was her screaming and crying and telling me to get up and get in the car. We got to the hospital but this time I wasn't allowed to go back to the room. Instead, my Aunt Mary was there to meet me and she said I was going to stay with her for a few days. Not fully understanding what was happening, I was more than happy to go. 

I had a good few days there. We celebrated Christmas together, and I even got a few presents from my Christmas list. The tags said:

*"To: Mikey, From: Grandma"*

My grandpa picked me up and drove me home on Christmas night. We talked a bit about life and he gave me a pep talk about how to be a man and take care of myself when there was no one else around to help me. 

When I got home, my mom and her boyfriend were sitting at our dining room table waiting for me. They had me open gifts which were well beyond what I was expecting, the best of which being a new Playstation 2. Then my mom sat me down on her lap and broke the news to me. 

My grandma was dead.

I screamed.

**"SHE PROMISED ME WE WOULD GO TO ZOO LIGHTS!"**

I don't remember anything after that moment. I must have blacked out in a fit of crying. What I do remember is the feeling of betrayal I had. My family didn't let me see my grandma one last time. I didn't get to say goodbye. They lied to me. The presents weren't from my grandma. I hated them. Every. One.

I was allowed to go to the viewing, but I wasn't allowed to attend the funeral. I was told it was because my grandpa didn't want me breaking down and causing a scene. That was it. I would never see my grandma again. 

My mom let me stay up late on the weekends after that.  I think because she felt guilty  or maybe part of her had given up. About a month after Christmas,  I passed out watching cartoons when I was abruptly woken up. It was dark, but it shouldn't have been. I fell asleep with the TV on and my mom had never once shut it off in the middle of the night. This was different. 

I looked around, confused and slightly unnerved. No one was awake and the rest of the house was pitch black.  Normally, the hall light was left on in case I needed to go to the bathroom. I called for my mom but she didn't respond. I can't say for certain,  but it felt like my voice didn't carry outside of the living room. Like I was an animal inside of a glass enclosure...and I definitely felt like I was being watched like one. I slowly moved towards the side table to turn on the lamp, hopelessly calling my mom one more time. After a few flickers, the light dimly illuminated the room followed by a loud rattling sound coming from the vent in the wall - like something was crawling up the ducts. My eyes darted to the sounds location and that's when I saw her.

My grandma.

It was her face - there was no mistaking that. She was looking at me from behind the vent fencing. I had so many emotions that I couldn't react. My body shaking, telling me I was terrified. My mind was telling me to scream. My heart...my heart was telling me my grandma was in front of me. Before I had the chance to react, my grandma started moving her mouth like she was chewing on something overly sticky. There was no noise coming from her. This went on for a few seconds until I realized she wasn't chewing - she was trying to say something. I crawled over to get close enough to hear what she was trying to say, if anything. As I was getting closer to the grate her mouth began forming more coherently, like she had figured out how to say what she needed to say. Now in front of the grate, I turned my head and put my right ear next to her. She spoke, weakly. One word only:

"You."

She kept saying it, over and over, in different tones that kept progressing into more normal speak. Then she shouted at me.

**"YOU!"**

The vent slammed shut. The TV came back on, but I had no interest. I ran screaming and crying into my mom's room attempting to tell her what just happened. I don't think she believed [me](https://twitter.com/knutsonwrites?s=09), but she let me sleep with her that night.

That's when it all began. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "Golden Rule" of investigating - one Micah always followed - was not to dig deeper into a case than is needed to complete the job. That's when personal influence comes into play, and morals don't pay bills. 

This job...this job was one of a kind. 

Micah, as much as he knew he shouldn't, needed to know more. Something about the Manager, his story, this...situation didn't add up.

"What happened to 'progress' with your girls?" Micah asked sternly. "If you've put in the effort to create a crime syndicate, why are you concerned with shutting down one that went rogue?" 

The Manager snapped, "**She's not rogue!**" he slammed his fist against a metal hard drive casing, causing some sparks to fly. Micah hit a sensitive spot, and he knew it.

"Easy, old timer. I get what you're doing - this isn't my first job. You're about to be caught and you want me to save you ass."

"You're not entirely wrong," the Manager replied calmly, "'cept I'm not 'bout to be caught." He pulled a PcC from his pocket and tossed it to Micah, who missed. 

"On that device, you'll see transcripts of conversations she's been having with our patrons. This whole 'love' thing is just a front. She's been trying to drop hints about the corruption. No one has caught on, but that's not to say it won't happen if she isn't shut down." The Manager walked away. "The money will be in your account once she's deactivated. Best of luck, son."

More confused than ever, Micah decided not to open the files on the PcC and left through the entryway the Manager opened up. Felicia was waiting at the end of the hallway. Without any exchange of words, the Robot led him to a different room than the one they first met in. 

"He wants you to kill me, you know." Felicia spoke softly. 

"You can't die. You're a robot." Micah was annoyed.

"You don't understand!" It began to sob. "All I want is love. That's all. Just love."

The Robot began secreting tears from its eyes and breathing rapidly. While highly unusual for a Bot, Micah knew the Manager wasn't dealing with the typical models from Vital Wires. These had been augmented. Micah started examining her body for a control panel.

"I'll pay you, I have so much money stored away!" Felicia pleaded, as Micah searched her body. She was warm to the touch in most places, another unusual trait. 

"Micah!" A grainy voice boomed from the ceiling. "Son, add two-thousand if you end it now so I don't have to watch this drag on."

"Where's her box?!" Micah shouted to the tiny camera he noticed in the corner.

"No box, son. These girls aren't different. There's a gun under the bed, loaded with electric rounds. They'll fry her systems and you can head out. I'm sure you want to be done with this job already." 

The Manager was absolutely right. Micah was tired of whatever game was going on in this robotic cesspool. Without any further hesitation, Micah reached under the Robots legs and grabbed the gun. After checking the chamber, he stood up and pointed it at Felicia's chest. She sat there, sobbing and staring at Micah. 

"Bye, Felicia." Micah said as he pulled the trigger.

Everything went white, and a loud, continuous beep resonated through Micah's head.

`"Simulation Terminated"`

A burning sensation in the back of Micah's head caused him to scream out in pain.

"Easy there, Cadet." A stern, male voice spoke from beyond the white light.

"What...wha..?" Micah was unable to find words.

"You killed a human - too focused on the incentive. Test failed. Lay here until your sight comes back, then meet me in my office." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This was it. 

Out of the twenty-nine years Phil was on this planet, 2016 had proven to be the worst of them all. 

February - His wife Janine left him, but he was making it through that. They didn't have kids or property - just a nice downtown apartment.

May - The dog died. Phil began smoking again.

June - Phil's brother Chris died in a boating incident. That caused the depression to set in. Without a father, Phil and Chris relied on each other heavily.

August - "We've got to let you go, Phil." He had enough in savings, but a lot began going towards drinking.

September - His wife was pregnant with their first child. She sent him a letter with the due date and the court order.

October - The Boston Red Sox got knocked out of the playoffs. While some might consider this insignificant, it was the last thing Phil had to hold  onto. His Mom always took him and his brother to the games when they were kids. Phil proposed to Janine at a game.

Phil was done with 2016. 

He jumped out of it. </TEXT>

One time, someone commented on my story and said (not verbatim):

It was probably the greatest comment ever. I have *no* idea how he possibly picked up on the twist! That comment made me change my entire writing style and I'm a better man because of .

	<TEXT> He knew it was coming. Costing the company their fourth multimillion dollar client in less than a year essentially sealed his fate.

With an hour left in his shift, his boss Tom came into the office and closed the door behind him.

"Jim, we've got to let you go. We just aren't seeing a future with you."

"I understand."

"You have until 3pm to clean out your office."

"Will do."

Jim cleaned out his office, walked out of the building, and never returned to the company again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just done being a teenager when Molly came into my life. She got me through college by instilling a sense of responsibility and purpose in my life - I would have just flunked out without her. When I would go home after a long, empty day of class she would jump into my arms, kiss me, and all of my dread would wash away.

When I started hanging out with the wrong crowd, Molly still stayed by my side. She never asked questions. Someone would be tweeked out on my sofa and Molly would just go sit with them until they came back to reality. 

When I OD'd, Molly ran into the halls crying until someone came and helped.

I owe her my life.

I'm in my thirties now, and I only made it with Molly's support and unconditional love. I don't know what I'm going to do now that she's gone.

I took her on one last bicycle ride yesterday - one of our favorite hobbies. The vet had a warm, soft table waiting for her when we came in. I almost backed out, but after everything Molly did for me I couldn't be selfish and let her continue to suffer. 

She's truly an angel now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *"Open the fucking door!"*

That was the last thing I ever heard my dad say. Then there was some loud banging and a gunshot. 

My dad was killed by the police.

The case was highly publicized - everyone smeared my dad's name. They called him a monster. An abuser. They all said he was going to kill me, and that the police saved my life right before he broke down my bedroom door.

No one cared about the man inside my room trying to keep him out. </TEXT>
