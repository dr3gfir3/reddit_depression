	<TEXT> While I appreciate there aren't many guns in your area, there are enough guns in America for almost *every* citizen to have one (link 1).

A gun is just the most obvious scenario. I use myself as the example because I'm not a large man (both shorter and weigh less than average.) I.e overpowering me should be easier for even an average sized man.   But that doesn't matter because a single blind punch, that I'm not guarding against, would be enough to knock me, or anyone, out cold.

Judgment really doesn't enter the equation as women are expected to do this. Those that don't **are** exercising better judgment, but those that don't aren't viewed as having poor judgment (hence my post.) it's considered a societal norm so women do it.

Lastly, assuming we know anything about anyone in this day is dangerous. Thanks to the rise of online dating and hookup apps, it's even less likely you know anything tangible about your date besides their name (and, as a real world example, both I and the girl I'm seeing learned each other's actual first names on first date. We **both** lied in profile)

I think all of your points distinguishing between children and adults are valid, but that doesn't invalidate that we as a society don't question the risk we find acceptable for women. Even if it is less than the child scenario, it's more than most men I know would accept for themselves.

If you get in and close the door, and the person drives away, then 5 minutes later pulls out a handgun...well you're pretty much screwed no matter what.

Yes, a grown woman is stronger than a child I.e. She has a better likelihood of getting away. But that doesn't explain why we expect her to put herself in a dangerous situation in the first place.

Just because she *might* get away, isn't a justification for the risk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This article is nothing more than a dressed up version of "video games make kids violent."

The author extrapolates people will go commit crimes based on other situations rooted in the *appearance of their avatar.* Being more confident because of a tall avatar is a significant leap from virtual murder **could** lead to actual murder. 

Additionally, the first video game study she references used a sample size of 70 people. The second citation is waaay TL;DR. I'm willing to entertain the larger point if her tangential research wasn't used to reach a specious conclusion.

The larger point she's making, and it isn't the clickbait headline, is: 

"Virtual Reality alters our physical and mental perception of self. Society must be prepared to address these challenges as VR becomes more widely available"

...but that headline doesn't generate advertising revenue

	<TEXT> My comment lacks sufficient clarity. If you'll humor me, I'll expound on my thinking:

Whether a person, child or woman, is going to be abducted is in the mind of the person operating the vehicle

We tell children it's *not okay* to get in a stranger's car because we presume a stranger *will* do them harm (which is an unquestionably fair conclusion)

We tell women it *is okay* for them to get in a stranger's car because a stranger *most likely* won't do them harm (which is an arguably fair conclusion)

However, in both scenarios, neither the woman nor the child knows the thoughts of the driver i.e. the risk mechanics of the situation don't change.

A woman getting in the car of a stranger is no different than a child doing the same because both have the same lack of knowledge.  As a society we just accept one as okay (the reason for that is up for debate) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This explanation is awesome.  That said, to explain like poster is 5, I would have shortened it to:

Breasts, unlike hands, attract a mate

Hormones make breasts large (preferred when mating)

Hormones can lead to breasts of different sizes (not preferred when mating)

Hormones also weaken immune system (Not preferred when mating)

Thus, a woman with large breasts that are the same size has good genes (optimal for mating)

Gross oversimplification of a fantastic answer but it is an ELI5 :)

	<TEXT> While I'm reticent to encourage what I feel like will lead to a very angry argument, I would say:

1) Ask them to point to the part of the bible that justifies their feelings about homosexuals.  This matters because the counterpoint is different based on what they quote
2) Familiarize yourself with the common arguments and the counter arguments at link below.  Most people will point to the Holiness Codes of Leviticus as their reason, so I'd focus here. This is where the frequently cited "a man shall not lie with another man" comes from. As does "a man shall not wear a clothing of mixed fibers" and "a man shall not eat shellfish."

That said, if you want to change someone's mind, then you are better off helping them to recognize the errors in their own logic as opposed to trying to forcefully make your own points.  No matter how many times you scream "YOU'RE A HYPOCRITE BECAUSE OF THIS OTHER POINT", the person with whom you're arguing still holds that their belief is correct because you haven't eroded the core tenets of the *original* point that they made.

To illustrate my point in a stupid example:

If I said animals are stupid and have no rights, then you might respond, "What about gorillas that know sign language? They aren't stupid."

I could say back, "That's an exception fallacy because you're holding up an infinitesimal group of a single species as evidence for the entire animal kingdom's iintelligence."

While your point would be valid above, you've done nothing to make me critically consider my argument. If I was forced to define my assumptions like "what is an animal", "what is stupid" and "what are rights?" I'm more likely to reveal a flaw in my reasoning that you can exploit in your argument.

In your example, if their basis is the holiness codes, then you need to undermine their reverence for the holiness codes and not point to other scripture that appears to contradict the holiness codes (Not contained therein)

Finally, you're trying to argue a logical point with a person holding up a faith based argument. While it never hurts to try, you're more likely to tear your hair out than they are to *alter their faith.* I wish you luck.

If you're using a half pint jar (8 oz), then I'd argue you're savoring the cherry notes of a classic vintage and I hope you've paired it with a perfect dish like lamb tajine and blue lobster with fine cumin (as recommended by Veuve Clicquot)

If you're using a jelly jar (12 oz) or larger, then you're everything that's wrong with America.

I recognize compared to how we evolved, our expectations of meat consumption are probably unrealistic compared to our forebears; however, that still doesn't make eating meat an ethical dilemma.

It only means the modern approach to raising livestock presents an ethical dilemma (OR the modern diet presents an ethical dilemma...which is probably the actual case) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm actually closer to your second point ie the likelihood of prions diseases from cannibalism
should act as a deterrent not that all humans will get a prion disease from a single bite of human flesh (and while I know the brain is more likely to transmit that type of disease, my understanding is any part of a human can)...also, I can't believe I just typed that monstrous paragraph.

While I realize strictly relying on odds can be a statistical fallacy; we can hold up the example of BSE in England/Ireland as what can happen with large scale cannibalism (cows were fed to other cows, that were slaughtered where sheep ate other sheep ---then humans ate the cows.). I realize that's a single morbid example but, Thankfully, there aren't many examples of outbreaks of prions diseases specifically because we aren't typically eating animals that are forced to cannibalize other members of their species.  

I would argue an "inferior" creature has no morality. Morality is a mental construct that arose from human self actualization.  The lion eating me is an amoral act.

As per children punching adults and the outcome, modern western societies believe what you said (and I agree). That doesn't mean everyone does (or that even everyone in western society does.)

Think of the controversial case of NFL player Adrian Peterson hitting his son with a "switch" as a form of discipline. Personally I found this appalling BUT I know many people who disagreed.  I'm not saying they're wrong (hint: they're wrong) BUT I'm saying the morality of something like that isn't "common sense"

Consumption of food is amoral.

If you're dying in the desert and see an animal to eat, out of self preservation, a person typically kills that animal and eats it.

That's biology. Not ethics.

	<TEXT> The scenario you describe with reprogramming predators is some Jurassic Park level playing God. I'm not even going there lmao!

I appreciate your point on impulses vs. actions and agree. The drive to procreate can lead to rape but procreation is amoral and copulation by force (for humans) is immoral. However, that still doesn't address the larger issue of how a person defines what does less harm vis a vis consumption.

If for a given person, a single human suffering outweighs the pain of *every* livestock animal on Earth, then they are correct in *their* view to state, "I will not eat any vegetables because humans are exploited." (They may not consider humans were possibly exploited to get the grains)

I doubt anyone has ever worked out the math to say definitively "the wholesale slaughter of animals is worse than the exploitation of people because of X factors"; however, even then, id imagine most people would have hard time accepting that argument.

Just like we are biologically preprogrammed to eat, we are biologically preprogrammed to prefer that which is most like us (which is the same reason why countries like Norway and Finland are always rated happiest...homogeneous surroundings...but that's a whole different topic!!)

His point is the eating, not the killing.

My argument (implicitly) states you (a single person) can kill a single animal to eat it without presenting an ethical dilemma as eating is a biological imperative.

	<TEXT> Because consumption is a biological imperative and humans are omnivores, as such, the act of consumption in and of itself is an amoral concept.

We can pick what we choose to eat but the act of eating (or killing an animal to eat, because you wouldn't eat a live animal), is not an ethical quandary.

To take it to an extreme conclusion, self preservation  dictates anyone would sooner eat than die. 

If an animal was the only option, then you would eat that animal because eating is a biological imperative for surviving.

For Anyone that would say otherwise, I'd be interested to hear them argue for their own death over eating an animal.

Also, because the typical comeback here is the lifeboat scenario, "do you murder another person to eat them and survive" --I'm not going there. Don't be a barbarian on thanksgiving!!

	<TEXT> An avalanche and an animal hunting are a false equivalency. Avalanches are prevented with...avalanches (albeit smaller controlled ones.) same goes for forest fires.  Having a lion eat "smaller, controlled" amounts of gazelle doesn't resolve the argument some pose about having issues with non-human animals eating other non-human animals (which is bonkers to me and again, I know you aren't arguing this point)

I definitely oversimplified my calculus (and concede yours is a more accurate representation) but the open utilitarian question remains the same: what's the level of acceptable "ethical malfeasance" -for lack of a Better term (knowing that your answer doesn't negate the fact that eating is still an amoral, biological imperative).

	<TEXT> I would disagree whole heartedly. We cannot foist a value system upon a wild animal (disagreeing with larger point, I know you said you don't feel that way.)

We have a responsibility to modify our behavior in accordance with moral reasoning; however, eating is a biological imperative.

We can choose what we eat but both sides have sacrifices.  Most agricultural products are picked by exploited labor, yet that is frequently ignored by society (comparatively).

You can eat primarily vegetarian knowing you're tacitly exploiting people or eat primarily animal meat knowing animals are inhumanely slaughtered.  Thus, utilitarian calculus, what matters more: 

X number of exploited people 

or Y number of slaughtered animals.

Naturalistic fallacy:

My point:
X occurs in nature,
Thus, x is not morally incorrect 

Here's where you scream and I explain why that's different.

The act of eating meat is amoral (IMO).  How you get the meat, raise the meat, slaughter the meat, all of that is up for an ethical discussion. Eating the meat is not.

Humans are omnivores and eating is a biological imperative. You can choose what you eat but that does Not rise to an ethical quandary until you consider how you get the food (or dietary restrictions etc). Humans have a requirement to eat just like we have a requirement to breathe (hence my points about that those things.) the original post is: is it ethically wrong to eat meat? My response is: no and ethics never enters the equation.

For me, eating is an amoral act, whether that's fruit or animals.  It does not rise to the level of an ethical question because the act of eating is a biological imperative. How we obtain meat, slaughter animals etc are all ethical questions but my argument is that, biologically, there is not a morality question to be asked.

As per violence, that is not a biological imperative. A human can live a lifetime without violence (and is most likely the better for it.). 

Respiration, consumption, excretion - biological imperatives

Violence, copulation, drug use - actions that can be viewed through the lens of morality

	<TEXT> Thanks for responding to this (I looked it up too after getting home).

Generally, there are a *ton* of reasons cannibalism occurs in animal kingdom. That said, it seems like in many cases there is an evolutionary reason to why that cannibalism is occurring (and it also doesn't read like they are eating them just to make a meal).

For example, the big cat one I am familiar with but I also know the main reason male lions do it is so that the females will come back into heat.  So, not knowing enough, I would ask, are they actually *eating* the young for purposes of nutritional needs *or* are they just killing them. Additionally, a human female won't come into heat strictly because a potential mate eats her children i.e. cannibalism as a practical act does not necessarily hold the same benefits for humans as it may for another species.

All of that said, and not split hairs, I take your larger point.

	<TEXT> It does matter because my primary point is ultimately about biology and not ethics.  

Ethics are mental constructs we've developed thanks to self-actualization.

As per quinoa vs. animals, if you check a later post I compare the deaths of sentient animals to suffering migrant workers. Quinoa was a food so I kept the theme, so to speak. My larger point, which was admittedly not eloquently stated in my original analogy, is that there is no modern method of consumption that has zero negative impact. It's about compromise.  

Do you care more about humans suffering in fields to pick vegetables (whole foods), coffee beans (starbucks), or cacao beans (all chocolate...and oh yeah...child labor)

Or do you care more about animals suffering - basically all meat.

I'm not making the point that one is more ethically acceptable than the other as they are both riddled with ethical dilemmas.

However, the simple *biological act of eating either* is not a moral question. We **are humans** and **humans eat these things**.  Thus my original point, it is not immoral to eat animals.  How we get the animals to our mouths, is a different argument.

I am not definitely not here to troll, but I was a philosophy major (which a number of people I know might call the same thing)

	<TEXT> Almost but not quite. The naturalistic fallacy states:

According to nature, X is true

Thus, X is morally correct

I am actually arguing:

According to nature, X is true

Thus, x *is not* morally *incorrect*

You may be screaming at your computer right now "That's the same fucking thing."  However, I disagree because to me consumption of meat from a biological perspective is not a binary, moral question but an amoral one.  Hence my points about metabolism, reproduction, etc which specifically speak to the biological definition of being alive.

Now, going further into your point, war is not ethical in *your* system of values. There are numerous warrior cultures from history for whom there is no dilemma.  The challenge is the omnipresent ethical relativism.  It's easy to say war is unethical, and I agree, but that doesn't mean everyone does.  Your point presupposes an absolute based on modern western values.

You said it, humans are omnivores. Omnivores by definition eat meat.  That's the exact biological argument I'm making.  We *can* eat vegetables as you state but that doesn't make it morally incorrect to not eat vegetables.

I actually didn't argue any of those reasons of why we shouldn't eat people lol.  However, the more salient point you make is "do animals have the same rights as people" as that is the core of the next few sentences. There I would say, "they do not."  While I believe they do have rights to not suffer, if we had equal rights does that mean I could walk through woods with out being eaten by a puma? Of course not, because I'm projecting my system of ethics on the puma. It doesn't care about that, because I'm lunch. This argument expects an equal treatment of animals that ultimately ends up with *their* treating *us* unequally.

All of that said, I don't deny any of your climate change arguments, etc but all of those extrinsic the actual eating of meat.  That is how we get the meat, not eat it.

Enjoy your vegetarian Thanksgiving! 

And I agree, WOLVES ARE MAJESTIC! I was lucky enough to see one of the packs that roams Hayden Valley in Yellowstone but they were actually on the road. One of my favorite national park memories. </TEXT>

As per the handicapped, etc - we care about them because those are *Our* system of morals; however, not all humans feel that way.  Calling eugenics a pseudoscience does a disservice to pseudoscience but people *do* exist that don't think we should care about them. (I do not fall into this camp but I'd remiss if I didn't mention it) If we want to go down the path of bioethics, then we can discuss what happens in this realm with genetic manipulation in utero (that's a deep dark hole)

is it morally wrong to eat meat?

In the vacuum of biology, the answer is no.

When you consider **all** possible aspects of how meat gets to your mouth, then I understand there are many arguments to be made (hence why I made my last point in my first post).

In fact, and you may find this surprising, I swear I'm not trolling you. I would not have engaged in this discussion simply to troll you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I definitely agree with all of that but pork is only one kind of meat.

More primitive humans had other options and did not need to eat pork (however tasty it may be.)

As you say, yay for marvelous machines of the 20th century! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you've just described is known in philosophy as Hume's Guillotine, or more specifically, the is-ought problem.

If I could answer that, then I'd run an AMA called "I'm a Redditor that knows more than the titans of ethical philosophy" lol.

Simply put, we can't derive what ought to be based on what is.  One (I) can try, but whether we agreed would be luck of the draw.

	<TEXT> So because the lion isn't burdened by a construct of human thought, it's absolved I.e. You agree it's not nature that makes us question eating meat but rather the self actualized human thought.

I don't include children because, unlike a lion, they are *expected* to learn our moral systems at some point. the lion never will.

If quinoa is cherry picking, then allow me to make the argument for exploitation of workers in American fields. Why is that okay? Without exploited labor, a large amount of our vegetables and fruits don't get picked or become significantly more expensive (and potentially limit the number of consumers who can afford them.) Fruits and veggies aren't perfect foods that grow themselves in a vacuum and magically make it to Whole Foods. However, the process of their production is often considered less upsetting because the humans that are exploited to pick them have far fewer videos than the animals slaughtered on killing floors.

	<TEXT> LMAO I've never been known for my brevity!

And while nature may not "care", there are actions that run contrary to nature, that if performed, have undesirable outcomes.

For example, drinking bleach...which will kill a human.

Eating properly prepared animal meat, no such problems. (Excluding allergies, etc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have no idea what meat is "safer" to eat when compared to others; however, humans eating undercooked meat is generally a danger with all land animals (not just pigs.)

When prepared properly, and undercooked implies improper preparation, pork is perfectly safe to eat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would make the animal farm argument 

"Some animals are more equal than others" in western society.

For example, I cant shoot and skin a dog in my backyard but no one would flinch at a deer. As such, I would argue there is not shared sense of morality because "pets" are exempted from certain treatment. This is kind of like Hans landa's argument in inglorious basterds on the difference between a rat and squirrel "they look rather the same except for the bushy tail but you would not treat a squirrel with such contempt" (paraphrasing)

Also, animal cruelty is not "eating meat."

If I humanely kill a pig and eat it, then theoretically no harm, no foul. If I have not "harmed" the animal strictly to cause it pain BUT this is a very different argument than the point of the video. </TEXT>
