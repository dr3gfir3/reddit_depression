	<TEXT> You can easily find out for yourself, but first you just gotta sell yourself into slavery. Then you'll definitely know which one it is. I mean, you might not know what it looks like from the outside, but you'll probably get the name of it from one of the other slaves. If you can sneak online at some point, let us know.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in New York City and I've been friends for many years with a girl now who used to be a stripper, and she wanted to take a break from working at the club back in late 2006-early 2007, so she joined a few of the "Sugar Daddy" websites (SeekingArrangement is now hugely popular), and I remember that she told me how some "sheikh" from KUWAIT wrote her a long message offering her to come and move there with him for some absurd amount of money, and she was seriously considering it!! She was seriously weighing THAT offer alongside an offer for a restaurant date from some fat 26-year-old white doughy guy from New Jersey who was wearing a football jersey in his profile pic. I was like "Are you fuckin crazy??" and explained that she'd be living for the rest of her life as part of a whole group (I didn't say the funny-sounding word "harem") of sex slaves to a bunch of Arab guys. Thankfully, these past couple years, she's just been involved with some big fat white pharmaceutical company guy who visits her from Virginia every couple months, and she actually met him at the latest club where she worked until she got pregnant from a one-night stand with a young guy she met at a Thanksgiving dinner.

	<TEXT> Because there's already a new, active, loyal userbase for the other service. Think about what compelled Facebook to buy Instagram and then WhatsApp. They want the users, who are ultimately advertisement-consumers, as advertising is what fuels Facebook's business. There are 3 ways to make money from the Internet: 

- the 1st is by hosting ads, which is what virtually every website does, and that's how Google totally re-defined the global economy in the early 2000s (the company IPO'd as NASDAQ:GOOG in August 2004); ads are also the basis of Facebook's business, of course (NASDAQ:FB)

- the 2nd is by selling access or special features of a site or app (paid apps, paywalled news websites)

- the 3rd is by selling a product or service to people, and using the website as a store (Amazon, Ebay, Zazzle, and countless T-shirt selling websites) 

- and the 4th is by begging users to donate (as Wikipedia does)

The approach that most companies take is "U.R.L" - "Ubiquity (or Users) first, Revenue Later." The sites and apps you see that just try to grow without appearing to do anything to make money are just looking to attract and retain users (readers, listeners, viewers, players, visitors), whom they will later target one those 4 above-named business models at.

	<TEXT> No individual in world history has been more made fun of and insulted for his skin color and his hair than Donald Trump. The late-night TV hosts all make at least one joke about his appearance every night since he announced his candidacy.

	<TEXT> Google Translation of the article:

**Minister for the law to filter Internet porn in Israel**

**The Ministerial Committee on Legislation voted to law initiated by MK Shuli Mualem Jewish home by which ISPs will be obliged to block porn sites surfers in Israel. Consumers who want to surf porn sites will be able to do so only after eviction provide and ask for it explicitly. The bill was approved unanimously and unopposed.**

Committee for Legislation voted at noon (Sunday) for Promotion of law initiated by MK Shuli Mualem, chairman of the Jewish Home faction, according to which ISPs will be obliged to filter out inappropriate content - unless the customer asks another. Initiated the bill said in response: "Child's easier to consume content online than hard ice cream kiosk to buy local."The bill was approved unanimously and unopposed.
 
The bill stipulates that Internet access provider will provide an efficient service to all subscribers of Web filtering harmful and harmful content on the Internet. For this screening service provider may not charge subscription free Internet access in addition to the payment it collects from service for Internet access.
 
Supplier shall inform the subscriber, after ensuring that no minor that they can avoid filtering service in one of these ways:
By notice in writing or orally at the time of the contract with the supplier.
When you call a customer service center of power.
Using the vendor's website. 
 
The explanatory notes to the Act states: "In the last decade the internet has become the world into a global village and it provides greater access to information and variety. Internet with parties and contents are considered negative, such as gambling, pornography, pedophilia, etc., which can affect and damage the public is exposed to, especially for children. In recent years there has been a marked increase the reports about the number of minors affected by exposure to sexual content and offensive language on the Internet. "
 
It also says in the explanatory notes that "hundreds of studies in the country and the world record and examine the various infringements caused by exposure to the same content and the effects in the long term. In discussions on the subject showed that 60% of children in Israel aged 9 to 15 visits to pornographic sites. Also found that only 47% of children in Israel At age have private in-room computer with which they go online, so that the danger to fall victim to pedophiles has increased significantly due to the lack of parental supervision. "
 
To date aggression against Israel providers were required to inform customers about filtering options through handouts mail and advertising on their sites, but many customers were not aware of those possibilities. Therefore offer MKs to change the default and determine that the ISP will have to provide an efficient service to all subscribers or web filtering offensive content set, free of charge.
 
These MKs signed the bill: Shuli Mualem, Nissan Slomiansky, Bezalel Smotrich, Eitan Cabel, Meirav Ben-Ari, karin elharar, Oded Forer, Hamad Amar, Moti Yogev, Aliza Lavie, Yifat Shasha lining, Uri drying rack, Rachel Azariah, Aida Touma-Suleiman, David Bitan, Nava morning, Ahmed Tibi, Elazar Stern, Yaakov Margi, Menachem Eliezer Moses, Moshe Gafni, Roy Folkman, Zouheir Bahloul, Abraham bitten, Yoav Ben-Tzur and Abdullah Abu Marouf. Similar proposals were also raised in two previous income, but not passed.

# The people of Haiti HATE the Clintons, and rightfully so! -

 Nevertheless, the Clintons are facing a growing backlash that too little has been accomplished in the past five years, and that some of the most high-profile projects they have backed  including the Marriott, another luxury hotel and the industrial park  **have helped foreign investors and Haitis wealthy elites more than its poor.**

 Bill Clinton is a good guy and well-intentioned, **but the people here dont think so  they think hes here making money, said Leslie Voltaire, a former government official who worked with Clinton on post-earthquake reconstruction. There is a lot of resentment about Clinton here. People have not seen results. . . . They say that Clinton used Haiti.**

Then this great line:

 **Why is he hiding, or being hidden? (Closed door money solicitations do not count).**

And lastly:

 Regarding the Times story, how about the campaign telling voters and media that she believes in something more powerful, inspirational and visionary **than what television interviews she plans to appear on to improve her negative trust ratings?**

 General Secretary Gorbachev, if you seek peace, if you seek prosperity for the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, **if you seek liberalization,** come here to this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, open this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall!

Even Arnold Schwarzenegger said last summer on the Howard Stern Show (yes) that the two Republicans he was considering were those two, and they are among the few who have refused to endorse Trump. There were articles every day for the first half of last year about Jeb this and Jeb that. It was going to be Bush vs. Clinton once again, but Trump had his own plans, THANK GOD... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks like Wikileak-leaks are seeping into the cracks of the dam of censorship! MSM had actually covered at least a couple things before--I can't remember what exactly, but I know this isn't the FIRST time that the Clinton Wikileak stuff has gotten big write-ups--but now it's more extensive, and that was the first time I saw the group of major papers ALL cover the same story on thier front pages on the same day. 

It COULD also be that people are tweeting (and even emailing) news outlets and mainstream political journalists like crazy, as O'Keefe urged people to do in one of his videos the other day. Alex Jones was saying the other day that Infowars twitter account was tweeting at all the major networks about O'Keefe' videos, and of course the two of them did an interview as well.

	<TEXT> Their fucking vocal cords and brains and every waking move were all under the absolute and total control of their money-masters, aka puppet-masters. In the primary debates, Trump's opponents were all continuously holding back, because they can only say and do exact what their backers have ordered them to do, and I'm sure among that was "DON'T take any risks, DON'T 'go rogue,' DON'T act like Trump, as he'll just burn out within a week or so because of the crazy shit he says." And then all 16 challengers fell one by one, and now 11 of them endorse him. See the last column on the list here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republican_Party_presidential_candidates,_2016

	<TITLE> Desperate anti-Trump propaganda sign I just ripped down from a phone booth in midtown Manhattan - Yes, he wants to help America realize its free-market capitalist ideals...just like a communist dictator! Wait, what? (Could the stupidity of this be any more obvious?) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's a evil, insidious conspiracy to create peace! Goddamn those peace-loving pacifists who don't wanna turn all of Syria and Iran and 10 other countries into rubble where millions of people are left homeless!
