	<TEXT> I thought the number of calories seemed really low so I just input your info into the IIFYM calculator... at your age/height/weight and exercising 4 times a week it gives me 1933 calories recommended, or 1819 for aggressive weight loss.

Edit: and if it's helpful as a reference point, I'm shorter and lighter than you (5'7" ~145) and losing weight at 1600-1700 calories a day, lifting 4-5 times a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A couple things you could try:

- a little more food on workout days, like you mentioned - doesn't have to be complicated, it can be as simple as adding a dessert or protein shake or something
- focusing your carb intake around gym time (carbs before/during/after the gym, and then low carb the rest of the day)
- bump your calories back up to maintenance for a month, then continue cutting

I wouldn't do all of those at once, just some things to try out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't have to bulk to increase your lifts! You can get stronger even if you're not gaining weight/muscle mass, especially if you're newer to lifting and if your calorie deficit isn't too drastic.

If you're feeling flabby and it's bothering you, go ahead and cut (or at least stop bulking) - just do it gently. Drop your calories by only a couple hundred, keep an eye on your weight, and reassess as needed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In addition to the other recommendations, I used box squats when I had trouble hitting parallel/figuring out where that was. I used a low box my gym had (I tested by sitting on them in front of a mirror and found one that had me ending up just below parallel). 

Then I brought the box into the rack and did some sets with a lighter weight than usual, making sure to touch the box each time (test with bodyweight squats first to make sure the box is in a good place). That way you can "feel" parallel without having to see it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's totally normal based on water weight. I find mine to be usually within 1lb but it can jump around if I eat a bunch of pizza and drink a bunch of beer, for example - it'll shoot up and then go back down to normal a couple days later.

I like to weigh myself every day so that I know what's "normal" and what's just a weird day, but I only pay attention to the overall trend.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, it'll work (you may have to adjust a bit the closer you get to your goal weight, since TDEE estimates are just estimates, of course). The reason it's not usually recommended is because you have less control over the speed of weight loss. You might start out with a huge deficit and be really hungry/not do well in the gym/whatever, and then end up with a tiny deficit and lose weight frustratingly slow. But with 40lbs to lose, your initial deficit might not be too enormous (disclaimer: I didn't calculate it) so if it seems easier to manage, go for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it easiest to make sure I'm hitting my macro goals by planning my meals rather than just tracking as I go, so I make sure that I set my day up to get lots of protein and don't accidentally end up in that awkward "hit my calorie limit but way under on protein" situation.

My calorie and protein goals right now are around yours - personally I find it easiest to split up my protein intake into smaller, frequent meals rather than trying to eat a pound of chicken at once. I have a scoop of protein first thing in the morning, a scoop before bed, and then a small amount of eggs or meat at each meal. It feels... almost too easy.

	<TEXT> Yeah the biggest struggle for me would be switching that. I love my AM gym session but there's no way - my commute to work from there would probably take an hour or so. :( So if I switched it would be for the next 531 cycle in April and I'd go for those classes in the evenings. Total sleep schedule switch.

	<TEXT> YES. You should definitely at least check out the next training day (which sadly won't be until the third Saturday in April) to get a decent sense of the place. I didn't even tour the rest of the gym but I already like it as a place I could go nights/weekends (which is totally different than my current life routine, but I think would be worth it). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a cheap spiralizer [kind of like this](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00IRGYQ36?psc=1) so I just spin the zucchini through that thing and it slices it into noodles.

It's then generally a good idea to dry the noodles a bit, otherwise they'll release of water when you cook them - I put mine in a strainer and squeeze them a bit and then let salt them and let them sit while I prep other ingredients.

They don't need to be cooked very long (depends on how crisp you like them) so I'll usually just throw them in for a quick saut with the sauce/other ingredients. </TEXT>

Then pop it in the freezer for a few minutes, optionally top with walden farms 0 cal chocolate syrup. It tastes like chocolate peanut butter ice cream! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dunno why people downvoted you, I agree that this is sometimes where the "muscle turns into fat if you stop working out" myth comes from. If you're an athlete and used to eating like an athlete, and then you stop being an athlete but keep eating the same way, you end up fat. 

Obviously we all know this is from eating at a surplus + not maintaining muscle mass, not from muscles magically turning into fluff.

OP, when you get old, everything sags anyway so who gives a fuck? :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is a powerlifting-focused gym ~20-30 minutes away from me (in the opposite direction of work) that I've been dying to check out, but I also love my early AM workouts right on the way to work so I've held off... but I recently discovered that once a month they have "training days" open to anyone for $20 that focus on one big lift.

I went to "deadlift day" this weekend and it was absolutely amazing. I was there for 2 hours getting 1-on-1 coaching from a dude who squatted 750 in his prime. I was actually sick as a dog but went anyway and pulled 275 (a 10-lb PR) and it felt great.

They apparently also have a small 531 "class" that meets 3 times a week at night and is similarly structured - lots of individual coaching attention for a lot less $$$ than actual individual coaching. I'm in love and I think I'm going to switch when the next 531 cycle starts. </TEXT>
