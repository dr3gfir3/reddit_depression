	<TEXT> I didn't have any trouble. However, I still think it's important to "feel it out" with a few different dogs to see if you find one who you connect with. I didn't know I would end up with a Great Dane, we just ended up having a connection during my adoption search. Best of luck to you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't purchase! Adoption is always the best option. I adopted my Great Dane when he was 1 year old and I love him to death! Do a google search for great dande rescue organizations near you. There are so many already out there who need homes, plus they are great dogs, thus appropriately named! </TEXT>
