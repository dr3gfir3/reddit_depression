	<TEXT> *There's a psychopath in my house.*

No he didn't break in. He sleeps in the same room as me. It's not my brother's fault; this is just who he is. 

If it's anyone's fault, it's my parents. My mom left when I was six and my little brother was four. She never wanted us, or at least that's what my dad said because I don't remember her very well. 

Dad said she used to be a perfect student with big dreams, then she got knocked up and had to drop out of college to take care of us. He reminds us all the time that it was our fault she left, and how happy he was before we were born.

That's the nice version of what he said anyway. Lots of stuff about her being an ungrateful slut who will burn in Hell, but I don't think of her that way. If I was married to someone like my dad, I would have run away too. 

My dad needed "medicine" to cope with her leaving. Every time he took it, he would be gone for a few days. It would be just me and my little brother in the house, and I took care of him the best I could. My dad wouldn't usually leave us with any money, but I got pretty good at hiding things under my dress at the grocery store. 

I thought things would change when I was 12 and found a paper bag with about 1,000 dollars in our backyard. I thought mom had sent it - that she'd heard about how hard things were and mailed us some money. 

I could usually find food when I needed it badly enough, so I didn't want to waste it on things like that. It was my brother's 10th birthday coming up and that seemed like a big deal. I hired a van and brought him and seven kids from his class to spend the whole day at Sea World. 

It was so much fun I thought about never going back. My brother didn't want to run away though, and I couldn't leave him. Besides, the van driver was keeping an eye on us and said he had to bring us home or he might get fired. 

We should have run away though. The money hadn't come from my mom - she'd forgotten about us. That's when I found out my dad's "medicine" was meth, and that he'd been selling some to his friends when he dropped the money by mistake. I tried to tell him that it was my fault, but since it got spent on my brother's birthday, he got the worst of it. 

My brother didn't walk again for two years after that. He needed even more help now that he was in a wheelchair. There were more bills that weren't being paid - the electricity, the gas, even the rent sometimes. I had to be out a lot trying to find money, sometimes for days at a time when I was staking out a house to steal from. 

I couldn't leave my brother alone too long though. My dad would just ignore him, and if I didn't check in at least twice a day then I'd find my brother sitting in his own piss and shit. I think he could have made it to the toilet by himself if he really tried, but he just gave up caring about everything.

There is one thing my brother started doing to pass the time though, although this I wish he hadn't. I noticed his growing collection of small animal skulls for awhile, but I assumed they were just plastic until I saw how he was catching them.

I watched him put bird seed in a 2L soda bottle with the opening cut wider. Once a squirrel crawled in, he would pull a string which slid the bottle down to cover the opening with a piece of cardboard. It would struggle frantically to get out, but when it was near the opening its own weight would hold the bottle into place against the board. 

I would have congratulated him on his contraption except for what happened next. He picked up the bottle - cardboard still covering the opening - and slipped a couple razor blades into the opening. Then he *SHOOK* the whole thing until it looked like the inside of a blender, the squirrel *SCREAMING* the whole time. 

I took it away from him, but he just kept building little things like that. It wasn't just squirrels either - mice, small birds, even a raccoon once. After he'd killed them, he'd *BITE* the head straight off and then spit it into a bowl of water to clean the organic matter off the skull.

*"Please stop. God didn't make those animals just so you could torture them,"* I said to him. 

*"Then why did he make it so much fun?"*

---

It's not just animals anymore. I found a big cardboard box out on the sidewalk near the bus-stop. Inside was a bag of M Ms, a couple comic books, and his old Gameboy Color. There was a rope tied to little hooks inside the box which led toward my house.

If someone were to pull that rope, the box would close and the whole thing would be dragged down the sidewalk. I don't think he'd be strong enough to pull anyone bigger than a six year old, but the school bus stopped here. 

I ripped the box into pieces and ran to confront him. I found him sitting on his bed - he was out of the wheelchair now - waiting with a knife in his hands. 

*What the hell are you trying to do?"*

*"Set a trap.*"

*"It's not going to work,"* I said. 

*"Don't worry. It'll work.*"

*"I destroyed it. Why are you trying to trap some kid?"*

*"I'm not. I'm trying to trap you."*

That's when I noticed that the TV was suspended with ropes above me. He cut the cord, and it landed right on top of my head. 

He must have counted on that knocking me out because he was already coming at me with the knife. I was dizzy, but I managed to scramble out of the way and slam the door in his face. 

---

After that, I was too scared to go back inside the house. I called Child Protective Services and reported the meth deals my dad was doing in the home. I didn't mention what my brother has been doing because I thought once he was out of here he'd have a chance at a fresh start. I didn't want his life to be over before it had even begun.

We were both put into separate foster homes, and it's been two years since I've heard anything from him. That was until last night.

---

My adoptive parents - wonderful Asian couple who couldn't have kids of their own - sat down with me at the kitchen table. They told me they had some good news: they were going to adopt my brother as well. 

I guess the family that took him in suffered an unfortunate accident. They didn't tell me what happened, but by the look they gave each other, it was something gruesome. 

I hope he's changed. Telling people what he did will stop him from being adopted and ruin his life forever. I can't say anything until I've seen him again. If he hasn't though...

Well that's why I'm writing this. If he hasn't changed, then at least someone will know what happened and have a shot at stopping it from [happening again](http://tobiaswade.com/horror-blog). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've done it. Three years of being single, and I've finally gotten a girlfriend. 

*Yes she's human. No she's not blind. No she's not a body pillow.*

These are the kinds of questions my best friend Mike kept asking me. I was so excited that it didn't even bother me. Besides, I knew he was just jealous because he'd never even been with a girl before. He's always been the bigger nerd between the two of us - like like learning Elvish from Tolkien's books and chanting spells in our DnD games - hardcore nerd stuff. 

Neither of us are the type of guy that girls tend to hang around though. Mike and I live together; we're both video game streamers (Hearthstone and Dota2), and we make a living off advertising and tournament winnings. 

I met Natasha through a Twitch chat room and she happened to live close by. Since the first day we met, we've practically been joined at the hip. We eat every meal together, shower together, even stream together. 

I don't remember ever being this happy - the only problem is, Mike has decided to make this all about him. He started gaining *even more* weight, he never goes outside, and all he does is bitch about how I never hang out with him anymore. 

Natasha decided the solution was for the three of us to go camping together in Yellowstone National Park. Mike would get some exercise, I'd get to hang out with him, and most importantly, Natasha and I wouldn't have to spend any time apart. 

---

I regret *everything*. Why does everything in nature have to be so damn itchy?

It turns out Natasha has a severe misunderstanding about how trails work. She must be a skyrim player, because she thinks there is only one right way up a mountain, and that's straight up the rock cliffs. 

If we weren't still at that phase of dating where everything becomes an opportunity to impress her, I would have given up and gone home. I have no idea how Mike made it, but we all decided the day was over by about 4 PM in the afternoon. 

The view was incredible - no I'm not just talking about Natasha in her short-shorts. She found a practically inaccessible rock ledge overlooking most of the park and single-handedly hauled all our camping gear up there while Mike and I lay panting on the ground. 

Campfire - s'mores - a full blanket of stars - it was a great night. Natasha and Mike bonded over Magic the Gathering cards (which I can't believe he packed instead of a lantern), and he finally agreed to start working out and taking better care of himself so he could find a girl too. 

As the campfire burned down into embers, we started telling ghost stories. I told one about a man-eating wendigo, Natasha knew a twisted story about a priest who crucified people, and Mike...

I don't know where Mike stole his story from, but he claimed to have made it up on the spot. I think he was trying to impress Natasha too, but I didn't get jealous. He said it in a sing-song rhyming voice which was super creepy, and I made him write it down afterward. It went like this: 

---

*I had a dream one fateful night
when day had made its run.
When waking world had fled from sight
and silent moon eclipses sun.*

*Into fitful slumber slipped,
losing command of my thoughts.
Nightmares around me gripped,
The familiar had come to naught.*

*I forgot what I've been taught
about what cannot cause me harm.
My fears abound, in safety sought,
I scream to waken in alarm.*

*Only to find I've fallen deeper,
down this darkened pit of shade.
No sound escapes from silent sleeper,
nor outward sign of my dismay.*

*I saw a monster rear its head,
somewhere inside of mine.
On my dear memories it fed,
the beast who devours time.*

*Scything talons raking down,
gaping jaws of a giant spider.
I was marked as I was found
As the one outsider.*

*Until all I could recall of life,
was that I had once loved.
Until that too was torn in strife,
an arm severed from the glove.*

*There upon the edge of breaking,
inside of me a guide would lead.
She was the love I'd be forsaking,
when I opened my eyes from sleep.*

*She took my hand and together ran
from the monster in my mind.
We got so far that soon began
What I never thought to find.*

*We lived a day, a season, then year,
an entire lifetime in my head.
Happy as he who has forgotten fear
of the monster I had dread.*

*Until finally it rose from quiet,
when we thought ourselves alone.
We had lived lives in spite it,
but our life together was on loan.*

*The monster had us caught!
Trapped and helpless in a corner.
With no escape I stood and fought,
rather die than be a mourner.*

*Rather lose oneself completely,
than forget what I had sworn.
Death before me, but I would beat he
who would dare to touch her form.*

*I ripped the air with my two hands,
but as the creature was not real,
no blows upon the beast did land,
though its talons I could feel.*

*Blooded broken and abused,
I awaited morning's light to heal,
and save me from this awful ruse,
that my fortune had me sealed.*

*She knelt above me, my lovely queen,
and besought me waken from this dream.
But what fate would befall her here?
would with the morning she disappear?*

*She bore the monster and its fury
begging only that I woke.
Bidding me go, though not to hurry
lest this the last time that we spoke.*

*Sweat soaked, body shakes -
I cant remember why I was sad.
Throat chocked, fully awake - 
Memories flood of the dream I had.*

*Blood trickled down my length,
and I thanked each crimson bead.
They gave hope and lent me strength.
That perhaps she too was freed.*

*And there my bride lay beside me
from my dream she was released.
Wearied from dreaming was she
who in the waking world found peace.*

---

I woke up to a high-pitched scream in the middle of the night. What the shit? 

Did a bear get into our camp? I thought we'd be safe from any of the larger wildlife because of the rock ledge. Or a maybe it was a mountain lion... 

I was on my feet - Natasha was already unzipping our tent. 

"Wait - it could be dangerous!" 

"Then we've got to help Mike." 

I couldn't fault her reasoning. I just wish she had been a little more selfish. I grabbed my cellphone to use as a flashlight and followed her outside. 

"I'm okay! I'm okay. Sorry I screamed." Mike was in his boxers, standing outside his tent. 

"You scream like a girl. What happened?" I asked. 

He pointed inside his tent and drew the flap back. Natasha and I peered inside with him. 

There was a girl - or maybe a Goddess - mid-twenties, long auburn hair, flawless skin - butt naked, lying beside Mike's empty sleeping bag. I turned away for a moment, but looked again as soon as I noticed Natasha wasn't averting her eyes. 

"Who the hell are you?" Natasha asked.

The girl smiled, making no effort to cover herself. She sat upright and began smoothing out her hair. 

"I had the dream - the same dream from that story I found." 

"Aha! I knew you didn't make that shit up," I said. 

"Yeah whatever," Mike replied. "But I was dreaming about her. And the beast was there... and..."

"What's your name? Where did you come from?" Natasha asked. 

The girl stretched luxuriously, still smiling. She stood up and wrapped her arms around Mike, peering at us from over his shoulder. 

"Where did you find that story?" I asked Mike. He was frozen stiff with a mix of terror and rapture. 

"Some book. Doesn't matter." 

"It *does* matter if it's real," I said.  

"I don't like it," Natasha said. "Either tell us who you are or get out of here." 

"No!" Mike stepped protectively in front of her. "She's lost without any food or clothes or anything. We can't just leave her in the wilderness." 

"You're just saying that because you think you're going to get some." I don't know why I was fighting it. I shouldn't be jealous. I had Natasha. But this... this just wasn't fair. 

"I don't care," Mike said. "I'm going to take her back with us and bring her to a hospital in the morning. Maybe she had a concussion or something." 

"And until the morning?" Natasha asked, crossing her arms. 

The girl pulled away from Mike and settled into his sleeping bag. Mike smiled sheepishly. 

"Well she seems comfortable here so..." 

"You're an idiot." Natasha rolled her eyes and walked out. Over her shoulder, she added "But if the girl is real, then I wouldn't be surprised if the beast was too." 

Mike gave me a thumbs up. I laughed, closing the tent behind me.  

---

That was the last time I saw Mike alive. When we checked on him in the morning, his rib-cage was flayed open. His heart was missing, but there was still some scraps of sinew and part of his aorta lying in a pool of blood beside the bag. The girl was gone.

I threw up in the bushes. Natasha just stared at the grizzly scene. 

"We're going home." She said, turning sharply away. 

"I'll start packing -"

"No," she said. "Let's just go."

"We can't leave Mike like this."

"It's his own damn fault. Now the girl could be anywhere, so let's go *now*!" 

Natasha was already half-way down the rocky wall, but I wasn't going to run through the forest naked. I opened my tent to grab some pants but - 

The girl was sitting in my tent. Her naked body was covered in blood, and when she smiled, more blood squirted out from between her teeth. 

"Hurry up!" Natasha yelled from outside. "I swear to God I'll leave without you." 

I was bout to turn and run when the bloody girl finally spoke. 

"Help me." 

"Help you? After what you did to -"

"It wasn't me!" Her smile was gone now, and she looked on the verge of tears. "It was the beast. He's free too." 

If she was telling the truth, then I couldn't just leave her here. If she wasn't... 

There was another SCREAM outside. Natasha! I leaped from the tent and ran to the place she was climbing down. Her crumbled body was lying on the ground. She must have slipped while climbing -

*No.* There was a dark shape on top of her - like a wolf with impossibly long limbs and an elongated mouth. 

"Natasha!" 

But I was helpless to get to her in time. One bite was enough to snap the rib-cage open. I couldn't watch what was going to happen next. 

I turned around, and the girl was gone. I ran - farther and faster than I ever have in my life. There were a few times when I heard something bounding through the underbrush to my side, but I didn't look. I kept running, even when my lungs felt like they were about to explode and the stitch in my side threatened to tear me in half. 

--- 

I don't know whether the girl and the beast were the same, simply two-halves of the same nightmare. I don't know if it's still out there, or whether it only comes when that story is read aloud.  

I'm going to try and find the book where Mike found the story and destroy it. Although I have to admit, I'm a little curious what else is [written in those pages..](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade)  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to start your own cult </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-05 20:31:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me preface this by stating I am a firm atheist. There is no life after death, although I will go to great lengths extolling its beauty to my subjects. We do not grow older because the Reaper is always siphoning our life energy. I was not born from a dying star, and I am no prophet of the Divine Cosmic Order. 

I am a nihilist - I do not believe in anything. And as much as I do not believe in the supernatural, I believe even less in mankind and their ability to govern their own lives. 

Do you really need proof of that? Fanatic mobs begging for their religious oppression to be protected by the government, junkies in the street surrendering their will to anything they can boil into their veins, a narcissistic idiot elected president of the United States - you get the idea.  

The church-states, the cartels, the two-faced cooperations - none of them will hesitate to manipulate the population for their own selfish purposes. The vast majority of people will always be susceptible to being manipulated, because it is so much safer and easier to be told what to think than to think for yourself. 

My reasoning dictates:

1) **People will always be susceptible to manipulation.** If you aren't manipulating them, then someone else will. 

2) **The manipulator will always profit at the expense of the people.** That is the purpose for their influence. 

3) **The only way to protect people from a selfish manipulator is to become a benevolent manipulator yourself.** 

For these reasons, in my senior year of college, I decided to start my own cult. 

---

Step One: Identify your targets. 
-
People will not run to you unless they are already running away from something else. Now, where could I find the most fearful students?

I formed three support clubs and put up fliers around campus. One for the socially anxious, one for those needing financial assistance, and a third for victims of sexual assault.

Step Two: Amplify their fear
-
Ever wonder why priests scream about Hell while politicians rant about terrorists and economic collapse? There is nothing like fear to get someone's attention and follow you for relief. 

To the socially anxious, I forced them to give speeches. I asked them embarrassing questions, put them in awkward situations, and generally ridiculed them, all in the guise of helping them gain confidence. 

To the financially stressed I gave lectures about how student loans haunt people for the rest of their life. I told them how the job market is over-saturated with college degrees and how  slim their chance of employment was. I told horror stories about homeless drug addicts who graduated college but couldn't make anything of their lives. 

The sexual assault group was the most fun for me. No I didn't rape them - I needed them all to trust me. I did however convince them that I was the only one looking out for them - that there was a rapist in every party and down every dark alley. 

Step Three: Offer a Solution 
-
Three months into the semester, I had finished establishing sufficient trust. That's when I let them in on a little secret - *the reason why I'm not afraid*. 

Wouldn't it be great if there was safe place to go where no one would make you feel bad about being socially inept? A band of brothers who helped each other find jobs, share rooms, and reach financial success? Sisters who would hold your hand and keep you safe from all the predatory monsters in the world?

I had enough people now that I was able to register my flock as a co-ed professional fraternity. I did some fundraising with the groups and managed to raise enough money to renovate an abandoned motel into my headquarters. Now that I had them all together, the fun could really begin.

Step Four: Make yourself special. 
-
It's not enough for your people to need your insight. They need to *need* you. Now it was time to explain what made me unique. 

Don't force it down their throats. People don't want to be part of an organization that needs them. They want to be part of something exclusive, something that recognizes how special they know they are inside.

I began by offering private counseling sessions to everyone having difficulty. To each of them, I confessed the *truth* about why I was helping them. 

You see, I wasn't human at all. I was an alien who was born in the Andromeda galaxy. My people are empaths, allowing us to sense the suffering of other sentient beings. I felt how troubled Earth was, and I came here to save humanity from themselves. 

They were all skeptical at first, but here's what really convinced them. I told each person in confidence that the rest of the fraternity was already indoctrinated. No-one wants to be the only one left out, especially when they finally found a home which unequivocally accepts and shelters them. 

Step Five: Make them special
-
Each new member makes it that much easier to add the next because it adds credibility and makes people more afraid of being left out. Adding the first few is the hardest part, so here is what I did. 

The first person I convinced was a scared freshman girl who was raped during a house party. She was ready to give anything just to feel safe. I gave her the chance to witness the ceremony and didn't force her to commit to anything. 

I laid rows of candles in the basement and lined the walls with mannequins. I concealed the mannequins with thick robes, so it would appear as though most of the fraternity was already present. I used a surround sound system and a layered chanting soundtrack to make it seem like everyone was participating. 

By the time I was through with the ceremony, she was so afraid of being left out that she swore the oath of loyalty right on the spot. 

Step Six: Make it impossible to leave
- 
This is the final - and I would argue most important - step. There is nothing as toxic to an organization as having a previous member leave and talk about it. 

Once I had ten members who had undergone the ceremony, I organized them into two groups of five. I gave them innocent tasks to prove their loyalty. Each one would be slightly more difficult than the last, which is important for keeping them invested. 

The final task to allow them full membership and protection was very simple. Four of them must team up and kill the fifth member of the group. For each group, I chose the least loyal, most suspicious member to be killed. I told the rest that the fifth member was a traitor - that he raped one of the other members. That he was going to single handedly destroy all we had worked to build together. 

They would never do it alone, but when the rest of their group was going along with it, they lost the power to think for themselves. Both groups did as they were told. 

It was a ritualistic sacrifice - the extra man would be tied down to a stone table. I had already drugged him, minimizing his resistance. I used his slurred speech as proof that he was possessed by an evil Cosmic Spirit which sought to destroy us all.

I made sure each of the four loyal group members thrust the knife into his body at least once. After that, their conscience would bind them to me forever. 

If they stayed, their minds told them they were a hero. If they left, they were a murderer. Which do you think they would rather be?

---

One full semester later, I have indoctrinated 54 members so far. There have been 10 deaths, soon to be an 11th. 

I'm not writing this as a confession - I don't expect you'll be able to find me. I'm writing this as an offer.

My cult is growing, and there are different chapters springing up all around the country. We have been helpless pawns for too long, but we are learning how to play the game by their rules. When you are ready to take power into your own hands, I hope you will join me and [change the world](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade). </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Read part 1](https://redd.it/62njyr) to see how I found the dead bodies floating to the surface. 

---

After reading all of your warnings, I'll admit I was pretty hesitant about making my second dive. Just to be safe, I decided not to go on this one alone. 

Two nights ago I reconnected with Entoine, one of the boys who found some of the original floaters with me. He still remembered trying to lick the body to get his 5$ back and we laughed about it - I guess that sort of thing only happens once in your life. 

I showed him the audio recordings I pulled from the black box and talked him into joining me. He didn't have dive equipment, but I knew I'd feel better with him in the boat. 

"Notice feeling anything strange since you licked it?" I asked him while we were rowing out to the middle of the lake. 

"What kind of strange? You mean besides puking my guts out?" 

"Warts. New birth mark in the shape of a pentagram. Sudden urge to kill people. You know - something like that." 

"Not that I can think of," he admitted. "Except for my ability to talk to animals."

"What? Seriously?" 

"Yeah. He smirked. "They just don't talk back. Keep pulling your weight or the boat is going to start turning in circles." 

--- 

Reading too many horror stories online must have made me paranoid. I don't know what I was so afraid of in the first place. The visibility was good underwater, and I didn't even see any fish besides a host of little black water slugs scootering around. 

Instead of weights, this time I just used a crowbar to sink me down to the plane. The doors were so rusted they were starting to unfasten on their own, so it was no problem breaking the lock off. 

I was tense, but I remembered to force myself to keep breathing evenly through the regulator. Holding my breath under water could easily result in an arterial gas embolism. Then I'd be the next floater they found washed up on the beach.  

Even without the lock, the room was still pressure sealed with an air pocket inside. I tried leveraging the crowbar, but I still couldn't pry the door open against the weight of all that water. I managed to hammer on the door with the metal bar until a leak appeared. The wider I forced the hole, the more water flowed through to equalize the pressure. Once it was full, it should swing open without a problem.

I finally worked the crowbar all the way through the door, but this time it got stuck. That's weird, because the water was flowing freely around it so there should be plenty of space to pull it back. It was almost as if something were holding it from the other side...

That was a thought I could have done without. I freaked and dropped the crowbar, but without its weight I began to immediately float back towards the surface. I held onto the door-frame to keep myself from slipping upwards, but it was almost impossible to swim further down against my buoyancy. 

Luckily I didnt have to. The cell finished flooding and the door began opening on its own. Suddenly I was face to face with a dead body. Its skin had long since begun to rot away, especially around its eyes and mouth where there were just gaping holes remaining. 

My crowbar had stuck straight into its side where it had gotten stuck. I was about to pull myself down toward it along the door frame when I noticed the crowbar was sliding back out. 

*No. Not sliding. The body's hands were wrapped around the bar. They were pulling the crowbar out of its side.*

Had I jolted upward too quickly when I let go of the bar? Maybe I already suffered a stroke from the gas embolism without noticing? 

The body lurched toward me. *Slow, even breaths. Don't stop breathing.* Easier said than done with a dead body clambering up toward you. It was fast too - driven with a purpose. Legs and arms with openly rotten sinews moved effortlessly through the water like a practiced swimmer. 

I pushed my way out of the plane, but the body was right behind me. It dropped the crowbar and began ascending smoothly through the water toward me. It was just as fast - at least as fast - as me even though I had fins. 

*Shit.* I kicked hard, and without any weight I was raising way too swiftly. I couldn't stop myself. I felt the air expanding in my lungs so rapidly it felt like they would burst. I was practically screaming underwater, trying to get as much air out as I could. 

Once I hit the surface, the scream finally became audible, although it was little more than a wheezing gasp at that point. The boat? Where was the boat?

"Entoine get your ass over here!" He was leaning over the boat and peering down into the water - about fifty yards away. Fuck. I looked down and saw the shadow of the body swiftly ascending toward me. 

I swam hard toward the boat. Entoine wasn't reacting. There's no way he didn't hear me. Why the hell didn't he start rowing? He was just staring into the depth, his face about an inch from the water. 

"Entoine I swear to God -" but my lungs felt like they were on fire. I couldn't take a full breath yet. All the air I had was going into keeping my legs kicking. 

The shadow was right underneath me now. Ten feet from the boat - I ducked my head underwater and paddled as hard as I could. Too slow - the body was intercepting me. It was going to block my route. About five feet away from the boat, it surfaced directly between me and the boat. 

But it wasn't an explosive surface like something swimming upward. It just floated there, face down in the water, looking as dead as I felt. I had to push the body out of the way to get to the boat. I kept expecting a hand to grab my ankle and pull me back down, but there was nothing. 

I climbed into the boat and fell on my back panting. My mask was cloudy, so I ripped it off. As soon as I could kneel again, I practically shoved Entoine straight into the water. 

"What the hell is wrong with you?" The push pressed him against the side of the boat. He tensed and relaxed, but didn't turn away from the water. It was like trying to wake someone from a deep sleep. He was just vacantly staring at the floating body now. 

The body was moving again though - its ear was anyway. Not a natural movement anymore - not like the body was moving on its own. It was like there was something trying to crawl out of it. 

As I watched, one of the black slugs pushed its way out of the ear. It got stuck part way and had to gnaw its way through the rest of the cartilage with razor sharp teeth like a leech. As it struggled out, the whole corpse shook like it was having a seizure. 

"It looks like you had it wrong," Entoine said in a sleepy voice. Did he just wake up? There's no way he could have slept through that. His face was still down next to the water though, and I couldn't get a clear look at him.

"What do you mean?"

"The floaters we found weren't the test subjects," he replied, finally pulling away from the water. His body was shivering slightly - somewhere between freezing to death and full body ecstasy. The tail end of a black slug had just finished slipping into his ear.  

"Of course they were. Why else would they be in the cells?" I asked. By the time the words were out of my mouth, I had already realized it. 

The bodies weren't the test subjects. The bodies were *hosts* to the test subjects. 

And they had already been free in the water since all those years ago when the [first floater broke free](http://www.facebook.com/sirtobiaswade).
