	<TEXT> Hey everyone! Looking forward to visiting this October! We realized we are in town for the Wild game on the 25th, and thought 'Perfect opportunity!". Unnnfortunately, we only realized this a week ago. Needless to say, second-hand becomes necessary. Looking on stubhub, the lowest I see is $130 each. Is this fairly average? Should I wait til I get into town? Looking forward to some NHL hockey!

(Alternatively, suggestions for good pubs to watch the game are also welcome!)

Thanks folks!  </TEXT>

(full disclosure edit: am not sure if duopoly is the right word, since brewers are allowed to sell in their own shop, and direct to customers. corrections welcome) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strange to lock the car door and have just your pack. Pretty well-prepared, and the weather co-operated marvellously, making some of our gear unnecessary. Low difficulty, but a good 'proof of concept', building our confidence that we can tackle longer/deeper backcountry trips.

I think the best part was waking up in the morning, with about 3 hours until the tour boats came to bring the daytrippers. We had the Flowerpots all to ourselves, snorkelling around the shore. I can't recommend this trip enough, and will probably be back next summer. </TEXT>

To acknowledge your knowledge. I got cut off by a cyclist yesterday and wouldn't have even been mad if he signalled at all. As another commentor said, maybe just for insurance purposes.

	<TEXT> Canadian here. Flew from Toronto for 2013. I bought a tent while over there and brought it back with me (lashed haphazardly to my backpack). Spent a week and a half in Belgium/London beforehand. Other than the obvious overpacking that was necessary, I wouldn't say there was any hardship. Packing smarter next time would eliminate some weight. Like the bare minimum of clothes, gear, etc. I left my passport and some other valuables in a lockbox in my hostel as well. Didn't want to bave that go missing.

The ticket buying was a damn hassle even then. Stayed up late, and the site continuously crashed. F5 key took a beating that night, but I secured tickets fornmyself and two friends. As others said, they sell out in moments, so be prepared to fill shit out in a hurry.

Also, the bus trip from London is shit, I would recommend finding another option if possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Many of the waterfront plans cant advance until the State of Washington finishes building a tunnel that will replace the viaduct"

This has been my biggest problem with demolishing the Gardiner. These guys have a plan to replace their Viaduct with something equivalent to what is there now. A six-lane boulevard is not the same as a highway.

I do love the plans for the waterfront. Very condo/chain restaurant free for Toronto though...

	<TEXT> I'm a little grumpy about the traffic, since I commute all over the gta for work with no real option to do otherwise. Hopefully shifting start times will help, but I expect mismanagement at every turn.

I'm a little bummed about actually getting to events. We have tickets for two, but the others seem kind of inaccessible, especially for sports I am not sure I will enjoy. "...but it's in Hamilton", "...but it's in Milton". Ordinarily, I would drive there, but I may be on a rampage by the end of the drive. I understand there are public transport options, but it just seems like a hassle. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had trouble reading for a while. Everything I picked up I would half-finish, and leave to gather dust on my shelf. I found the problem was I was trying to read 'important' books. Don't get me wrong, I loved reading Steinbeck and Verne and Achebe, but it felt forced. 

Then I read an article, probably from this sub, about reading what you love, without feeling bad you aren't reading what other people tell you to.

So I stopped slogging through Dostoevsky and Dickens and dove into Pratchett, Tolkien, Vonnegut, and branched out from there. Just read what you actually like to read. You'll find it comes easy. </TEXT>

But Rona Ambrose has also been Minister of the Environment, Minister of Intergovernmental Affairs, Minister of Western Economic Diversification, Minister of Public Works and Government Services Canada, Minister for Status of Women. So I guess learning about health and medicine would have taken a lot of time out of her schedule. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that the story could be a good one off movie. However, I think the world of the Silo has enough depth that a mini-series would not be stretching the material. The culture, the castes, the characters and the cycle of the Silo could definitely withstand the expansion from ~2 hours to 6-8, in my opinion.

I don't see anything about results, but considering the UK's program, at least, is only a few years old, there might not be any/enough data yet. 

Closer to home, apparently B.C. has a mandatory finance program called [Planning 10](http://www.investright.org/planning_10_finances/Planning_10__Finances.aspx) </TEXT>
