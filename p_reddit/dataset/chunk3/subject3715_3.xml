	<TEXT> Hey All, I finally released Hex FRVR 2.0.0 with lots and lots of updates. Most noticeably:

* The game now gets harder as you play for all of you hare amazing at puzzle games! 
* I also fixed it such that if you leave the game, it remembers where you stopped playing.

Lastly, the Android mobile version no longer sucks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Few tricks for getting better scores. 

* Do not keep the one tile. Rather always have multiple lines you can remove with a brick in your "deck". 
* Build the biggest combo you can around said brick. 
* Afterwards clean up the board and repeat.

How do you propose to make the game more fun? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a question that is going to be very diffrent from developer to developer, so don't accept my answer as a generic truth for all developers.

My games are fairly simple and is build mostly using technology that all devices already support (HTML5) so it's not that hard to make a windows port. Getting the technology in place and setting up store listings will likely take about 2 weeks.

However the problem is more about prioritisation. I am pretty much just me and there are higher opportunity things I could be working on. A simple example is that the Amazon Android App store is substantially bigger than the windows phone store. So it might make more sense to put my hours there.

When that is said, I am now hiring help on the platform side. Making it very likely that I will have WP support inside the next 2-3 months. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got interested in development at around 15 years old in QBasic by modifying the source code of the bundled examples such as snake. I had no reliable access to the internet back then, so ended up relying on library books to get me started.

While I later studied computer science, I had worked as a developer professionally for about 4 years. I wanted the education to give me a more theoretical background.

As for motivation, this one is hard. My biggest trick is to [release early](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95918196337/creating-a-minimum-viable-product) and iterate from there. Nothing better than people playing your game to keep you motivated.

However rather than a known word which is hard to trademark and control. I chose FRVR as it's guaranteed unique to me.

	<TEXT> For me, publishing a Facebook Web App is absolutely worth it. Is that what you are asking? The web installs organically drives mobile installs due to Facebook's cross promotion system.

As what I did to stack traffic, the short list is this: 

* I arranged several features with web pages hosting the web version. 
* I released the game as a new version on app stores (People the updates)
* I tried buying advertisement cheaply.
* I did this AMA

While no where as successful as I had hoped, I managed to peak at #7 in the us Board category yesterday. Over the next few days I will keep trying to see where I end up at :)

	<TEXT> Hey /r/AndroidGaming/ about a month ago I posted my game [Hex FRVR](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frvr.hex) to this great sub and got some amazing feedback (Among other that my game sucks when run on most android devices)

Since then, I have been hard at work improving the game, and I am finally happy with the result with the latest 2.0.0 release. So now I would love feedback on what to do next? Where would you like to see the game go?

You can also still play the [web version here](http://hex.frvr.com) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hardest part is making enough money to support yourself without having to do consultancy work (Major defocus).

My suggestion would be to start by participating in game jams to get your experience with making games at speed improved.

Hereafter get an exception to your competitive clause for the games you are making. Would be a really bad thing if the startup you are working for claims that they own the games you make.

Lastly, release early, collect feedback and most importantly experiment. [More on that here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95918196337/creating-a-minimum-viable-product)

PM me if you go down this route and have something ready to show and I will help you the game in front of an audience :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Time for math and pseudo code!

    var chance = currentScore * random(0.0 - 1.0)
        if(chance less_than 20000) tile = random_tile_including_the_one_tile
        else if(chance less_than 40000) tile = random_tile_not_including_the_one_tile
        else tile = random_tile_not_including_the_one_tile_and_including_the_evil_tile

In short the one tile is decreasingly likely to happen. At 30000 you are 33% less likely to get the one tile, at 40000 you are 50% less likely. (I believe, someone better at combinatorics correct me if I am wrong)

Honestly the best channel for you is going to depend a lot on what kind of game you are want to make. 

* Male oriented action game  Steam
* Female oriented puzzle game  Facebook
* Super niche indie games  Tumblr
* Anything  Apple and Google features if you can get them!

As for social channels, by far the biggest is Sina Weibo, which exploded organically by itself by the ability to share the game as a link. A distant second would be Reddit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got into game development at 15 in 1996 by modifying the game examples in QBasic (Yes I am that old!, 34). 

Professionally I got my first jobs related to games in 1999, where I was hired to write asynch multiplayer games in JavaScript. Back then we called it DHTML and IE4 was the newest coolest thing on the block. 

Honestly, not much has changed since then except hundreds of fancy buzzwords for JavaScript techniques and new API's to implement with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Short answer** Playing my own games (By a wide margin) - With the type of games I create it's very easy to get distracted.

**The answer I want** Polish. It's incredible how much the game experience can be improved by tweaking an animation, improving the mobile experience or tweaking graphics.

**The truth for FRVR** Engine work. To date, properly less than 30% of total work as been around actually doing games. The rest has been trying to get the games to run well on all devices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After a huge engineering effort, I gave up on the standard WebView integration on Android. If the native WebView does not support WebGL I initialise [CrossWalk](https://crosswalk-project.org) and run the game via that. (+20MB)

Likewise the app is currently a fat binary containing both a native ARM and Intel binary. 

Part of the 2.0.x updates is going to be to split it into two binaries and use a slimmer version of CrossWalk. The goal is to have a 15mb binary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With my previous game I did quite well by allowing 3rd party websites to embed the game. This is a strategy I have used for Hex FRVR as well. While really successful, Reddit simply dwarfed the traffic in volume.

If you do a Google Search for ("Hex FRVR")[https://www.google.com/search?q=%22hex+frvr%22] you will see thousands of sites embedding the game as an iFrame.

For longterm growth I rely very heavily on App Store and Google search optimisation. Try searching for Hex on either app store. If I did everything right my game should pop up on top :)

Even more long term is [brand building](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95104073432/on-building-a-strong-brand). Trying to make [FRVR](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/95775223752/frvr-my-new-game-company) a household name people will search for when wanting to play a quality game. Here I went so far as to register FRVR as a trademark in the games space. </TEXT>

With version 2.0.0 the difficulty now increases with your points. 

* Below 20k points everything is as usual
* Above 20k points the one tile starts becoming less likely
* Above 40k points a new evil red tile gets an increasing statistical chance of showing up.
* Above 80k the evil red tile is as likely as any other piece. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A) Probably not, it's been suggested and even tried. It's very diffrent game with rotation and thew the game balance completely off. While I am not against it, it would be a completely diffrent game.

B) For now I have limited myself to pieces that have 4 hexagons (Except the 1 dot piece). Not entirely sure I understand what you mean with 2-3 sided pieces. Can you draw a picture?

C) This is absolutely something I am considering in connecting with adding more game modes. The slow puzzle game as it exist right now is quite fun, but some people seem to really like a mechanic with progression alla Candy Crush. For something like that, bombs, obstructions, chain reactions, etc. would be natural. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a great question!

I have a custom HTML5 game engine written on-top of a heavily modified fork of [PixiJS](http://www.pixijs.com). 

For multiplatform support, I initially relied on [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) but quickly ran into technical limitions I was unable to solve myself. In a search for a solution I was lucky enough to bump into an amazing developer who was able to write my custom integrations for mobile from scratch. Much more info on that [here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/131920929742/replacing-cordova)

My biggest mistake so far in the project was to build my own game engine which I ended up totally scrapping for my current PixiJS based solution. Doing so was a [really hard choice](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/114408890172/pride-ignorance-and-lag-of-focus), but I am incredibly happy I did it today. </TEXT>

However, Hex FRVR was never intended to become a real game. Rather is was a test of my new abstracted engine technology. But while testing it was simply to fun to not release as a game. </TEXT>

Next up is skiing for 17 days in [Whistler](http://www.whistlerblackcomb.com) then 28 days of skiing in [Portes du Soleil](http://en.portesdusoleil.com) France.

Reddit was my lucky break. My latest game, [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com), blew up on [this /r/Gaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/3o43f8/what_started_out_as_a_test_ended_up_as_a_crazy/) thread which resulted in a [huge amount](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/131847710352/20-days-of-hex-frvr-distribution) of social traffic, especially on [Weibo](http://www.weibo.com) in China.

Today, I [released version 2.0.0](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/132595909292/hex-200) of [Hex FRVR](http://hex.frvr.com) on both web and mobile - [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id1036010745) - [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.frvr.hex)

[View the live stats for the release!](http://www.twitch.tv/cbenjaminsen) (Join the chat!)

~~3000~~ ~~3500~~ ~~4000~~ 4500 online!

From the first day, I wanted to be 100% transparent with the startup. Sharing numbers, ups   downs and tips on how others can do what I am doing.

To that end I write a very honest blog [here](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com). The [first post](http://blog.chrisbenjaminsen.com/post/94738198525/lets-make-a-hobby-startup), outlining the motivation for creating FRVR.

Next version, scheduled to be released next Thursday will also offer an in app payment to disable ads as an experiment.

Looks like my revenue is normalising around $650/day after having spiked at almost $1k/day.

Also stop writing reusable components, it's almost exclusively always a waste of time. At-least do not do so until you made 2-3 games so you have an idea what will actually be reused.

Again, and I cannot say this enough. Get the game live, get users on it, build a fanbase, get feedback, etc. This is 100x more likely to make this and future game a success than the imitate rewrite you are considering.

That thing was, and is still magic. After about 20kb of data send to the browser in a streaming document the browser will start executing individual script tags. This was how we managed to build something that was live back when. 

Even more fun you could inject http requests into the streaming document to make use of the same HTTP 1.1 connection making transport to the server as fast.

	<TEXT> Don't do tutorials, instead make something you currently think is outside your competencies. Then solve problems as they appear. You will learn much more this way than doing tutorials.

Personally I would not learn a library like jQuery or React to improve my JavaScript skills. They are almost languages on their own right and unless you expect to work in them later, you are simply confusing your JavaScript skills.

However, Node.js might be cool, allows you to do all kinds of cool things in JavaScript that is not related to the browser. I've personally used it to make build scripts, web scrapers, websites and much much more.

Personally I wrote the [ExtendJS](http://extendjs.org) library for myself, for when I need to do more structured projects. However I ended up not actually using it much, as it comes with a performance overhead which I do not want when making games. </TEXT>
