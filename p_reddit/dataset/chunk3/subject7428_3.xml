	<TEXT> You are most likely seeing these. You can tell by a little white band on each antennae. I was told by an exterminator that they are invasive and new in town; supposedly they are trying to get into your walls before it gets cold, then kind of stumble into your place throughout the winter. I only had to flush about one a week last year. Not terrible. </TEXT>
