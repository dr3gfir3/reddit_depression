	<TEXT> My 3 Most Anticipated Movies of 2017 is:
1. Dunkirk: A WW2 movie by my favorite director of all time, Christopher Nolan? Do I have to explain? And the cast looks amazing, and, unlike other people, I'm quite interested in Harry Styles in the movie, despite hating One Direction.
2. Baby Driver: Edgar Wright is my second favorite director, and my favorite comedy director, as I love his style of humor, but apparently this film is a bit more dramatic, which, although, I would love to see another comedy, I'm excited to see anything he does. Plus, Kevin Spacey plays a crime boss in an Edgar Wright movie. Do I need to say any more?
3. Blade Runner 2049: I love the original, love the director and the cinematographer, Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins, and I love the cast, and plus, this is the first hardcore sci-fi movie (Arrival has sci-fi elements, but it's not hardcore sci-fi) that could possibly win Best Picture, which is pretty exciting in itself.
There's my list.  </TEXT>
