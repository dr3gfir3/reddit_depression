	<TEXT> Yes, unfortunately :( I have a toooooooon of loose skin, just about everywhere! I'm hoping by continuing to exercise and tone that it will get better. However I'm pretty sure I'll be looking into several surgeries (arms, boobs, legs, tummy- the works!) probably in the next year.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wrote a whole post over on r/loseit if you wanna check that out! Basically I stopped eating fast food and most processed foods. I only drink water or herbal tea, and try to get in 3-5L a day. I calorie counted for a while, but now just do rough estimates in my head so I don't go crazy. I try to stay around 1500 a day. Also I got my mental health in check with a psychologist, which helped immensely. I try to eat mostly whole foods, but you can't say no to pizza ALL the time :) I also now work out 4-6 days a week, flipping between cardio, weights and yoga! 
  Thank you so much! I feel incredible honestly. It's amazing how eating well and exercising can make you feel strong and healthy!   </TEXT>
