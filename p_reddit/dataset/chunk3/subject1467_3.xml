	<TEXT> This is because these people are process oriented instead of goal oriented, they have their ideology and their playbook and just because it has never worked does not mean they should try something else. They are like those underwear gnomes except they are like: 

Step one - Inconvenience and anger thousands! 

Step two - ? 

Step three - Solve all societies problems!!

This idea of blocking traffic is old and does not work, they should just stay home and work through social media but their logical, rhetorical and social skills suck.

And most of them are in it at least partially for the emotional self gratification as their hobby. </TEXT>

Yeah, what it says is dash cams are pretty much required in Russia if you want car insurance, other countries, not so much. I am not discounting the whole macho culture of Russia as a factor and this could just be a traditional scam but the reason you see so many Russian vids is so dang many cameras.

	<TEXT> Right wing talk shows made Trumps rise much easier because they normalized the extremes of hyperbole and demonized the left to such an extent that some people are willing to accept that President Obama is a homosexual Muslim Kenyan. Once you get a group of people acting like that it makes it easier for a snake oil salesman to seem presidential.
