	<TEXT> Not to mention that it says that Rav Moshe supported the American revolution. 

In other words, armed revolution is fine so long as it's not based on some cockamamie political idea like communism or fascism.

There you have it. Halacha l'Moshe (Feinstein) m'Sinai. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems obvious to me, but Pirkei Avos 3:2 might make a good starting point.

Pirkei Avot isn't halacha, it's advice. This is saying that a government, any government, is preferable to complete anarchy. It's not saying that there's anything wrong with replacing one secular government with another through armed revolution. 

Rabbi Chanina, deputy to the kohanim, would say: Pray for the integrity of the government; for were it not for the fear of its authority, a man would swallow his neighbor alive.

It seems to me that one would need to show what heter a Jew has to engage with secular politics in the first place.

Why? If something isn't assur you don't need a heter for it.  </TEXT>

Also see here.

That's a specific case that had to do with what impact Napoleon would have on Jewish life. The issue was not whether armed revolution was allowed or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am. And I've known some pretty religious Conservative people. I already agreed that it's rare but it's not completely unknown. C requires a much higher level of observance than most O and even C people realize. C people not being more observant is a failure of their educational and social system. It's not like Reform were you literally have the option to do whatever you want. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am Orthodox. I wouldn't recognize a Conservative conversion, which is why I said he could later convert Orthodox. 

Though there was a time when C conversions were recognized. My understanding is that because back in the day, some C rabbis were actually O rabbis. So that means that it's not a C convert who's necessarily the problem, but the rabbis.  </TEXT>

Not at all. It's not uncommon. Maybe not necessarily for this reason but it is absolutely done as people who convert Conservative and find that they are more religiously to the right.

I think I even read a memoir about this. I'll see if I can remember what it was.  </TEXT>

I'm not opposed to long movies - I recently saw Bollywood movie 3 Idiots, and for such a lightweight movie it was surprisingly long (2 hours and 51 minutes) but I was never bored because it moved along at a nice brisk pace. </TEXT>
