	<TEXT> I really like the idea! If it were made into an actual card, I imagine it would be a nightmare to balance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great idea! Probably needs to have an extra stat to see play or change it thematically so it's a beast? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone have any ideas or decklists that make the card "Holy Mage" work? It's the 3pp 1/2 with Ambush that gains +1/+1 each time a friendly countdown amulet comes into play. I feel like this card may just need a slight buff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I spent money on crystals because the daily deals on packs made it great value. To echo the sentiments of others, the fact that the game doesn't feel like it's trying to pressure me to spend money, I want to support the developers for making it that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the idea! Perhaps the card should cost a little more since the new hero power is, in many ways, an upgrade. It reminds me of mortal coil. </TEXT>
