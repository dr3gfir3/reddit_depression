	<TEXT> This is so true!
I am a young kid at age 18, but when I fist saw this sub, I was still in a relationship. And I really didnt like this sub. Then. BAM. She cheated on me. (I broke up) Then one night, I came over this sub again, and wow. I was amazed.

Thank you RP, I have my cheating ex girl around my littlefinger now, and my life is actually really good now.

Sounds stupid, but it is because of this sub that my life is so good now! </TEXT>
