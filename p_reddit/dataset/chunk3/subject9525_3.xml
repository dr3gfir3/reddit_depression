	<TEXT> I started a game on EU W. Usually I get around 120-130 ms (which is pretty good considering I live in India). Today, it's started off with 140 ms. But it was still fine, no lag. 
After a while the ping climbed to 2.5k. At one point it was actually 9k.
Volvo pls.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taking inspiration from the legend of Hercules, the set would contain a shoulder slot headgear+cape skin of the Nemean Lion and a custom boar making it look wilder and naming it after the Erymanthian Boar, replace the axes with maces (a mace is Hercules' weapon). I don't know anyone who could design such a set, so reddit. Is it a good idea?  </TEXT>
