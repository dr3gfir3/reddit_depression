	<TEXT> Hmm, good thoughts there.
That concept may also flow along with parellels between OA and Steve:
OA is uncomfortable with people touching her and so is Steve is too, in the way of being vulnerable or being rejected. 
Referring to when he punched a hole in the wall in the 1st episode after he has sex with that girl and she said  "This is not a thing" like rejecting him. He felt vulnerable and punched a hole.

	<TEXT> What if the place Homer is trying to escape is a real life Psychiatric Hospital? With the white walls and people trying to catch him and them telling him he isn't who he says, seems like maybe he's a mental patient. This could also explain where OA wakes up in the very last shot of the last scene. She's sitting in a bed with white walls and says Homer. Maybe they're both psyche patients and the fish tank is an inspiration turning into over exaggeration of being captive. Idk, just thoughts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if someones covered this, but haven't seen it mentioned. Why did Steve stab OA in the leg with a pencil? She's trying to hug and comfort him (even though she doesn't like people touching her) and he stabs her. What's up with that? She later has to remove the lead from her leg. Thoughts? </TEXT>
