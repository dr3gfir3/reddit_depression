	<TEXT> Get a lawyer... Insurance companies will go to great lengths to shaft you and keep things out of court.

My little brother got bit in the face by a dog when he was like 13. We didnt want the guy to turn it in but he did it anyway. His homeowner's insurance put a letter in the mail the very next day offering 28,000 over 3 installments (18, 21, and 25 years old)  because if they didn't put the matter to rest, he could have sued them once he turned 18 or if any vision problems ever occurred with the eye that was damaged. "He" accepted though because that wasn't a bad deal for as much damage as he took (a few stitches in his eyelid and a few in his lip.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. It's a weird concept but in my opinion, gay marriage is a much simpler "issue" than racial, cultural, foreign, or economic problems. Gay marriage isn't even in the same league as those other issues therefore it's easier to have an opinion on and discuss. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This logic could also be used to argue in favor of gay marriage for the simple fact that the government shouldn't be involved in evolutionary matters. If homosexuality is a genetic mutation, it is destroying itself by not necessarily reproducing every time it's present. Whereas before when homosexuality was kept quiet, a lot more of them reproduced out of fear of being discovered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sounds like you're doing it right.  Having your life in order is a huge plus. Be supportive but not overly in your face supportive.

The girl I've been seeing told me up front that she wants to know she'll be ok on her own before jumping into anything.  Her boyfriend just threw her and her 2 y/o out a few months ago leaving her with nothing.  She never wants to be in the position of having nothing ever again. I respect that.  As for the kid, he's awesome. He likes me (which is weird because kids usually hate me), which I KNOW has been a huge help.  She usually tries to hang out while he's with his dad so we have more time to talk but I've also joined them at the park a few times and made sure she knew he was welcome any time we've had plans or suggested staying in if she didn't want to take him out. </TEXT>

He was joking back and forth with the operator because this was the 3+ time we rode the coaster that day.  The operator forgot to check our bar which I had noticed right as we were taking off but didn't think anything of it.  We got to the highest drop and my cousin said "Put your hands up in the air! It's so much more fun!"  So I began to put my hands up, and all in slow motion...

 The bar came up. I saw him lift out of the seat. I threw my right arm across his legs and wedged my legs against the front of the cart. I pushed him back down into the seat with my right arm and pulled the bar down with my left. </TEXT>

We were both bored and apparently she found out that I'd had a crush on her in school so she started chatting me up and eventually invited me over specifically for sex.  We fucked for a little over an hour. I give total credit to the fact that I've jerked it 1-3 times a day since I was a teenager.  She was very experienced... for lack of a better word.  She called me every weekend for a few months trying to get me to visit her at college, even after she got a boyfriend.  We stopped talking after I kept turning her down because I didn't want to drive a 3 hour round trip for sex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nah. Most "embarrassing" mishaps are cute.  If it is by chance a REALLY disgusting mishap, I would probably just not bring it up again. I definitely wouldn't stop talking to her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's her deal... 

Same thing (sort of) happened to me.  Except I wasn't drinking, I was just babysitting her stupid ass.  But she kept taking her clothes off and trying to go outside because she needed more crackers or a drink. I went and got them for her. She ended up getting sick, I rubbed her back and talked to her...

Cut to the morning

We had both fallen asleep inside the camper we were staying in. She woke up before me and was outside telling everyone I was trying to have sex with her. I was PISSED.  I can't even imagine what kind of shitstorm would have come if I had been drunk too.

**EDIT:** She has since proven that she's bat shit crazy </TEXT>
