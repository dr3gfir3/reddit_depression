	<TEXT> The ending of The Ringed City DLC is a metaphor for the player giving the game back to FromSoft so they can move on and make a new game. The player gives the Blood of the Dark Soul (the game / The Dark Souls franchise), to the Painting Woman (FromSoft / the developer), so she can paint a new world (make a new game). 

The Painted World of Ariamis (from Dark Souls 1) was actually a demo / proof of concept for the original Dark Souls. Painted Worlds (Ariamis and Ariandel) are metaphors for video games. The painter (game developer) paints a world (makes a game) in which others (players) can enter and experience that which the painter created. </TEXT>
