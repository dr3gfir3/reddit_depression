	<TEXT> Most comments have covered it. But one of the most important aspects is to be able to talk to customers that have never touched a computer and explain, either the problem. Or answer any question they might have without giving them more questions. Also dont be afraid to say "sorry I dont know how to solve this problem. I Will leave you for now and come back to you with a viable solution" people rather Wait for a phonecall than listen to you googling. Atleast most people. 

Good luck in the world of IT. After a while you'll be impressed that some people know how to start a car.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What? Even with a license? 

I'm a hunter and I've gone through tests and expenses to be able to own a Gun. Then again im from Sweden where the Gun-laws are very strict and working well. Compared to places such as the US. 

But if you have an Idea how to make Gun ownership illegal yet i'm able to Hunt with a Gun, im more than intreuged to hear it. 

Sorry for shit spelling, #swedishautocorrectproblems </TEXT>
