1) How old is sis and is she on Reddit?  2) When did you and her start to have romantic feelings for one another? 
3) When did you go all the way? 
4) Does she use birth control and/or do you use a condom?

	<TEXT> But you probably wouldn't have roads in drivable conditions to put the trucks on to. Lower taxes=less revenue for road repairs. Eventually, you might have to spend more money to get the trucks fixed. Smooth roads means more money in your pocket.  </TEXT>
