We are still good friends and she really likes the job. There will always be a place for them. However it certainly is a shrinking market, and even with stellar references, and credentials she has struggled to find work now. As time goes by technology will displace many people in the field, and she will be the first to admit that it may not have been the wisest move for stability. 

As far as professional jobs go, it is quite a risk to pour that much time, and money into a wildly shifting career.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It depends. There are some really flavorful salads out there, but dry lettuce with a little chicken, and no spices makes for a pretty sad lunch.

Today I was near Ala Moana, so I ran into foodland. Their new bar is pretty amazing. While smaller in size, I actually prefer it to whole foods. I got a nice big salad with tons of tasty ingredients, and some grilled plantains from the hot bar.

Ran me $13.50 but it was good, and I don't feel weighed down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not native but long time resident. I am lucky enough to travel often, but I still certainly get rock fever(feeling of claustrophobia). 

The most lonely part of living in Hawaii is the constant turnover of friends. This place chews up, and spits people out do to the cost of living. I am constantly saying good bye to great friends, and at the moment I just said goodbye to my BFF bros within the past 5 months. 

It's really hard to get the energy to invest more time in people when you know that eventually they will be leaving.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if you are relatively affluent it is still hard to eat healthy in Hawaii. In the supermarket often produce can run over $3 a pound. I buy it, but my food bill is a huge part of my budget, and just a simple salad at home can run me $6-7. 

My hardest time is eating on the run, it is just straight up hard to find places that sell healthy food. The vast majority or restaurants sell deep fried, starchy belly bombs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is what everyone conveniently forgets. Very eloquently put. I love Bernie and voted for him, but the truth is that his stances never got the opposition of the GOP. For every reason that progressives loved him, he would have been crucified in a general election. 

Also remember that his platform was very 2 dimensional. While his one issue that he ran on certainly would have had traction with a lot of people, when asked to state his position on a broader range of issues he would have landed very at odds with a lot of social conservatives, and even moderates.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know this is hard to stomache, but of course they were against him. Despite any 20/20 revisionist version of history, America would not elect a admitted agnostic socialist. It was Clintons race to lose, and she sure delivered with her robotic persona, and hunkering down when she should have been out in front of all the fires.

However the smart money was still on her. If I was in their position I too would have been hoping she won. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FYI their router is shit, don't use it. If you got the TV bundle I recommend you set up a switch from their optical modem. You run one port to the HT box, and one to your personal router.

I had to do this to solve some weird issues I was having, and to make port forwarding easier for my security system. 

Overall though 0 complaints about the service, and they have been great about letting me jump to new promotions as the old ones expire. I need to call them soon, but now they are doing for life 300 mbps with basic TV for $50 which is unbeatable. </TEXT>
