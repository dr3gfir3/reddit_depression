	<TEXT> Theres loads.  Wedlockes, like you said, or Wonderlockes, Monolockes (one type only) Or cagelockes sound awesome too, where two people play at the same time and after every gym, they each choose a pokemon to fight and the loser dies. Post elite four, the whole teams fight and the winner passes the cagelocke.

Theres honestly all kinds out there. I even made my own variant that requires multiple games. If nothing else create one :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are mods you can emulate, I've heard of ones like Storm Silver before... apparently some roms have truly competitive based teams with advantageous IV/EV spreads in them, sounds banaynays.

A nuzlocke isn't a specific game, its a set of rules the player decides to use themselves. Totally subjective.

The core rules are:

 once it faints, its dead. Box it permanently or release.

 only one pokemon per route can be caught

 Nickname your pokemon (optional really but strongly recommended, and time honored tradition)

All the info you need:

http://nuzlocke.wikia.com/wiki/The_Nuzlocke_Challenge_Wiki

The idea is to get extremely attached to your pokemon, give them nicknames and all your love and soul, and listen to the small, timid sound of your heart being crushed into tiny little pieces as Whitneys Miltank slowly suffocates your favorite buddy under a giant pile of rollouts.

Also starting over is recommended, keeps the run honest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah after reading these I have to agree, the anime is still great, but still beaten by the manga in both narrative/imagery. Mikami's discovery in the manga actually showed Nears entire thought process, and the anime sort of just went 'BAM it's him'.

Lights death was so much better too. Understandably they probably thought the anime audience would be slightly younger, so they decided he would die with a little more dignity. But I prefer the much more tormented death in the manga, with Ryuk finally taking his dues on the spot, and Light having 40 seconds to come to terms and feel the terror of the death note for himself, finally equal to all those he 'righteously' murdered.

The real thing that blows my mind though is the epilogue. Matsudas theory gave me so much more appreciation for the finale, and I'm fully invested in it at this point. It even plausibly explains how Mikami could've possibly overlooked the potential of checking his notes authenticity. </TEXT>
