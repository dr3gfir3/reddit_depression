	<TEXT> Yes and because when you initially pop revenge you knock down opponents that hit you. The more often you can get revenge and the more often you can threaten with the knock down the better. </TEXT>

I run a revenge build conq.

I do not get revenge quickly in a 1v1 at all.

	<TEXT> When does this happen? Unless one just came from being outnumbered and is bordering revenge. I'm a 108 conq full revenge build and my revenge does not build as quickly as this. Do certain characters gain revenge faster by design? If so maybe those characters need to be looked at and not revenge itself. As a conqueror I do not ever just fly into revenge unless I'm outnumbered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes the kinda "scrub" this game doesn't need lol I'm exactly what this game needs since the competitive "pro" side is so small and insignificant. Players like myself make up the bulk of the games player base and once you remove the fun factor from it we will leave and the game will die.

Theres way too much of this esports obsession going on with multiplayer games now a days. People forget the fact that not everyone wants a super serious competition game. Sometimes we enjoy a more casual fun game. Not everything needs to meet your pro level standards lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is. But it does not proc as easy as people make it out to be. I have a 108 revenge build conq and unless I'm fighting an idiot I won't get my revenge. And if I'm fighting an idiot and I do, it's not that quick of a gain anyways, plus it's an idiot so who cares. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly lol I don't understand people's obsession with a bland game with perfect balance lol so what if you get two shot by someone with revenge. That's the whole POINT. Instead of getting knocked down by someone with revenge let them use it and back away and pick your shows and GB and play defensively until it runs out and that's it. Me and my friends always destroy people with revenge, yes we are 108s with high gear but getting there isn't that hard lol people just like to complain about anything now a days and don't like fun. They rather have a super esports serious game rather than an actual fun and exciting game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's a high gear character though... If you had high gear as well he would've most likely been dead by that time with the fact you would he doing more damage. It's a gear based mode and high gear end game character SHOULD have a clear advantage over you IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK but isn't that the point lol he had a revenge already so obviously in a 1v1 he's gonna demolish that guy. It's made to help you win 4v1 so imagine 1v1. Idk. Yes it is powerful but I don't see why it should be nerfed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Without revenge we cannot win 1v4 scenarios and honestly that is some of the most fun and adrenaline filled moments I have in this game. People get annoyed by getting ganged up on but then complain about the one thing that helps you fight off ganks and feel like a super bad ass. I don't understand lol

What would the solution be? How much would or should revenge be nerfed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Depends on the player for example as conqueror, assuming I do not pause but instead attack immediately, I can land a guaranteed heavy if I attack to your left or right, but if I chose to attack high you can block it because that animation is slightly slower than the others giving you enough time to block. </TEXT>
