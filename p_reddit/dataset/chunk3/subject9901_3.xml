	<TEXT> You're right.  Every situation has the potential.... You have to have this thought in your head no matter what call you're going to, and you will be ready when you don't have time to think.  This is the reason so many officers come off as "assholes."  This is the reason so many citizens who don't have a clue think cops have no business asking them to take their hands out of pockets, stop moving, sit down, or do any of another list of things to remain in control as much as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I ran warrants for a year. No one ever fought. I got into it wanting action, I was sorely disappointed

When the entire warrant unit shows up, people either run or give up.  Not a lot of people actually fight in that situation.  They realize their day has come.

Finding someone on the street who's got a warrant is a whole different situation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Domestic violence. Hands down. Everytime we had one wed roll two just because of how often you end up getting physical.
 When people are mad or stupid enough to hurt and attack their own family, what's a little violence against police.


This.  So important.  Our department policy (approx 600-700 sworn), is to always have at least 2 responding officers.  We don't have a policy yet mandating 2 officers (or more) actually show up, so as long as the dispatch logs show two responding you're within policy.

The two times I got there before my partner and did not wait resulted in me getting into physical fights with intoxicated people.  More officers are injured or killed responding to DV calls than other call types.

	<TEXT>  Just because I know and understand my sovereign rights granted to me under the Articles of Confederation doesn't mean you need to be hostile :/

There are no sovereign rights granted to you under the Articles of Confederation.  At least, not any more.  The United States Constitution replaced the Articles of Confederation when it was fully ratified on March 4, 1789.

Edit:

Also, if you insist on implying you have said outdated rights, they would only apply if you were in the following states which are listed in the title/documents at the time they were published and ratified: New Hampshires, Massachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Providence Plantations, Connecticut, New York, Jew Jersey, Pennslyvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A t-score is used in California by the Police Officer Standards and Training (CA-POST), and can be used in lieu of many agencies in-house written tests.

I've sat on oral boards for interviews/applicants multiple times.  From my experience, you need to balance high test scores (book knowledge) with common sense/street knowledge/life experience.  No one wants a brainy cop who can't talk to people on the street, or who lacks common sense.

Life experience can only be learned through making mistakes, whether they're yours or someone else's that you learned from doesn't matter as much as the fact you learned something and can explain what you've learned.  

Some agencies/departments like to see some sort of volunteer service, as that's one of the cornerstones of all law enforcement agencies.  I have seen a large shift in many law enforcement agencies near me.  Many of them are really revamping and embracing the "community policing" model.  This means they're looking more for community service based models of service, as opposed to proactive/aggressive street level enforcement.

If you want to stand out, make sure you know how you've already helped your community and those around you, as opposed to just helping yourself.  Going to college is great, but make sure you know how to explain how that helps you help others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  but a lot of "worried well" people with mild anxiety or depression really need friends and lifestyle changes more than anything else. 

This is super important, and often overlooked.  This goes to a bigger picture that shows the stigma attached to mental health.  Also, a lot of people who have mental health issues/problems/illnesses want to find someone/something to blame the problem on, and refuse to accept any responsibility themselves.  They refuse to change their lifestyle or habits (i.e. withdrawing/secluding, alcohol consumption, etc) which exacerbate the problems.

A therapist is only meant to be a temporary solution. 

True.  Too many people want to avoid any sort of therapy because they think they'll be doing it for the rest of their lives.  This leads me to the next part:

The rest of society has to be supportive to welcome them back to normality after they're done with therapy/treatment and the quick fix attitude of our culture is not helpful.

Speaking from the perspective of a North American male adult, our culture is increasingly more fragmented and solitary.  We no longer know our neighbors, and they no longer know us.  We stick to ourselves at work, and avoid being close to too many people.  We make ourselves too busy to know anything about anyone else.

We also are ourselves afraid of being labeled as a mental health "basket case," and avoid addressing the problem because we can then pretend it doesn't exist.

Also, people are more and more unwilling and/or unable to have difficult conversations.  We're no longer comfortable with our feelings and emotions.  We don't want to hear other people's problems because they remind us of our own.  The old family/social structure where neighbors helped neighbors is gone.  We're more and more becoming a "video game/instant gratification" society that's used to pushing a reset button (or going to a game completely) when things don't work out.

	<TEXT> Being able to step back and realize when you're not safe for yourself, or others, is tough.  From my personal experience, a lot of this *may* stem from Critical Incident Stress/Cumulative Stress/Post Traumatic Stress.  I highly recommend a book titled, "Emotional Survival for Law Enforcement" by Dr. Kevin Gilmartin.  Even if you go into the CSI thing, this will help out, and the first part of my post still applies.

LEOs, first responders, paramedics, EMTs, fire, dispatchers, etc all face a unique set of stress and hypervigilance the rest of the world will never know.  Make sure you take time to take care of yourself, or you may find yourself in a similar spot even after you go into the CSI gig. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Part of it is that I didn't make things very easy for her. I reacted badly to some things and established some patterns that made it all the more difficult, and I kept beating around the bush myself, and for those facts, I blame myself. If I'd been more patient and more understanding, if I'd been better, maybe things would be different. 

You can't change the past.  Only learn from it.  Trust me, even if you had been more patient or understanding, it doesn't sound as though she was any of those things.   You can't be the only person in a relationship who's working on growing or bettering themselves.   Otherwise you'll quickly become bitter and resentful. 

Trust me.   I've been on both sides of that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> but she was just never willing to open up to me. she ghosted instead of giving me a real answer.... I hadn't realized how utterly conflict-averse she was, but there seem to have been some daddy-issues in there that I had never picked up on.

Ok. So she's avoiding problems in order to remain comfortable.  She has daddy issues, she left without telling you anything... After seeing this, and realizing these were the reasons your relationship ended, you seriously still think things are your fault? 

It sucks things didn't work out.  I get it.   I've been through my share of breakups, getting dumped, etc. It's never easy.   But, how would things be now if you stayed together for years?  Had kids, a house, shared property that has to be fought over in court? 

Either way, shit, I miss her, but I know she's never speaking to me again. I feel like shit for fucking things up. 

Again, we all know breakups are hard.  But the things that make them hard is no matter how shitty things were, you had some good times.   Remember what you liked, and didn't like.  The next round will be better, you'll be stronger, and you won't let yourself get walked all over.

	<TEXT> When most people think of "resisting arrest" charges, the laws are typically written to include resisting, obstructing, or delaying law enforcement officers engaged in performance of lawful duties.

The crime title is often shortened to make it easier to write, but includes more than simply resisting arrest. 

Read california penal code 148 for more information.

US Supreme Court law says police officers can use "objectively reasonable force" in different situations.   One of them being to overcome resistance to lawful authority. 

If a cop asks or tells you to move/come with them, and you refuse they can legally grab you.   If you pull away, you are now resisting.**  More force can reasonably be applied.  But only what's reasonable to another officer with similar training and experience, and only basing decisions on facts known to the officer at the time. 

Granted, cops can't just take off and club people like baby seals, but any new level of resistance can legally justify new higher/increased levels of force used.  

** I understand the laws of arrest... just for the sake of this argument let's assume the officer has the authority to ask you to come with them or force you to do should you refuse. 

Yes, technically you can resist unlawful actions by law enforcement.   BUT most people are not legally trained to know whether they can legally refuse or not, and that's best left determined in court to avoid unnecessary physical or lethal situations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You would have to invite them in."

No.  Not necessarily true.  If they have (or think they have) exigent circumstances, they can go in with or without consent or a warrant. 

If they were wrong, whatever they may have found/seen in plain view gets suppressed/thrown out of court.  Of course, this doesn't give them the right to look through anything, or in places a human person/body might *not* reasonably be found.
