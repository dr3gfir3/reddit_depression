	<TEXT> I was in London 2014 and they we were walking by the Tower of London and they planted a big field of  red roses in memory of The Great War, this picture reminds me of this. Also the Great War Museum is great! (No pun intended) and I've bought a book there with some trench stories about WW1 and they are party very terrifying.

But the important question: Can one buy this and where could one buy this?

	<TEXT> I hope I don't bother you with this question, but I hope you answer it anyways. I am graduating from high school next year and I am learning Java in school and I really love programming but I always feel like I don't know where to start. I know a fair bit about the language now and we'll be doing GUIs in a few months and it is something I could see myself doing but I often feel like I won't get a job as a programmer as I don't sit at the PC all day coding. I like to do small stuff here and there but when I come home from school I often feel like shit and just want to rest so here is my question in short:

Do I need to spend all my day learning programming or how much time would you recommend to spend learning?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I got a few things this guy I know said:

* "America had nukes in 1919." to which I replied "No they didn't have nukes nukes, they were invented towards the end of WW2" and he answered "It's america you never know."

* (About a religion exam) "I can't even know this, I have been in catholic class for 10 years, you've been in evangelical you have to know all this." //He thinks protestantism is a whole different religion. 

* "Ohh I don't know if I am able to come to your LAN party because my PC is so valuable. I can join you online from my house though." (That is not what a LAN is for...)

Edit: a word

	<TEXT> I am sorry but I have to stop you right there. I am not sure what part of Germany you are from, that might be the reason for our different experiences, but Halloween is really taking off in Germany. Seeing you speak of St. Martins day I guess you are from Bavaria, but I am not sure. 

I live in North-Rhine Westphalia and kids dress up each year and go around collecting sweets and more than 5% of houses give out sweets. I used to live in a small village, we moved to a rural area 6km away from the city, and I used to go trick or treating every year with friends and we got a lot of sweets. 

On the other hand I have never really experienced St. Martins day. Well meaning I have never given out candy to kids on St. Martins day. They all go by with their lanterns singing songs (mostly kindergarten kids) but never try to get candy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am living in Western Germany (North Rhine-Westphalia) and my grandparents are living about 15km away from me in a city called 'Burgsteinfurt' and although most of the city is partly modern today there is still the old part of the city with the houses from the middle ages. Even the streets in that part are mostly old and some of them are very narrow with the houses being closely side by side. Not sure if you are interested but a 'Furt' is the part of a river that you can cross by foot or in a vehicle. I don't know the English word for the other readers in here though.   </TEXT>

From what I've read they copied the parts you described 1:1. I still remember the mortars being so damn loud. We were about 100 people or more and everybody was terrified of the loud mortar sound and now I imagine that about ten times louder and with real consequences... war is hell.  </TEXT>
