	<TEXT> **RAM:** I thought that 16GB would enough.  Do you think having 32GB is necessary?

**Storage:** I will probably be working on one project at a time.  1TB may be enough for my OS+Apps+Current projects, but I can't really speak for future projects.  I edit a lot of documentaries that have a lot of huge files during the interviews.  I was actually considering buying 3 2TBs and setting up a RAID 5.

**PSU:** According to pcpartpicker, my build would be using 336W.  a 430W PSU will be enough?  I'm not too experienced so I'm not exactly sure if 600W is overkill or if it's necessary.

**Optical:** I haven't really had to burn any blu-rays, but we are about to submit our most recent doc to film festivals and I know that some festivals require a blu-ray submission.  I should probably buy a blu-ray burner.  Thanks.

**Monitor:** Do you know of any good 4k IPS that aren't too expensive?  I was looking at this one: [Dell P2415Q](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-Monitor-P2415Q-24-Inch-LED-Lit/dp/B00PC9HFNY/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1439237490 sr=8-1 keywords=Dell+P2415Q)
I eventually want to have dual monitors.  When I have more money to spend I was thinking about adding on another one of these.   </TEXT>

**GPU**

As of right now, I'm not going to be color grading much 4k footage anytime soon.  I usually handle Canon DSLR and occasionally BMPCC footage.  I figured that when the time comes that I find myself editing a lot of 4k, I could upgrade my GPU.  Is the 750 TI enough for what I'm doing now?

**RAID and HDDs**

I would want to set up RAID 1 with the two 3TB HDDs.  I'm also considering buying 3 2TB HDDs instead and using RAID 5.  I'm a little confused however.  If I used RAID 5 with the three 2TB HDDs, how much storage space would I have? 2TB or 4TB?  If I'm working on one project at a time, I think 2TB will probably be enough.  I'll have to think about this one a bit more before I order anything.

As for the 4TB external, I was planning on using it for my backup and other random files.  Maybe it's not necessary to have the 4TB external.  

**Internal vs. External**

What are the pros and cons of having either?  Not really sure if there's a big difference between the two. </TEXT>

Editing video files using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Avid Media Composer, Davinci Resolve.  Needs to be able to contain large quantities of video files.  

No gaming.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$2000 is maximum, but lower is preferred.

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp) Don't ask to be spoonfed a build (read the rules!)**.

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

I was thinking about installing the OS and apps on the 250gb SSD and use the HDDs to hold the large video files while I'm editing. 

Should I run a RAID setup?  If so, which one would be best? or perhaps you know of a more efficient/safer method.  Please let me know!

I will not be doing any kind of 3D graphics or anything like that. </TEXT>

Not going to use for gaming.  But I've been considering buying Battlefront for my PC.  How much more will I need to spend on my GPU if I plan on playing Battlefront? If I don't play any games though, will the 750 ti be enough?

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

$2000

	<TEXT> Do I need to spend that much on a GPU? I've been reading about editing rigs and people are saying to focus mainly on the CPU, RAM, and quick storage. Not exactly sure though, so let me know!

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply! 

Storage: Do you think I could get by with a 120gb SSD for OS and Apps? Or will I need 250gbs

GPU: I won't be gaming at all. Based on your reply, I'm assuming that video editing isn't too dependent on a good GPU? Why is that?

OS: Will Premiere Pro and other programs work correctly in Win10? I'm afraid of running into all these problem with the new OSs and I feel like I'd rather just play it safe with Windows 7. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Editing PC for under $2000 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

I'll be editing video files using Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Photoshop, Lightroom, and Davinci Resolve.  Currently I'm filming with a Canon 60D, but I'll be upgrading soon and might possibly be working with larger files, like 4k.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

$2000

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

I'm planning on buying the PC in about a month (4th of July) so I can take advantage of a sale hopefully.

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc)** 

Tower/OS/Monitor

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

California, USA.  No, I don't have access to a microcenter location.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

I'll be reusing a keyboard and mouse. Keyboard: Logitech S510. Mouse: Microsoft Arc Touch Mouse

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

I don't know. Will this be necessary for me? If anything, I can get into it down the line.

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

I was thinking maybe a 250gb SSD for my OS/Apps, and a 250gb or 500gb SSD as a scratch disk for projects and then a large HDD for long term storage.  

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

I just want a basic looking case with good airflow.  Nothing fancy.  

**Do you need a copy of Windows 7 or 8.1 included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference for one or the other?**

I need Windows 7. 

**Extra info or particulars:**

For now, I'm okay with only having one monitor to keep costs down, but eventually I'll want to have a dual monitor set up.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly, I don't know much about what I need or what parts I really need to put my money into since it's my first time building a pc.  If you guys could help me out, that would be awesome! 
So I need a pc that will be able to run Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects smoothly while handling large video files.  I'll eventually be working with 4k video files, so having tons of storage is a must.  I'm also considering having dual monitors.  I'm willing to spend up to $2000, is that enough? 

Also, I'm not in a huge rush to put it together.  What times of the year have the biggest sales? Sorry if these are dumb questions, I just don't have much experience and I'm looking to learn more! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best cheap on-camera shotgun to upgrade from built-in mic? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-18 04:57:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been debating on buying a little on-camera shotgun for my Canon 60D (with magic lantern).  I shoot a lot of skateboarding and I'm just looking for something cheap to upgrade from the built-in mic.  I have a Rode NTG-2/Tascam DR-60D set up for other gigs, but it's just not ideal for when I shoot skating.  

So far, I've been looking at either the Rode Videomic or Sennheiser MKE400.  What do you guys recommend? Or are there other mics for around the same price that are better?

Someone on my local craigslist is selling the MKE400 for $75.  Is it worth it? </TEXT>
