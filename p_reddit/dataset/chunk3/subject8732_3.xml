	<TEXT> Hello, fellow book-lovers. I am from Russia, although I am not living there now. I thought of the following - there are huge number of modern Russian authors - Prilepin, Sorokin, Pelevin, Ulitskaya, Max Frei and many many more - almost or totally unknown in the English-speaking countries. I can do the translation of some of these novels for you (my first degree is translation and interpretation) or find already existing translations.

What do you think of this idea? Please let me know your opinions in the comment section.

P.S. Also I noticed the absence of Russian section in the Literature of the world feature. I can contribute there as well. </TEXT>
