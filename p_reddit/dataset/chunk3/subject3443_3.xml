Especially guys being down 0-2, they would go for the TKO.

	<TEXT> It is a stratocaster from 99. I bought it second hand. The owner said that the frets were recently dressed, and they look alright.

it doesn't buzzes when played open, or the first fret, from the the 2nd on, it buzzes. It only happens on this string (it is bottom E, not e). if I press the fret very hard the buzzing kind of dissapears, so I don't know if it is my problem or the guitar's problem.

I've tried raising the action, but it doesn't seem to be a difference. The neck doesn't really look convex or hump. More like straight, a bit concave, very slightly.

I don't know if this buzzing is normal or not. or how I can solve it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I just watched TUF21, and I love it. My favourite season. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-15 14:04:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> TUF21 receives near 0 love here when people asks about their favourite TUF seasons. I think TUF21 was one of the best so far, and it did something that people always asks for: trying something new.

- The idea of gym vs gym was amazing. It gives a real meaning to teams. I also liked the point systems. Before this, TUF fighters only fought for themselves, and the teams were kind of meaningless. This meant that if you didn't like the fighters in one episode, you did not really care. In this case, you support one gym or the other, so all the fights are important.

- Having the 2 owners as leads except of UFC fighters was refreshing. Most UFC fighters are kind of boring, they just give cliche speeches, and most of them doesn't really care. The owners cared 100% about their fighters, because they were fighting for their gyms. Also, seeing all the strategy they would do to choose the matchups was amazing.

- I liked the idea of choosing blindly your fighter, instead of the winning team choosing the fight.

- Fights in their gyms were way more exciting than in the UFC Las Vegas gym. The environment during the fights was amazing, 10/10.

- The celebrations or sadness after the fights were real. In normal TUF fights the winner gets a high five, and the loser just some random words from a team mate who doesn't really care.

- By putting in more strategic chat about the fights they put in more good conent, and less house drama content. I think this season is probably the one with the less drama content, and that was good.

- Half of the fights were really good. The last one was one of the best TUF fights ever. The previous one, the biggest comeback I have ever seen, from a near TKO to a choke in 10 seconds.

- You get to see more of a real MMA gym, instead of the UFC Las Vegas gym.

I hope they do more seasons like this. I'd love to see more gyms vs gyms fights. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a stratocaster with 2 singles and a twin blade. I only get noise in positions 3 and 5, as expected. Something that annoys me is that apart from the usual hum I get a lot of noise from the computer. For example, if I move the mouse or click or something, I get some "cpu noise". I've tried searching for stuff like "usb shield", but I cannot find anything. I don't know if any of you has any experience and can help a bit. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rewatching Nate vs Conor... I don't think he threw that much, I think he got tagged a lot. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-25 13:03:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wanted to show the fight to a friend who has never watched MMA (I think it is a great fight, short and packed with action). This is the first time I watch the fight. The first time was the morning after (spoiler free) and then the next day.

Rewatching it now, Conor threw a lot more leg kicks than what I can remember, and his pace is not as wild as I thought.  He was loading, but he was clearly not punching himself out, and between his combinations he always rested for some seconds. There's no way a top fighter would gass just throwing that volume.

When I watched the first for the first time I thought Nate was getting murdered, but watching it now, especially during the first round, Conor got tagged a lot more than what I can remember. There were the classic 1-2 jabs from Nate, which as we know, they can hurt a lot. For example, the left that cut Diaz in the brow was immediatly followed by a good right hand by Diaz that went directly to Conor's chin (similar to the one that put him on wobbly legs)

Example: https://streamable.com/3sqf You can see he gets a very good right to the chin, and just after that you can see he is opening his mouth.

Another example: https://streamable.com/sklx

Another one: https://streamable.com/6psl

There is also the famous left counter to Diaz chin, which would have TKO everyone in that division except Nate Diaz, but if you look again, in that sequence Conor eats a couple of 1-2 like the ones that set him on bambi legs: https://streamable.com/atey You can see after the first 1-2 Conor said "What's that?" A sign he was hurt there.

Finally, you can see another 1-2 that left Conor with stiff legs, although then he launches another left. https://streamable.com/pxo2 

This punches don't seem like much, but we all know that they have Power and they can decimate very good fighters (like Conor, Cerrone, Maynard, plenty of them)

I am a Conor fan, and I hope he wins the rematch, but if he thinks he lost because he gassed because he loaded too much, he is wrong. He was tagged and hurt, and you can see his face and mouth getting serious, tired, mouth open, after Nate landed those combinations.

Finally, Conor attacked his legs a lot. The reality is that he is not that good doing that. He didn't attack his body that much, but Nate leans with his head, so his body is very far back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We tend to say here that UFC / MMA is a "niche" sport, and that they cannot be compared to the american giants (NBA or UFC). I don't know why MMA fans like to see themselves as a "poorman big sports leagues".

I did a very quick test using google trends (so the number of search queries, which can almost directly relate to popularity). All the data that follows is worldwide.

Comparing Conor Mcgregor with Lebron James and Stephen Curry, during UFC 196 Conor got 4 times more hits than Lebron or Stephen ever (which was during the last finals).

Comparing Ronda with them, she never peaked as much as Conor, but during her last 2 PPV she had 3 times more hits than Lebron James or Stephen Curry during the NBA finals.

Nate diaz doubled Lebron James best ever during UFC 196.

Holly Holm got the same number of hits as Lebron James NBA last finals during her PPV against Ronda.

Miesha Tate got almost the same hits as Lebron James NBA last finals during her co main with Holly Holm.

For those of you who say "but but NBA is not that popular, NFL is the big one".

Conor McGregor got 5 times more hits than Peyton Manning during his last superbowl. Same for Ronda, but she did it twice.

Same data when compared to Tom Brady.

Conor McGregor during UFC 196 even got more hits than Messi during the final of the WC. He even beat Mayweather during his bout against Manny Pacquiao.

	<TEXT> So I have a Standard Stratocaster (made in usa) from 1999. I have been offered the tonerider city limits pickups.

These pickups have decent reviews, but they are kind of cheap. So I don't know if they would be an improvement over my original pickups, or a step back.

Any recommendations?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It is been sold online. The serial number seems good. The guitar is from 1999. I have only seen the pictures. I don't know about the overall condition, so I cannot say much. In one picture you can see a chip on one of the horns. He says the frets are good and dressed. Bone nut fitted. The neck pickup is a twin blade humbucker.

I know the answer would be to go and check it, but, if its a scam I would really never know. Plus, I live a bit far away, so I cannot just "go".

That is why I would like to know if it sounds like a reasonable price.

I can read it for 10 minutes but not for 1 hour.

I wonder if there is there any book, documentary, tv series,... that will explain me what happened in Scotland, from the first settlement (pre romans) until nowadays. Although I am mostly interested on the story between the first settlements and the union. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Basic tips for raw processing ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-03 17:53:41 </DATE>

	<TEXT> I've started to do some raw processing, first time in my life. I'm using ufraw and gimp, although I'm trying to do everything in ufraw and in gimp I only scale down the image.

I've watched a tutorial where every element of ufraw is explained, but I don't really know how to do the stuff. Like I'd there's a very white portion how to get more detail, or the same when a portion is too dark. 

There are a few curves and tools and I don't know how to apply them, apart from the very obvious.

I don't know if there are some basic tips I can use to improve my pictures.

Thanks ! </TEXT>
