	<TEXT> The biggest challenge for me was changing my attitude towards food and trying to tell myself that I am not missing out on anything but gaining so much more for my life. I have also had to experiment a lot with what foods I can tolerate now. For instance, I cannot drink milk or eat rice. Both leave me with terrible stomach pains but other than that the list is endless of foods I can enjoy. I have already begun incorporating exercise: I go to the gym, I run and I go to a place in Perth called Jacobs Ladder which is something like 227 stairs.   </TEXT>
