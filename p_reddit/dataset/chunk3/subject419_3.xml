	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just wandering if anyone knows how big of a part the class halls are going to play in legion? I ask because I LOVE the hunter one and if it plays a big part I think I'd level a hunter and play that through legion. I was originally planning on a mage but the mage hall doesn't appeal to me at all </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Iv just resubbed after a few months and logged onto my druid and I really can't remember anything. I don't have any friends who play so can't ask anyone like that for help. I left when I was about halfway through getting the runes for the legendary ring, part 3 I think. I'm thinking, as I know absolutely no one on this game of just completely restarting on a new server. Do you think that's a bit excessive? </TEXT>
