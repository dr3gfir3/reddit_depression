	<TEXT> Also, I want to add that when downshifting, you can apply pressure to the desired gear for a few seconds (not actually pushing it into the desired gear) after an engine blip. This will allow the synchro's to match up and you will feel the stick 'fall in to' the gear. This is also how you can change gears without the clutch but NOT Recommended. I hope I am explaining this well.  </TEXT>
