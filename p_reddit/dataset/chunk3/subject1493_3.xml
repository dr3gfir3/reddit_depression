	<TEXT> Oh I'm well aware it was both an economic and cultural mainstay of the time, and had been for centuries prior. Racism was more of a justification than a motivator, they needed/wanted slaves and the Africans were easy targets or already enslaved and for sale. It was the dehumanization of the slaves that allowed people to sit idle while it happened. Hitler did much the same with Jews (although his motivations are different). 

 My comment was a joke, nothing more, but I appreciate the correction. The less misinformation the better. </TEXT>

Of course not, well maybe some, but if they cared you would imagine they'd do something. I personally think they're just being elitist under the guise of being pro-equality. Think about it, they ask you to earn the privilege to even associate with them, they constantly demonize "the other", and they will completely break from reality before actually admitting their constant bitching does nothing. Being an SJW is being part of something exclusive and cutting edge and if they let anyone associate with them they wouldn't be precious little snowflakes anymore. </TEXT>

None of this crystal bullshit, he's explained the medicine behind what he does and it actually makes a ton of sense coming from someone invested in the scientific method. Of all the alternative medicines, chiropractic looks the most promising, and as a profession they're really pushing to separate from their pseudo-scientific beginnings. 

It's also worth noting i'm in Canada, chiropractors here are certified and can actually use the title of "doctor", since it takes ~10 years of medical school to become one here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In first world countries the discrimination generally comes from the zeitgeist, not the law. The law is against women in the middle east, they're basically second class citizens. Old cultural holdouts is what they are against in countries where they are equal under the law, just ignorant opinions and people. That mentality is dying out luckily, but culture changes slowly over time. These are attitudes people have held for centuries, it's going to take more than ~60 years of social progress to fully move on from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is some amazing perspective from some awesome youtubers, if only youtube allowed for this kind of thoughtful interactivity! Keep doing what you do cubed, honestly the vast majority of your fans (me included) are just happy to hear your voice, the ones who complain are ungrateful cunts. 

You make quality, funny, and consistent content that is available for *free*, and frankly if that's not good enough for some people then nothing will be. I, and many like me, do genuinely enjoy what you do and appreciate the effort and enthusiasm that you do it with. We are the silent majority, but we're here and we want to say thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Retrospect makes fools of us all. I have a distant relative (great uncle? i heard this story through my mom) who accidentally ran over his own son. My mom isn't here right now to fill in the details, but the kid was pretty young and had somehow wandered behind the car as the dad was backing up. Died later in, or on the way to, the hospital. The dad was never really the same, despite it being an accident. I think he may have even ended up killing himself later on but i'm not sure. I hope the dad in this article can find a way to keep going, it's not going to be easy, but hopefully he'll find some sort of closure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ya we really don't know enough context to say whether or not this relationship is worth saving, that's up to OP. She certainly shouldn't have to take abuse of any kind, but we don't have any semblance of an alternate point of view on the guys part. He could not even realize how much of a dick he's being, or not realize how caught up in the moment he was getting. It wouldn't exactly excuse his behavior but all the info we have on this guy is from his obviously upset GF (understandably upset of course but upset nonetheless)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are such things as open relationships where both parties are ok with their partner sleeping with other people. There is nothing wrong with that provided both agree that it's ok. It's really up to the people in the relationship to set their own ground rules for their specific union and as long as it's legal and consenting, it's nobodies business but theirs.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mob mentality helps as well, and this one had already gained momentum from previous lynchings. On an individual level it's much harder for them to justify these things but when you get hundreds of like-minded people together they just reaffirm for each other that what their doing is right. As a collective they can rationalize anything. Tie in that these people were raised thinking black people are sub-human, and the fact that law enforcement was either powerless or indifferent and you have a recipe for extreme sadism. 

Don't get me wrong though, this is absolutely disgusting and each and every person involved has their own special place in hell. The power of mob mentality and collective rationalization is simply terrifying though, and shouldn't be underestimated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The whole "same amount of chemicals" argument is just a distortion of biology. All biological organisms are made of chemicals, hundreds to thousands generally. I'm actually fairly certain marijuana has *more* "chemicals" than tobacco. However, tobacco has rat poison, and formaldehyde, among other things, mixed into the leaves and paper for added flavor, burning smoothness, preservation etc. I'm not saying marijuana doesn't have carcinogenic properties and the tar can be just as bad (if you smoke a joint, it's different with a bong or especially a vape) but simply saying they have the same amounts of chemicals isn't really an indicator of anything but the amount of chemicals in them. </TEXT>
