	<TEXT> Mid lane: When my enemy laner roams and I ward his tracks and ping his ass but that overextending bot lane still blames me for not following Talon with mobis from base.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The synergy issue might also be a 'shoved together this roster with like a week's notice' problem too (CLG have had HuHi and Stixxay around all season even if not playing, TSM is in a similar boat admittedly but at least the management was always aware the team would be attending IEM and as you mentioned, the infrastructure is better). UoL still have the whole break to get it together - hopefully the management can work out those kinks. I want them to succeed : ( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UoL were at least playing a little better the second time. I always liked the team because they seemed a good natured lovable organization and while the first game was disappointing I'm not going to worry just yet because they showed a bit of improvement between the games and honestly they were invited at the last minute and probably put together this roster/had to switch back to practicing on this patch on just as short notice. At least Hyli/Gillius/Vici are showing a propensity to make plays (need to learn to do it in a way that doesn't mean overextending and dying though. That's a teamplay problem they should work on). Hopefully Fox and Steelback can wake up (I know they were...better in spring split) and the team spends the break working on establishing an actual shotcalling system (they don't have the raw talent to just rely on brute force 'chaos style' anymore) and get it together. I believe in Unicorns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, yeah I wasn't trying to rush to any conclusions, by 'has the cards' I meant he has all the attributes of a solid top laner (not afraid to go for plays when he sees the opportunity, good laner (showing good lane mechanics vs Acorn/Flame individually have little to do with LGD as a team), not reckless, good map awareness and teamplayer) which if he keeps it up, has the potential to hold up internationally. Maybe that wasn't clear haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He *was* Dyrus style in that he did exactly everything his team needed him to at all times - he didn't try to be a primary carry or play forward in a way that felt like he had a 'got the team on my shoulders' mentality, he did what he had to for the team. But the difference was he is still proactive and when an opportunity to make an outplay surfaces, he sees it and takes it. He has a great mentality and the fact that he held onto it despite being the only player in that game with 0 international experience is huge! I'm glad to say NA may finally have a top laner who has all the cards to hold a candle to KR ones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Given he's the only guy here without any international experience, Hauntzer is playing really solidly, not afraid to go for the outplays but not going recklessly ham either - good mentality. Very impressed. </TEXT>
