	<DATE> 2016-07-18 17:37:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My Prediction Is:
Finn Balor

American Alpha

Bayley

Nia Jax

Shinsuke Nakamura

Number 10 comes, everyone starts chanting 10 expecting Dillinger, on the Titantron it just shows, No, then Way, then Jose, and No Way Jose debuts

Just kidding, probably Dillinger

	<TEXT> Splitting the women's division, in my opinion is an awful idea, there's not enough depth in the women's roster to justify splitting it up, if I think now who's active in the women's division then I have:

Sasha Banks

Charlotte

Dana Brooke

Becky Lynch

Natalya

Paige

6 main roster active women, Naomi and Tamina (Injured) have disappeared, Eva Marie hardly appears, Nikki is Injured, Lana and Maryse are managers rather than superstars
There's not enough to say the women should be split, even adding NXT superstars has what, 2 women ready to move up and ones the champion, Nia Jax and Carmella need time to develop into their potential, only Bayley and Asuka are ready and Bayley could do with a little work on the mic, the tag team division has enough depth to justify splitting it but the women don't, 8 people isn't nearly enough to fill out a division on two rosters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a thought came to me that we're at the 6th PPV of the year so I thought how about some half year awards. So the Monday after MITB there will be some nominations for awards half way through

As for the awards, so far these are the categories I've got:

Best Match

Worst Match

Best Male Wrestler

Worst Male Wrestler 

Best Raw/Smackdown Moment

Worst Raw/Smackdown Moment

Best Quote

Worst Quote

Best Female Wrestler

Worst Female Wrestler

Best PPV Moment

Worst PPV Moment

Saddest Retirement/Death

Best Return

Best Debut/Call Up

If you have any ideas for new categories, or some nominees for the categories, feel me to let me know.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I only have one question, why is the guy so different when he's on screen, he can talk outside of the ring just fine but for some reason when he's in the ring he talks with no charisma, why is this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Up Up Down Down is outside of the brand and kayfabe in a sense as all of them are out of character, while Ryder's show (Long Island Z Stories or something) was in character and is used to progress Ryder's character on screen. The WWE will have wanted to control that series where as they don't need to control Up Up Down Down </TEXT>
