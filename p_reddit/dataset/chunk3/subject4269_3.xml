	<TEXT> I know this isn't true WTF material.  But it is pretty WTF to witness my mom go through this due to her 25 years of unmanaged diabetes.  It's cellulitis and she's been in the hospital a week. Can barely make it to the bathroom cuz of the pain / obesity.  Makes me sad.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dan is a douchebag and I'm sorry that situation happened. Ridiculous.  I would say though, from what I've seen on reddit, that most people here are reliable, friendly and giving. Don't write us/them off yet. 

Your parents are even bigger douchebags.  I can't believe their reaction but I guess for you its pretty typical.

I wish I had some good advice. But other people will have some and I would heed the common sense consensus. 

Good luck and please keep us posted. I'm glad you made this decision.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> WTF.  My favourite day every two weeks is when I get to throw away those suckers rather than cleaning and storing them for the night. And of course I do that into the trash bin or if I'm feeling rebellious into the toilet. I just don't get peoples laziness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Such a strange scene. First it looks like he stabs himself and drops the knife. Then he's basting himself in blood while someone else's hands are trying to do something - help? . Then he leaves the window but in an awkward "I fucked this up" way.  And then a seizure, I guess, followed by just sitting there looking like he's thinking "Goddammit I have to work in an hour."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's terrifying to witness and so horrible for that person going through it. Really sucks and I feel for those people. 

For me, I have really bad aural comprehension (always have misheard lyrics), and so I thought I heard him talking about the platypus server from the dark side.  </TEXT>
