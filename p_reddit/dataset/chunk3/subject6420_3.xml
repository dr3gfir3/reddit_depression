	<TEXT> Hey, when you literally have millions of people that are similar to you, you have to make yourself and your "group" special somehow. 
And I realise this not only applies to Chinese, this is a pretty typical "us vs them" behaviour everywhere. It's why bullying exists in schools everywhere. It's easier to see yourself as better if you can see other people as worse. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It actually is more common in older generations. Younger generations generally don't care much about that. But you also have to consider that most of China is pretty much like 99% Chinese, and most Chinese people's impressions from people from other countries are from media. So you can actually blame Hollywood representation of people from other races for their prejudices. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The "white people" part was kinda unnecessary but I get where she's coming from. When people ask me where I'm from and I answer Argentina (my parents are from China) I get the "no, but I mean where are your parents from". But I get it from all kinds of different people, even some Asians. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember there was a bear pit near where we came down from the wall. When we were going past, a guy threw some apples into the pit and the bears started catching them in their mouths. He then sold us a bunch of apples for us to throw. It was actually quite fun and the bears were actually really good at catching.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is the simplest way of using money. Spend only what you have. A lot of people live that way and do relatively well. A lot of Chinese, especially older people, think like that, that you are spending more money on a loan than you would by paying upfront. But the thing about borrowing money you don't have is that you get to use (or enjoy) whatever you are purchasing now instead of having to wait. Like in your car example, you have been using your car for two months or more before you pay it in full. And if you are resourceful and assuming you could have paid for the car upfront, you could have used the money you didn't use on the car to make more money. 

Apart from that, using a credit card and paying it back gives you good credit rating, which in turn you can probably use for borrowing more on mortgages among other stuff. 

Also, to answer OP's question: I think most credit cards have a maximum amount you can "borrow". And credit card companies allow this because more than likely they will be able to collect it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In restaurants, most of the time it gets thrown in the trash. That probably gets into a landfill or whatever trash disposal your city has.
Sometimes it might get mixed into other food but that probably happens only in very low end or Chinese food places. </TEXT>

It's surprising how much having any kind of work experience helps you find a job, at least in my country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really depends on if the bacteria has any way to move. Most bacteria don't.
Although when they move, they move fast (relatively). I present to you a bacteria being chased by its predator the White Blood Cell https://youtu.be/JnlULOjUhSQ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mold is rooted to one spot because it has "roots" that it uses to absorb nutrients and stuff.
Bacteria are more complicated. Some of them can move because they have like a little motor that rotates and propels them, though a lot of them don't. A lot of other bacteria also produce secretions to hold them there. But most importantly, bacteria are like unimaginably tiny. Like hundreds of them can fit on a needle tip. Bacteria colonies like you see (the little coloured mounds) are probably formed by millions of bacteria. 
Also, there are tests for bacteria mobility. If they form mounds or spots on the agar plates, they probably can't move on their own. If you see a thin slightly opaque layer on the agar, that means that they've moved and spread on the plate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To add to this, this reaction allows more warm blood to flow towards the site of injury. And also, both the injury and the reaction bring the warm blood closer to your heat sensors and you feel warmer. It is kinda similar to when you drink alcohol you feel warmer but you are not really increasing your body temperature but bringing warm blood closer to your sensors. This is why it is a bad idea to drink alcohol to keep warm. You feel warm but you lose heat a lot faster. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because the nervous system doesn't work the same as electronics. It doesn't use electricity, but it uses ions on different sides of the neurons to transmit signals by releasing other chemicals or hormones. Also, it probably is a lot easier to generate a voltage surge in cables and circuits than in neurons. And a high enough EMP would probably generate also enough heat that the nervous system being affected is lower down the list of worries. </TEXT>
