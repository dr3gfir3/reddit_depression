	<TEXT> that's why I feel like killing myself. whenever I think I try to figure out the reason why I'm depressed, its always something different or something I cant do anything about. or for all I know all of those things are the cause of my depression, and its just too big of a mess to even clean up.

maybe its life is just so unfair and there's no explanation behind why things are unfair, and there's no point in anything in life if things are unfair. all the unfair things just get me frustrated and depressed. I can't stop focusing on the unfair things.

for all I know the depression is too comfortable and I'm afraid to even leave it, maybe that's why, but I dont know for sure

or maybe its because I'm overweight and I can never achieve my goals of losing weight, I always fuck up every time I try. every time I get frustrated because something unfair happens, I just eat because it feels good, and I feel like I should treat myself in order to male things fair again

I'm just so tired of being depressed and life sucking I kinda just want it to end </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are some ways to train concentration? Does the way I meditate help train concentration? I meditate by just closing my eyes, sitting down, and focusing on my breath, or trying to. I have trouble with doing it everyday though.

Another reason to why I probably don't help myself I just realized, is because it feels like I've dug myself into too deep of a hole, and it just would take way too much effort and time to dig out of. I feel like I wasted my youth so why bother, I'm already 23. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess maybe the problem lies in relaxing. Its just too hard for me to relax, or I don't know how. I always want control over things in life, and when things are out of my control or don't turn out right it feels unjust because of the work I've done or the suffering I go through like depression. Its even harder when it comes to letting go of things too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im not exactly sure why I haven't sought them out yet. One reason may be that I'm afraid to not be depressed, like I've been depressed for so long its become normal. Another reason may be is because I don't believe it would help, or that I wouldn't be able to follow the instructions because I don't have confidence in myself. Another reason that might be is because I'm waiting for some special moment in life that makes me not depressed, or someone to come along, and then that moment or person changes my outlook in life.

I've read many articles on stuff like this and seen a few videos, and while it gives me hope and motivation for about a day, after that its gone.

I've also been seeing a counselor for therapy already , but like the above, I feel good and hopefully for about a day after seeing the counselor, but then it usually goes away after a day. </TEXT>
