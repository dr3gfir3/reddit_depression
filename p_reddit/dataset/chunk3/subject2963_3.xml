	<TEXT> That was my thinking when I just for fun answered one of the ads. The guy basically said he was the same thing as trans woman and they both have dicks. I wanted to explain that there was a bigger difference between the two but felt like i was wasting my time he makes 5 ads a day in the trans section. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The question came to me when lurking the section and feeling like certain ads don't belong in the transgender section. I had two thoughts. The first was why do some of the ads want only straight guys and are misleading in that they aren't trans. My thought on the misleading ad issue was they think that they can get away with it in that section because they think guys looking for trans women might also be into gay guys. Or something a little more discriminatory toward transgenders which I won't even say but it is possible as why the cisgender gay guy ads in the trans section don't get taken down. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 7 train is kind of isolated. I feel the numbered trains are the most reliable but you asked what are the most reliable in general and those are. The 2 train is great in Manhattan but there are some problems in the Bronx. For example there was a snow storm recently and all the above grounds stops on the 2 train were no longer accessible. The 2 train worked fine in Manhattan though on that day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the train system was first created The letter trains and numbered trains were created by two different companies. With the 1,2,3,4,5,6 trains the people who control the trains know where they are and were able to implement those countdown timers you see in the stations. Last I checked the people runinng the lettered trains still dont know where each train is in the system. They need to update the letter train system but MTA is cheap and has delayed updating it for decades. </TEXT>
