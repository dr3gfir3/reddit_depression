Some dudes just feel the need to strut their dicks around. The only reason they do it is because they either feel deeply insecure or feel threatened by you in some way.

	<TEXT> Ha. I'm not too sure what "be a man" means, but the best way to take control of a conversation/discussion/debate is to be informed on the subject matter

Also, allow your views to remain objective i.e. questionable and admit when you are wrong or atleast acknowledge the possibility that you MAY BE wrong.

Do these things and you'll be fine until you figure out the finer points.

Lastly, aometimes the smartest thing is to say is *nothing* so if you don't know anything about what's being said, just listen </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump wins, then gets impeached and forced out within the first year, because he's despised by most politicians, regardless of partisanship. 

Pence gets sworn in, only to last a few months before stepping down due to political pressure.

Paul Ryan assumes office as third in line, just in time for Democrats and Independents to take the House and Senate in two years.

Ryan, slighted and bitter, for being stuck in his third, unwanted position, becomes hammered and careless, loses the nuclear football at, you guessed it, a Superbowl party, and during the halftime of Super Bowl 53, all nukes go off simultaneously and the last thing we all see are Miley Cyrus's tits being rubbed in Mick Jagger's sun-spotted face.

	<TEXT> That's the problem with the two party system. We dichotomize our issues because there are presumably only two chances. It's a system that needs more than two parties, as that makes people feel that there are only two options, "right" and "wrong", as if those words were absolutes and not highly opinionated in their origins </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Authoritarian religions, religions with one or more omnipotent god or savior, such as Christianity and Islam and Judaism, are overwhelmingly meant to keep you subservient and under someone's control, out of fear. Not only do they force you to fear other religions and proclaim their own as the one true religion, they also teach people to fear the darker sides of our own humanities.

These types of religion have caused more death and destruction than good.  </TEXT>
