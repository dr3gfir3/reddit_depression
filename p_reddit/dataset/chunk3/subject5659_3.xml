	<TEXT> [The Invitation](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2400463/) which had a limited release + VOD. One of those suspense thrillers where the less you know going in, the better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Sorcerer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BDbIzovuos). The latter half of the movie is all great jungle sequences. On that note, Wages of Fear, but I haven't seen it so I can't vouch for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the funniest thing I've seen on this sub in a long while, good job. The intersection of O A fans and anime viewers must be miniscule, but anyone can appreciate this regardless. </TEXT>
