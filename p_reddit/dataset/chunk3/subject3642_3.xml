	<TEXT> George saw the expression of horror on my face from halfway across the yard. Even before I started yelling for help, he was on his way toward me. Through my shallow, ragged breaths of panic, I choked out, shes in the well!

My neighbor was galvanized into action. He practically carried me to his pickup and we peeled out of the driveway toward his barn. George slammed the parking brake down while we were still moving. The truck screeched to a halt and George ran into the barn. He came back ten seconds later with a long, extendable ladder. He threw it in the back of the pickup, cracking the glass on the rear window of the cab with the force of his throw. Without even a hint of concern for the window, he jumped back in the truck and we tore through the field separating our yards until we reached the old well on the edge of my property.

For Mias entire childhood, Dave and I warned her to stay away from the well. When she was a kid, she listened. Once she hit ten, though, she got a rebellious streak in her. It only got worse in the aftermath of Daves passing. Without her dad around and with me being at work so often, shed always find her way into some trouble. George did his best to keep an eye on the house from across the way, but he couldnt watch it all the time. Nor should he have to. But he remembered when he had to tell his own kids to stay away from our well. The thing is a deathtrap, even with the boards Dave had put over its opening.

She hasnt answered me, I sobbed. Wed just gotten to the well and George was using his flashlight to peer into its stygian depths. The boards that had covered the opening were stacked neatly against the side. George yelled her name into the blackness. His deep voice echoed off the narrow walls and came back to the top a few seconds later as a weak shadow of its former self. Not a sound was heard from the bottom. 

George could see I was starting to lose it. My shivers had turned into full-blown shudders. My knees were knocking together so hard I could barely stand. I leaned against the pickup for support. 

Shes going to die, I gasped. Mias going to be dead. Dead like Dave and Ill be alone.

The world desaturated and dimmed as I hyperventilated. For a second, I must have blacked out because I wasnt standing anymore. I sat cross-legged in the dirt as George struggled to put the ladder into the opening of the well. He called Mias name over and over and over as he worked to get the thing inside. It struck me that George loved my daughter. It made sense; hed babysat her whenever I needed to work. Even after his own kids were grown and had moved away, George took interest in Mia and did his best to give her turbulent life a modicum of stability. 

I heard George swear under his breath once he realized the ladder wasnt long enough to reach the bottom. He yelled, Mia, look out! and he dropped the ladder. I struggled to my feet and peered over the edge; my tears falling into the blackness. I could see the top of the ladder was only about ten feet from the lip of the well. George rushed to the bed of his pickup and grabbed a rope. He tied it to the bumper of the truck and was ready to rappel down to the ladder.

How long until the fire department gets here?, he asked. 

I called them two minutes before I came to you, I whimpered. Itll be at least another 15 before theyre here.

Before jumping over the edge, George told me, When I have her in my arms, I wont be able to get back up the rope. Theyll need to get us both out. With that, he lowered himself down to the ladder.

Once he had his feet on the rungs, he let go of the rope and navigated down the narrow throat of the well. He peered up at my tearstained face as he descended. Shell be okay, he told me. His voice was firm. Confident.

George reached the bottom a minute or two later. He yelled up to me, his voice still calm and steady but with a hint of worry thatd been absent moments ago. Im looking. Ill find her.

I glanced over my shoulder and saw dust being kicked up on the dirt road way on the other side of the property. Dave always hoped hed get an opportunity to pave the damn thing, but he never got a chance. The only benefit was it was easy to see when someone was coming. 

The ladder shuddered as George made his way up. His face emerged from the blackness. I...I cant find Mia, he admitted. The calmness that had defined his voice this whole time was gone. He sounded resigned. It almost sounded like hed failed.

I heard tires screech to a halt behind me. I whirled around and shouted, Its about time!

Im so, so sorry Mom!, Mia exclaimed. She got off her bicycle and let it drop in the dirt. She was panting and sweat poured down her face. Did I miss it?

Mia and I peered over the edge of the well. George, whod made his way to the top of the ladder and was reaching for the rope, stopped and stared up with bewilderment.

Mia?, he asked, a look of confusion blooming on his brow.

Hi Mr. Palumbo!, Mia shouted.

George reached for the rope and tried to pull himself up. Its end whipped over the edge of the well and slapped him in the forehead. Id untied it from his bumper the minute hed set foot on the ladder. 

Whats going on?, asked George. He sounded angry now. Indignant. What are - . He stopped talking. A deep, droning sound came from below him. Even though it wasnt loud, I could feel its low frequency resonating in my chest. 

He peered down. Mia glanced at me and smiled. I put my arm around her sweaty shoulders. We watched George together. The noise came again. It was louder this time. Almost too loud. I felt it in my chest and deep in my stomach, giving me the unpleasant sensation of needing to rush to the bathroom. Mia squirmed with discomfort. The stones lining the inside of the well began to leak. George yelped with surprise. The fluid was thick and viscous. It started dark - almost black. As more vomited out from between the stones and dripped into the pit of the well, its color lightened. Crimson liquid mixed with swirls of beige paste and yellow, mucousy discharge. The smell made my head spin. From the corner of my eye, I saw Mia quietly retching.

George yelled again. And again. More fluid spurted from the walls, soaking George. His yell turned into a high-pitched, uncomprehending scream. His clothing dissolved. The mop of gray hair on his head began to smoke. Steam rose from his skin. He gripped the top rung of the ladder in some desperate bid for security.

The walls stopped their ejaculation. George stared at us with a look of desperate pain and abject terror. The droning sound from earlier was replaced by an intense, distorted blast. The ladder shuddered below George as the amplitude of the noise increased. My breath felt stuck in my chest. It was so, so loud. My ribs felt like they were being trampled on and my bowels contorted and spasmed. Mia doubled over and fell backward, clutching her knees to her chest as her nose dripped blood onto her t-shirt. 

When it felt like my body would pop from the intensity of the sound, it stopped. Come on, get up, I hissed at Mia. She obeyed, wiping her nose with her forearm and pulling her shirt down over the back of her shorts with embarrassment. George was silent. He wasnt looking at us anymore. He was staring at the bottom of the well. Then he gasped.

Our God coalesced from the putrescent slime and crept up the sides of the well like ivy carved from rotten meat. A thick tube, about as wide as Georges trunk, rose silently from the depths. George scrambled up the ladder, bracing his hands on the slippery stone. Steam billowed from the spots where his hands met the walls, still wet with caustic fluid. He didnt seem to notice. He dug his fingers into the stone and I cringed when his fingernails snapped backward with audible pops. Our God was at him in seconds. 

The column had enveloped the ladder and was at Georges feet. Cilia slid from the tip of the tube and grasped each ankle. As he was pulled downward, he reached up toward us. Mia waved. A terrible sucking sound exploded from the well. Georges legs disappeared into Our God. The color drained from his body and his eyes collapsed backward into his skull. After a loud crack, the top of his head caved inward. Mia and I stared into the hole in his head. Soft, wet slurping sounds burbled up from the wreckage of my neighbors body.

I looked away from George and watched Mia. She gazed at Our God with rapt attention. Her nose had clotted and she gripped the edge of the well with white knuckles. The embarrassment shed felt a brief time ago was long forgotten. This was what shed wanted to see. This was what Dave and I had told her about since she was a toddler. 

Once Our God had finished and disappeared back into the well, Mia looked into my eyes. She was weeping. 

Are you okay?, I asked, genuinely concerned.

I love you, Mom, was all she said. We embraced for a long, long time. 

Today, with Mia all grown up and my beautiful grandchildren running around the house causing all sorts of trouble, I look back at that embrace as the first time my daughter and I truly connected. Sometimes it just takes a special situation for two people to realize how close they are. For that situation - for that wonderful, memorable moment - I give great thanks to Our God. 

May every word I speak be in praise of His drooling mouths; may all my pleasure be felt by His singing flesh; may my last day on Earth be the day He chooses to taste me. Through His grace, I will bathe in His tongues.

	<TEXT> You know that interactive meme site that takes pics with your webcam and makes captions at the top and bottom of the image? My girlfriend showed it to me the other day. We were pretty impressed by how well the software picks up on facial expressions and makes captions based on what the algorithm detects. Anyway, we played around with it for a while, got bored, and then watched some Frasier reruns.

Last night, when I was home alone with nothing to do, I clicked over to that site again to see what kinds of captions I could get it to come up with. For a while, it was no different from the other day. Right when I thought Id had enough and was ready to head out and get something to eat, the page refreshed and a new button appeared. Live caption. I clicked it. My webcam light turned on and my familiar, stupid face appeared. Every five seconds, a still-frame was captured. Like before, it was captioned. 

I let it caption me for a few minutes and I watched the picture pool fill with thumbnails of all the captured images. I was a little disappointed. All live caption seemed to do was take away the need to click the capture image button Id been using before. I closed the laptop and went to the burger place down the street. I stuffed myself with bacon cheeseburgers and fries, rolled myself home, and went to bed.

When I got to work this morning, I opened my laptop and the website was still open. Once the WiFi connected, the page automatically refreshed and the live caption resumed. It detected I was tired and captioned the first picture, NEEDS BETTER PILLOW - BEARD NOT FLUFFY ENOUGH. In my sleep-deprived state at 7:00am, I thought it was pretty funny. I let the thing run in the background while I did my work.

About an hour ago, I remembered I had the site running. I checked the picture pool and it was loaded with captures of my face, along with various captions. As I scrolled through the more recent ones, though, something had changed. The captions werent lining up with my expressions. All the ones before, despite being silly, were more-or-less in line with whatever I was expressing. These last ones were different. Different and wrong. I downloaded them and put them on Imgur so they wouldnt get lost.

I dont know what to think. I was pretty sure someone was playing a joke and I tried to send an email to the site administrator to compliment them for making such an interesting site. When I clicked the Contact button at the bottom of the site, I got an error. I tried to go back, but again, there was another error. I tried going to the site on my work computer, but I keep getting the same ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED message. 

So yeah, if anyones able to get on expressioncaptioner.com, just let me know. The domain lookup says it isnt even registered, but Im assuming thats a mistake because my browser history is full of my visits to the site. Im not a superstitious person, but I gotta say - Im not feeling too well after all this. Its also getting pretty dark outside, but there isnt a cloud in the sky. Its not even 11:00am.

	<TEXT> Ive been Beths closest friend since we were toddlers. All throughout elementary, middle, and high school, we were inseparable. It was only after we went to separate colleges that we spent any significant amount of time apart. For me, it was borderline devastating. It wasnt the loneliness that bothered me most. It was how Beth, in the very week she began attending school, found a boyfriend who replaced me as the most important person in her life.

We still spoke on the phone with relative frequency during the first couple weeks of school. The frequency diminished, though, as Beth dedicated more and more of her side of the conversation to gush about her love for Luke, the boyfriend. Without ever meeting him, I knew he was using her. And I was right. After a month, Beth was tossed aside and Luke was never seen again. Gradually, the conversations between Beth and me resumed their pre-Luke frequency, but I could tell something was dreadfully wrong. It was only during our Christmas vacation that Beth confessed why she wouldnt be returning to school the next semester.

Beth was pregnant. She insisted she was on the pill and Luke had worn a condom every time, but her claims didnt matter much. The pregnancy tests were positive and a visit to Planned Parenthood confirmed what the tests already told her. Somehow, in a terrible move motivated by fear, Beth told her parents. They responded by revoking their promise to pay her tuition and insisted that she move back at the end of the semester or shed never be welcome in their home again. 

Were both from a small town in Florida. Our families are religious, but Beths parents are fanatics. The idea of a pregnant daughter infuriated and terrified them. In their flailing and hysterical confusion, they determined the best course of action would be to send her to a religious order where she could have the baby, give it up for adoption, and devote her life to the church. If the whole situation were on a television show, I would have found it almost funny; a parody of the most exaggerated customs of the irredeemably religious. But this was real. And Beth was going to suffer because of them.

Id carefully brought up the idea of abortion. It was not a possibility. Beth was 17 at the time and Florida law required the consent of at least one parent to make the procedure legal. We knew her parents might react violently to even the suggestion of abortion, so we couldnt approach them. On Christmas Eve, after wed discussed her options for hours upon hours in hushed voices in my parents living room, Beth asked the question: Do you think you can do it?

I began shaking. As soon as I mentioned the abortion idea, I was terrified shed ask me to conduct the procedure if all other options fell through. And the worst part was I knew Id do it if she asked. I couldnt let her be imprisoned by her parents church and be forced to devote herself to a group for whom she felt nothing but fear and contempt. 

After we parted ways for the night, I locked myself in my bedroom and looked for videos of the procedure. I felt intense nausea and sympathetic pain as I watched all the necessary steps - the brutal things Id have to do to my best friend. Gradual dilation. Violent evacuation. No anesthesia, no support. Nothing except the futile comfort Id try to provide; comfort from the same person who was inflicting the pain. I hadnt touched Beth yet and I already felt like a torturer. 

I called her early the following week and tried to explain what Id have to do. I was explicit as possible; part of me hoped the details would frighten her and shed abandon the idea all together. But that wasnt an option - not for either of us. She needed to be free from the situation that would condemn her to a life of pious imprisonment, and I couldnt live with myself if I were to change her mind. Id be just as bad as her parents.

At the end of the conversation, our plan was in place. It was less a plan than it was mutual resignation; two terrified and desperate people with minds made up to go through with something unavoidable. The next day, Id collect the implements Id need. The day after, wed go through with it.

I purchased an assortment of smooth, wooden dowels of varying widths. I shuddered when I touched the widest one. Next, I went to the drugstore and bought a few packs of condoms. I recognized the cashier from high school and tried to ignore her stare of disgust and disapproval. At another store, I bought more innocuous-looking items: gauze, cotton, peroxide, and painkillers. The painkillers were purchased almost as a joke; I knew theyd be all but useless. I couldnt stop thinking about the width of that last dowel. 

The day after, I met Beth where wed agreed would be the least likely spot where wed be interrupted, and, most importantly, where she could feel free to yell if she felt the need. No one came to that part of the city anymore. It was an old industrial park thatd been abandoned decades ago. Not even the local teenagers or homeless bothered to venture into those warehouses anymore. Half of them had caved-in roofs and the other half were plagued by rats and other unpleasant conditions that made visits not worth anyones while. For Beth and me, though, it was the only conceivable spot. It was cold, filthy, and a little scary. These were the lengths to which wed been driven.

We didnt talk much in the time leading up to the procedure. There wasnt really anything we could say. I prepared the makeshift tools to the best of my ability and Beth used her phone to watch the same, terrifying video I used a couple nights back to learn what I needed to do. She was shaking slightly. The trembling only increased when she removed her pants and wrapped a blanket around her waist.

When I was ready to start, I did my best to hide the feelings which threatened to pour out of me in a torrent of sobs and pathetic bleating. Beth needed me to stay in control. She wasnt crying, and she was the one whod have to endure this indignity. I admired her composure. As I was preparing to insert the first dowel, Beths phone rang.

Oh my God, she whispered, and jumped to her feet. Wrapping the blanket around her waist again, she paced back and forth while talking in a hushed voice. She was crying. I prayed it wasnt her parents. They were so, so good at emotional manipulation.

Beth hung up and headed back to me. It wasnt her parents. For the first time in months, it was Luke. He was on his way to Florida. He wanted to see her and take her away and they could raise their baby together. When Beth told me this past part, she whispered so quietly I needed her to repeat it. In a voice equally hushed but contained a haunted aspect Ive never heard from her before, she said again: I never told him I was pregnant.

The chill I felt had nothing to do with the coldness of the dilapidated warehouse. Beth resumed her position and set her jaw. Her look of fear had changed to something wholly different. She was determined. Do it, she instructed. Now.

An hour went by as Beth exhibited a strength I never knew she had. She whimpered and winced, but not once did she cry out. I felt intense nausea as I inserted the progressively-wider dowels, having to stop more than once to look away from the bloody blanket underneath her and tried my best to disassociate from the situation for a minute or two. This isnt me, I tried to convince myself. I wouldnt do something like this. When the waves of nausea passed and Id calmed down as best I could, I kept going. 

The widest dowel was in place. Beth had removed the condom from of the previously-used dilators and had the wooden rod clenched between her teeth. I didnt know if it was doing her any good, but she hadnt cried out. Tears flowed from both of us as I removed the last one and took the thin forceps from the jar of rubbing alcohol where theyd been soaking. Before the instrument could touch Beth, a crash echoed through the cavernous warehouse. It was the door wed been unable to unlock. Wed used the broken window to climb in. But it was undoubtedly the door wed heard, and from across the football field-sized building, we saw a person striding toward us.

Beth again jumped to her feet, this time yelping when she moved. She scrambled to wrap the blanket around her as the figure moved toward us. No, sighed Beth, as she finally recognized who it was. Luke, she breathed at me. Id already figured it out. The closer he came, the more frightened I grew. He was massive. At least 66. And muscular. He moved with the heavy, effortless grace of a of a silverback gorilla. The sunlight coming in through the holes in the roof flashed off his pale skin as he got nearer.

I tried to stand in front of Beth as Luke barreled toward her, but I was pushed away and landed hard on the filthy floor. He reached Beth, whod huddled against the wall. Luke grasped her shirt in his enormous right hand and lifted her from the ground. Beth flailed and landed weak, futile kicks on his body. Luke stared into her eyes for a moment, then he looked around at the bloodstained instruments on the towel next to where Id sat. 

No, Luke hissed into Beths face as she hung limply from his grasp, not bothering to fight him anymore. I tried rushing at him, but again he pushed me away and I fell hard on the floor. 

No, he repeated. You dont get to do that. I need him.

As the words left his mouth, something happened. Luke left arm, which had hung at his side, began to twitch. His hand deformed. Sharp cracks rang out as the shape changed. His fingers elongated and moved with a dextrous articulation I can only associate with tentacles or tendrils. When the fingers were nearly twice their original length, he moved his hand between her naked thighs.

Give him to me, Luke growled. For the first time, Beth screamed. I watched helplessly as she tried to clamp her legs together, only to have them wrenched apart by the impossibly strong thumb and pinky of Lukes reshaped hand. The middle three digits pushed upward as Beths scream rose a full octave. 

Mine, Luke whispered, as he slowly withdrew the fingers. Clasped delicately between them was a red lump no bigger than a lemon. It writhed his his grasp. Its shape was vaguely fetal with a distinct head and body, but the rest was alien. Tiny arms and legs split over and over, fanning out like progressively-thinner cilia. They gripped Lukes fingers. 

Luke dropped Beth to the floor. I heard her ankle snap when she landed and she cried out and grasped the injury as she stared up at the creatures in front of her. 

The fetus-thing crawled up Lukes hand and arm, leaving a trail of slime as it went. It nestled in the crook of his arm and remained there. I couldve sworn I heard it coo with contentment.

Luke looked at both of us. Tell whoever you want, he said with bemusement. Let them laugh at you.

He turned, and as he walked away and I scrambled over to help Beth, he turned to face us again. In a year, theyll wish they took you seriously. Everyone will.

	<TEXT> I lost my husband and my daughter last summer. I was a wife and a mother. Now Im neither. Im alone in a big house overlooking the lake that stole the loves of my life. 

Sometimes, when the house is quiet, Maria, the housekeeper, says she hears them talking and laughing together. I dont know if shes telling the truth or just saying it to make me think theyre watching over me with love in their ghostly hearts. It doesnt particularly matter. I know theyre dead. If anyones watching over me, its Maria.

My life is a haze of daydreams and inactivity. The payout from Franklins life insurance policy means I wont have to work again if I dont want to. I probably will at some point. Im just not ready yet. Every night, I go to bed wearing the same outfit I wore the last time I embraced my husband and daughter. Its not much comfort, but its better than nothing.

About two weeks ago, Maria said she saw footprints in the hallway while she cleaned. Wet ones. It took me an hour to calm her down. I love Maria, but her superstitions can sometimes cause problems. I assured her she couldnt have seen what she claimed, and I think I sounded pretty convincing. Still, in the back of my mind, I felt a twinge of fear. Not just fear; hope. But no. It was Marias superstition rubbing off on me.

Those slick trails Maria called footprints showed up every day since. She didnt complain and she didnt panic like the first time; she kept a stiff upper lip and cleaned up the water and mud without a word. I noticed the cross shed always worn inside her shirt was exposed now, signaling her faith to the world.

Yesterday morning, I woke up to all the floors in the house covered in muddy water. It was Sunday and Maria was off. I was glad; I didnt want her to have to see it. I wept as I mopped. I listened all day, praying Id hear the conversation and laughter Maria insisted shed heard when it was quiet. All I heard were the wet squelches of the mop with my pitiful sobs in the background.

Last night, before I could fall asleep, I heard something moving outside my bedroom door. I knew who it was. Without turning on the light, I sat up and watched as he came into the room, his body sloshing across the floor. His smell turned my stomach, but I didnt shrink away. Id been waiting for a whole year to see him again. I refused to be afraid. He whispered in my ear for a while, then he left. I bawled in my empty room until the sun came up.

Maria came at her usual time. She was surprised to see me awake. Id gotten up at five to clean all the water and mud before she would arrive an hour later. I greeted her with a cup of coffee and asked her to walk with me. She could tell I needed to talk to someone and shed always been my shoulder to cry on after Id lost Franklin and Erica. We strolled in silence through the backyard. We reached the lake and sat on the small dock.

I saw him last night, I confessed. I didnt look at her. I felt ashamed and nervous to admit such a thing.

Maria stared at me for a while, fingering the cross on her neck, before replying. I knew hed come back to you. Sometimes they just cant let go.

I didnt say anything for a while. The sun was coming over the treetops and burning the mist off the surface of the lake. I thought about the time Erica asked if the mist was the ghosts of dead fish. I thought it was the most adorable thing Id ever heard.

I stifled my tears brought on by the memory and asked Maria, do you ever miss them?

All the time, she sighed. Ill stand and look at their pictures on the mantle and just daydream when I should be working.

Maria held the cross tightly in her fingers as she spoke and stared at the ducks in the middle of the lake. I could tell she meant what she said. She turned to me and asked, when Franklin came last night, was Erica with him?

I sniffed and tears ran down my cheeks. I couldnt hold back my emotions anymore. Can I see your cross for a minute?

Maria looked puzzled for a second but unclasped the gold chain and handed it to me. It was warm from her hands. Heavier than Id expected, too. It wasnt Franklin, I whispered.

What do you mean?, inquired Maria, clearly confused.

The lake water rippled and the ducks flew away. Maria began to scream. I clutched her cross in my hand, feeling its edges digging into my skin. Silently, he rose from the lake. All of him; not just the part hed sent to me last night. Before Maria could run, hed wrapped his tendrils around her legs. His colossal bulk towered over us, all mouths and tentacles and tendrils and hideous, gaping orifices.

A thick, red tentacle with a purple gash in it descended onto the top of Marias head. Im sorry, I told her. The loudness of the sucking sounds caused birds to fly from the trees and my hands to cover my ears as I watched. Marias body contorted as she was turned inside-out, her femurs erupting from the hole in her head before her hips shattered the skull entirely.

He drank Maria as I clasped the chain from her cross around my neck. He was finished in minutes. A smaller, thinner tendril slithered up the side of my body and wrapped around my ear. Again. Next year. And I might give one back. 

I remember the agreement, I mumbled.

As I spoke, a yonic cavern in the main bulk of his body split open. The head and torso of Erica appeared. Her mouth opened and she vomited grayish-red jelly into the lake. She saw me and choked out, it hurts, Mom, before he re-sealed his hole and slipped, noiselessly, back into the water.

I walked back up to the house. Marias cross felt cold and heavy around my neck. I sat at the computer and sipped my tepid coffee. I browsed for a few minutes. There was no shortage of available housekeepers for hire. I sent a few messages and one replied immediately. Melissa. She gave me her number and we chatted for a little while. She was nice. Im interviewing her in person tomorrow morning. On the phone, she sounded excited.

	<TEXT> I was always good at hide and seek. While being small for my age sucked most of the time, it was one of my biggest assets when hiding. Combine that with my flexibility Id developed from being in gymnastics classes since I was four, everyone wanted me on their team when we played. Keep in mind this was before kids had video games and cell phones; if it sounds like we played a lot of hide and seek and that seems weird, well, maybe now it is. Back then, though, we didnt have anything else to do.

Maggies family didnt have much money and they lived a few blocks away from the junkyard. When the wind blew in a certain direction, their house smelled pretty bad. We got used to it, though, and we still liked hanging out there. Her parents were nice and always gave us chips and soda. I think they were happy Maggie had friends and wanted to make sure we kept visiting her. That didnt cross my mind at the time, though. All I cared about were the chips and soda. I liked Maggie; dont get me wrong, but chips and soda were chips and soda. 

During the summer months, despite being told not to, our small group would hop the fence of the junkyard and play hide and seek amidst the piles of old cars and dishwashers and microwave ovens. The one guy who worked there, Luis, didnt seem to care. Dont do anything stupid, hed tell us, before retreating back to the little shed that housed his television and beer. 

On Maggies birthday in August, her parents threw a surprise party. All in all, about 20 kids showed up. She had a great time and I was pleased that the wind wasnt blowing the smell of garbage into the party. A lot of the kids hadnt been there before and I didnt want them to be mean to Maggie or her parents if the place stunk. After cake and an impromptu water fight, a few kids left but about 14 of us remained to play hide and seek. For such a big game, we split into two teams - creatively named the Hiders and the Seekers. I was a Hider.

The whole neighborhood was fair game. The only catch was we werent allowed to hide in someones house. The Hiders would have ten minutes to hide before the Seekers would come out of Maggies living room and go looking for them. The penalty for being found was a water balloon to the face. If the Seekers couldnt find everyone from the other team in an hour, all the Seekers would get water ballooned. I didnt want to be found. I really, *really* wanted to be the one to throw a water balloon in Javiers face. Javier was a dick.

The moment our team was told to go hide, I took off like a shot for the junkyard. The other day when we were hanging around in there, I saw the perfect hiding spot for the next time we were going to play. As I ran, I saw a few kids jumping in bushes or climbing way up into trees. I remember thinking how great the trees were for hiding. The leaves were so thick you couldnt even see the individual branches. I was really excited for my team to win, even if I ended up getting found.

Once I hopped the fence to the junkyard, I made a beeline for that perfect hiding spot. An old refrigerator. I was moderately dismayed when I opened the door and there was still some gross, rotting food in there. I pulled it out as quick as I could, hid the stuff on the other side of a crumpled car, and jumped inside. Now, keep in mind even though I was young, I wasnt completely stupid. The fridge had a couple holes in the side that were probably from whatever piece of machinery had moved it. I knew Id be able to breathe without a problem. So, I situated myself at the bottom of the compartment, tucked my legs to my chest, and closed myself in using the shelf in the door.

It was dark, smelly, and hot. None of it mattered, though. I was giddy with the anticipation of potentially being the only one left unfound; the one whod win the Hiders the opportunity to give the Seekers a good soaking. Especially Javier. Time went by and I started getting a little sleepy. I might have dozed off for a minute or two, but I awoke with a start to the sound of a loud clattering. Before I could register concern or fear, something smashed into the back of the refrigerator, pitching it down on its front side. I smacked my head hard as it fell and might have lost consciousness for a little while.

When I came to my senses, I panicked. Whatever had fallen from the pile of junk to knock over my hiding spot mustve ended up partially resting on the fridge. It wouldnt budge. I screamed and yelled for Luis, hoping hed hear me. I thrashed around in the confined space, my limbs getting tangled in the wire racks of the remaining shelves which had been dislodged in the fall. I tried to straighten my legs, but they were too cramped against the sides and tangled in the racks to move more than a few inches. I was face down against the immovable door of the refrigerator. 

I noticed an intensely putrid smell coming from the area of the freezer near the top of my head. Something wet was spreading around my head and neck. Whatever had been in the freezer mustve gotten broken or unsealed by the impact. Then I felt something pinch my right earlobe. Hard. I yelped and tried to smack away whatever was biting me, but my arm was too tangled up. I pushed my shoulder up to my ear and hear a loud crunch as I killed it. It took me a second before I remembered what it was; Id seen a couple earwigs in the fridge before I hid inside. I thought Id gotten them out when I threw out the food, but apparently Id missed one.

I kept yelling and trying to get someones attention. Another pinch, this time on the other side of my head. There was nothing I could do about it. Not from the position I was in. I felt it again on the top of my head. I pushed my legs against the sides of the fridge hard and forced my head against the plastic in front of me. As I felt the bug crunch against my scalp, a rush of the foul liquid escaped the cracked freezer compartment. I realized pushing my head against the freezer had only made the crack worse, and I gagged as the stuff touched my lips.

The odor and nausea was forgotten quickly, though, as I felt pinches on my head, face, and neck. I felt the earwigs crawling on me, making their way down my shirt and toward my legs. I exploded with as much motion as I could muster, cutting my arms and legs on the wire racks that were trapping them and doing anything I could to slap the biting, pinching things off me. 

In the distance, I heard sirens. They were getting closer. Part of me was hoping theyd be coming to my rescue, but I knew there was no way they couldve known I was trapped. If Luis hadnt noticed, no one would notice. As the insects crawled over my trapped, contorted body and I struggled and screamed with no effect, I realized for the first time that I might die in there if no one found me. My hope was resting on Luis hearing me scream and the Seekers, even stupid Javier, thinking I might be hiding somewhere in the junkyard.

The sirens kept getting closer. It almost sounded like they were right across the street. I screamed as loud as my already-damaged vocal cords would allow. Then one of the insects crawled directly into my right ear.

I made a sound I never knew could come out of my mouth. I tried to jam my shoulder against my ear again, praying I could kill the thing before it went any deeper. I was unsuccessful. I heard, with terrifying volume, its hard body squeezing through the warm, tight canal. The scratching sound was worse than the countless sets of pincers still sinking into me as I flailed. I heard and felt the thing going deeper - so deep its mere presence was causing pain deep in my head - and with a violent scratching sound so loud it drowned out my screams, I knew it was up against my eardrum.

The sirens had stopped, but my screaming had not. More of the earwigs were seeking a warm, safe place where they could hide. As the one inside my head continued scratching at my eardrum, I felt at least two moving up the leg of my shorts. In any other situation, that wouldve been enough to get me to strip out of my clothes, no matter where I was or who was around. At that point, though, I was just grateful they werent biting. 

Id been trapped for about a half hour. My voice was raspy and my throat hurt worse than it had when I caught strep in the winter. The shriek of the sirens started up again and I jumped, sending the earwigs into attack mode again. I felt their pincers lock on my scalp, back, neck, and perineum. The one inside my ear pinched the wall of the canal. It sounded like the loudest click you can imagine and stars exploded in my vision from the pain. More sounds of abject terror and misery escaped my mouth.

More time went by. The fluid coating my body had begun to dry and turn tacky. Whenever I tried to lift my face from the surface it was resting on, my skin stuck to it. I had to jerk my head to free it, which only aggravated the earwigs. I wailed and sobbed for a while, knowing Id be found dead in a month with my body as rotten as the food Id pulled out to fit myself in the fridge.

An enormous crash made me jump and set off the bugs again. This time, I heard another person yelling. It was Luis. He was trying to get me to talk and say I was still okay. Hed heard me. I screamed that I was trapped and stuck and I needed help. Another crash - this time the world spun as the refrigerator was flipped onto its back and the doors were flung open. The light of the late afternoon blinded me and I felt strong hands pulling me up by my shirt. My eyes adjusted and I saw the face of Luis studying me before he started slapping me all over, crushing or pushing off the bugs covering me. I looked down at myself - there were hundreds of them coating my sticky clothes and skin. They covered me in a reddish brown mosaic, all of them attacking me with their long pincers as they panicked at the violence and light theyd been introduced to.

I pulled off my shirt and threw it on the ground and joined Luis in brushing the remaining earwigs off me. In my head, the one by my eardrum squirmed and pinched over and over. I screamed and Luis, concerned for my safety, picked me up under his arm and ran toward Maggies house. Hed seen me coming from there earlier before getting involved in whatever afternoon television he was watching. Apparently after realizing he hadnt seen me leave, he decided to look around to make sure I was okay. And I wasnt.

When we got to the house, Luis just said call 911 to Maggies parents and left to go back to work. I wondered where all the kids were, but only for about five seconds - that was the amount of time the earwig gave me before it started moving and pinching inside my ear. 

Ten minutes and countless inner-ear pinches later, a paramedic was using a pair of forceps to pull the thing out of my head. He showed it to me as it writhed the metal that was squeezing it. It was so much smaller than it felt. Welts had started to rise from a few of the parts of me that had been bitten multiple times. Mom arrived right around then, and at the request of the EMT, she was going to drive me to the hospital to get checked out. While we were walking out to the car, Maggie told me Ron had fallen out of the tree where he was hiding and broke his leg really badly. Those were the sirens Id heard. 

As I gingerly eased my shirtless, sore, and sticky body in the car, praying the earwig hadnt laid eggs inside my head, I was drenched by an explosion of water that soaked not only me, but the inside of Moms car. One of the balloons. Nice nipples, asshole!, Javier yelled over his shoulder as he ran away with Mom screaming at him. Such a dick.

	<TITLE> Amy's Wish </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-28 17:49:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When Amy was four, I taught her the eyelash game. You know the one. Find an eyelash, close your eyes, make a wish, take a deeeeeeeep breath, and blow it into the air. If youre lucky, I told her, your wish will come true. Amy considered it for a moment, then announced it was a stupid game. I laughed and asked her not to say stupid anymore. I remember being glad she didnt think Santa and the Easter Bunny were stupid. That wouldve been a problem.

Right around Amys 7th birthday, she got a very special present: a new baby brother named Michael. Amy adored Michael from day one. Shed always ask to hold him, which we allowed once we were sure shed be gentle. She was. Michael was fond of his sister and if Dawn or I couldnt get him to stop crying, wed put him in Amys arms and hed calm right down. Needless to say, we were grateful.

When Michael was a year old, he developed a high fever. We rushed him to the emergency room where they successfully brought down his temperature, but something else was wrong. Tests revealed the worst possible scenario: leukemia. Hed have to begin treatments as soon as possible.

We didnt tell Amy the full story about her brothers illness, but she was able to figure out it was serious. I did my best to put on a brave face so Amy wouldnt get more upset than was necessary. For a little while, it worked. But a few months in, the emotions caught up with her. She descended into a sadness Id never seen in her young life. One night, over dinner, Amy started crying. Michael doesnt think I love him anymore, she informed me, as tears streamed down her face. It wasnt a question. She was certain. 

I felt like a terrible father. Caught up in the day-to-day living hell of my sons illness, Id neglected to help Amy cope with the feelings shed been forced to endure. At 39, I was having a horrible time dealing with it all; I couldnt imagine what it mustve been like for someone as young as Amy. 

After she went to bed, I called Dawn at the hospital and we tried to come up with something that might help. We decided she should visit Michael just to see that he was still okay and that the doctors and nurses were doing their best to make him better. Wed been reluctant to take her to the hospital because Michael was in such bad shape. We didnt know how shed handle the sight of him stuffed with tubes and hooked up to monitors, but we also knew too much time had passed. It was important for Amy to see her brother. 

When we arrived, Amy was only allowed to look at Michael through the window. To our surprise, she perked up right away. She waved and talked to him, knowing he couldnt hear her but still wanting to make the effort. I caught her smiling for the first time in a while.

I noticed two eyelashes stuck to Amys cheek. Hoping to add to her renewed sense of positivity and not caring if she thought it was stupid, I brushed them from her cheek onto my thumb. Then I asked her to make a wish, half expecting her to roll her eyes and go back to talking to Michael. To my surprise, she smiled again. She closed her eyes, thought for a moment, then blew the lashes away as hard as she could. Then she looked at her brother and grinned. I didnt need to ask what she wished for.

A couple weeks went by and Michaels condition improved. It was entirely unexpected and inexplicable; he just started getting better. But the relief brought by the improvement was short-lived. His condition deteriorated soon after. It was what Dawn and I knew would happen but were still unprepared for. Our beautiful son passed away on May 3rd, 2015.

Dawn and I were devastated. Obviously. But Amy was inconsolable. When she learned about Michaels brief improvement, she got it into her head that hed continue getting better. She refused to believe hed taken a turn for the worse. Then, when we explained to her that he had died, all she did was scream. She screamed and cried for days.

Over a month later, when the reality of life without Michael had finally sunk in and the three of us were gradually returning to our normal routines, I made it my goal to be more active in Amys life. Id been neither absent nor distant, but I wanted to be a force of positivity and support for my daughter. After such a trauma, it was what she needed. I made sure she was seeing the psychologist at school and I scheduled a family therapy session for the following week. I was determined to not let our family tragedy scar Amy any more than it had to.

The night before our therapy session, long after Id fallen asleep, I awoke to Amy standing next to the bed. I could hear her crying. I asked if she wanted to sleep with us for the night, but she didnt answer. Between her sobs, she was making a blowing sound. I could feel her breath on my face and bare chest. The crying continued. 

Are you okay, hon?, I asked, fumbling for the lightswitch on the old lamp next to the bed. The crying and blowing sounds intensified. Finally, I found the switch and clicked it on. I gasped.

Amys face was drenched with blood. She glared at me with her eyes wide with a combination of terror and rage. She had her hand up to her mouth and was blowing into it. As my eyes adjusted to the brightness of the lamp, I shouted. Dawn awoke with a start and screamed. In Amys hand were two, bloody pieces of skin with hair bristling out of them. She kept glaring at me as she sobbed. No, not glaring, I realized. Panic bloomed inside my chest and and I struggled to breathe. Ragged flesh dripped blood into Amys eyes as she blew hot, panicked breaths onto the amputated eyelids in her palm. The lashes swayed in the humid wind. 

I keep wishing Michael would come back, she sobbed. But Im no good at it.

Can you help me wish? Please?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone, Im a community moderator for a popular medical website. Yesterday, I saw a [post that talked about a procedure a person did on himself while asking for advice from our resident experts](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4bnqkb/to_the_kind_folks_at_webmd/). That was on our site. If you search for it there, you will not find it. Listen to what I have to say. I think youll want to hear it.

Where I work, there are some cases were required to hide if it looks like theyre promoting self-injury or have the potential to be a prank. Obviously, with millions of users coming to the site each day, its tough to be 100% accurate with all the content, but we have other employees who flag the posts that might fall under those categories. My job is to investigate the flagged posts and hide them accordingly.

Over the last couple years, the number of people hired to read and flag the posts has gone up dramatically. Its not only made my job harder because I need to go through a lot more content, but its increased the number posts I had to hide. For a while, I just thought the company was being overzealous with wanting to protect new users from seeing something too disturbing and leaving before their visit could bring in ad impressions. It didnt take long before I discovered something was up. Here are three random cases I was required to hide:

**Case 1**

*April 22, 2014  
1:45am*

*My names Leonard and Im hoping a doc or nurse can reply with some advice. I had a hell of a headache for the last couple weeks. I thought it was allergies because of how Id been all congested and snoring lately, but none of the OTC stuff helped. Over the weekend, the headache got a little better but the snoring persisted and I started getting itchy. Not really sure how to put it, but my foreskin felt crazy tight and like there were mosquitos biting the skin underneath. Now, Ive never been with anyone other than my wife since weve been married but shes always had suspicions about me, so Im a little nervous about telling her because shell think I was cheating. I dont want to go to the doctor yet because Im under her insurance and shell see the visit on her policy statement. Any advice?*

*April 24, 2014  
3:32am*

*Hi, Leonard again - I dont know if you got my last message but the itching got a lot worse and I had to cut away the skin to get at the problem. Its still bleeding a lot and Im kinda worried, so can you please let me know what I should do? My wifes sleeping right now and itd be great if you could get back to me before morning. Im on the east coast, if that matters. Itll be daylight in three hours or so. Thanks again.*

**Case 2**

*February 11, 2015  
4:01pm*

*I think this is the right forum to put this in but feel free to move it if its not. Ive had a splitting headache since January and its starting to get hard for me to concentrate on my schoolwork. Tylenol and Advil dont do anything, either. There are times when the pain almost goes away, but when it does, I feel itching everywhere. When I was sleeping the other night I mustve scratched myself really hard because there are terrible nail scrapes all over my thighs and stomach. Im a little scared to go to the student infirmary because they might think I got assaulted and I dont want to deal with that stress on top of everything else.*

*February 12, 2015  
4:17pm*

*Its been a day and I havent gotten any responses yet? I checked my spam filter in my email and there werent any messages or anything so I dont know if either no one knows what to say or if its just too busy. Sorry if Im being a pain, but I scratched myself really, really badly again overnight and I think I mightve done damage to the inside of my ear. My fingernail was broken off and part of it was stuck inside. I can still hear ok but Im getting more concerned with every minute and the scratch is still bleeding. Message back, please.*

**Case 3**

*December 25, 2015  
5:32pm*

*Its probably a longshot that any doctors are working on Christmas, but hey its worth a try. My heads been killing me since the beginning of the month. Ive ignored it for the most part because I used to get migraines when I was a kid but they never lasted this long. Im only writing now because early this morning before the kids got up the headache went away but my skin felt like it was on fire. Like, no joke. The worst was around and between my toes. I scratched like a lunatic and started bleeding and Ive been walking around all day with bloody socks. I had to excuse myself from our Christmas dinner so I could message you all because it was terribly distracting. I look forward to your response. Oh, and my wifes been complaining about me snoring a lot lately, too - I dont know if it means anything, but I feel I should mention it.*

*December 25, 2015  
11:50pm*

*I know its nuts to think Ill get a reply at this time on this day, but the itching is getting a lot worse. Now its my neck and scalp. I took some Benadryl and my wifes concerned and wants me to go to the ER. She hasnt even seen my feet yet. I cant stop scratching my neck and Ive drawn blood on my scalp. If I dont hear back by tomorrow, I might have to go to the hospital. Please let me know - this is torture.*

Those are three of literally thousands of similar complaints. The one yesterday, with the man and his uvula, was the 20th manifestation of self-injury reported that day. While he didnt mention a headache, the number of messages containing snoring, headaches, and self-injury are too numerous and related to ignore. The question is, why are ALL these being flagged and hidden? Even the times I unflagged one of them and let it go through, within minutes someone in the other office reflagged it and it was gone soon after.

I have so many more examples to share if it will help get the word out. Please spread this around. If anyones experiencing the symptoms Im talking about, post about it on social media. Use the tag #hiddensick. People need to know whats going on and right now, its being actively covered up.

7:15 am* 

I tried to snip off my uvula an hour or two ago. I read online that problems with my uvula can be why I snore so bad and I didnt want to make my girlfriend deal with it. She doesnt want to sleep over anymore and Ive got no insurance and cant afford the doctor to get it fixed.

Anyway, I tried to cut it off but its still hanging by a thread and I dont know whether or not I should cut it or leave it. It hurts a lot but I think the bleeding stopped for the most part. Let me know.

*March 22, 2016  
8:19 am*

Hi guys, I havent heard anything back yet so I did some more research and it seems like the upper palate can be a problem with snoring too? I dont want to do anything major yet just because I want to be careful, so just reply back when you can ok?

*March 22, 2016  
10:00 am*

Sorry if Im being a pain but Christines coming tonight and I want to make sure she can stay over without being bothered. I keep feeling like I have to swallow because my uvula is dangling back and forth and hitting my tonsils. Im worried if I swallow too hard itll get sucked in and Ill choke. Thanks.

*March 22, 2016  
12:43 pm*

I know you guys are kinda busy but I need some help. My stupid scissors wouldnt reach all the way and they couldnt cut through with just the tip so I grabbed it between my index and middle fingers and pulled it off. It hurt real bad and its still bleeding, but not as much as it did at first. The problem is when I pulled I felt and maybe even heard something up in my soft palate ripping. I know I shouldve tried again with the scissors because they worked when I did the majority of the cutting, but I got sick of the feeling of having to swallow all the time.

I think I can see where it mightve ripped from so Im gonna see if I can fix it.

*March 22, 2016  
1:22pm*

Guys Im a tiny bit worried over here and Id appreciate some advice for real. I used one of those tomato knives I got for Christmas and used the serrated part to cut away the part of my palate that had the piece torn off it. I got a little piece out the size of a penny after I cut into it and pulled with my fingers, but it just doesnt feel right. I mean obviously it hurts like hell and Im bleeding pretty bad, but like I can put my tongue up inside where the roof of my mouth was.

*March 22, 2016  
2:15pm*

Ok so while I waited I read that tonsils might be the biggest culprit with snoring so Im gonna see what I can do with those. I think thatll take a while so Ill probably have some advice from you guys waiting for me. I already did some cuts with the knife and used the tip of the scissors to pull away some pieces but its bleeding a LOT and Im gonna have to do it real slow. Im getting frustrated with you guys though so Im gonna copy and paste all this to some other places in case other people might know. So yeah, please write back.

	<TITLE> Roo </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-21 17:00:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ive lived in the same house for 40 years. After Ralph passed and I was left alone for the first time in three decades, I turned to my neighbors for comfort. They provided it in spades. I was honored and brought to tears by their kindness. Not too many places would make sure a lonely old man was taken care of. Im surrounded by wonderful, beautiful people.

I took on the role of a grandfather to some of the neighborhood children. I was more than happy to babysit; Ralph and I always wanted to adopt but it wasnt permitted in our state. So, having the opportunity to be a formative figure in the lives of these children was a great privilege. It made me feel like I was getting another chance to do everything that had been denied to me. I wish Ralph couldve been here to take part. Still, I know hes watching with the same love and pride he expressed every day he was alive.

One girl, Madison, formed a particularly strong connection to me. Her father was out of the picture. Her mom, Helen, who was forced to work full time, was rarely home during the day. Helen had always been the most supportive and loving of the neighbors after Ralphs death, so when I had the opportunity to help with Madison and watch her during the work day, I was more than willing.

I started looking after Madison soon after her 10th birthday. She fell in love with the collection of toy kangaroos all over the house. Ralph was born in Australia and I always used to call him my little roo -- especially when he got excited and his accent became more pronounced. On his birthdays, Id give him some type of kangaroo toy. Theyd been gathering dust after his passing and I was glad Madison could give them some life again.

Years passed and Madison started to grow up. I worried she was becoming depressed. She never had very many friends in school. Shed come straight over when her day was done and do her homework while waiting for her mom. Her mood was less bubbly than Id remembered. Part of it, Im sure, was her age. Adolescence is tough for everyone, let alone someone with a difficult family life like Madison. Still, I worried about her. She was perfectly nice to me and was never rude or disrespectful, but shed withdrawn. She didnt watch television with me anymore after her homework, either. Shed just sit on the floor in her kangaroo pajamas, which were far too small for her at that point, playing with Ralphs figurines. Just like she did when she was little.

When Madison was 16, she got a boyfriend. Her first one, as far as I knew. I didnt like him. At all. He was your typical teenage tough-guy type; a chain-smoking, foul-mouthed loser. There wasnt anything I could do about it, though. Madison wouldnt bring him over and I think she sensed I didnt approve. But it wasnt my business. I told myself years before that such situations were purely between Madison and her mother. Only if I felt like Madison was in danger would I interfere.

Madison spent more and more time with the boyfriend and less and less with me. The house grew quiet again. The other children Id taken care of had grown old enough to watch themselves. Their parents stopped by every so often for coffee, but my general person-to-person interaction was far less than Id previously enjoyed. I was lonely. 

One night, Helen came to me in a panic. Apparently, Madison had admitted to using drugs. Helen had no idea what kind or anything like that, but she was terrified for her daughters safety. I tried to reassure her that there had to be something the school could do, but that was when she told me the other half of the story: Madison was pregnant.

This floored me. Id seen Madison around town over the last few months and Id noticed shed gained some weight, but it never occurred to me she might be pregnant. Now her drug use was even more worrying. We tried to figure out a plan together and the only thing we could agree on was that the school had to know. Even though the local school system wasnt the best, they had to have some resources dedicated to problems like these.

The school did nothing. Madisons reckless behavior continued. Helen was too terrified to notify the police because she feared shed be put in a foster home. I, too, was clueless. Time went by and the rare times Id see Madison in town, shed be stumbling around drunkenly with her idiot boyfriend, her protrusive belly an obscenity against the background of her intoxication. 

On a late afternoon in February, I was leaving the supermarket when Madison spotted me from across the parking lot. She wasnt with her boyfriend, thankfully. She rushed up to me and gave me a big hug. She didnt seem drunk, but she had to have been on something. Her pupils were dilated and her words were slurred as she said how much she missed me. Then she asked if she could come over later to see the kangaroos. I told her that would be wonderful and that I missed her. 

At some point around 7, Madison came over. I ushered her in quickly; it was way below freezing outside and she looked ill. I could tell she was high. She shuffled in without saying hello and went to the mantle where the kangaroos stood. In a singsong, childish voice, she talked to them. When she was 11, I thought that type of thing was cute. Now, though, knowing she was under the influence of something that was poisoning not only her, but the baby as well, it was far less adorable.

I walked up to her and asked if I could take her coat and if shed like some tea and chocolate cake. She didnt reply. She just kept talking to the kangaroos. I sighed and sat down on the couch, waiting for her to either snap out of it and talk to me or leave and hopefully go home to her mom. 

Madison went down the line of the kangaroo toys on the mantle, saying I love you to each one. Then she walked back, doing the same thing in reverse order. Then she faced me. I love you too, Michael, she cooed, a thin smile cracking her pale face. But you know what? I love Roo most of all!

Madison dropped her heavy coat to the floor and I screamed. A gaping wound had been carved across the top of her belly. The blue head and chest and right arm of her baby stuck out from the opening. Look at little Roo, she said weakly. Such a good little Roo. Madison tried to hop toward me, mimicking a kangaroo. The limp head and arm of the child flopped back and forth with the movement. 

Sweet little Roo. All warm and safe in his pouch.

	<TITLE> The Floor is Lava </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-17 16:33:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was a kid, I used to play games like The Floor is Lava with my brother, Greg. I didnt like it too much. Greg was far more athletic than I. Older, too. Hed do all these graceful steps and great, balletic leaps that were way beyond anything my pudgy body could do. When Id fall and lose the game, hed gloat for a while and then wed go off and play something else.

My neighbor, Mr. Clayton, would always watch us from the other side of the fence that separated our backyards. Mom said to stay away from him, but she couldnt stop the guy from watching us play. He seemed harmless, if not a little weird. We didnt pay him much attention. All afternoon, hed watch us run races or throw the football around, only leaving his place behind the fence if he wanted to refresh his drink. Every so often, Greg would say, hi Mr. Clayton and give a big, exaggerated wave. Mr. Clayton just smiled awkwardly and looked down at the ground. To be honest, I felt a little bad for the man.

On an afternoon in late June, right after wed gotten out of school and the day after Gregs 15th birthday, he and I were roughhousing outside. We did that often. Even though he was older and taller, because of my extra heft, we were roughly the same weight. He was still much stronger and more agile, though, so he always got the better of me and pinned me down. After another win by Greg, he had me helpless on the ground while he crowed over me. While I waited for him to get off, I glanced over to the side. I could see Mr. Clayton watching us with rapt attention. His right shoulder was moving back and forth. Even though I was 11, I had a pretty good idea what he was doing.

Lets go inside, I told Greg. The tone of my voice was much different than what Greg was used to, so he sensed something was going on and let me up. I didnt tell him what I saw. 

Mr. Clayton wasnt in his yard for a few days after that. While I was reluctant to go out and play again, I kept reminding myself that the guy was harmless. Not only that, but Greg could certainly kick his ass if he ever tried anything. So things went on like they normally did, with Mr. Clayton reassuming his position behind the fence later that week.

After the July 4th weekend, Greg had a couple of his friends over. Dion and his brother, Rob. Dion was okay but Rob was a total asshole. A bully. I hated when he visited because Greg felt like he had to impress him. And thats what was happening. The four of us had climbed into the dilapidated treehouse thatd been on the property before wed moved in. The thing was a wreck. Floorboards were missing and countless spiders had made the place their home. Still, for whatever reason, there we were.

Rob was bragging about doing something to some girl over the weekend. Greg and Dion laughed along while I sat there, bored out of my mind. One of them had the great idea to have a pull-up contest using one of the branches above our heads. Rob took off his shirt to show off his muscular body, prompting the other two to take theirs off, as well. They did their pull-ups. Rob, unsurprisingly, won. After hed made fun of them for being so weak, he turned his attention on me. 

Go ahead, he sneered. Its your turn.

I told him I didnt want to. The others started to taunt me until I gave in and tried to do a pull-up. Obviously, I couldnt. They all laughed.

Come on, take your shirt off!, laughed Rob. I did, with some reluctance. When Dion and Rob saw my chubby body, they started giggling. Try again!, Rob shouted. As I strained and pulled, I felt pain explode across my back. Rob had slapped me as hard as he could. I yelped and cowered, but he kept slapping my back and chest while Dion and Greg looked on without protesting. Once Rob stopped, he said, now watch those handprints show up.

They watched. True to his word, the prints rose out of the angry, red flesh while they giggled maniacally. 

Hey Steve, said Greg. The floor is lava. 

I told him I didnt want to play and started to climb down from the treehouse. Rob blocked my exit. Youre playing, he informed me.

I was ordered to jump the gap between the floorboards. There was no way Id be able to do it. I knew what I was capable of, and that just wasnt even close. All three boys whooped and hollered at me to do it. I stood my ground. Thats when my brother started hitting me. Not slaps, either. Punches. He rained blows down on my lower back before getting in close to my ear and hissing, just do it you fucking baby. 

As much as I tried to keep it in, I started crying. After a couple minutes, Greg got bored of hitting me. I curled up in the corner as Rob changed the subject back to the girl hed been with over the weekend. While they laughed and asked typical, obscene questions, I sobbed pathetically. Rob looked at his watch and swore once he noticed it was much later than hed thought. He and his brother climbed down the creaky ladder and left.

Greg followed them, leaving me alone in the treehouse. I stayed there for an hour, seething. It would still be another three hours before mom would be getting home from work. If I had to wait up there the whole time, so be it. I didnt want to see my brother. 

Mr. Clayton stared up at the entrance of the treehouse while I sat with my legs dangling over the side. Greg came back out an hour later. He climbed the ladder and pushed me backward onto the floor. I stared up at him as the splintery wood dug into my bare, handprint-covered back.

You embarrassed me in front of my friends, you little piece of shit, he hissed. You fucking faggot. You fucking pussy.

He circled around like he was about to start hitting me again. Then I noticed where he was. Without thinking, I kicked him in the knees as hard as I could. He gasped and stumbled backward. He dropped through the missing planks in the floor, striking his chin on the wood as he went, shattering his teeth. I heard a loud thump as he hit the ground below.

I took my time climbing down the ladder. Once I reached the ground, I walked over to my brother. His face was a rictus of blood and he drooled shards of teeth out of his mouth onto the grass. 

I cant move, he wheezed. My legs. Arms.

I kicked him in the chest. I thought the floor was lava, you fuck, I whispered. Why didnt you jump? I kicked him again.

My neighbor watched from his side of the fence, his right shoulder moving furiously as he stared at our shirtless bodies. I smiled.

Hes all yours, I informed Mr. Clayton. 

As walked back toward the house, I looked over my shoulder just in time to see my neighbor hauling himself over the fence.

	<TITLE> Malique, part 1 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-11 17:19:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Loretta and I are the adoptive parents to a young man named Malique. Malique grew up in a terrible area of Philadelphia. Gang activity was rampant, violence was ubiquitous, and hopelessness was endemic. The result of living in this environment was a terrified, deeply disturbed boy. To make matters worse, he didnt know his father and his mother had wasted away from untreated AIDS. His only sibling, an older brother, was in prison for murder. By the age of 13, following the death of his mother, Malique was living on the street. He was discovered by a patrol car, huddled next to a trash can. They initially thought he was dead.

After a period of physical recovery, he was shuffled from foster home to foster home. To make a very, *very* long story short, we adopted him. Wed been hoping to adopt a child for many years. After learning about Maliques story and getting the opportunity to meet him, we knew wed be able to give him a better life. 

As is customary, he stayed with us for a few supervised weekends to make sure the relationship would be the right fit. Not just for us, but for him, too. Those weekends were a joy. We were surprised by how sweetly he acted toward us. Loretta had worried his lifetime of trauma might make him angry and prone to outbursts, but not once during the four weekends he stayed with us did he show any hint of anger. Quite the opposite; he spoke with a quiet, shy sadness that practically screamed for the nurturing and warmth that had been denied to him.

On a snowy day in late November, Malique officially moved into our home. We knew the acclimation process would take a while. The hideous poverty hed endured all his life made our home seem palatial and ostentatious in comparison; I felt guilty having so much when he grew up with so little. 

Right away he began calling us mom and dad. Ill admit to crying the first 200 or so times I heard those words directed at Loretta and me. Wed wanted to be parents for so, so long. To be honest, Id given up hope. I never realized how depressed Id been until the shroud of it had lifted by the sound of our son calling us the names Id so desperately wanted to hear.

Malique was too fragile to start school. Further, his verbal and mathematical skills were pitifully low for a boy his age. His lifetime of trauma had provided no breathing room for education. Loretta received permission from the state to homeschool him. Before she retired the year before, she taught special education at the local public high school. She had 35 years of experience teaching children like Malique. Loretta knew, with time, he could be brought up to grade level.

A month went by. Malique remained as sweet as ever. His nervousness gradually evaporated, but his soft-spoken and tentative manner held; while we both hoped hed come out of his shell, we werent going to rush anything. We could see the life of horror and sadness frozen in his dark eyes. It would take far more than a month for that icy trauma to melt away.

Shortly after Christmas, Malique began to have nightmares. Loretta and I would hear horrible screams coming from his room and wed rush in and find him thrashing around on his bed, desperately trying to fight off whatever was terrorizing him in his dreams. It was the only time we ever heard his voice rise above the soft, near-whisper to which wed grown accustomed. To be honest, it was terrifying. The shrieks were so raw and violent I was afraid to comfort him for fear hed think I was another assailant. But my fears were baseless. Upon waking, he was as gentle as ever. Apologetic, too. It broke our hearts.

The nightmares persisted and I grew more concerned with every scream-filled night. I suggested to Loretta that he be allowed to sleep with us in our room, on a cot, where hed hopefully feel less alone and terrified. She agreed to try it out, and so did Malique. Surprisingly, it worked. Hed still toss and turn and mutter in his sleep, but the agonizing, torturous nightmares seemed to go away. We were all relieved.

Loretta and Malique came home from the store in the middle of January to find the kitchen in shambles. Id been at the bowling alley and was oblivious to the event until I received a call from my wife soon after. When I got home, the police were there. They said it looked like a breaking and entering, but there was no sign of forced entry. Loretta said it was possible shed forgotten to lock the doors, but as far as I knew, shed never forgotten before. Nothing was missing from the house, either. Apparently whoever broke in only wanted to trash the kitchen. No one was buying it. But there was no other explanation.

That night, Maliques nightmares came back with a vengeance. It took us nearly five minutes to rouse him from his sleep, and in the process, he hit me hard in the stomach and knocked the wind out of me. When I hit the ground, Malique woke up. He started sobbing and apologizing. The stress he so obviously felt was devastating. He clutched his knees to his chest and rocked back and forth, crying and telling me how sorry he was. I locked him in an embrace and he put his head against my chest. The moment our bodies connected, a colossal series of crashes tore through the house. Loretta was knocked off her feet and fell backwards, her fall arrested, thankfully, by our bed. I fell on top of Malique as picture frames shattered and our dresser toppled over. I could hear dishes breaking downstairs.

The three of us had no idea what was happening. Loretta immediately yelled that it was an earthquake, since shed lived in California when she was growing up and was used to them. But we live in Pennsylvania. Theres never been earthquakes like this for as long as weve lived there. I was terrified but I tried act brave for Malique, who was whimpering under me. When the violence had ended, I took my weight off him and sat on the cot. All he did was whisper apologies over and over.

Loretta righted herself and reached for the lamp that had fallen from her nightstand. The bulb was broken. She carefully walked over to the main light switch by the door and flipped it on. The overhead light illuminated the devastation around us. For the first time, I could see Maliques face. Blood trickled out of his nostrils and left crimson lines on his dark skin before hitting his white t-shirt and blooming outward. I grabbed a handful of tissues and told him to hold them against his nose and keep his head back. Then I looked at my wife. Her nose bled, too. But that wasnt what shocked me. Her hair was falling out of her head in thick, gray chunks. She hadnt noticed yet and my look of horror was making her nervous. What is it?, she asked, her raw, nude scalp gleaming wetly in the light. Are you and Malique okay?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If you do a Google search for Charles Robert Olevsky, nothing will come up. Well, maybe by the time you read this theyll have indexed this particular content, but aside from that, my name has been absent from the Internet. I lead a dull life. Im a daytrader. Upper-middle class. No family, few friends. To be honest, Im a homebody. Lifes just easier that way.

Last night, on a whim provoked by boredom, I did a Google search for my full name. I expected the usual nothing. But thats not what I encountered. There were hundreds of thousands of results: news articles, Wikipedia entries, social media mentions - even pictures. But they werent pictures I could ever remember taking part in. And I looked much older; at least 20 years. I was surrounded by uniformed men carrying weapons. In a confused and moderately terrified frenzy, I clicked the top article. My blood ran cold.

*Charles Robert Olevsky, founder and leader of the New White Dawn Militia, announced today the successful completion of his campaign to eliminate the immigrant threat from the Southern United States. This was the largest of the NWDM campaigns, resulting in the deaths of 250,000 immigrants or perceived immigrants. Following the overwhelming successes of the most recent NWDM actions and the lack of intervention from the US government, it is believed Charles Robert Olevsky will continue pushing south into Mexico.*

With trembling hands, I zoomed in on the photograph of me. On my wrist was the same watch I always wear. The one given to me by my father. Minutes ticked by and I read more and more about the atrocities Id been accused of committing. Mass murder. Systematic rapes as terror tactics. Torture. Every victim was innocent.

There were videos of me from the early days of the NWDM. Propaganda videos. Someone recorded while I walked down the street with an assault rifle slung on my back, intimidating and beating everyone who looked like they didnt belong in that particular area. Each video featured me committing different acts of violence. I performed the acts with a calm demeanor and spoke to the victim like a patronizing father explaining to his child why he had to be beaten. As the videos went on, I began killing them. When the families ran to the corpses of their loved ones, I shot them, too.

Before I could finish the video, my Internet connection died. I felt unbearably nauseous and dizzy. Guilty, too. That man couldnt be me. When my connection reestablished, I tried to resume the video. It wouldnt go. I closed the browser and tried again. When I typed in Charles Robert Olevsky, nothing came up. All Google showed me were other people who had either Charles or Robert or Olevsky in their names. Nothing mentioned me.

I opened my browsers history and clicked the links from the last half hour. Each one was a 404. There was nothing. I started to think I was losing my mind. But then I remembered the pictures of me wearing the exact same watch Ive worn for the last 30 years. The videos, though, were what shook me to my core. Nothing about my actions in them was anything like who I am as a person. I glanced over at the side of the desk where my printer stood. The package housing Rosetta Stones Learn Spanish sat on top. I thought about the scenes of those hideous videos. I started to cry. Every time I talked to one of the people I brutalized - every time I mocked them as they bled out, I spoke in perfect Spanish.

I wish I could say I developed a relationship with Joy following my return. Quite the opposite. She withdrew. Once she told me about what shed been experiencing and how the white man was influencing her life and actions, she was a ghost. Anyone who didnt know what was happening to her would have claimed shed retreated into a solipsistic world of hallucination. Shed wander through the house, muttering to herself. Shed talk about fulfilling her purpose and being a good mother. If I stood in front of her, shed bump into me, wait until I moved, and then keep going. The only times Id get a hint that Joy was still somewhat cognizant of the world outside her head was when she would put money in an envelope for the people who delivered our groceries.

When I say our groceries, I just mean my groceries. I was painfully obvious Joy was rarely, if ever, eating. The clothing that hung from her delicate bone structure when I arrived was forgotten after the first three weeks of my return. Shed walk around naked, her waxen flesh clinging like shrinkwrap to her bones and joints. A dark bruise covered her mouth and ran down her chin and throat, between her shrivelled breasts, to her emaciated belly. 

Days would go by when shed remain in her room, never leaving the bed. Images of the nightmarish body in which my beloved sister had become an organ flickered in and out of my perception.  When the flickers came, Id see the monstrous shape shed called the white man hovering above her; its thick umbilicus carrying gelatinous solids down her throat. The network of translucent, biological tubes throughout the home contracted and expanded as unidentifiable substances shuttled in and out of the white man.

Weeks went by. The old house, which had been so still the whole time Id been back, began to see activity. Real, tangible activity - not just my visions. Even though Joy never left her room anymore, she began to have visitors. Men. Men of all shapes and sizes and walks of life. Theyd enter the house, climb the stairs, spend a minute or two with my sister, and leave. They paid me no attention. Even when I followed one of them in and saw what theyd been doing to Joy, they acted like I wasnt there. Days went by. Hundreds and hundreds of men visited. After another week, they stopped. The house was silent again.

Joy, or what remained of her, wouldnt leave her bedroom. She couldnt if she wanted to. The damage from the weight of the hundreds of men had splintered her hips. But she was alive. She was wide-eyed and alert, breathing regularly, and being nourished by the atrocity which remained hovering above her. 

I wouldnt leave her alone for very long. I wanted to call an ambulance, but I knew Id be taken from the home and put in state custody if anyone discovered I was unguarded. That meant I stayed on or around the property. I grew more and more compelled to visit the tree which had caused me to miss so much time. Part of me was hoping the event would happen again and Id emerge in a future where things had somehow gotten better. I think, in the back of my mind, I needed even more. I wanted so badly to be pulled into the past and get to see my parents again. Even in Joys terrible physical state, she looked like the pictures Id seen of Mom when she was young. Sometimes the connection was too much for me to handle.

Once I made up my mind to venture into the forest to visit the tree, it came to me instead. I woke up and found it growing, upside-down, out of my ceiling. Unaffected by gravity, its long, thin branches stretched out in the same positions and angles as when Id first seen it. When I tried to touch the thing, my hand passed right through. During the phased flickers of my visions, I noticed the network of intestinal highways had detoured around the tree, giving it a wide berth. It remained there, visible yet untouchable, for a long time.

A month passed. Then two. The house was a tomb. I spent my time watching television next to my bedridden sister; her eyes wide with hope and her mouth gaping as the often-invisible tube delivered nourishment into her body. Shed taken to running her hands up and down her belly. It was another few months before I realized why. By then, the venerators had started showing up. Her venerators.

This part of the story is the hardest for me to tell. Even having to recall the deaths of my parents, which devastated me, wasnt as existentially disturbing as what happened to Joy. Much of it is a blur of terror and confusion. Its what I watched from the slatted door of her closet over the course of three days. I dont want to write about it for fear I will be a worse person for having to relive the events. But I need to. It has to be known.

Men and women came to see Joy as her body swelled with the new life inside her. They, too, paid me no attention. I was just part of the scenery. Still, as their numbers grew, I felt the need to hide. So I did. I watched from Joys closet as the room packed with people who spoke about her in hushed tones. Spoke about her baby with crazy, hyperbolic grandeur. When the room was at capacity and I could barely see between the venerators huddled against the closed door where I hid, it happened.

I want to say Joy gave birth, but that would be a lie. The child literally exploded out of her and showered the venerators nearest her pelvis with gore. Joy never made a sound. The venerators, though, began to weep. I couldnt see her baby. Somehow, though, I heard it. It was talking. And the nightmare began.

The venerators bit the skin from their bodies. One by one, they chewed it into a pulp and spit it into the mouth of the baby. The child started to steam. I could feel its heat and humidity from my hiding place. Once the baby was strong enough, it started to bite and chew the crowd on its own. The steam was blinding and I had to curl in a ball on the floor of the closet for fear of being burned. I cried as the sounds of chewing filled the room. Bodies fell to the floor, leaking their fluids into the closet and soaking my clothes. I sobbed and prayed it would end.

After a while, it did. The heat died down. The steam dissipated. I peeked out between the slats in the door again, and for the first time, I saw the child. But it wasnt an infant. She looked at least 12 or 13. She stood, naked and soaked with blood, over her mother. With a vile, wet sound, she regurgitated some of what shed consumed and drooled it into Joys mouth. My sister, whod been unconscious the whole time, awoke with a start. She looked around with bewilderment. When her eyes met those of the creature shed brought into the world, she began to scream.

The child walked toward the window and tore the panes away with an effortless motion. Then she dropped out of the house onto the ground below. I burst out of the closet and slipped and slid my way across the gore of the countless venerators bodies and went to my sister. She was still screaming. This time, I could tell it was from pain. The lower half of her body was gone. All that remained was a crater cauterized by the heat of whatever had happened. The rest of her skin, too, was burned. 

Where are you?, she screamed toward the ceiling. It took me a moment to realize the white man was gone. The images of the intestines spanning the house flickered back into my vision. Nothing was above my sister. Shed been abandoned. At that point, I knew Joy would die if she didnt receive medical attention. Shed probably die anyway. I ran from the room to make a phone call. There was no dial tone. The phones were disconnected. 

Frantically, I ran back to her, not knowing what to do. As I climbed the stairs, I stopped in my tracks. Long, black branches were travelling from the tree on my ceiling to the room of my sister. They touched the hideous wounds on her skin and pushed through, entering her ruined body. Her screaming stopped. I thought she had to be dead. But her eyes opened and she smiled at me. She reached toward her bedside table and opened the drawer. Inside was a note. I asked her if it was something I should read. Joy studied me for a moment, then nodded. She whispered something and I moved closer so I could hear. Extinguish the stars, Joy muttered. 

As dread filled me, I unfolded the letter and read aloud what shed left for me. Once I finished, the long limbs of the black tree began to shudder.

*To freeze is to extinguish  
the constellations; the stars.  
Decadent warmth turned cold  
in black and pristine space.  
To end.  
To erase.*  


*She can erase.  
She can extinguish  
each glowing obscenity in space  
which mocks the cold:  
the stars!  
She is their end.*  


*End  
now! Erase  
and then extinguish  
the pox upon space -  
the blight against the cold  
purity of void - the hated stars.*  


*And Her reign without stars -  
the celestial end;  
with no more to erase  
or extinguish,  
begins Her Kingdom of Space:  
the glory of Her cold.*  


*Her cold will  
antithesize stars.  
Fires to extinguish;  
light to erase;  
warmth to end.  
Our Future Queen of Space.*  


*Weep at the deathbed of warm space  
as matter succumbs to cold  
and the depraved era of stars  
reaches its end.  
Soon, nothing more to erase.  
Soon, no more light to extinguish.*  


*And She will extinguish light from space.  
And She will turn the stars cold.  
The end is the rape of constellations. To reign is to erase.*

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For as long as I can remember, Ive wanted to be an otter. When I was six, Mom brought me to the Maritime Center in Norwalk. It was my birthday. Things had been really difficult for us since Dad died the year before. Mom worked long hours and I spent so much time in day care. For a while, it felt like everything was falling apart. But Mom knew I was having a hard time. She did her best to let me know I was loved. And on my sixth birthday, I truly realized how much.

Mom knew how much I adored otters. I had pictures of them from National Geographic hung up all around my room. [This one was the best.](http://imgur.com/n2XyoJk) I had little stuffed otter toys, too, like [Ollie here.](http://imgur.com/K6pnkHp) They made me feel safe and happy. But until then, Id only seen otters on television and in magazines. When Mom surprised me with a trip to the Maritime Center, I started crying. We walked through the halls, bypassing all the aquariums featuring stingrays and jellyfish and giant lobsters. After what felt like an eternity, we made it to their glass-walled habitat.

I stood, transfixed, and watched their sleek, furry bodies navigate their enclosure. Itd been designed to look like the local estuary from which they came. I marvelled at how quickly they could dart across solid ground and dive into the water where theyd move with equal speed and grace. Then, as I watched, I finally saw it. Two otters, tired from playing around, floated together in the water. I shook with anticipation, praying Id get to witness what Id dreamed about. The otter on the right held out its left paw. The left otter held out its right. Then they clasped them together in a gesture of closeness while they peacefully floated.

While I watched the beautiful display, I felt a soft hand wrap around my own. It was mom. She looked down at me and smiled her warm, loving smile. We stayed that way for a long time.

Looking back, that was the best moment of my life. The decades that followed were nothing but heartbreak. Mom passed away when I was 14. Cancer. We had no other family, so I was put in foster care. My foster parents were kind, but distant. They didnt try to understand me. I know they thought I was weird. I guess maybe I was. A teenage boy with a love of otters and no friends doesnt sound normal. Because of that abnormality, I started getting picked on at school.

It started off innocuous. Just some name-calling in the hall. Freak, fag, retard; the basic high school Freshman insults. Over time, though, starting around my Sophomore year, the negativity got worse. A lot of it stemmed from when I tried to join the swim team. Id never been a competitive swimmer. I wasnt in particularly good shape, either. Add to that a body that was extraordinarily hairy for a 15 year old, and I became an easy target of the schools more vicious bullies.

Verbal insults increased in frequency and physical violence became the norm. I dont need to get into it, because it makes me sad to think about, but there were many times I was simply punched in the face as I walked down the hall. Sometimes Id get kicked in the crotch. One time, someone reached up my shirt and smeared their gum into my chest hair. And all the time, they laughed. I wouldnt wear my otter shirts anymore. The other students were ruthless with their bullying whenever they saw me with a picture of my favorite animal. Someone started a terrible rumor that since Id never had a girlfriend, I must have sex with otters. And when they noticed I cried whenever they insinuated such a hurtful, despicable act, it became their insult of choice.

Once or twice, school officials would punish the most flagrant abusers if their words or actions happened to be noticed. But for the most part, it was under the schools radar. I never said anything. As it all went on, my foster parents never had a clue because they never asked how I was doing. Even if they did, I dont think I would have told them. My grades were decent enough. Thats all that mattered to them.

By the time I was a Senior, the bulk of the bullying had died down. Still, not a day went by when I could say people were kind to me. I was growing sick of the feeling of isolation that plagued me from the moment I woke up to the time I collapsed back in my bed at night, usually in tears. When the school posted a notice asking for someone to work in the pool area in the afternoons, I decided to apply. It was pretty low-effort work. Some organizing, some water testing, but mostly just cleaning up the messes of the day. No one else was interested, so I was hired on the spot.

The shift was short; about 3 hours starting at 4pm. Most of the students were gone by then. The swim teams season was over, so they didnt have practice. Some of the teachers liked to swim and get some exercise around that time, though, so I made sure their locker rooms had towels and were relatively clean. It all went well. I made a few bucks. Nothing much, but more than I was used to.

Once everyone left, Id swim by myself. Id float on my back and glide through the still water while my imagination ran wild. Id imagine myself in an estuary filled with otters and fish and seabirds. Wed all be happy and everyone would get along. I stretched out my hand, half hoping another understanding person would grab it and wed float away together. Soon after, Id leave. While I walked home each night, I would cry.

After graduating high school, I kept the job. They were happy to have me. There wasnt a chance Id go to college and endure any more abuse, so I was perfectly content with keeping the status quo. My foster parents were glad to have me around, especially once I began giving them a small bit of my take-home money as rent.

When the next school year started up, the swim team started practicing again. Id hover around the pool area, doing my various jobs, and every so often Id hear the team laughing at me. Theyd point an insult or two in my direction, but Id just keep my head down and stay on task. After work, Id head home like I always did, have my dinner, and retreat to my bedroom where Id sit at my computer and watch videos of otters until I was too tired to continue. [This one was my favorite.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=de6uTMEiZf0) I still think about it all the time.

On a night in October, when I was finishing up my shift, someone was banging on the door to the pool and demanding that they be let in. It was two swim team members and their mother. Theyd missed practice in the afternoon and they said they had to get their laps in or else the coach would force them to miss their next meet. I apologized and said the pool was closed. Their mother started to yell, so I unlocked the door to let her in so we could discuss it. As soon as I opened it, her sons pushed by me, stripped down to their swimsuits, and jumped in the water. While the mother screamed, her pregnant belly bumping against me as she got closer and closer, I closed my eyes and wished I could run away. So I did.

I turned around and ran toward the supply room. Id left it open while I cleaned, so once I got in I slammed the door behind me, locked it, and sat on a bucket while I cried. The mother laughed at me from the other side of the door while yelling to her sons, is this that otter fucker you told me about? I heard the boys laughing as they did their laps. The woman gave one final pound on the door before she muttered, loud enough for me to hear, I cant imagine what that freaks mother must be like.

Everything went red, then white. I found myself travelling down a lazy river. I was on my back, staring at the sky. It was bright blue and dotted with puffy cumulous clouds. Thick, green grass grew all the way to the riverbank. As the river turned and I bumped into the grass, it felt soft against my furry skin. The water slowed as the river drained into a wide, clear lake. I craned my neck around and saw her. I let the gentle current take me, and I gradually drifted closer. Once I got there, I held out my paw. She grasped it in her own. 

Mom and I floated together for a while. The sensation of closeness was almost as wonderful as my birthday at the Maritime Center. Then it got even better. Mom had been hiding my new baby brother in the crook of her other arm. She reached over and sat him on my chest. He squirmed for a minute, but then he was still. Comfortable. Safe. I closed my eyes and felt the warm sun on my downy fur. 

When I opened my eyes, I was staring at the ceiling of the pool room. The bodies of the two swimmers floated lifelessly in the shallow end, blood blossoming in the water from their slit throats. I floated, silently, clasping the hand of their mother. She was facing the ceiling, breathing shallowly. I glanced over at her. A gaping wound in her belly was spilling blood all around us. Her breathing stopped. I felt her start to sink and I turned to pull her toward me, but something on my chest shifted and nearly fell. I dropped the dead womans hand and picked up what was resting on me. Her baby. It wasnt breathing.

I worked hard not to panic and I retreated back to my safe place. If I ever really wanted to be an otter, this was as close as Id get. I felt the sunlight on my fur again as I clutched my baby brother to my chest. I looked over, hoping mom would be there, ready to hold my hand. But shed ducked underwater to get us some fish to eat. It would all work out in the end. My paws stroked the tiny form of my brother as I floated in the tranquil lake, waiting anxiously for him to wake from his nap so we could play. I love him so, so much.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Months ago, my neighbor Gwen sent a [diary shed found](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3vb2jk/i_found_a_diary_while_i_was_out_hiking_in_new/) to the Centers for Disease Control which detailed the experiences of a woman and her husband 20 years ago. Everything written inside sounded like complete horseshit. Blair Witch Project and alien abduction and Lars Von Trier garbage all wrapped up in one cliche-loaded package. Still, there were some parts that concerned me enough to agree with Gwens belief that it should be investigated. Especially the nature of the fluids that had encrusted on the pages. Last month, she received a letter from the CDC thanking her for the diary, but thats it. No explanations. I figured shed made a big deal out of nothing.

A week ago, though, Gwen started acting strangely. Shed show up on at my door at all hours of the night. She didnt rant and rave like a lunatic, but she said really disconcerting things. Things about demons and hell and all sorts of satanic nonsense. Then shed point up at the sky and tell me to watch the red light. Always something about the red light. Like a light shining through blood, Gwen whispered. 

Since Id moved to the area a couple years ago, Gwen and I had gotten along pretty well. We hiked together and she helped me get to know the woods around our properties. Shed always been an avid hiker and knew far more about the forest than I, so I was grateful for her guidance. The other day, despite the strangeness of her late-night visits and claims, I agreed to go on a hike with her. It was inordinately warm for February, even up here in Pittsburg, NH. We traced out a route on the map and hit the trails.

A few miles in, we realized we hadnt dressed properly. It was far colder than wed anticipated. The wind had picked up and dead leaves were whipping by our legs while we walked. We decided to pick up the pace. Not long after, though, as snow began to fall, I was surprised to see bolts of lightning streaking across the sky. Wed had thundersnow up here before, but never with such strong electrical activity. Peals of thunder shook the forest and the snow came down in buckets. I started to worry, but Gwen told me to stay calm. She showed me how the sky in the distance was much brighter than the black clouds above us. The storm would be over shortly.

And she was right. Well, half right. The brightness moved in, but its color changed as it did. Once the stormclouds were gone, the sky was alive with dark-red atmospheric disturbances which reminded me of the mammatus clouds I used to see in Florida. But this was definitely not a cloud formation. I can only describe it as transparent liquid. I remembered what Gwen had whispered to me a few nights earlier: like a light shining through blood. I asked her, with obvious fear in my voice, is thats what shed seen. She told me it was, then hugged me while saying how relieved she was that I could see it too.

Minutes passed while we stood on the trail with our heads craned to the sky, transfixed by the seething undulations of the phenomenon. A sound unlike any Id ever heard detonated all around us, causing Gwen and me to jump and cover our ears. It was a bellowing drone that reminded me of a fog horn, only somehow organic and wet. I couldnt figure out what direction it was coming from; I just knew it was everywhere. 

My view of the sky shook as the amplitude of the noise grew. I saw birds and squirrels falling out of the trees and not moving when they hit the snow-covered ground. Pain streaked through my head and everything began to flicker. I saw black spots forming in my vision and I was certain I was going to pass out. The spots grew and grew as I sobbed and prayed for it all to stop. And then it did. The silence was only broken by the sound of my rapid heartbeat and the blood rushing in my head. 

As Gwen and I took our hands from our ears, I noticed the black spots were still plaguing my vision. I shook my head. The spots remained, but they were stationary. I looked down at the snow. No spots. I gazed outward again. There they were. Gwen mumbled something about her eyes. She saw them too. Ten of them. As we headed forward, we could see they were areas of space where the sky should have been. When I squinted, I could see stars twinkling inside. I was terrified.

We continued along the trail, our movements slowed by the four inches of snow that had made the path slippery. The sound exploded around us again. We clasped our hands to our ears and stared at the spots, which I then realized were holes. They leaked. Fluid drooled from them and poured out of their places in the sky in a thick, yellow line. Solid matter followed. Long strips of what looked like intestines or esophaguses fell straight down into the woods. The nearest hole, about a hundred yards from us, was leaving the trees draped with gore and viscous, yellow slime.

Again, silence replaced the din. But the activity in the bloody sky remained. The holes still leaked. Pieces of hard, solid material fell next, shattering when they hit the trees and taking branches and bark with them. Then skin. Flesh rained from  the holes and tangled itself in the remaining tree branches. After a minute, the grisly display ended. The stars inside the holes faded into nothingness and the holes themselves dissolved. The blue sky broke through its bloody mask.

Gwen and I walked in stunned silence. We were closing in on the spot where the vile matter had fallen. The smell was beyond all comprehension. We retched and tried not to breathe as we hurried by. It looked like a slaughterhouse had exploded and had been doused in thick, syrupy urine. After a minute, wed gotten by and were on clean snow again. But then we heard something that caused us to turn around. 

The material was moving on its own. It had animated into a whirling thundercloud of viscera and was funnelling itself into three spots on the ground. Each spot grew. In horror, I recognized the formation of small, humanoid shapes. In the distance, I could hear the same wet rustling. I knew the other nine locations had to be producing their own creatures. Ragged bone structures stood while jellied fluid coated their surfaces. Entrails wrapped around the bones and flesh enveloped it all. Sounds of skin-on-skin friction rose from the hideous bodies as the flesh tightened and gave features to the things. They all moaned in a quieter, but otherwise identical, sound to what had nearly deafened Gwen and me. Gwen pulled at my shirt and said we had to get out of here. But I needed to watch.

Two of the creatures, which I can only describe as looking like human toddlers, started to move. Before the production of the third one could finish, they attacked it. Its body was torn to shreds and consumed. As they ate, steam rose from their bodies and they grew larger as they metabolized and incorporated their siblings mass into their own. When theyd finished, two young adolescent girls stood in the gore of their birthplace. They looked at us, looked into the forest, and ran.

Gwen and I took a cue from them and moved as quickly as the trail conditions would allow. The moment we returned to our homes, we called 911. There was a brief investigation, many, many questions, and then nothing. Its been a week and neither of us have heard anything. No one else had called to report the sky conditions or the terrible sound. But I know what we saw. Ten holes, and if what happened with the one near us was what happened to the other nine, 20 children. 20 things. I have no idea what it all means.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Our grandfather was obsessed with safety. Whenever my brother and I went out, hed tell us to be careful and watch out for cars and slippery spots on the ground. If we were playing around the house, hed demand we keep an eye out for sharp corners on the coffee table or wires we might trip over. Even when we were going to bed, hed stand over us and warn about the dangers of our blankets getting wrapped around our necks. Hed demand that we listen to each other breathe if we ever woke up in the middle of the night. Just to make sure. 

To make matters worse, hed follow us in his pickup truck wherever we went, the loaded gun rack dissuading anyone from interfering with us. We could see him when we were in school, always parked outside, just in case anything might happen. As Reggie and I got older, we started to get tired of his nagging. We werent kids anymore. We didnt need to be coddled and watched over. 

When we turned 16, Reggie and I got a present very uncharacteristic of our safety-fetishing grandfather. Hed adopted two adult dogs. Twin brothers, just like me and Reg. They were Caucasian Ovcharkas; apparently the same breed he used to work with when he was stationed in Siberia, back before he and grandma moved to the States. Over the 11 years wed lived with him, wed never been allowed to go near any dogs. Even little ones. Theyll kill your brother, hed always say. The guilt wed feel from that statement would always get one of us to tell the other to leave the animal alone.

The Ovcharkas were truly enormous. Id never seen such massive dogs. They were both well over 200lbs and neither of them were overweight. When I leaned over and gave one a tentative pat, it felt like there was iron under the thick fur. Its tail didnt wag and it didnt look at me. Both animals just stared at grandpa. We were told their names were Mikhail and Sergey.

Reggie looked as uncomfortable as I felt. We thanked our grandfather for our gifts, but it was obvious we were unnerved. Grandpa asked us if we remembered the dog wed had before our parents had died. Neither of us did. He told us it was a beagle named Chair. A useless animal, he informed us. 

As our birthday dragged on, grandpa taught us how to care for the Ovcharkas. For the first few hours, theyd only listen to him. Whenever we spoke to them or even tried pushing them in the direction we wanted them to go, theyd wait for him to give the command before moving. By nighttime, though, the dogs had started to accept the commands from my brother and me. Their responses werent instantaneous, like they were with grandpa, but it was still progress. 

The next day, we realized why wed gotten our presents. The dogs were never to leave our sides. Rather than grandpa cautioning and watching us all day, every day, hed simply transferred his authority over to the animals. We were pissed. Reggie especially. Hed always been the more outspoken one, and, as a result, had most often incurred grandpas wrath. This time, though, Reggie wasnt slapped when he called the whole arrangement bullshit. Grandpa wrinkled his deeply-scarred face and yelled something in Russian. The dogs leapt at my brother. Reggie screamed and flailed, but the dogs had him on the ground in an instant. They stood over him, growling and frothing, until Grandpa yelled another word we didnt understand. They backed away and Reggie got up. He didnt complain anymore.

Since we were on summer vacation, we had a lot of downtime. Wherever we went, though, the dogs followed. Wed walk down the street with the two colossi in tow. Theyd growl at anyone who came near, whether it was at one of our friends who came up to say hello or at the cashier at the store who yelled that no dogs were allowed in the place. Anyone who presented even a hit of a potential threat was intimidated by the growling guard dogs. For Mikhail and Sergey, a potential threat was being within five feet of us.

On a hot day in early August, we were at the lake down the street. As usual, no one wanted to be near us because of the two wary, grumpy Ovcharkas. Reggie and I went swimming. The dogs, of course, swam alongside. Out of absolutely nowhere, there was a speed boat bearing down on us. Before anyone, dog or person, could react, Reggie was struck. The hull of the boat crushed his skull and the propeller tore through his skin like wet paper. The driver just kept going.

Reggies corpse floated face-up in the bloody water. His face was destroyed. One eye was completely missing while the other draped itself over his left cheek. From groin to chin, there was nothing but a gory channel the same diameter as the boats propeller. Tangles of his shredded intestines leaked their contents into the water. Mikhail and Sergey swam in silence, staring at his carcass.

I was beside myself with panic and rage. I screamed and tried to drag my brothers body toward the shore. As soon as I touched him, Sergey bit my arm. Hard. I let go of Reggie and hit the dog. He stopped biting. Again, I tried to move my brother. Another bite. This time, the dog pulled me away from Reggie while Mikhail swam in a circle around my brothers body. I felt my radius and ulna snap under the pressure of Sergeys jaw. I shrieked and started punching the animal. My assault did nothing to release the pressure.

Mikhails growl caught my attention. I felt it in my chest before I could hear it. I whirled around and saw something moving inside Reggie. No, not inside. All over. His skin was undulating and stretching while the bones underneath popped and crackled, as if they were all breaking. His ribs spread twice the width of his chest, some puncturing through the flesh as they went. The remains of his guts started slapping and flopping around like a net full of eels poured onto the deck of a fishing boat. A deep, resonant moan rose from the destroyed form of my brother.

I started to back away. This time, Sergey let me move. I swam backward while watching the unbelievable scene unfold. Both dogs watched Reggie while I stood on shore, overcome by fear and confusion. I felt a hand on my shoulder. I yelped and spun around to see the scarred face of my grandfather. Hed been following us again. He held a shotgun. On our sides, bathers were running from the lakeside toward the cars. Watch, grandpa instructed.

What I once knew as Reggie flailed and howled. The water, turbid from his unhuman thrashings, was pink and foamy from the release of his blood and other bodily fluids. His moaning intensified, causing me to cover my ears. I turned to run, but he held me by the back of my neck and wouldnt let me move. Watch, he hissed.

Reggie stopped moving. The dogs, whod been paddling close to him, barked furiously. Massive stalactites of bone began to erupt from the remains of my brother. As they burst through, the dogs attacked. They tore at the already-damaged flesh of the creature, ripping out thick chunks before pushing their faces in to get more. As they bit, the Reggie-creature moved toward us. As the water around it grew shallower, more of its body was revealed to us. It walked on five pillars of articulated bone; the segments joined by oozing, fatty tissue. It moved slowly, but deliberately. Bulbous, white eyes squeezed themselves from the cracked sockets of its skull. They rotated and then focused on my grandfather and me. He held me tighter.

As it walked, the dogs were tearing more and more of its body to shreds. Sergey attacked its legs. As the gristle and fat were pulled from between the segments, the creature slowed. Still, it didnt stop. An ossified spike shot from the rib-area of the monster, impaling Sergey through his chest. The dog was dead. Mikhail, in a renewed frenzy, tore the remaining connective tissue from the other four legs. By the time it had stopped moving, it was only ten feet away from us. Mikhail ripped the creature apart, spitting its bowels and meat from its bulbous eyes all over the sand. And then he stopped. Whatever Reggie had become was dead.

Grandpa let me go. Mikhail ambled over to Sergey and began to lick the mortal wound in his brothers chest. He whimpered and sat in the sand, panting. I sobbed as the pressure Id felt released. My grandfather slapped me and held my face in a vicegrip between his leathery palms. I stared at the deep latticework of scars covering his face.

I always thought it wouldve been you, he hissed. My grandfather made the same mistake with me. He traced the facial scars with his fingernail. Then he grabbed my broken arm, causing me to yelp. At least thisll heal.

I glanced over my shoulder. The remains of the monster had turned into a foul-smelling gelatin. Seabirds were diving and collecting it in their beaks before it could absorb into the sand. Those who managed to get a beakful died moments later, falling from the sky into the lake or on the sand.

I thought your father knew better, grandpa grunted as we walked. I didnt say anything. He kept mumbling in frustration when we got into the house. A fucking beagle, he murmured. I sat on the couch and cried.

*You have pretty hands.* 

*I love how you do your nails.*

*How did you get your skin to be so smooth?*

He stayed with me all day and all night. As the days went by, though, I must have done something to make the ghost angry. Instead of mawkish pleasantries, the messages grew negative.

*Ive seen other girls with prettier hands.*

*What happened to your nails?*

*Im sorry your skin looks so dry nowadays.*

I started to get upset. Id grown fond of the little ghost. Since hed always been so positive, it was comforting. But once he started to get mean, I wondered what Id done wrong. I didnt want my ghost to feel like Id disappointed him.

One night, as I was getting ready for bed, I saw the ghost in the mirror. He looked up at me as I brushed my teeth and said, with sadness in his voice, your cuticles are so ragged and ugly.

I looked down at my hands. He was right. I hadnt been taking care of them at all since I started that art class. Bits of skin and hangnails sprouted from each cuticle. They were red and angry.

Can you get rid of them for me? The ghost sounded so hopeful. I couldnt bear to make him feel like I wasnt the good person he initially believed me to be. What if he left?

I grabbed the corner of a thick hangnail on the side of my left middle finger. I started to pull backward. It hurt terribly. The ghost, his eyes brimming with hope, told me I was doing such a great job. Even through the pain of what I was doing, I was overwhelmed by relief. I was finally doing something right.

I kept working on the hangnail. After a little while, Id pulled a thin strip from the side of my finger, up my hand, and across my arm to the inside of my elbow. It stung terribly, but as tears of joy flooded from the ghosts eyes, I started to wonder if things were getting back to normal.

Your hand is looking a tiny bit better, the ghost informed me. Maybe someday you can be pretty again.

I spent the next hour tearing the skin and nails from my fingers. Even though they bled and I thought they looked terrible, the ghost smiled and assured me I had the hands of a beautiful angel. Through my tears, I smiled.

As the days went by, I did what I could to make the ghost happy. Sometimes, hed get in a bad mood. Just the other night, he told me the skin on my lips was ugly and chapped. I pulled the chapped skin away. Some of it went pretty far up my cheeks before it tore. But it was okay. The ghost talked on and on about how kissable Id become.

My parents arrived at my apartment this morning. They hadnt said they were coming, but it was a nice surprise. Itd been a while. But when they saw my face and my hands, they were horrified. My mom sobbed, what happened to your beautiful face? My dad, almost at the same time, exclaimed, oh my God your hands are ruined! 

Tears started to leak from my eyes. Off in the corner, my ghost sighed, theyre the ones who make us so sad, arent they? I agreed.

Ten minutes later, as I worked to saw their bodies into small parts, I asked the ghost if hed be happier now that they werent around. No answer. I turned around to see if he was listening. The little ghost was gone.

	<TEXT> After the earthquake, we were trapped. We assumed rescue efforts were underway, but itd been three weeks. No one came. There was more than enough for us to drink, thanks to a burst pipe that trickled clean water through the ceiling. But that just meant we were dying more slowly. Starvation seemed imminent. 

Liz thought all the other floors of the hotel had to be right on top of us. All 60 of them. How the two of us managed to avoid being crushed seemed like a miracle. Well, at first it did. As the days dragged on, and we came to the gradual realization we might not get rescued, the miracle soured. After two weeks, it was more like a curse. 

We couldnt give up, though. I constantly coaxed Liz down from hysterics which, during their worst periods, had her threatening to slam her throat onto a jagged piece of rebar. Talking about Lena and Clair helped. If we were going to get out of this, theyd need their mom. Theyd need both of us.

Talk was cheap, though. No matter how much we held one another and cried, praying that the catharsis would diminish our agony, our stomachs growled. After the first week, Id started to grow dizzy. Had I not been sitting, I know I would have passed out. But we both sat and maintained an atrocious lucidity about where we were, what was happening, and how the likelihood of our escape was dwindling.

A few times, off in a distance blocked by hundreds of feet of concrete and steel debris, we heard the sounds of rescue equipment. Saws, bulldozers, all that. Not one voice, though. Thats how far inside we were. The day it happened, wed been getting on the elevator, which was in the center of the hotel. Once the quake started, it just shuddered and began to fall. Somehow, as the building swayed, the plunge of the elevator car was arrested by the angle of the shaft. We still came down very, very hard, but had it not been for that slight angle, no one would have survived. 

Since a couple days after the earthquake, the air had been growing ripe with the odor of putrefaction. I couldnt even begin to imagine how many people were dead in the rubble. The hotel seemed packed to the gills that day. Ill admit, I was jealous of those who were crushed and died instantly. I know Liz was, too.

Toward the end of the third week, our desperation had reached its peak. All Liz talked about was how shed abandoned the kids at home. She called herself a failure, even though she knew this whole, terrible thing was out of her control. It was only then that I broached the subject of Kevin.

I flicked my lighter, illuminating the carcass of our eldest son, who stood like a twisted, decaying scarecrow on the other side of the elevator. Hed been impaled and crushed when debris fell on top of the car after we hit bottom. I crawled over to his body and told Liz to close her eyes. I bit, spit into my palm, and moved back over to my wife.

Keep your eyes closed, I instructed, and think about getting home to Clair and Lena. In the dark of the elevator car, her sobs quieted as she chewed. I went back and got her more, as well as some for myself. The moment I heard her swallow the last piece, the rubble above us started to move. I was ready for the cave-in. Almost happy for it. Seconds later, we were blinded by a flashlight.

	<TITLE> Cracks in the Foundation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-29 03:18:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Things turned sour between my wife and I before we were married. Before our marriage was even recognized by our state, in fact. There was too much mistrust; too many incidents from our respective pasts had bubbled up to commandeer our attention. But we soldiered on. The gesture of our marriage, we agreed, was more important than the fraying of our bond.

As the months dragged on, we worked to rekindle the essential elements of our relationship. For the most part, we were successful. Janelles sharp edges, honed by the coarseness of our interactions over our most difficult times, began to dull. Mine, too, softened. For a while, things felt good. Comforting. Familiar.

Familiarity, though, would beget slothfulness. Its what Id worried would happen. Every night, when we were curled up together in our bed, Janelle would snore and Id be plagued by fear. It was the fear of inevitability. No matter how well things were going, once we got our wheels back in the familiar rut of our old routines, I knew our foundation would resume its inexorable deterioration. There was only so much damage it could endure before everything wed worked to build would topple.

We both felt pangs of stress before either of us articulated our concerns. Janelle started drinking again. She wouldnt stumble around drunkenly, but not a day went by when I didnt smell it on her breath. She made no attempt to hide it. I, too, regressed. I was overeating - just like how Id done before we met, when food was the only way I could escape the reality of my depression. When Janelle and I started our relationship, I was elated. My self-loathing melted away, taking 25lbs with it. But each time our connection felt like it was weakening, the first thing I turned to for comfort was junk food. Now I down a pint of ice cream every night while she polishes off a bottle of wine.

If it wasnt for our sex life, I think our relationship would have ended after our first fight. But I freely admit - were hedonists. We escape reality through physical gratification, whether its food for me, alcohol for her, or sex for us both. The pleasure we give one another has always purged the most toxic of the venom from our respective battle wounds. We both knew it was escapism. Neither of us cared. We needed to feel good and we had the ability to provoke that feeling in one another. 

This morning, we were sitting at the breakfast table and drinking our coffee. As Id always expected but never anticipated, Janelle announced her intention to leave me. I didnt say anything. I just stared into my coffee; the black liquid and the white mug defocusing and hazing as tears filled my eyes. I asked her if shed finally chosen Alana over me. She nodded and began to sob. We didnt talk much after that.

A few hours ago, as Janelle was packing, she came over to where I sitting and hugged me. She held me for a long time. I sat, motionless, doing my best not to bawl. But she wouldnt let go. I hated her. She kissed my cheek. My ear. My jawline. I felt warmth between my thighs. I hated my body. I turned and met her kisses. After less than a minute, we were undressed. Her tongue explored me and I writhed beneath her ministrations, despising her cowardice and antipathy toward our relationship while I clutched her head and ground against her mouth. I shuddered and saw flashes of our earlier life together as I came; my pleasure decaying into oversensitivity as I pulled her by the hair to stop her rough tongue from scraping over any more of me.

Janelles face wore a rictus of self-satisfaction and wanton lust. I could smell her arousal and knew it would be my only opportunity to finally give her what she needed. My final opportunity to get what I craved. I wasnt gentle with her. It was what shed always asked for but Id refused to provide. This last time, though, she could have it all. I scratched. Bit. Pulled her hair. She arched her back and mewled in mindless pleasure which only infuriated and further-motivated me. Mewls became moans. Moans became screams. And screams became gasps as her muscles tensed and she collapsed on the sofa, wide-eyed and sweating. She lay on her back, splayed, dripping, and utterly exposed. I kissed her forehead and watched, transfixed, as warmth drooled from her inviting slit. Throat.

	<TITLE> Rats in the Barn </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-27 23:13:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was 19, I worked for a local exterminator. I wasnt licensed to use the chemicals, but I did inspections. A potential customer would call the company, theyd send me out to take some notes and pictures, give the property owner a quote, and my boss would come out and kill whatever little critters were causing a problem.

On a particularly busy day, I was scheduled to visit a barn on the far edge of some guys ranch thatd been infested with rats. Hed thought about demolishing it and starting over, but I guess there was some sentimental value because he and his dad built the place a while back. Didnt matter to me.

I was surprised by how big the barn was. Two full floors, also. The place was packed with old equipment, boxes, and whatnot. The owner said the rats were probably attracted to the grain crates thatd sat, unopened, for the last few decades. I told him he was probably right, then he went back to the house while I started looking around.

I went up to the loft first. There were a few droppings, but nothing that made me think of an infestation. It didnt look like anyone had been up to the loft in a while; lots of cobwebs and dust all over the place. I found a couple dead rats tucked into some corners. I took pictures and noted a few gnawed holes in the walls. When I turned back around to head back to the ladder, without any warning or straining sound, the floor below me collapsed. I fell right through, hit my leg on a tall crate, flipped over, and landed on my head.

For a minute, I thought Id broken my neck. Thankfully, I could wiggle everything that mattered, but I quickly realized Id broken my arm. To make it worse, I was wedged, upside down, between two crates. I squirmed and tried to fall to either side, but my pant leg was caught on a series of large splinters jutting out of a crate. The area was very, very tight. Dusty, too. It wasnt particularly dark, thanks to the barns big windows, but I was terribly uncomfortable.

Ive never been particularly claustrophobic, but not being able to move from my position was terrifying. My broken right arm throbbed and my left, because of the bizarre way Id landed, was pinned behind me. All I could move was my left leg, but only to kick pitifully at the crates. 

As the seconds ticked by, I started praying the rats wouldnt find me. I was fairly certain Id panic if they came. I began hollering for help, squirming pretty hard until I realized how it caused pain to explode through my broken arm. The homeowner didnt come. But the rats didnt, either. I tried to control my breathing; I was inhaling a lot of dust.

Once my breathing finally returned to normal, I tried to lean in different ways, hoping to dislodge my pants from the wood. Then I felt something which made me gasp. The arm that had twisted behind me, which had been prickling from pins and needles as a result the awful position it was in, was prickling for something else, too. Something was crawling on me. Immediately, I thought of rats swarming and biting my eyes out. I screamed and flailed as agony erupted from the compound fracture. I expected to see the rats any minute.

But I didnt. I saw spiders. Countless, brown, semi-translucent spiders about the size of my palm were swarming all over my arm and had begun crawling up my shirt. Soon, I felt them on my chest and neck. I screamed and screamed as I watched them skittering in the dirt around my face. I used what little movement I had in my head and neck to crush a couple with my temple and the side of my face, feeling their bodies burst against my skin. But it was useless. There must have been a hundred of them. And the action of killing those two caused the others to start biting.

Pairs of fangs sunk into my skin from the top of my head all the way to my navel. I spasmed with futile panic and a few of them lost their grip on my skin and fell down onto my face and neck. Each of my rasping inhalations before my shrieks forced more dust from the floor into my throat. I felt my tongue get coated with the desiccating stuff, forcing me to stop screaming and close my mouth to try to get enough saliva to spit. The second before I closed my mouth, one of the spiders pushed itself in. I gagged and retched but it remained inside. In fact, it went further back toward my throat.

I flopped my tongue around, trying to get it out. It didnt budge. So I bit down. The spider exploded in my mouth, coating my tongue and palate with thick, bitter fluid. I retched again, uncontrollably, while dragging my guts-coated tongue against the very dirt I was hoping to get rid of just moments before. 

Dirt and dust flooded my throat and lungs while I gasped and flailed. Over and over, the things bit me. The bites were coming fewer and further between, though. The infinitesimal consolation I felt was annihilated after I crushed another spider near my head, however. When I lifted my head from the carcass, tiny babies which must have been riding on its body fanned out all over my face. They crawled into my eyebrows and eyelashes before moving toward my nose. I screamed louder than Ive ever screamed in my life.

In groups of what must have been at least ten, the spider babies crawled into my nose to seek shelter. I flopped my body back and forth in abject, disbelieving terror. In my thrashing, I freed my trapped arm. Immediately, I jammed my fingers into my nose, trying to scrape the things out of me. Blood flowed as my fingernails destroyed the delicate membranes and I desperately blew dirt-caked snot from my sinuses. I could still feel them. Without thinking, I just starting banging my face into the ground. I felt my nose break immediately and the pain as I continued smashing it into the dirt was incomprehensible. 

I felt two hands grab me and pull. Shocked and surprised, I fought against them, striking the person in the groin as he pulled me out of the area where Id fallen. He yelped and dropped me on my broken arm. But I was free. I scrambled out, blood streaming from my nose, and saw it was the property owner. Hed come running once hed heard my loudest scream.

He grabbed me by the healthy arm and dragged me to the other side of the barn, where a hose was plugged into the wall. He turned it on and sprayed me with it while I stripped off my clothes. After a minute or two, all the spiders were out of my clothes and off my body. He called for an ambulance as I stood there, naked, directing the stream from the nozzle into my destroyed nose. The ambulance got there 20 minutes later.

I needed plastic surgery to fix my face. My arm took almost a full year to be back to normal. I quit my job at the exterminator from my hospital bed. They told me not to worry about it; Id already been fired. The barn owner had demanded they pay for the damage Id done to his loft.

**March 12, 2015**

*5:15pm*

As much as I thought I had to, I wasnt ready to go into the village just yet. There were things I needed to do back in the lab. Annie and Jared obviously arent healthy and Im worried about how safe they are around one another. I remembered GeneMedica had supplied us with three bottles of Laphroaig 30 to use in celebration if we had any breakthroughs. So, I did what any self-respecting scientist would do: got my fellow researchers blackout drunk and locked them in their respective rooms with a fresh bottle to call their own. 

Then I called Rakesh. He seemed more freaked out than I was. Hed known Jared for 20 years; apparently hes in a 25+ year monogamous relationship with his partner, and, to directly quote Rakesh, gayer than gayer than gay. Rakesh agreed with me that stranger things have happened than two people pairing off when stuck in a bad situation, but with everything else going on - the spore eruption, the skin lesions, the pain/pleasure rewiring, and whatever the hell was happening to the villagers - it was impossible to say it was just a situational fling. He commended me for figuring out how to keep Jared and Annie safe, then he told me to get my ass into the village and take notes.

I have a sinking feeling its going to be really, really ugly.

*Update @ 8:00pm*

Its hard to form a coherent narrative when youve been traumatized. At the same time, its easy to recall the details of that which traumatized you. The first things I noticed, upon leaving the lab and starting the 100-or-so yard walk to the village, were the bird feathers. They were raining from the trees and blowing in the weak wind. I couldnt make out much through the thick canopy, but I could see one bird very clearly. It was perched on a branch nearest the trunk and vigorously rubbing its body against the bark. Once one side was denuded of feathers, it started on the other until the same result was achieved. Then it leapt from the branch and flew in a bizarre, insect-like trajectory that didnt seem to be going anywhere in particular. It went out of sight before I could learn what was happening to it.   

A dog ran out from the general direction of the village and stopped in front of me. Its fur was mangy and the visible flesh was punctured or rotted away. Its tail wagged furiously and its ears were up, making it look incredibly happy despite the painful-looking condition of its skin. I reached out to pat its head, and it obliged, pushing its snout and head against my palm very hard; almost as if itd never felt the touch of a person before. 

It ground its skull against my hand and I felt something slide. I recoiled and pulled back. The skin stuck to my gloved hand as I pulled, tearing the fur and flesh from its head. The dog, with blood trickling down its face and its tail still wagging, stared at me and began to eat itself off my glove. I didnt shoo it away. I didnt know what to do at all, aside from continuing my walk to the circle of huts.

With each step, the details of the natives, who still swarmed in the center of their village, became apparent. I can only describe their activity as an orgy. Every conceivable pairing was demonstrated, all the way up groups as large of six. Most sickening to me, aside from the atrocious and seemingly-indiscriminate disparities in the ages of the participants, were the injuries. Every person had terrible damage to their skin. It appeared to be the same as what Annie and Jared are dealing with, but most of the villagers were much worse off; likely due to their constant and frenetic activity with one another.

They paid me no attention as I walked through their midst. Every so often, Id come across a corpse. Each had profoundly-disfiguring damage to them. While I know some of it was the result the fungal spores effect, a good portion was clearly from the action of another person. This was verified when I saw a young man in the crowd, a rictus of pleasure etched across his face, having his entire back flayed open by his partner. The man gasped with clear delight, his nudity making obvious the arousal he felt despite the terrible injury. His partner pressed his face into the wound and planted tender kissed on the exposed ribs.

There were more acts like that, but theyve all blurred together. Im exhausted and overwhelmed. I called Rakesh once I got back and while he expressed eympathy for what I saw, he insisted on the importance of documenting the behavior and progress of those affected by the spore cloud. I promised him Id do a better job tomorrow if I was able to get any sleep tonight. I checked on Annie and Jared; both were snoring. Their skin looked worse, though. Im not sure what to do. Rakesh assured me that by tomorrow evening theyll be able to get a helicopter to us. When I asked about where itd land, he told me not to worry about it. So Ill do my best. Im going to get drunk and try to fall asleep.

**March 13th, 2015**

*6:15am*

Before I went to sleep last night, I bound Jared and Annie to their beds. It was something Rakesh suggested and I eventually decided it would be for the best. I could deal with them being pissed at me as long as they didnt hurt themselves while we waited for the helicopter. Apparently ours would be the first of a few; theres a medical helicopter scheduled to come in minutes after were taken out. While Im really happy the villagers will get medical attention, it absolutely sucks so many of them will be either dead or terribly disfigured. If wed been able to figure out the workings of that massive underground fungus, we might have been able to prevent this from happening. 

Im heading down to the village again. Im bringing my voice recorder so I can document enough detail to make Rakesh happy. Im not going to transcribe it all, but Ill put what I feel are the most important parts in this journal. 

*Update @ 12:00pm*

What I saw yesterday was paradise when compared to the devastation and depravity I was forced to observe today. Rakesh, I wish you hadnt asked me to do this. I understand why you needed me to, but Im not the same person I was a few days ago as a result. Theres just nothing I can express other than sadness and terror. Well, maybe one thing. Theres a tiny, tiny bit of solace in the fact those affected by the spores dont appear to be in pain. But the other side of that is how they gleefully destroyed their fellow villagers. People who were entirely innocent. People who, even as I write this, continue to scream with impossible ecstasy as theyre torn apart. So Rakesh, you asked for details, so here. Choke on them.

* Woman, woman, man grouping. Severe skin deterioration among all three. Severe mutilation of the mans genitals. All that appears to remain is approximately 5 inches of his urethra, which is being stretched and pulled by both women. Each woman takes turns performing oral sex on the remains of the mans genitals. The smaller woman, when not occupied with the man, had created holes in the larger womans thighs, into which she thrusts her fingers and tongue. All participants in these acts express joy.

* Man, boy grouping. The dead man is on his back in the dirt while the boy sits in the gashed crater of the mans belly. The boy is laughing and pulling out loops of the mans intestines. Every so often, the boy will duck his head into the dead mans stomach cavity and move around, as if trying to swim. He then erupts upward, reminding me of a dolphin leaping out of the water, before settling back down in the belly of the dead man to repeat the process. Large bite marks are visible on the boys arms.

* Man, man, man, man, man grouping. Four men are having intercourse with gaping wounds in the torso of the fifth man. The fifth man is on his back on a small table, chewing on what appears to be the dismembered hand of a child. The child from whom he got the hand is not in sight.

* Woman, woman grouping. The women are engaged in mutual oral sex. Each womans belly has been torn out and is dangling her viscera either onto the dirt or onto her partners body. The woman closest to me is bleeding very badly and will not live much longer.

Side note: As these observations were made, I noticed a change in the surface of the spore victims skin. Aside from the growing blight of sores, the skin appears to be growing sticky. It also appears to be weakening. I watched a boy, whose back was relatively free from deterioration, get pushed back against a hut. When the boy moved forward, the skin stuck to the hut and tore from his body with each step. This is similar to what I experienced yesterday with the dogs head. 

* Man, man, woman grouping. The older woman is flaying all skin from the other two group participants. Both the flayed man and younger woman are sitting, apparently chatting happily, while the older woman removes their skin with a small knife. The scraps of flesh are being thrown both at the other groups of villagers and into the forest. This flesh is particularly tacky and is sticking like glue to whatever it strikes.

* Woman, man, woman, woman, infant grouping. The woman on the ground appears to be in the process of giving birth to what may have been a healthy, unaffected infant. The man and other two women are pushing the infant in and out of the mother with a great deal of force. I have no doubt the infant is no longer alive. All four living participants are either laughing or yelling with excitement or pleasure.

It was that sight which forced me back to the lab. Id reached my limit. When I walked in, Annie and Jared had escaped from their rooms. Once their flesh had deteriorated, it was not difficult for them to slip out of their bindings. I hadnt bothered to lock their bedroom doors after tying them up. 

They had resumed their intercourse from the day before. Jared was atop Annie, chest to chest. When I entered the lab, Jared, surprised and delighted to see me, lifted himself off Annie. Their skin clung together and the force of his motion tore the flesh from the muscles. Amused by this, Annie pulled back from Jared and attempted to disengage their genitals. Her vaginal walls clung to Jareds penis as she moved, sloughing off and separating from her anatomy. 

They stood in front of me, like they did yesterday, happy to talk about how much fun they were having. I couldnt stand to look at them. I asked if theyd kindly go back to their rooms and wait for a little while. Even though they looked confused, they listened to me. I locked them in. Thats when I began to write this entry. As I type, I can hear them moaning as they pleasure themselves. I dont know what Im going to do between now and the eight hours before the helicopter is supposed to arrive, but Im compelled to go into the forest and see if I can salvage anything useful from this horror show. Even if I dont see anything, maybe it can help clear my head.

*Update @ 6:00pm*

The first important thing I noticed was how the chunks of flesh thrown by woman who flayed her two partners had sprouted mushrooms. Small, stringy mushrooms. Everywhere I found chunks of flesh, I found the mushrooms. Also of note: the orgy of hideousness in the village had abruptly stopped. I hurried back to see what had happened. I thought at first they might all be dead, but they were standing there, smiling and wandering around aimlessly. Their injuries were horrific; some catastrophic. Those too hurt to move lay on the ground. The sticky flesh that had touched the dirt had begun to grow the same mushrooms.

Gradually, those capable of walking started to spread out in all directions. They moved slowly, picking their skin and throwing it on the ground as they walked. Over time, they increased their speed. I ran behind a group of boys. They pulled small strips of skin from their bodies and flung it to the dirt with each step. The bit off their own lips and tongues and spit them on the ground or at the trees. They ran and ran and ran, leaving a trail of gore behind them. I looked from side to side and saw the other villagers running and tearing themselves to shreds as they went.

I must have gone a few miles before I couldnt continue. The hazmat suit was too heavy and I was overheated and exhausted. I turned around and trudged back. The closer I got to town, the first few scraps of flesh that had been torn off had already started sprouting the same stringy mushrooms. I was overwhelmed with visceral disgust and scientific intrigue. Back in the village, no one was left alive. Whoever was capable of running away had done so, and all the corpses remained where theyd fallen or been dropped. Each of the carcasses were sprouting bouquets of fungus. 

Out of nowhere, I remembered Annie and Jared. I ran back to the lab, threw open their doors, and saw the consequences of being too late to help them. Both were dead. Theyd torn themselves to shreds and blanketed the bedrooms with their flesh and blood. With no dirt or plant life for the mushrooms to grow on, the flesh just sat there. Useless. I dont know why I did what I did next, but at the time, it felt like the only way to honor them.

I scooped up what I could of their remains and threw it on the ground by the lab. I sat and watched as the mushrooms grew. Now Im waiting for the helicopter.

---

Thats the end of the journal. The helicopter picked me up around 10pm. The other teams came in later to do whatever investigations needed to be done. Physically, I was fine. Aside from stewing in a sweaty hazmat suit for two days with a terrible cold and too few fluids, my body was no worse for wear. 

The bodies of the villagers were found over the course of the next few weeks. Some of them had made it almost 45 miles before their bodies gave out and they dropped. All that could be recovered were bones. 

Its almost a year later and Im back in the area with a new team. Having to wear a hazmat suit at all times when were not in the lab sucks, but no one wants to go through what happened to our colleagues. The research difficulties wed faced for the last ten years still plague us, but at least a few questions about the fungus have been answered. Still, when its quiet or Im working alone, I think about the villagers blindly running as far as their bodies would go, all while tearing themselves apart just so theyd fertilize the ground with the spores of that which had possessed them. And I cant stop thinking about how, because of it, a full five miles have been added to the radius of where that particular mushroom grows.

	<TITLE> Slough, Part 1 of 2 </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the last three decades, small groups of mycologists have been visiting a village deep in the Brazilian Amazon. It is suspected, based on some evidence, the village is atop a colossal fungal colony, similar to the Armillaria solidipes in Malheur National Forest, Oregon, only dramatically larger. If thats the case, the fungus would be the largest living creature on Earth. 

The hundred-or-so expeditions before ours yielded inconclusive results. Genetic tests have shown there is a type of fungus unique to the general area, but attempts to grow it in any environment outside a 40-mile radius of the village have been futile. My trip down last March was with the intent of seeing if the fungus could be grown artificially under specific chemically-induced conditions. 

A biotechnology firm had recently developed an interest in that particular mushroom, believing it might have anticarcinogenic properties. As a result, the two members of my team and I were given far better equipment to take with us than we normally had. We were happy to oblige. When we arrived, the native people were as friendly and inquisitive as always. Theyd taken a liking to all the scientists whod visited them. While the lab was set up a hundred yards from the nearest structure in the village, it was common for the scientists and villagers to interact when the workday was over. A few of us even figured out a few words of their local dialect, although no one was anywhere near conversational level. It didnt matter, though. Food, drink, and wrestling were the common languages we spoke. And for 32 years, everything had gone well.

Everything, that is, except our research. Wed been stuck for the better part of a decade. With no ability to grow the fungus aside from that small, incredibly isolated locale, the likelihood of fully determining its properties was low. Further, without massively-invasive and destructive digging, wed never be able to find out the true size of the fungal colony below us.

Things became complicated, though. And they changed for the worse. Im not going to write out an explanation of what went on or why Im the only person in our group to survive the last trip, but I will share my journal entries from that period. I have to warn you, though: the things I saw were unlike anything I could have imagined. And theyre things I hope no one will ever have see again.

**March 9th, 2015**

*9:00am*

Its been absolutely pissing rain for six days now. Jared estimates the rainfall is exceptionally high, even for that time of the year. He thinks at least 20 inches have fallen. I believe him, too. I can see why the village folks have their huts elevated off the forest floor. Otherwise theyd be in knee-deep water. You know, sort of like our fucking lab. 

Ok, its not that bad in the lab. Maybe only ankle-deep. But I saw Im going to knock Franks teeth out when we get back home because it was his responsibility to make sure the place was sealed tight before his crew left. The dickhead.

Anyway, Annie said fuck it and hiked through the water to see if the trails had been flooded. They were. Big time. None of us are getting out of here for a while, so I hope no one gets hurt or sick. The place where the helicopter usually lands might as well be a lake and when its all drained away itll be 4 feet of mud. The sat-phones work fine, though, but when I called Rakesh, he just told us to suck it up and get some work done. The rain should be tapering off tomorrow. Well, as much as it tapers off in a rainforest I guess.

**March 10th, 2015**

*8:15am*

Well, the suns out. God DAMN theres a lot of water around. Thankfully, its draining into the ground pretty quickly. I guess thats one of the benefits of being on top of (maybe) the largest mushroom on Earth; mushrooms loooove their water. I cant even imagine how much that thing can hold. 

Yesterday, we laughed at Annie while she picked the leeches off her legs after her little hike. Well, we laughed until she starting throwing the nasty bastards at us. Then we just hid and giggled. Only in a rainforest are there so many leeches that youll get them even in water thats moving. 

We didnt do any work today. I think tomorrows going to be a good day, though. At the rate the waters draining, we should be clear to start getting new samples. Whenever it rains a lot, that big bastard underground sends up thousands of little mushroom caps that grow in less than four hours. Well have more than enough samples to play around with.

Side note, though: I think Im getting a cold. 

**March 11th, 2015**

*12:00pm*

I have a cold. You know how summer colds are the worst because the humidity makes the sinus pressure so much worse? Yeah, well a cold in a rainforest is about 1000x worse. Im sniffling and blowing snot all over the place while Jared and Annie are out doing field work and hanging out with the villagers. Being stuck in here gave me the time to do stupid Franks job and make sure the place was airtight, and after that was done, I had the opportunity to play with the cool toys from GeneMedica. That said, I dont even know what half this shit is. Were mycologists, guys. Not geneticists.

*Update @ 3:15pm*

Something started happening a little while ago and its definitely relevant to our work so Im going to do my best to detail everything. I called Rakesh and he agreed I should document it all. 

I was sitting at the computer and looking out the window when what looked like dark orange smoke started pouring from the ground. And I mean pouring. The visibility went to practically nothing. The tree thats about ten feet from our lab was nearly invisible. Outside, I can hear the villagers yelling to one another. They seem pretty frightened. Im unnerved, to say the least. Unnerved, but also excited. Is this a spore bloom? 

Im assuming it might be, and even though Im in the lab which I know is finally sealed properly, Im putting on my hazmat suit. Im probably being overcautious, and I know Annie and Jared are out in the stuff without any protection, but something about the ferocity of the way its coming out of the ground worries me. 

*Update @ 3:35pm*

Jared just came back. Well, hes still outside but hes at least back where I can see him. Hes acting like hes high out of his mind. Hes walking around and laughing to himself. Like, a lot. It doesnt look like hes having any problem breathing, but the amount of orange powder in the air and stuck to the surfaces of nearly everything is disconcerting. I cant imagine having that stuff in his lungs.

I yelled out to him about Annie and the folks in the village. He just yelled back how awesome they were. Theres no way Im getting through to him until his buzz wears off. It doesnt appear that he wants to come in the lab, and Im glad about that. I dont think itd be a smart move if the only mostly-clean area gets contaminated. 

*Update @ 7:15pm*

Annie came back and is in the same state as Jared. They played around outside like two kids and wouldnt listen to a word I yelled from the lab. Theyve since fallen asleep outside on the picnic table. Im going to bed.

**March 12, 2015**

*6:30am*

The spores (Im calling them that from now on because theres no other conceivable explanation) stopped coming out of the ground overnight and after it rained early this morning, theyve blended in with the mud. Im not taking off the hazmat suit, but Ive disconnected the breathing apparatus and just using the filters in the mask. I strongly doubt there will be any particulate matter small enough to penetrate the filters.

Jared and Annie seem to be no worse for wear, aside from exhaustion. After cleaning themselves in the river, I agreed they were probably fine to come back in the lab and sleep. As for me, even though Im miserable with this cold, Im too excited to stay in here. Im going out, first into the village, then to the forest around us. I want to see if that spore explosion could confirm the presence of that enormous mushroom.

*Update @ 10:20am*

I spent a little over an hour in the village. None of the people seemed injured, just a bit confused. Im concerned, however, about the skin irritation a few of them developed overnight. Annie, too, has red blotches on her back and stomach. She insists they dont hurt, but they look painful. They remind me of eczema. Jared, so far, isnt having any skin problems. Hes been coughing up disgusting orange crap from breathing in all the spores yesterday, but thats the worst of his problems. Im heading out into the forest for a few hours.

*Update @ 2:00pm*

My trip to the forest was unsettling. There were many, many injured animals. They appeared to be suffering from a skin condition similar to that of the people affected by the spore eruption. Im going into the village once more to see how their symptoms have progressed.

*Update @ 3:50pm*

I returned to the lab and found Annie and Jared having sex with one another in the middle of the main room. When I entered the lab, they didnt even try to hide themselves. They just continued doing what they were doing. That is entirely uncharacteristic of Annie, first of all, who is happily married and Jared, who, as far as I know, is gay. Neither of them ever appeared to have any romantic interest with one another and their interactions have always been professional. 

I approached them and they greeted me happily, but not even pausing their action. The blotches on Annies back looked much worse. As they went about their business, they talked to me about how much better they were feeling after getting some rest. Annie, who had been riding Jared chest-to-chest, leaned back and exposed her chest and stomach. The flesh was terribly damaged. Jared, too, had started to show signs of skin deterioration. His own chest and belly were riddled with ugly, red, eczematous patches. 

When I asked if theyd be okay with stopping for a few minutes so I could take a look at their skin, they didnt argue. Annie hopped off Jared and they stood in front of me, naked and beaming. I have no medical training, but I thought it was important to get samples of their damaged tissue. While Id never done a biopsy before, they didnt look hard and Jared and Annie consented. 

I made the first cut on Annie. As the knife went in, when I expected to hear a gasp from pain, she groaned with what I could only identify as pleasure. I glanced up and saw her with her head back, smiling. I took the sample, bagged it, and put it in the refrigerator. Jared, too, expressed delight at the feeling of the scalpel sliding into him, his pleasure manifesting itself more obviously as he regained the erection hed lost following his interrupted sex with Annie. I did my best to stay professional, but I was very, very disturbed.

I put his sample in the fridge next to Annies. When I turned back around, I was horrified by what I saw. Annie and Jared were kissing again, and rather than resuming their intercourse, she had invaginated his navel with her index and middle fingers. She slid them in and out of his abdomen, blood trickling through his public hair to the base of his erection, and dripping onto the white floor. All the while, as they kissed, both their faces shone with ecstatic glee.

Feeling sick to my stomach, I backed away and walked outside. From the village, I heard screams of rapturous joy. Many of the villagers had congregated in the center of the main huts. They were all nude and writhing against one another. Men. Women. Children. And bright blood glinted off their dark skin.

[Part 7](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3yues6/part_7_i_was_diagnosed_with_childhood/)

My name is Joy. My brother, James, whose account youve been reading over the last couple months, asked me to contribute this portion of his story before I die because he has no memory of the events Im about to describe. I feel strange having to narrate a period of time that might as well never have happened for him. My concern, which Ive articulated to him as best I could, is that Ill give skewed depictions of the time he was gone. He told me it was better than nothing.

Since I wasnt even a year old when James disappeared, I dont remember him being in my life. I grew up with our late aunt, Emma, and had a happy, albeit lonely, childhood. She homeschooled me and helped me understand how certain members of our family, herself included, had the ability to perceive things others couldnt. Sometimes those perceptions manifested themselves as visions, sometimes as sounds. Tastes and smells, too. Rarely, like in the case of my brother, the perceptions could be detected by all their senses. She hadnt told any of that to the police, who, after James seemingly evaporated into thin air, scoured the property and surrounding areas for weeks before officially declaring him gone.

Thats what she told me, at least. I was way too young to know about any of it. Still, I grew up in the house with his pictures decorating the mantles, along with photographs of our parents, who were also dead. Emma was the only family I knew. I hate how it sounds like Im making this all about me, but its pretty important to have some background - especially in the face of what happened.

Emma died on my 20th birthday. She left me an incredible amount of money. Far more than I knew she was worth. It allowed me to embrace the new sights and sounds in my life without any financial hindrances or any other obligations. I had no doubt they were real. And the day James came back, I told him about it all. 

I watched his small face as he listened the woman who, to him, was his infant sister just a few subjective hours ago. Emma had always talked about how intelligent he was, but back then I only could understand it as an abstraction. That day, though, as I saw him process everything I told him, I was struck by his perspicacity. Hed not only accepted the fact that hed somehow traveled nearly 20 years without aging a day, but as I spoke to him about the things Id seen, he actually believed me. Empathized, even. But then I mentioned the white man.

I started seeing the white man when I was six. He never wore clothes, he never spoke, and he never did anything except follow me. But Emma couldnt see him. She didnt deny his existence, though. Whenever I mentioned him, she always said there had to be some purpose for him in my life, but I hadnt gotten to the point where that purpose could be actualized. 

As I grew older, he changed. At first, I was terrified. His skin began to drop off; first in small flakes which whirled around him whenever the wind blew. Later, the flesh began to slough from his muscles. It collected in baggy folds around his wrists, hips, and ankles. That which fell from him entirely sat where it was dropped, decaying over the months with no hint of odor or material presence. The process took years. When I was 11, the house was littered with rotting flesh. It was just part of my life.

Here, James interjected. He told me about the black woman. He mentioned how he could touch her; how she spoke and gave him comfort; how she protected him. As he spoke, his eyes kept darting around the room. I knew he was seeing things, but I wouldnt ask what. In time, if he wanted to tell me, he could.

I went on, filling him in about the white mans place in my life. By the time Id reached 17, he was hardly a man anymore. While Id expected him to decay like a normal corpse and leave behind a desiccated heap of skeletal remnants, the white man grew soft and wet. It was almost as if his bone structure had grown gelatinous. He could no longer move like a bipedal human, but like a fat, wriggling larva. While I still thought of him as the white man, he no longer resembled either. He was blood red and streaked with purple veins. Chunks of yellow matter which had to be fat clung to portions of his body, remaining unsettlingly stiff as the rest of him moved through peristaltic heaves. If anything, he looked like a disembodied organ. A stomach, maybe. It was the form he occupied for the next few years.

One year before James came back, the white man changed again. And so did I. For the first time in my life, I could hear him. He whispered wet, rasping seductions I found both nauseating and intoxicating. His shape, still that of viscera, began to extrude tentacles. No, not tentacles. Intestinal tubes. They grew quickly and soon crisscrossed the house in an elaborate transitway of bowels. Part of me was surprised I wasnt revolted or frightened by my home being overtaken by what looked like a surrealists nightmare of an abattoir. 

James interrupted again at that point, telling me he could see them. Its what hed been watching as we talked. And he wanted to know why the thickest one was connected to my mouth.

Its the part Id wanted so desperately to bring up. Its what Id been so excited to mention to someone who finally would understand. My own, beautiful brother would be the one whod share in my elation.

Shortly after the white man finished growing his tentacles, about 8 months earlier, he did something else entirely new. He didnt follow me around anymore. Instead, he floated above my bed. It was there hed whisper to me about my great potential. About how, if I stopped eating, hed give me all the food I needed. And he did. Every night, with his intestinal tube snugly down my throat, I watched as portions of jellied fluids trickled through its translucent skin and disappeared into me. I felt none of it, but I knew I was being nourished. I felt incredible. And when I woke up every morning, the feeling remained. 

I lost interest in my friends. They never could understand what I was accomplishing with the white man. Why even bother telling them? I lose weight quickly, but I didnt care. It felt like I was making room for something great. Something bigger than myself.

While Id hoped James would be appreciative about what Id seen and experienced, he surprised me by expressing fear and worry. For the first time, I felt anger toward him. Of all the people Id met, it was he who should have recognized the beauty of my relationship with the white man. His description of the black woman sounded no different to me. Yes, the shapes and forms of the white man and the black woman were dissimilar, but surely there was enough of a connection between the two of them for James to feel comfort, rather than fear. 

I was devastated. And as I write this, I remember the venom in the betrayal I felt. If Id realized the reason for his fear was his countless experiences with incomprehensible, otherworldly atrocities, so much could have been saved. Maybe even my life. And while Im happy I had a chance to meet my brother and spend the last ten years watching him grow and overcome so much, I wish he never came back to see what Id initiated. 

My remaining time is short. I only hope James will remember me as someone who tried to do her best in the face of overwhelming evil. Still, I fear the worst. And while I doubt Ill live long enough to read the remaining parts of his memoir, Id rather die thinking hell write about the adult me in a positive light, rather than as a pathetic girl who was seduced into the actualization of her hideous purpose.

I cant believe how long its taking. Yeah, I get it, things that ship from China are going to take longer to get to Rhode Island than if they shipped from Canada. IDC. I paid so much money for this shit Id expect the people who sell it to actually care about their customers. Such bullshit.

The tracking info says its in fucking Rotterdam. I thought it was going to be flown over here because it needs to be refrigerated. If its just sitting in a hot cargo ship next to baby clothes and ballpoint pens and dildos Im going to be so mad. $155!

**July 6th, 2015**

So fucking pissed. Its going to be another week. I sent an email to the company and they got back real quick and told me, yes, its refrigerated and, yes, it will be perfect when it arrives. But I have to wait SEVEN MORE FUCKING DAYS. Thats cutting it so super close to Carlottas wedding and I need my skin to be PERFECT for all those pictures. Im not going to look worse than my sister, even if shes bride. I want people to look at her wedding pictures and be like, yeah Carlottas beautiful but Rachel is the one in the family with the looks. Because I am.

**July 10th, 2015**

Another three days of waiting. My skin is AWFUL. I dont have a ton of zits but the ones I have are huge and they dont just look gross but they hurt. None of the stuff Ive gotten at the store works. Yesterday, I went to Whole Foods and found some natural coconut oil cream that people online said was good. I put it on last night and this morning I woke up with another massive pimple right in the left corner of my nose. I did a test with my camera and I stood 15 feet away like how the photos will be taken for the wedding. The pimples were so obvious. Even with makeup, you can see them underneath. Especially if one starts leaking. So fucking gross. Im so mad.

**July 12th, 2015**

ITS HERE ITS EARLY THANK GOD! 

The package came in a really well-sealed box that looked like it had some weird refrigeration packs inside. It was definitely cold. The acne cream was in a clear tube. The stuff looked almost exactly like the Neutrogena scrub I use every day but instead of being blue with gray exfoliating beads, the Chinese stuff was yellow with white exfoliating beads. I have no idea what the writing on the tube says but Im texting a pic to Mei so she can translate.

*Update @ 11:25am*

Ok, Mei said the writing just says skin care and for use on blemishes. The instructions say: Keep refrigerated, use a thumbprint-sized dollop on the face immediately after getting out of a hot shower, let sit for a half hour, then rinse off with warm water. For best results, use twice a day for one week. Mild swelling may occur, but it is normal. If severe peeling occurs, stop using immediately. 

I jumped in the shower and turned it as hot as I could stand so my pores would open up. I squeezed the pimples that were ready to blow and almost threw up when the biggest one popped so hard i heard the glob of pus hit the shower wall. That one bled a lot. I hope the new acne cream wont sting too badly.

I got the cream out of the little dorm fridge I keep in my room and started to spread it on my face. It stung SO BAD. I thought it smelled pretty good, though. Reminded me of Meis moms perfume, although there was something weird in the background. Not chemicals, either. Just...weird. Whatevs. I left it on for a half hour like it said, washed it off, and went to work.

*Update @ 10:50pm*

Work sucked as usual. My face felt nice, though. The stinging went away pretty quick after I scrubbed the stuff off and my skin feels smooth. Definitely less greasy. I could see in the mirror at work that my pores were a bit larger than normal. But they didnt look or feel oily. The blackheads were gone, too. So far, so good.

I got home and took another hot shower and put on the stuff. I rubbed the exfoliating beads over the worst of the remaining zits, hoping to erode them down. One of them popped and hit the mirror like a mashed potato javelin (Im working on my similes for English 102 next semester) and the cream stung like crazy when it touched the open sore. I gritted my teeth and rubbed the beads across the bleeding crater, working them into the skin to bring down the edges.

After a half hour, I cleaned it off and went to bed.

**July 13th, 2015**

My face looked SO MUCH BETTER this morning. The big pimples are still there but I can tell theyre starting to shrink. None of them have whiteheads. The skins a little swollen and feels hot, though. Im glad the creams still working even after its been washed off.

Ive got a lot more confidence today even though my face still is way worse than I want it to be for the wedding. Ive gotta go to work now but damn it feels good to not want to cut my stupid skin out of my head. 

*Update @ 10:30pm*

Apparently the cream helped me grow some balls because I asked out Todd from the deli department. Ive wanted to fuck that dude for two years. Im so going to, too.

**July 14th, 2015**

Last night after I showered and did my face, I started peeling a little bit. Im not too worried because all the acne stuff in the past that stung going on always made me peel later on. Ill keep an eye on it just to make sure it doesnt get really bad, but I cant believe how happy I am with how well its working. I take back everything I said about that company and the Chinese people in general. Im glad Mei hadnt heard me. Jeez.

*Update @ 9:19pm*

Todd looked so good at work today. I cant wait until we can go out next weekend. Mei came in to see me and I pointed him out and I think he noticed but he didnt say anything. She agreed hes hot as fuck. She told me if I didnt hit that this weekend shed be on him an hour later. No way shed have that chance lol. 

My face feels pretty okay but its definitely more swollen than Im used to. The biggest pimples are almost all gone, though. I dare say my complexion looks almost GOOD for the first time in 10 years. Jesus, Ive gone from 12 to 22 with fucked up skin. No wonder Im such an asshole. Oh wait, Ive always been an asshole lol.

**July 15th, 2015**

My skin is smoooooooooooth! Its not peeling anymore and even though its still swollen and the pores look way big, Ive got no new pimples. Not one. Hasnt even been half a week. Ill be recommending this stuff to everyone once the treatment is finished and Im in the wedding pictures looking like a total goddess. Youre so screwed, Carlotta lol.

**July 16th, 2015**

Nah, nothing. Same ol shit.

**July 17th, 2015**

Face is smooth as a babys buttcheeks. Still swollen, still big-ass pores, but not a single zit. Two more days of my skin treatment, five more days until date night with Todd, and eight more days until the wedding. Things are pretty damn good right now.

**July 18th, 2015**

Tomorrows my last day of the acne cream. I started peeling again just a little bit, but everything is still pretty damn smooth. I used the exfoliating beads in the cream to get off the majority of the peeling skin, anyway, and I dont think anyone but me noticed. That said, my housemate said something about my cheeks being swollen and I told her it was just my acne meds. She nodded and said I might want to stop using it. I just laughed and told her Id be stopping it tomorrow anyway. 

After Olivia mentioned that, though, Ive become pretty aware of the swelling. I can feel it when I smile and furrow my brow. When I poke my cheeks, theyre still smooth but they feel a little hard underneath, kinda like my ankle did when I sprained it and it swelled up. Ill write the company tomorrow after I finish with the cream.

**July 19th, 2015**

Done! Today was boring as fuck cause thats how I roll but I just finished my last application of the acne medicine. I just looked at the before pic I took of myself the day before I started, and its RIDICULOUS how much better I look. I was fucking HIDEOUS last week! Omg. Yeah, my face is a lot rounder and stuff right now but its clear and smooth and TOTALLY awesome for the wedding AND my date with Todd. This is going to be awesome.

Im writing an email to the Chinese company about the swelling just to put my mind at ease. I think it might have gotten a tiny bit better overnight but I really cant tell. Neither could Olivia. Ill ask some of the people at work later how it looks to them.

**July 20th, 2015**

Holy shit Todd texted and wanted to see if I could go out with him tonight instead of when wed planned because something came up. Ive just spent the last hour showering and shaving every hair below my eyebrows. I have to admit, Im a little self-conscious about the swelling in my face. When I got out of the shower, I pressed on one of the larger pores near my nose and one of the damn exfoliating beads came out. That made me worry. Id pushed those beads in pretty hard when trying to get the flaky skin to go away. The last thing I wanted to deal with was an infection. Everything Id read about those was how bad they are for the environment. They cant be good if theyre trapped inside your skin.

Im going to go on our date and maybe tomorrow Ill go to the walk-in clinic just to get looked at. It really doesnt hurt much and I pressed on a couple other pores and got more of the beads out. There wasnt any blood or any gross pus or anything else that would make me think my face was infected, so its probably fine. Whatevs. Im getting dick tonight.

**August 13th, 2015**

Im in the hospital. And fuck it, Im going to write what happened because I missed the wedding and Todd thinks Im a freak and Ive got nothing else going for me but this story. And Todd told everyone already. Im done for.

The first part of our date went so well. Dinner, drinks, then a romp at my place. I was riding him and leaning forward and sucking his tongue when my face started to hurt REAL bad and he opened his eyes and yelled. Then he threw me off him and ran out the door with his clothes in his arms. My skin hurt so bad I could hardly breathe but I got up and ran into the bathroom. I almost died.

My pores had erupted with thin, white worms. And they were still coming out. Each pore released a few cracked exfoliating beads. No, not beads, I realized. Eggs. As each broken egg came out, a thin, pure white worm slithered out behind it. They slid and dangled eight inches out of my face. I screamed as I grabbed a handful of them and pulled. Hard. I felt them stretching out of my pores from deep inside my head. From behind my neck. From my scalp. I reached arms length and they were still in me. I dropped what I held in the sink and used both hands to frantically yank the things out. 

As I pulled, they curled up in the sink like vermicelli noodles. Finally, after what must have been five feet of length, that group was out. My pores oozed gray and yellow pus that smelled worse than anything Id ever encountered. It was then I understood what the underlying smell of the acne cream had been. I vomited into the sink as I kept pulling, but more of their bodies poked out of the pores.

I ran out of my bathroom, feeling the things slapping against my neck and naked chest as I scrambled to find my cellphone. I could see them dangling when I reached down for the phone. And theyd started to move. No longer did they just slide out, but they wriggled and thrashed, finally sensing they were in some sort of danger. I screamed over and over and eventually was able to dial 911. Somehow they were able to get my address from the cell phone data and they said an ambulance would be there ASAP.

While I waited, I stood in my kitchen, puking and crying, snipping the things out of my face with a pair of scissors. They squirmed over the linoleum, dripping the same yellow and gray pus that was squirting from each gaping pore. As a new crop of worms, fatter than Id seen so far, started to crawl out from underneath my left eyelid, I knew I was losing my mind. And I did what anyone who loses touch with reality does: I carved underneath the eyelid with the scissors. Immediately, everything in the room blurred and lost some level of dimensional perspective. I shrieked as the pain of the injury exploded through me, but I couldnt stop.

I snipped down the eyelid, down my cheek, and unzipped the side of my face. I took my fingernails and dragged them under and through the incision, feeling unwound masses of the things buried within the muscle. I pulled and pulled, not feeling any more pain, and I watched the blurry, blood-soaked bodies drop to the kitchen floor with a wet sound. 

Some time later, my door was being kicked in and I saw firefighters and EMTs staring at me in abject horror. I said something like, be careful, theres worms in my face before I fell forward and cracked my head on the counter.

Two weeks later, I woke up. I wasnt allowed to see my face for another few days, either. I could tell I was really messed up but apparently Id be fine aside from some pretty bad scars and a damaged eye. The doctors had no idea what kind of parasite was in me, but said theyll be taking the rest of the acne cream to run tests on it. They said that while it was refrigerated, the eggs would have been dormant. They figured once they got into the steamy humidity of my skin, they were able to gestate. And gestate they did.

Once Carlotta learned Id survive the whole thing, she went and had the wedding anyway. And she had a great time. The wedding pictures were in an email attachment I got after I woke up. She looked amazing. Most gorgeous woman at the place. Before her email, though, was another one. The mail I sent to the Chinese company about my facial swelling had bounced back. No such recipient.

Fuck everything.

	<TEXT> Shell be here soon. 

I collected the amniotic fluid in a glass jar as it was expelled. Oily swirls of yellow and red and brown danced across the wet surface. Just a sip. Just one for now.

The fluid caressed the back of my undeserving throat and left a sheen of grease on my tongue. The flavor of that which bathed Her would remain in my mouth for hours. More than long enough for me to lay my eyes upon Her entry into this world.

The container screamed as paroxysmal thrashing tore through its legs, hips, and back. I trembled with uncontrollable anticipation, vaguely noticing the warm spread of urine growing on the front of my pants. I had no doubt She wouldnt mind. She would be so far beyond such pitiful, corporeal shame.

Steam poured from the swollen body of the container. The humidity clung to the windows where it froze in crystalline fractals. The perversity of the spontaneous order filled me with rage. That such blasphemy would arise in the room in which She would be born reeked of mockery. Of eutaxiological hubris. I seethed.

The screams from the container continued until its vocal cords gave out. It babbled and belched its indications of pain; apparently indignant to the end. Its end. Her beginning.

I opened the door of the small cabin. Frigid air rushed into the room and froze the containers steam into rime. I gazed up at the hideous sky. White blemishes pockmarked the pitch blackness like acne. Like smallpox. Tears froze on my cheeks as I imagined each dot of white shifting to red. Then to black. Countless dots of fire raped out of existence. And each of those rapes will bear fruit.

The container bit through its teeth with a crunching sound that snapped me from my reverie. My frozen pants cracked as I turned and walked back in the containers direction. I peered into the area through which She would soon travel. The passage was engorged with the containers blood and slickened by its mucous. The lubrication would be of little use in easing the passage of Her form. 

The container shuddered and cracking sounds filled the room as its hips shattered into collagen and calcium shrapnel. Each rope supporting it groaned under new tension. Blood began to drool from its orifices. It was happening.

Two feet emerged from the container. Then two sturdy legs. The containers flesh began to tear as more of Her bulk emerged. Her flesh was a gelid blue. I shivered as I began to register the magnitude of what I was seeing. A stench filled the cabin as the bowels of the container gave out and spilled their contents onto the dirt floor. I hardly noticed. My fixation remained on Her. More was emerging.

Both legs were out and Her hips had finally burst free. I stared through my tears. Undeniably a she. It was Her. I had no doubt. Torso followed hips. Shoulders followed torso. She hung by Her neck from the devastated caldera of Her containers pelvis. Two perfectly-formed hands reached up and tore the remaining tissue away. She fell into the dirt and filth.

I carefully picked Her up and held Her to my chest. She began to nurse immediately. The flesh of Her body was impossibly cold. Incomprehensibly cold. It was the cold that She and Her 23 Sisters would use to rape the fire from every star. Cold that would, after countless eons of decadence and order, grind it all to a halt. And so would begin Her reign.

Through the numbing chill of Her touch, I felt Her teeth chew on my left breast. In the span of minutes, Shed already consumed the right. I savored the glaze of amniotic film on my tongue as I watched Her use me. All that was left for me to do was finish recording my experiences and continue to fulfill my purpose. Soon, Ill be inside Her. And She will be ready for the world.

	<TITLE> After 20 years, my wife finally allowed me to tell this story. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-15 22:02:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Like all good stories, this one begins with a testicle self-examination. Or, as its colloquially known: jerking off. It was my last day in Guatemala and I was sitting in the hotel, waiting to go to the airport, and abusing myself to help pass the time. Things were going as well as could be expected. Until they werent. My left middle finger brushed against a lump on my right testicle. My erection wilted like a primrose at Chernobyl.

I did a cursory examination, hoping it might be an ingrown hair. But I knew it wasnt. It didnt have the itchy pain of an ingrown hair. No pain at all, actually. It had all the telltale signs of a growth I absolutely did *not* want *anywhere* on my body, especially not on my balls. Within 20 minutes, Id cancelled my flight, phoned Renee to tell her the flight was delayed, and called an emergency clinic to tell them I was on my way.

Fast forward eight hours. Interesting fact about Guatemala: great medical care! I was examined, given an ultrasound, and told, to my enormous relief, the growth was benign. Just a cluster of fatty deposits. Itd go away on its own in a few weeks. I was on the next flight home.

I got back to my house around 10pm. Itd been almost two months since I saw my wife. Needless to say, we were both happy to see each other. I took a shower, scrubbed out the nooks and crannies, and did a bit of manscaping. The lump that had caused me so much stress only 24 hours earlier had already started to dissipate. There was a pretty good chance Renee wouldnt even notice. I finished the process of making myself smell moderately fuckable, dried off, and headed into the bedroom. 

Renee was waiting for me on the bed. I could tell when I got home that there was a decent chance wed be having a bit of fun. And I was right. Ill spare you the details, but it all went according to our tried-and-true routine: upper-front pinching, lower-front nibbling, lower-rear licking, mouth-to-mouth slobbering, and genitals-to-genitals docking. Four thrusts later and I was wheezing sorry, its been a while into her ear and collapsing on top of her.

I could tell Renee was stifling a laugh when she told me not to worry about it. I rolled off her and stared at the ceiling, panting like a chain-smoking Golden Retriever. While I watched the rotation of the ceiling fan and silently wished I didnt have the refractory period of a glacier, I started to get itchy in a remarkably unpleasant spot. Were all adults here, right? Okay, well, for lack of a better way of putting it, the tip of my dick felt like it was getting molested by a poison ivy plant. I started scratching, trying not to make too much of the irritation. Renee, of course, noticed immediately. She started giggling and began to ask are you seriously jer Then she stopped and winced a little.

You okay?, I inquired, doing my best to wipe our combined goo off my hand without my wife noticing I was wiping it on her side of the bed. Yeah, she told me. Just dry skin or something. You almost ready for round two?

Sure, I told her, lying through my teeth. Ill be right back.
I got up and stumbled my way through the dark bedroom into the bathroom to hopefully pee away the growing discomfort. Once in the bathroom, I stood in front of the toilet, mildly disturbed by the way the dim glow of the night light cast a shadow on the wall and made it look like I had a truly spectacular pair of breasts. Peeing helped the itching go away - for a second or two. Then it came back with a vengeance; not just on the tip, but all over the area. I gritted my teeth and leaned over to turn on the light. Then I screamed.

A sea of tiny, brown spiders swarmed over my penis, the front of my testicles, and my left hand thatd been holding on while I peed. I screamed again and squeezed myself, crushing the tiny things in my fist and pulling them away from me. Renee, whod leapt from the bed after my first shriek, saw what was happening and gasped. I looked at her crotch and almost passed out. Hundreds, maybe even thousands, of the things were leaking out of her and cascading down her right thigh. She hadnt noticed yet.

Pain, now, not just itching, exploded from my urethra as another wave of the arachnids pushed themselves out of me; their journey no longer aided by the lubrication that had eased the passage of the first group. Renee finally discovered her own condition and split my ears with a shriek I was certain wouldve shattered the windows. She reached in with her fingers and pulled globs of writhing baby spiders, still trapped in the sticky confines of what Id left following my profoundly disappointing attempt at sexual intercourse.

I jumped into the freezing cold shower and tried to aim a needle of the shower water into the spot where the baby spiders kept pouring from. Renee ran out of the bathroom but I didnt follow. I had my own problems. Gradually, over the course of a couple minutes, the spiders stopped coming out. I turned off the water and ran to find my wife. All I had to do was follow the drops of semen-trapped baby spiders. I found Renee in the kitchen, her right leg up on the counter, attempting to dredge the remaining creatures from her anatomy with the hose next to the sink. She glared at me. The floor was soaked, but I figured it wasnt a good time for me to tell her that. She probably knew.

I offered to help, but she just told me to leave her alone. Another few spiders crawled out of my tiny, flaccid penis. I asked if she was sure. She told me she was.

An hour later, after the last of the arachnids were purged from our respective anatomies, we got in the car and went to the hospital. Renee wasnt very happy. It was a pretty long ride and we sat in silence, doing our best to forget what had happened. We werent very successful. I felt terrible and tried to add some levity to the situation. So, um, remember when all those spiders came out of my dick?, I asked, and nudged her. She snorted out an unexpected laugh and just said, I fucking hate you right now.

We left the hospital after 12 hours of ultrasounds, X-rays, and hundreds of questions from every doctor in the place. Apparently a spider egg cluster can look *just* like a fatty deposit on an old ultrasound. The same old ultrasounds they used in Guatemala. No one could explain exactly how the spider egg had gotten there, but the doctors said weirder things have happened. Neither of us were particularly comforted by that fact. 

After we each got a clean bill of health and five free bouquets of flowers from the hospital florist, who told us every single person who worked at the hospital knew about what had happened, we went home. And that was that. We were finding cobwebs all over the house for almost ten years after, though. Memories.

	<TITLE> Fertility Treatments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-13 23:42:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> They told me when I was pretty young that Id never be able to have a baby. And that was that. No therapy, no consolation, no nothing. I was given the knowledge and left to my own devices to deal with it. They wouldnt have to see me crying at night. Every night. For years and years. I kept it all under wraps, despite hating myself inside. Hating my failure. Hating my parts that didnt work. Hating the jealousy I felt for the women who had that gift and squandered it. I needed to try something. Anything. 

It didnt take long before I was ordering fertility drugs online. Diethylstilbestrol. Clomiphene. GnRH. I took them all. Then I had to get sperm. A few quick ads on Craigslist, a couple pictures sent back and forth, and a meet up. An hour later, Id have a condom full of what I needed. 

I gave the drugs a week to kick in before doing anything else. They made me dizzy and nauseous. It was a small price to pay, I guess, and less invasive than my next task, which was to inject the sperm into myself. I had to try lots of spots; I was aiming for where I thought ovaries would be. I figured an ectopic pregnancy was still a pregnancy. And maybe the doctors could fix it if I was lucky enough to encounter that problem in the first place. 

In the time that passed between my self-medicating and material gathering, Id find myself drifting off to sleep and imagining a baby - my baby - warm and soft in my lap. A little bundle of warmth capable of melting the impossibly-cold center of my being. Of my identity. A precious life who would love me as much as I loved him or her. My hands would travel over my belly and Id dream of a life growing inside. I swear, I could almost feel the kick.

Waking from those dreams brought both a renewed sense of purpose and a renewed sense of hopelessness. It was the latter that threatened to end my quest entirely. The impulse to sleep forever with the hope Ill be joined by my newborn was almost too tempting to pass up. Reopening old scar tissue on my arms and legs did little to quiet that voice. I had to stop waiting. 

The needles were long and fat and the contents were cold from the refrigerator. In that week, Id been with 30 men. My body ached and my self-esteem was gone, but theyd given me what I required. I carefully dissected the abdomens of the two homeless women Id lured up to my apartment and exsanguinated earlier this morning. Organs look so different in person, but I found my way around. I did some damage, but Im sure whatever ova I was able to suck into the syringe had to be healthier than what my body - the body of a failure - could produce. 

I injected myself with all of it, sperm and eggs, over the course of the day. My belly was a hole-filled, leaky wreck by the time I was done. The medication left me dizzier than Id ever been. But its all going to be worth it when this works. When this works, Im going to have a beautiful baby of my own. One who will be loved. One who wont be told he cant follow his dreams just because hes a boy.

	<TITLE> He Went Ahead </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-12 22:18:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My friends and I used to break into old, run-down places and explore. This was back before people were videotaping their own explorations and getting ad-revenue from their YouTube channels. Back before cell phones, even. Wed go wherever we wanted without much concern for the consequences if we were caught. All of us were still under 18 and Kims mom was a police officer, so even if we did get in a little trouble, we were fairly confident itd be taken care of.

Michael was the one who usually made the decisions about where we should go. He suggested we check out an abandoned institution about an hour out of town. A few weeks earlier, after he got out of work, he told me he made a quick trip over there just to see if he could get in. Once he did, he only spent a couple minutes walking around before he got the creeps. Still, he knew it was exactly the type of place wed always talked about wanting to explore. 

Itd been defunct for a few decades by the time we knew about it, and every door was locked and the windows had been boarded up. Well, every window on the first couple floors. A tree, which was probably only a few feet tall when the crews went around locking the place up, had grown tremendously in the following tens of years. It was nearly effortless for the four of us to scale the branches and crawl through the window Michael had broken when hed done his cursory scouting of the place. A couple minutes later, we were standing in a filthy, dust-coated file room.

Kim really didnt like how many spiderwebs were hanging off pretty much everything. I cant say I was much of a fan either, but my excitement to explore that creepy place overrode my mild arachnophobia. Still, this was southern Florida; we have some enormous spiders down here. I prefered to not get one on me.

We opened the door of the file room and found ourselves in a long hallway. None of us were sure what the function of the building had been, and from what wed seen so far, it was still anyones guess. We took a left down the dimly-lit hall, grateful for the high-powered flashlights Michael suggested we bring after seeing how dark the place was on his first trip. 

Placed on the floor in front of each room along the hall was its corresponding key. The doors had small windows in them, and we peered through. It looked like they were basic rooms; a toilet, a bed, a small desk. Little else. The beds were pretty small; I wondered if they were for children. We gave each room a quick glance and determined there was nothing particularly noteworthy inside, so we moved on.

At the end of the hall, there was a door leading to the staircase. We propped it open and went into the pitch-black stairwell. The steps leading up ended at a door that was locked. No key was nearby that couldve opened it. Heading down, though, after many failed attempts at accessing the lower floors, we finally found a door that actually opened. Heres the problem: as soon as we pulled it open, the door wed propped open slammed shut from what we assumed was the air pressure of the other one opening. No one freaked out or anything; we knew we could get out from a window or something pretty easily from the lower floors. Still, having no known and obvious way out was somewhat unsettling.

When we stepped through the door and shone our flashlights around the room, we realized wed passed the first floor and were in the basement. I wondered aloud what kind of place doesnt label the fucking floors in their stairwell, but no one really cared about my complaint. We were all wondering how wed get out if there were no windows around.

From what we could see with our three flashlights, since Kims had died, the basement was enormous. It was one large room and was filled with junk that we assumed had populated the floors above. Desks, file cabinets, coat racks, and all that stuff. Darryl suggested we split up and look for a way out, but Michael and Kim quickly shot down that idea. Im pretty sure they were getting scared. I didnt want to say anything, but they werent the only ones. I dont know why Darryl was so confident. He was usually the one who chickened out at the first sign of trouble. I was grateful for his strength, though. It felt good to have someone who could lead us, even if he didnt know where he was going.

We wandered through all the junk in an attempt to find a way out of there. There was a loud banging sound. Kim realized what it was before any of us and whispered, was that the door? Murmurs of fuck variations through our small group. No one was ready to panic, though. Not yet. The basement had to have been the size of a football field. We came to an agreement to pair off and go in opposite directions. Wed yell if we found anything.

Kim and Darryl went one way, I went with Michael in the other. Wed agreed to travel with only one flashlight. Michael and I didnt come right out and say it, but we figured Kim would be better off with her group having two.

We spent a slow ten minutes walking through the old furniture until deciding to turn back and follow the wall. The room was even bigger than wed realized. From outside, the building was about as long as wed expected the basement to be; approximately that of a football field. In fact, the basement must have been many times larger. Michael said it probably connected with all the other buildings on the property, which meant it couldve been almost a quarter mile in each direction. I hoped that wouldnt be the case. The flashlights wouldnt last that long and the last thing I wanted to do is deal with complete blackness. I knew Id panic.

As we progressed, we started seeing doors. They were all locked, though. No keys, no windows. Michael yelled to Darryl and Kim and asked if theyd found anything. His voice didnt echo. It almost sounded as if it stopped right in front of his face; like he was standing in front of a wall. We heard no response from our friends.

Our flashlight was growing noticeably dimmer. I thought its intensity had been diminishing for the last couple minutes, but Id done my best to put it out of my mind. But there was no denying it now. Michael had picked up his pace, forcing me to rush to catch up to his long-legged stride. I yelled for the others, hearing my own voice die inches in front of my mouth. I could hear Michael breathing quickly. Was he sobbing? He was too far ahead for me to see any tears and I was almost jogging to catch up. We kept on for what felt like ten minutes. How had we not run into the others yet? Michael stopped dead in his tracks and I skidded to a stop to avoid bumping into him. There was a right turn down a narrow passage. At the very, very end, barely illuminated by the still-dimming light, was a metal ladder. 

Michael ran and I did my best to follow. The light was almost useless. We reached the end and both grasped the ladder and Michael shone the lamp upward. Whatever had been there, maybe a hatch, maybe just an opening to another floor, was nothing but concrete ceiling. He yelled, fuck! The word sounded like it was coming from underwater.

The flashlight strobed weakly. He turned around and shone it around the narrow corridor. A few feet in front of us, on the right, was a door. Lets try that, he told me. Wed given up trying the doors wed run by after all of them were locked. I was surprised he wanted to bother, but in our hopelessness, we walked over and I tried the knob. It opened. I walked in as Michael shone the sputtering flashlight in front of him. The room was small and empty. Almost empty. In the corner, there was a lump. Holy shit, I exclaimed, and ran toward it. Right as our flashlight died, I grabbed what Id seen for that brief moment. It was another flashlight. I couldnt believe our luck, despite being terrified of the stygian blackness enveloping us.

I fumbled for the switch and flipped it upward. Michael stood in the doorway. The light was strong and unwavering. Only then did I register the hideous smell of the room, somehow obscured by my earlier panic. I shone the light around the tiny, filthy area. Nothing. I turned around and pointed it at the lump behind where I saw the flashlight. Sitting in the corner was a corpse, its flesh swollen with putrefaction. Gray eyes pushed out of its thick and unrecognizable purple face. Its distended tongue bulged from lips that looked like a circle of rotting slugs. Worms fed. I retched. The corpse was wearing green cargo shorts and a Buccaneers jersey, both of which had been soaked through with greasy fluid.

Green cargo shorts and a Buccaneers jersey. I whirled around and looked at Michael, who was still standing in the doorway. Green cargo shorts and a Buccaneers jersey. I muttered something I cant remember. He dropped the dead flashlight and took two steps toward me. I screamed and stumbled backward, falling into the cadaver. I felt its swollen body burst under my weight. Soft, jellylike material clung to my back, neck, butt, and arms. The smell was incomprehensible. Flies buzzed angrily in my ears as I struggled to my feet and tried to keep the flashlight shining on the person, the thing, Id been walking with. 

The brilliant white of the lamp illuminated its face again. It hadnt moved any further after those first steps. It stared through me at the corner where Michaels destroyed body sat. Neither of us moved. Then its lower eyelids drooped. It almost looked like it was having a stroke, only on on both sides of its face. The skin continued to fall, lower, and lower, exposing the musculature underneath. The eyes burst from their sockets and hung down, swinging on their optic nerves. Then its mouth moved. I was paralyzed by abject terror. 

The mouth opened wider and wider, the jawbone snapping and popping as it shattered in protest of the constant force. The lower mandible hung flaccidly from its cheeks, connected only by skin. From its throat, something white began to drip. Then pour. Then flood. Repulsive, milky liquid gouted from the gaping hole in its throat. It splashed on the ground, soaking my feet and shins and knees. It was so slick; so warm; a perverse shower of liquid body heat that reminded me of semen and amniotic fluid.

The thing grabbed both sides of my head. I dropped the flashlight and it shone, uselessly, against the wall before blinking out, destroyed by the gushing fluid. In utter blackness, I felt incomprehensibly strong hands and arms pull me toward its mouth. My forehead touched the flood. I was pulled in, further and further. I gasped and aspirated the fluid. As I choked and coughed, more of it filled my lungs. I knew I was about to die. The blackness disappeared.

I awoke to a flashlight being shone in my face. Darryl was yelling my name while Kim screamed unintelligible blather beginning and ending with the word Michael. Darryl hauled me to my feet and practically carried me down the hall, across the expansive basement, and through the area theyd explored. Kim ran behind us, sobbing. I vomited milky bile as we went, coating Darryls arm, who gave no sign of noticing or caring. I have no idea how far we went, but I remember seeing daylight creeping around the beam of his flashlight. Over time, the flashlight became increasingly useless and he dropped it. We moved on and on. I was eventually able to run on my own and I followed them, cluelessly. But before I knew anything, we were outside. I passed out.

I was in the hospital for days that passed in a haze of incomprehension. Gradually, I regained some semblance of consciousness. Inquisitiveness followed. Michael, I was told, was dead. Id found his body. They assumed the shock of seeing my dead friend induced some temporary hysteria which caused me to desecrate the corpse. But still, no one knew what had happened to him. The fact his body looked like it had been dead for three weeks eliminated me from being a suspect in his death, but no one could explain how hed gotten to such a state of decomposition.  Not only his three friends, but his parents and coworkers, could verify theyd spoken and interacted with him every day up until he was found.

I havent said anything about what happened with the Michael-shaped creature after the body was found. I also didnt mention Michael had scouted out the place three weeks before we visited. I just wanted to believe I hallucinated the whole thing, but that didnt explain the unidentifiable organic fluid they found all over me, some of which which had dried in glutinous clumps that could only be removed by excising chunks of my skin. Twenty years later, every time I finger the scar tissue of the old excisions, I can still taste the stuff on my mouth and pouring down the back of my throat. Whenever I sit back in a chair, I expect it to burst like the body of the friend I once loved. And every time I get within 20 miles of the abandoned institution, I can hear Michael screaming for me to come back and help him.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> About ten years ago, I dated a masseuse named Valerie. Well, masseuse in training. She was passionate and enthusiastic and she practiced as frequently as she could. That meant I got a ton of free massages. Obviously, since we were a couple, those massages would escalate and turn into that usual thing couples do, but it was only after she felt shed gotten in a good practice session.

After one of our, ahem, sessions, Val looked a little confused but also relieved. I asked her what was up. She told me the sores she had on the inside of her mouth didnt hurt anymore. Wed talked about those things before. She said they werent contagious, thankfully, but shed had to endure them for most of her life and they were intensely painful; sometimes even debilitatingly so. Doctors prescribed an ointment for her to put on them when the outbreaks occurred, but they barely took the edge off. Plus, she was deeply attached to the ideas of natural healing and homeopathy and all that, so she very, very rarely used the medication. But that night, for the first time in a while, I could tell she wasnt powering through her pain. She genuinely felt good and had no idea why.

Her pain returned a few hours later. As always, she did her best to ignore it. Fast forward a couple days - another massage, another occasion for sexy times. Midway through, she stopped kissing me and exclaimed, thats it! I didnt know what she was talking about. She rolled off me and stuck her finger in my mouth. Not really sure what the hell was going on, I just sat up on the bed and let her do whatever she was doing. She pulled her wet finger from my mouth and stuck it in her own. I saw her rubbing the inside of her cheek. Her face brightened and she informed me, with complete certainty, that my saliva was taking away her pain. I laughed and said something encouraging despite thinking she was nuts. Then she hopped back on me and I completely forgot everything shed said.

The next day, I was lying face down on her massage table. She was doing her usual, outstanding work while I stared down at the floor through that little padded hole where ones face goes. Without any warning, there was a blinding pain in my head. I passed out. I have no idea how long I was unconscious. When I came to, I tried to get up, but I was completely immobilized. I couldnt turn my head or lift my arms. It felt like I was taped to the table. Not only that, but there was something metal in my mouth. I couldnt close my jaw or even dislodge the thing with my tongue. I yelled around it. Valerie, whod apparently been standing next to me, simply said, shhhhhh.

I saw her hand and arm appear in front of my down-turned face. She held a small, glass baking dish, which she placed on the floor under my mouth. Im sorry if the speculum is uncomfortable, she said. At the mention of the word, I gagged. A thin column of saliva drooled from my gaping maw and landed inside the glass container. She reached under and gathered a dollop of the fluid onto her fingertip. Her hand disappeared from my field of view, but I knew where it was going. I heard her moan with relief.

Im not sure how long Ill keep you here, she informed me. But dont be loud.
In response, I yelled. A hideously sharp pain erupted from my lower back, right around my left kidney. Thats a 3 inch long pin, Valerie said. Please dont scream anymore. I hate hurting people. I shut up.

As the hours went by, the bottom of the pan grew slick with a cloudy puddle of my saliva. I heard Valerie walking around the house, doing laundry, washing dishes; basic, everyday activity. The clatter of pots and pans told me it was almost dinner time. I was ravenous; I estimated itd been almost 24 hours since Id had any food.

Glorious aromas wafted from the kitchen as she cooked. My salivary glands went into overdrive and I drizzled their secretions into the waiting container. I heard Val walk in and she placed a plate piled high with spaghetti carbonara and what appeared to be a pork chop directly next to the collection pan. My mouth oozed.

You cant have this, she whispered in my ear. But feel free to enjoy the smell.

She walked away and turned on the TV. The room filled with sitcom banalities as my body leaked its desire for the meal into the waiting dish. I wanted to cry.

At some point, I fell asleep. When I woke up in the morning, the plate of food was gone. The house was quiet. I assumed Val had gone to class. I gargled out a weak yell, but theres no way anyone wouldve heard it. I was so incredibly thirsty. The smell from the collected saliva was absolutely horrendous. I could see particulate matter dotting the glass bottom; probably old food that had detached from between my teeth. My mouth felt terribly dry. Saliva still leaked from the glands, but it was thick, almost like corn syrup. The color was milky gray. When it hit the stuff that was already in the pan, it separated like salad dressing. Oily liquid swirled to the top. I couldnt believe how much Id produced over the last couple days.

The sound of the front door opening heralded the return of Valerie. She walked over, putting her sneakers in my narrow view. I felt her scratch the top of my head. You doing okay?, she asked, sounding genuinely concerned. I muttered something obscene from around the speculum. She bent down and picked up the pan. Saliva sloshed thickly against the sides. Im going to let you go today, Val informed me. I choked out a sigh of relief.

I saw a knife for a second and was certain she was about to cut my throat. Instead, she sliced through the duct tape that was holding my head to the table. I craned my neck upward and tried to shake out the awful muscle cramps. In front of me, I watched Val carefully pour some of the accumulated spit into a glass. She brought it to her lips and took a tiny sip. I almost threw up. She didnt swallow right away. I could see her swishing it around her mouth and aerating it as if she were a disgusting sommelier sampling a fine Brunello. She smiled at me as she swallowed.

Valerie reached into her purse and pulled out a small handgun. Of course she had a fucking gun. I didnt move. She calmly told me she was about to cut me loose but if I ran before she could talk to me, Id get shot. I nodded. 

She cut the tape away. I was suddenly self-conscious as the smell of my old spit was replaced by the ammonia odor of when Id pissed myself those two times. Dont worry about it, she whispered. After everything was cut away, she apologized in advance before pulling the tape off my head to unsecure the speculum still violating my mouth. Chunks of hair came with the tape and I winced. I let the metal instrument drop to the ground. My jaw felt like itd been pummelled by a prize fighter.

I stood up and Val pointed the gun at my chest. I stretched, slowly, then sat back down. She took another small sip before she spoke.

When you leave, I know youre going to call the police. And I know Ill get arrested. But I just want you to know how much I appreciate you for helping me.

I didnt say anything. She was nuts. Obviously. She gulped down the rest of the cold saliva and put the glass on the coffee table. The pan was still 75% full.

You can go, she told me.

I grabbed my car keys from the table and left. As soon as I closed the door to her apartment, I sprinted as quickly as my cramped legs would allow, got into the car, and drove away. As I went home, I called 911 and did my best to explain what happened. They said theyd stop by her place and see what was going on, then theyd visit me at home. Sure enough, a few hours later, the police visited my apartment. They told me Valerie was dead. Self-inflicted gunshot wound. Shed left a note, but all it said was, youll understand soon enough.

A year later, I started getting sores in my mouth. The pain was indescribable. Theyd last for a couple days before bursting. Theyd eventually heal, but two weeks later theyd just reappear. I was missing work because I couldnt even breathe through my mouth without searing agony. The doctors gave me some awful-tasting ointment to put on them, but it might as well have been water. Nothing helped. 

I didnt want to, but I started sleeping around. Men, women, it didnt matter. Partner after partner crossed my bed. Finally, I found one. Then another. Then another. Seven years later, theyre up to a gallon of production per day. The flavor took some getting used to, but hey, the taste of medicine doesnt matter much when it actually works. The trick, I learned, was to keep my producers hydrated and fed just enough so the quality doesnt drop off. Early on, my little cows (thats what I call them) used to be pretty boisterous in the mornings when I went to collect their milk, but theyve calmed down over the years. I just hope they know how much I appreciate them. Deep down, I bet they do.

	<TEXT> Theres nothing scary about the woods. Sorry guys. Or, should I say, sorry kids. I get it. You all saw Blair Witch Project or read some shitty creepypasta BS online and suddenly some of the most beautiful places in the world are havens for demons or zombies or whatever garbage is lining the pockets of writers these days. But guess what: its all your imagination. Look, I remember being a kid. My mind would go all over the place: ghosts, goblins, aliens, blah blah blah. You know what happened, though? I hit 13. I saw the real world.

Heres why Im so irritated about all this oooh Im too scared to go into the woods now bullshit. I live near a state park. There are quite a few local businesses that used to thrive because of the high number of hikers, picnickers, and daytrippers during the spring, summer, and fall. But over the last couple years, perfectly coinciding with those idiot kids one-upping each other to cry about how scared they are, these businesses have lost a ton of money. Yes, I own one of them. An ice cream stand.

I could see the trend starting, too. Pasty white, black-clad preteens on vacation with their parents would whine about being too frightened to go on a mile-long hike along a pristine trail just because there were spooky trees around. All while shoveling ice cream into their soft faces. I thought back to what my father wouldve done if I complained about being too much of a baby to walk around outside for an afternoon. The only ice cream hed have bought wouldve been for me to put on my black eye.

So Ive lost money because of this shit. My buddies lost money, too. Spouses divorced each other, kids ended up not going to the colleges they wanted to, and the local economy, aside from the revenue from skiers in the winter, went to hell. And its all because of those little assholes who think fragile bleating and cowering in fear is more desirable than strength and resiliency. I weep for the future.

My ice cream stand is supposed to reopen on March 1st. Already, though, I can tell its going to be a brutal season. The pervasiveness of those online stories about creepy things in the woods and omg I cant believe what I found in this diary while I was hiking has just grown and grown. When I look through the comments on the ridiculous websites that showcase that trash, I see adults, *ADULTS*, saying how terrified they are to even go out in their backyards because they think some skinny guy in a suit or a troll monster is going to possess them or something. 

Never once have the authors of that garbage thought about how their recklessness is destroying small businesses. Before my wife died, I used to be able to look out from my back porch and see families hiking through the woods, kids skipping stones across the pond, and dads teaching their sons or daughters how to safely build a fire using sticks. Now, theres just the timeless woods and a devastated economy. The childish dopes succeeded in scaring themselves away from nature and they screwed up the livelihoods of real people in the process.

Thankfully, every now and then, a family will walk by the house and do the things I used to see before all that Im too scared horseshit started. The other day, for the first time in nearly three years, a young couple braved the melting snow and mud and set up a tent right on the outskirts of my property. Do you know how happy it made me to finally see some people who werent afraid of ghosts or haunted woods? 

I mustve stayed in the tent until the sun came up, enjoying their warm, young meat. The women died instantly but her husband or boyfriend or whatever remained alive for hours. The only benefit of such a low population of hikers nowadays is that not a single person heard him screaming as he watched me eat the most tender morsels of his partner before I unleashed my appetite on him. Another bonus: they were in a tent! I just had to wrap it around them and drag them back to the house. No fuss, no muss. 

After all my complaining, I have to admit, finding two people who were brave enough to go out in the woods helped me feel better. It showed me they didnt follow trends and did their own thing, just like in the old days. It doesnt entirely make up for the lost wages and the harm to our local economy, but its still something. That knowledge, plus a freezer full of meat thatll last me through the spring, helps warm my cynical heart.

	<TEXT> I dont want to write about this. Ill try to keep it short. My doctor suggested I put it down on paper, though, so he can have a better idea of how everything happened. Hed never seen such a thing in his 30 years of practicing medicine and he actually wants to talk about my case at an ENT conference next summer. So why am I posting the story here? Because if I have to suffer through writing it, you might as well suffer through reading it. Yeah, Im a prick. 

Id always been an avid outdoorsman. Hiking was my thing. After my divorce, I did what I thought I had to do: quit my job and hike the whole Appalachian Trail. You know how your coaches always used to say walk it off after a bad hit? Well, after being sodomized by the vicious cock of alimony, I needed the longest walk I could think of. So off I went.

It was March when I started and I was pretty damn cold for a while, but I knew itd warm up as the hike progressed. Contrary to the wishes of my friends, Id insisted on going alone. I was an experienced hiker. No, I hadnt gone such a great distance before, but I was definitely in good physical shape and knew quite a bit about outdoorsy stuff from spending time in the woods with my father before he died.

To be honest, the first six weeks bored the living shit out of me. Yes, the scenery was beautiful. Yes, the feeling of accomplishment I expected to experience at the end of it all would be memorable. Still, it sucked. I found myself walking faster and faster just hoping to finish a day or so earlier so I wouldnt have to deal with it anymore. 

On cue, when my boredom had reached its peak, I got an awful cold. It was a nightmare. It seemed like every ten steps I had to stop, pick up an old leaf, and blow a gallon of snot out of me. For those who are laughing at me right now and saying Im stupid for not just blowing out snot rockets, hey - Im glad I could give you something to laugh at. But the reality of the situation was that the shit up my nose was like rubber cement. The one time I tried to blow without a leaf, I got a trail of yellow slime going from my left nostril to my knee. So thanks for laughing, but fuck off.

Anyway, as the days went by and Id Hansel-and-Greteled the forest with mucousy leaves, I started to get concerned that my cold hadnt gotten any better. Quite the contrary. My sinuses were packed with snot. And I mean packed; you know when youre in bed and you put your head on one side and you can feel your sinuses drain a little and get some relief? There was no relief. And every few minutes, I was blowing progressively-thicker goo onto anything unfortunate enough to get within my reach.

There was one morning in early May, after Id been sick for two straight weeks, that I knew I needed to hop off the trail and find a local clinic. I was fairly sure I had a sinus infection and it was severely affecting the amount of walking I wanted to do every day. I took a turn off the trail and in the general direction of a town.

The map indicated Id be off the trail for almost a day. It wasnt the ideal situation, but I really wanted to get some antibiotics. The way out was through. A few miles in, though, the pressure in my sinuses turned into blinding pain. I had to sit down and rest. There was no way Id be able to get to town before dark at the rate I was going. I did my best to blow out the horrible contents of my nose, which was now dark yellow and as viscous as chewing gum. 

I used my fingers to pull out as much as I could. There was almost no relief, though. Most of it was deep in my sinuses and no amount of picking or blowing was going to get it out. I wandered over to a small stream to wash my disgusting hands. As I pulled the slime off my fingers, I caught sight of something that caused me to gasp. I looked under my index fingernail. Buried inside the compacted dirt and snot was the unmistakable segmented body of a white worm.

Now I was really, really freaked out. I dragged the piece out from under my nail and inspected it. It wasnt a whole worm. It looked like my fingernail had broken off either the front or back end of the thing. The pressure in my sinuses only intensified as my panic grew. I told myself the piece of worm had to have been under my nail before it I picked my nose. It was futile consolation. Every night for the last couple nights Id heard what I thought was the moving and settling of my sinus contents. Now I knew. Id heard them moving around. And that realization was where I lost it.

Rather than trying to blow out, I snorted the contents backward, trying to get them into my throat so I could spit them out. After a couple powerful snorts, I felt something hit the back of my throat. I spit it onto the ground. On the brown pine needles, a fat white worm half the size of my pinky wriggled in yellow snot. I screamed. 

Over and over I tried to spit more of them out. Only one came. With the slightly diminished sinus pressure, I could feel them for what they were. This was the first time theyd been able to make any significant movement because theyd been so tightly packed together. But now, they wandered. I felt their thick bodies crawling around behind my nose and under my eyes. I started to hyperventilate when I felt one start to slither down into my nostril. I scratched and pulled at it with my fingers, but it wouldnt budge. It just sat there, writhing. 

The sensation was indescribably horrific and I needed the fucking thing out of me. I squeezed my nostrils together with my hand as hard as I could. I felt the worm burst inside and a torrent of gray sludge poured out of its destroyed body. Now deflated, I could pull its body all the way out. It was almost three inches long. It slapped on the forest floor like a used condom.

While the terror I felt was immeasurable, having expelled three worms from my sinuses gave me more relief from the pressure than I could have imagined. I still could feel others slithering inside me, though. But my breathing was much, much better. I started to run toward town. I didnt stop until I got there.

There isnt much else to say. I got to the main road and a kind soul let me hitch a ride to the clinic in the back of his pickup. The local doctor was pretty surprised, but he didnt seem to think I was in any danger. He asked where I lived, did a little research, and found a highly-accomplished ear, nose, and throat specialist only a couple miles from my house. Later that night I was on a plane back home. The pressure change of the airplane wreaked havoc on my sinuses and it felt like the worms inside were throwing party, but I managed to stay somewhat composed. The guy next to me didnt particularly like how I kept snorting up phlegm and spitting it into the puke bag.

The next morning, I met with the ENT guy. He did a whole bunch of stuff with small cameras that made me gag and he made a lot of sounds like he was absolutely fascinated by what was in me. After he pulled seven of the things out of me and warned that there are probably eggs inside thatll need to get dealt with sooner or later, he tried to figure out how theyd gotten there. It only took about 20 minutes before he concluded Id gotten their eggs in my nose from one of the leaves Id used as a tissue when I first got the cold. Lovely.

So thats that. Over the next couple weeks, he did some stuff to clean out my sinuses and gave me some pills he said would kill anything else that might be up there. Last week, he asked me to write this shit so he could share it with his ENT buddies who were really jealous hed gotten to treat such a cool case. Well, hi guys. Every time I blow my nose I expect to see a fat worm looking up at me from the tissue asking why I evicted it from its home. Have a great conference.

	<TEXT> **FDD MICROCYCLE: Angel-Snowdrop-Caterpillar** 

I dont want to bring my son into town because I know people will stare and try to interfere. You know the kind of folks Im talking about. Gossips and busybodies. Theyll look at him and say hes sick; that his color looks bad; that hes lethargic. A couple men, Jehovahs Witnesses, I think, rang the bell last week. I answered with my boy in my arms, and they had the audacity to gasp when they saw Cullen. I just slammed the door in their stupid, pious faces. I have my own faith, anyway -- my Lord tells me everyone is welcome, no matter how they look.

When Cullys mom died giving birth to him, I buried her myself. Its what weve always done in our family. Weve had six generations of Dempseys come and go. Each one is on our property, six feet underground at the foot of the rock face. No gravestones. No need to tie them to their earthly names when theyre beyond. Their memories live on through our journals and essays. Its what my great-many-time-over grandfather, Finian Domnall Dempsey, demanded of all his children, grandchildren, and so on. Its how our legacy will endure. 

Ill admit to not being the best father over the first couple months of Cullys life. I often forget to feed him. Sometimes I leave him alone for hours at a time if I need to run errands. Ive never once heard him cry or whine, though. Hes very sweet like that. Not a complainer. One thing Ive always remembered to do, though, since its hard to forget, is bathe him. As the time has gone by, his smell has gotten worse and worse. In the back of my mind, I know the reason. Im not ready to admit it yet. My boy is healthy. Strong.

**FDD MICROCYCLE: Angel-Sunflower-Lamb**

This was one of our shorter microcycles. It feels good to write an update so soon, though; only about a month after the last one. Cullen hasnt moved. The food I tuck into his mouth, hoping hell swallow, just sits there and putrefies until I turn him over and let it tumble out. That thing in the back of my mind I mentioned last microcycle is hard to deny nowadays. Cullys gone unwashed for at least three weeks. Whenever I tried to do it, hed get damaged. I cant bear to hurt my boy. Ive since swaddled him up in the tiny blanket Sine had knitted for him. I wish she couldve seen him in it. He looks so peaceful.

**FDD MICROCYCLE: Archangel-Thistle-Lion**

I had to stop denying the reality of Cullens situation today. More and more of him had leaked through the blue pastel blanket his mother had made to keep him warm and safe. The entire house smelled of death. The end of the macrocycle just made the impending trip to the rock face that much more of a necessity.

At the foot of the rock face, above the bodies of those who came before me, countless flowers grew. Their bright faces shone with hope and encouragement, doing their best to cut through the morosity I felt. I carefully placed Cullen on the grass. I unwrapped the blanket and stared at the carcass of my son. As the wind took his odor away and poured it into the woods, I thought about the long wait Id have to endure. Another three quarters of a year until Id see my next Angel. 

The swollen torso of Cullen collapsed inward as his livid flesh melted into the grass. His little mouth stretched open, popping softly as the decayed jawbone separated. His swollen tongue pushed itself out over his nose and forehead, followed by his esophagus, stomach, and intestines. A wanton orgy of flies descended upon the viscera, only to die the moment they touched the glistening surface. From the soil beneath my beloved boy, countless black tendrils of the finest gossamer erupted in an infinitely-long, omnidirectional spread. In my mind, I recalled the last words in Finian Domnall Dempseys journal hed left before inaugurating the very first macrocycle: *...and corruption will begin its inexorable metastasis in testicles and breasts and bones.*

The carcinogenic tendrils of Archangelic filaments continued their eruption until the last of my beautiful boy had dissolved into the dirt. And he was gone. I mourned for what felt like hours and watched snowdrops, sunflowers, and thistles rise from the Cullen-fertilized ground. I felt empty. Alone. 

I walked back into my home, trudged down to the basement, and unlocked the cage which held the soon-mother of my future Angel. I told her what her name would be, then I handed her a ball of yarn and two needles. Sine got to work immediately. Later that afternoon, I planted the seed of the new Cullen. All thats left for me to do is wait.

	<TEXT> Pre-investigation memorandum, Detective Natalie Hermoso. February 5, 2016.

I was mailed this dashboard camera following the initial police and paramedic response to the incident on Route 3, January 2, 2016.

	<TEXT> You know when you have something in your house or yard for so long it just becomes part of the scenery? You dont pay any day-to-day attention to it, but youd know right away if it was missing or damaged? Well, Im a retired farmer. Ive got more property than I know what to do with and more stuff than I know where to put. After 65 years of living in the same spot with the same junk, everything is just scenery. Me included.

Early this morning, when I was making some coffee, I noticed the scarecrow out back was different. I couldnt quite put my finger on what it was. Its pretty far away from the house, and the way my eyesight is these days, I wouldnt be finding out what had changed until I hauled myself across the field to look from up close. But with the rain coming down as bad as it was, I wouldnt be satisfying my curiosity any time soon.

I forgot about the scarecrow and went about my daily routine. Coffee with a bacon sandwich on rye with butter. I still have no idea how I developed a taste for rye. When Peggy was still around, shed always make fun of me for having exotic tastes. I did my best to downplay my love for the stuff when she made her own bread. It was good, but wasnt rye. That said, Id give up my stupid rye if it meant getting her back.

I had my breakfast at the kitchen table while reading the obituaries. Some poor bastard had published an obit for his Golden Retriever, Happy. Peggy wanted a Golden all her life and I kept putting it off and putting it off until her doctor found the cancer. A month later, I was a widower who never got his wife the one thing shed always wanted. I hated how that felt. Still do. I tossed the paper across the table and went into the living room to watch some TV.

Morning television is horseshit. One of the things that really stinks about getting older is you just cant sleep in anymore. Its not even the fact Im wide awake as soon as the god damn rooster starts screaming outside, but its how Ive been back and forth to the toilet 12 times since I nodded off the night before. Its hard to rest when youve got a prostate like a softball. Anyway, I was in my recliner watching some awful television about a judge who yells at people when there was a loud bang outside near the kitchen.

I figured some poor, dumb bird flew himself into one of the windows or the storm door. I dragged myself off the recliner and headed toward the kitchen, fairly certain Id have to be replacing some cracked glass. The last thing I needed was water getting in the house.

To my surprise, despite the telltale shape of a birds dusty body on the window, all the glass was fine. Filthy, because Im too lazy to wash them more than once a month, but fine. Satisfied yet tremendously bored, I stared outside and remembered the change to the scarecrow. With my curiosity still piqued, I directed my gaze at it. Same weirdness. The wind was making the remainder of the cornstalks bend pretty badly, but the rain had finally tapered off. I pulled on my boots, opened the back door, and headed out into the field.

The scarecrow stood about 500 feet, or around 150 meters for you Euros, away from the house. Peggy suggested we get it back in the 70s. I never really knew why. We didnt have any damn crows. Shed dressed the thing in an old tuxedo shed found at some thrift store, and that was that. Still no crows. Over the decades, the clothes became worn and tattered. The tux was just scraps of cloth but its cork or whatever-wood body stayed pretty intact. Thats why I got surprised when it looked different that morning. The thing was built like a tank.

I couldnt see a damn thing as I walked through the field in the scarecrows direction. Most of the viable corn plants were gone, but lots of crappy ones still grew pretty tall. I was soaked from the dripping stalks after just ten steps. I figured I might as well keep going just to satisfy the diminishing curiosity and feel like I succeeded in doing something today. After a couple minutes, I got to the scarecrow.

It stood about 15 feet high. When I looked up at it, I felt like an assholes asshole. Whyd it look different? The wind had blown so hard it turned the body around so instead of its front facing the window, its side did. And if I actually got glasses when the doctor told me to, I wouldve seen that from the kitchen and saved myself a walk and a soaking. I headed back.

I stepped out of the cornfield and went around to the front of the house. Id forgotten to put away my motorcycle the night before and I needed to make sure the wind hadnt blown it over. Once I saw the bike was fine, I turned and saw that the fucking storm door was shattered. On cue, the torrential rain resumed, further soaking me and pouring into the house. I was not happy.

Blood-covered glass from the storm door crunched under my boots as I walked through the front hall. The thing that hit the door mustve been huge; itd left a trail of gore all the way into the living room. Whatever it was stunk so bad my eyes started to water. As I looked around for its corpse, I stopped in my tracks. The scarecrow, the pouring rain, and the shattered door were put out of my mind when I saw a dog standing next to my recliner. It was terribly injured. Injured to the point where I couldnt believe it was still alive.

Loops of intestines clung to the floor, leaking putrid grease that bloomed outward as it spread over the hardwood. Its remaining fur, once yellow or some variant thereof, was matted with encrusted blood and other nauseating fluids. It looked emaciated; the flesh of its chest clung to its ribs like rotting shrinkwrap. Through the patchy fur by its neck, a massive infestation of maggots writhed and chewed at the meat. But still, somehow, the dog stood.

When it saw me, the remaining part of the tail swung weakly, as if it was happy to see me. Something clicked and my blood chilled. Happy. The color of the dog was definitely gold. I could see it now that Id made the connection. I said aloud, Happy, and the ruined animals tail wagged even harder. Its smell was incomprehensibly awful. Behind the odor of putrefaction, though, something else lurked. Something familiar and, dare I say, pleasurable. I told the dog to stay, assuming it would die from its injuries before I came back, and I walked into the kitchen. Happy, like all Golden Retrievers, disobeyed. He followed me; bowels dragging behind him.

The other smell intensified as I got closer to the kitchen. I looked on the table. A loaf of rye bread sat on a cooling rack with tendrils of steam rising from its surface. My confusion was turning into frustration. Who the hell brought me a loaf of bread? Whys there a left-for-dead dog stinking up the house? My questions were answered when I felt a hand on my shoulder. I jumped half a mile and spun around. In the same green dress she was married in; the same green dress she was buried in, was Peggy. Wisps of blonde hair grew from the desiccated flesh of her scalp. The empty sockets which housed the eyes Id gazed into so often gaped at me. Then I knew.

I embraced my wife with care. I didnt want to damage her. Then I released her and sat at the table, chewing on the best rye bread Ive ever eaten. Happy sniffed at Peggy, who knelt down, joints cracking like gunshots, and wrapped her arms around its rotting body. She pressed the side of her head against his wormy neck. I could tell she loved him. After Id eaten my fill and watched Happys ragged, dry tongue adoringly lick between Peggys teeth, I started to write. And here I am. Well, here we are.

Peggy had gotten the revolver down from the shelf in the pantry. She placed it on the table while I wrote, then came behind me and wrapped her arms around my torso. Now her head is resting on my shoulder, waiting for me to finish up. If anyone asks what happened to the old farmer who lived on the edge of town, just show them this letter. Im ready to go spend time with my wife.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before my husband died, our daughter, Veronica, was diagnosed with childhood schizophrenia. We brought her to countless specialists and nearly all of them came to the same conclusion. The condition is rare, but certainly not unheard of. We were devastated. The doctors suggested that we not start her on medication right away. They were concerned the chemicals might interfere with the development of her brain. At five years old, when proper brain development is critical, they didnt want to chance it. Only if the hallucinations became severe would they prescribe antipsychotics.

Paul said it might help if we could identify the hallucinations over the course of the next year so we might know what to expect before she started school. This was pretty hard for me to agree with. Id wanted her to start kindergarten right away. Shed demonstrated she was smart enough and more than capable, but eventually I caved. I just didnt want to admit that Veronica needed special attention. We needed to separate her hallucinations from the normal, everyday make-believe that every kid her age does.

We started to pick up on a few outliers. One was a big dog who played with her while she was supposed to be sleeping. The other was a fish who followed her around and talked to her about cartoons. Most disconcerting to both of us, though, was the dark man with no eyes, nose, or ears who said how much fun it would be if she ran out and played in the street. More than once, Paul told me hed chased after Veronica after she opened the screen door and ran toward the busy road.

After the third time, Paul got up at dawn, called in sick, and spent the day putting up a fence. It was summertime, and as much as I wanted to keep Veronica indoors, I knew sunshine and fresh air were too important for her to miss out on. Still, whenever Veronica played outside, she would make a beeline for the fence and start crying whenever she couldnt go beyond it. I remember sitting with her on the grass next to the fence as she sobbed and talked to the fish about how the dark man was mad at her and had told the dog to be mean when they played. Then she screamed for a long time. When I finally got her to tell me what was wrong, all she said was that the fish got hit by a car and died. I did my best to console her, but it was useless.

Paul and I had a long talk that night. We decided her condition might be bad enough to require the medication wed desperately tried to avoid giving her. After a trip to the doctor, who listened intently to all the observations wed made, he agreed her condition was potentially severe and prescribed the drugs. We were told to observe her very, very carefully. The medication could cause the hallucinations to get worse before they got better.

Three days into Veronicas medication experiment, her hallucinations became violent. Id never seen our daughter so frightened. Over the course of two terrifying days, shed describe to us how the fish turned into a monster after he died and made her water taste rotten; how the dog would hurt her whenever she was alone; how the dark man without the nose, ears, or eyes scratched her tummy so hard shed start bleeding. Then she lifted her shirt. There were fresh scratches all over her belly. I looked at her fingernails, and sure enough, I could see tiny scraps of skin and blood underneath. Paul and I were at a loss.

The stress of Veronicas episodes strained the relationship between me and my husband. I could tell his depression had reemerged. Still, I cared more about my innocent daughter than my adult spouse. The doctors asked that we begin to taper off Veronicas medication to see if things got any better. I couldnt see any difference. Veronica was always scared and kept scratching herself when we werent around, usually when she was asleep.

Paul and I began trading off nights where we slept in Veronicas room to keep an eye on her. Still, Id find blood on her sheets and clothes and under her nails whenever Id check. Each of her hallucinations had become violent. The fish would bite her, the dog would lie on top of her so she couldnt breathe, and the dark man would scratch her. I seriously wondered if Veronica needed to be institutionalized.

Paul shot himself in the head on a Sunday morning while Veronica and I were in the kitchen eating breakfast. I wont bother detailing the shock, the feeling of betrayal, and the sheer sensation of helplessness that followed. I was left alone to care for a dreadfully ill daughter.

A couple weeks after his funeral, I was cleaning the house with Veronica by my side, proudly displaying the new mittens her aunt had purchased for her in hopes that she might stop scratching. So far, theyd worked pretty well. For whatever reason, Veronica was in one of her rare good moods as we went through the house. I was boxing up small stuff that had belonged to Paul. It hurt too much to see it every day.

Veronica chattered idly about sleeping a lot better lately with no bad dreams and the dog not getting on top of her anymore and the fish being kind and funny again. I told her how nice that was and we brought the box I was carrying out back to Pauls shed. I thought about asking her if the dark man with the scary face was still asking her to hurt herself. Before I could speak, I saw her furiously scratching her belly. I sighed. Thank goodness for the mittens.

After trying about 15 of the 30-or-so keys Paul had kept on his keyring, I finally chose the right one for the shed. I opened the door and Veronica ran inside to explore. She turned left, I turned right, looking for a place to put the box. Veronica giggled and exclaimed, now *Im* on top of *you*! I turned toward her to see who she was talking to. Crumpled up in the corner, underneath Veronica, was a dog suit.

	<TEXT> When I was 17, I was in a head-on collision with another driver. I think I was unconscious for a minute or two after the impact. When I came to, I was confused and couldnt feel any pain. I couldnt move much, though. Something was pinning me. A downward glance showed me what it was. There was a metal rod impaling directly under my knee, through what the doctors later told me was my patellar tendon. It had pushed through the tendon, lifted my kneecap, and driven itself up the length of my thigh. It wasnt too deep inside; I could see it bulging under my skin.

A minute later, I felt everything. I screamed and screamed, thrashing for a bit before realizing any movement only intensified the pain in my knee and thigh. Then I looked out the cracked windshield and saw the other driver. His devastated skull sat on his neck like a mashed fruit. I could see his tongue lolling out of his ruined mouth. Without a lower jawbone to hold it in place, it hung down to his Adams apple. The remaining eye stared, unblinking, at the damaged its owner had caused. 

Another wave of impossibly acute agony surged through me, blurring my vision and forcing me to bite down on my own teeth until I felt at least one molar crack. Some part of my consciousness registered the fact I was hyperventilating and worked to calm my breathing. A couple moments later, the wave had passed. I realized no cars had come upon our accident yet. I tried to reach into the back pocket of my shorts for my cell phone, but there was no way the rod in my knee would allow that much movement. In exchange for my attempt, the unbearable pain resumed.

Once Id regained my senses, I looked again at the remains of the other driver. There wasnt much I could make out. It looked he hed had a beard; hair was puffing out from the skin of what might have been his cheeks. Even though he was the one whod caused me all this pain, I felt bad he was dead. No one deserved to have that happen to them. While I studied the gore with morbid fascination, the mans neck jerked and sent the fleshy wreckage of his face flopping back and forth. He jerked again. This time, his shoulders and torso moved as well. I gagged as the movement forced his head downward and bits of his crushed brain oozed from the hole that was once his face.

The man continued moving as if he was enduring a terrible seizure. My pain came back. Unable to bear the sensation, I blacked out. It couldnt have been very long. When I came to, there was something wrong with the mans body. Something I couldnt understand. The hole where his face had connected to his throat was stuffed with something. It slid out in a thick, wet mass onto the twisted steering wheel and dashboard. From my vantage point, about six feet away, I could only describe it as a worm or snake. Still, it was unlike either of those things. The body was grayish-white and oozed heavy, milky yellow discharge from gaping pores which covered the entirety of its length. That length increased as I watched with growing horror.

The return of the pain in my knee was unable to overcome the fear sweeping over me at the sight of the monster. Over ten feet had unfurled from the carcass and had draped itself along the dashboard. It was lying on surfaces coated with pulverized glass from the windshield, and I could see chunks of it sticking in its pores as it moved. The thing didnt seem to mind. Once another few feet came out, I saw its tail end finally discharge itself from the man. The parasite squirmed off the dashboard and onto the crumpled union of car hoods. The viscous, milky slime clung to every surface it touched and kept the creature connected to the contacted surfaces by thin ropes. It uncoiled completely and its full length lay wetly on our cars. The smell coming from its body was thick and putrescent with a revolting, cloying sweetness. I struggled not to retch, not wanting it to hear me.

The pores stopped oozing. An unsettling, peristaltic ripple passed through the things body. Ugly flatulent sounds leaked from each pore, and I saw something moving inside them. With an explosive jolt that caused me to jump in shock, bright red tendrils burst out of its pores. Each one was about as thick as a pencil and every pore contained at least 20 of them. They grew and grew in length, some laying flaccidly on the cars and some erecting themselves and flopping around like severed electrical cables.

I screamed when a couple of the tendrils brushed against me as they grew. But seconds later, every one of them pushed downward and dragged the main body onto the surface of the road. An 18-wheeler was driving toward us. It screeched to a halt and I watched an overweight trucker stumble out of the cab and run toward us. First he looked over and saw the dead man was far beyond help. Then he saw me and my look of pain and terror. He opened his mouth, presumably to say hed call 911, but the tendrils leapt into his mouth and throat before he could get a word out. 

The trucker grasped the thick cord of tendrils invading him and tried to pull. More shot out from the thing in the road and wrapped themselves around his fat form. Over the course of a minute, the main body had been pulled over to the trucker. Gradually, the tendrils retracted from the mans mouth while the body forced itself into his throat. The putrid seminal fluid again began to leak from the creature as it pushed deeper and deeper. A little while later, it was inside. The man was soaked from head to toe with the vile substance. But he no longer looked afraid. He just looked calm. He turned around and walked back to his truck, leaving a trail of milky-yellow slime. I heard the engine start and the truck drove away.

Another car noticed us soon after. The paramedics were called and I was brought to the hospital. I never told anyone what happened. I assume everyone was confused about what the slime was, but I didnt hear them talk about it. All they were concerned about was the wound in my leg, which required two years to recover. I never saw the parasite, or any hint of it, again. It was another five years before Id conquered my fear of driving. Ive done my best to forget about what I saw. No matter how hard I try, though, I still shudder when a truck passes me and I see the driver through his open window. I know that thing is still in one of them. At least one.

	<TEXT> Shanice and I are lucky enough to live in an area replete with wildlife. Every morning, when were sitting at the porch table having coffee or simply looking out our kitchen window, deer, foxes, squirrels, groundhogs, chipmunks, or other local fauna appear in our large backyard. Having property near a national park has its perks.

While Shanice is enamored with all things furry and adorable, or totes adorbs, which she squeals just to watch me cringe, Ive grown to love birds. Dont get me wrong - Im also quite fond of the totes adorbs variety of animals. Our cat, Meowsers, totes exemplifies adorbs. Still, something about birds relaxes me in a way I find difficult to describe. We have such a magnificent diversity of the flying creatures that even after five years of living here, I think I see a new kind every week.

Ive set up quite a few feeding stations throughout our backyard. My personal favorite is a spot right outside the kitchen windows where hummingbirds congregate. It amazes me how their tiny bodies can contain so much energy to flap their delicate wings as quickly as they do and flit away in the blink of an eye. But its not just the hummingbirds. In our yard, sparrows and jays tweet, ravens and jackdaws caw, and the occasional owl endlessly asks the same question. 

Whenever the weather allows it, Ill wander our property and the adjacent park with my head tilted toward the trees to see which of my friends are out and about. Sometimes I came across a hiker or fellow birdwatcher and wed get to talking about our hobbies and interests before Id retreat back to my own head and continue walking and observing. I wont tell Shanice, but sometimes I wish I was a Disney princess who could tame birds and go on adventures with them. A 34 year old, bearded Disney princess with a 3-plate squat and a 4-plate deadlift. Dont judge me.

One evening, as we sat in the living room and watched TV, we heard the jingle of the bell on Meowsers collar as she came in through the cat door. She wandered into the living room and looked at Shanice and me, deciding whose lap shed grace with her presence. A moment later, I was the chosen one. Meowsers leapt onto my lap and immediately began extending and retracting her claws in an autonomic display of pleasurable biscuit-making.

At a commercial, Shanice got up and went into the kitchen to refill her wine glass. I heard her yell God damn it, Meowsers! I looked down at the cat and asked her if she peed on the floor again. Meowsers purred adoringly. Shanice came back into the room holding something in a paper towel. She brought it closer and I could see it was a baby bird. Maybe a robin. Its belly had been torn open and its guts dangled from the wound. Ugly, yellowish-red liquid bloomed outward from the viscera clinging to the towel. I gagged.

The next day, I went and looked around the outside of the house for nests that might be reachable by Meowsers. I hated to disturb them, but I figured the birds would prefer inconvenience over the gleeful murder of their babies by my cat. They werent too hard to find, but my quick inspection of the first few determined they were empty and abandoned. 

After another few minutes, I found one with tiny babies inside. I wondered where their mom was. All three of them chirped pathetically as I took great care in lifting the nest and bringing it up the steps to the porch. Id set up a ladder which led up to the roof. I knew Meowsers couldnt get up there, and I hoped the shadow of the chimney would be a safe spot with relative shelter from the elements. 

While I carried the nest, I noticed a few details Id missed at my first glance. When I realized what they were, my blood ran cold. The nest was woven together with what had to be human hair. All different colors, too. I placed it down on the edge of the porch and took a closer look. It was definitely hair. I moved it around a little bit with my fingers as the birds high-pitched screams of terror and hunger drowned out the singsong calls of the ubiquitous adults. Buried within the body of the nest were tattered scraps of leathery material and hard, gray fragments. I gingerly pulled one out with my thumb and forefinger. As soon as I felt it, I knew what it was. A human tooth.

Something was terribly, terribly wrong. I ran back to the other, abandoned nests that Id only glanced at before. Closer inspection yielded similar construction. When I turned one of them over, I saw a childs pink necklace was embedded within the tangle of hair. I felt panic rise in my chest. After Id calmed my breathing enough to yell, I screamed for Shanice to come outside. She had to see what I was seeing to make sure I wasnt going crazy.

Shanice was visibly shaken by my find. The whole thing got even worse when she pointed out that the leathery material was skin. Without even discussing it with one another, we both knew what we needed to do. 

After stopping at the garage to get some tools and a couple sheets of plywood, we threw it all in the pickup, grabbed the ladder from the porch, and drove over to the edge of our property about a quarter mile from the house. When we got to the shed, sure enough, there was a big hole in the roof. Shanice had been bugging me for almost two years to make sure the shed was sturdy and strong, but Id always put it off because the smell got to me.

Shanice teased me and made me do the majority of the work myself, always laughing when I had to stop and retch. After I hammered in the last nail, I went inside to make sure there were no birds trapped in there. I stepped over the putrefying bodies of hikers and birdwatchers and, sure enough, a tiny nest was hidden in the corner. A couple baby birds lay sleeping inside. How they managed to sleep through the hammering and bickering was beyond me. I smiled and picked up their little home and brought it out into the light. I handed it to Shanice, who grinned at the sight of the babies, and I closed the shed door and replaced the padlock.

While we headed back toward the house, Shanice carefully stroked the head of one of the sleeping babies with her index finger. You know, she said, I guess baby birds can be pretty adorbs too. I beamed. Maybe she was finally coming around.

	<TITLE> Dial Tone </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Theres a land line phone in the cabin where Im staying to finish my novel. Cell service is practically nonexistent and God knows we wont be seeing any major broadband providers stringing lines around here for another 50 years. I can get online using a 56k modem and connect to a shitty long-distance ISP, but Ill be damned if Im getting more than 14.4 speed whenever its windy out. Its always windy out.

My plans for the days were pretty simple. Id get up around 7, have breakfast, and start writing by 8. Id make lunch around 1, call my wife at work during her own lunch break, then go back to writing until 6 or 7. Then dinner and bed.

On Saturday, when I picked up the phone to call Tasha during her lunch, the dial tone sounded off. It was pitched differently. You know how all the land line phones in the US have the same tone and you get used to hearing it every time? Well, it wasnt that tone. It was pitched higher. It was as if the normal tone is an A note on a piano and the strange one Saturday was A#. The difference wasnt big, but it was definitely noticeable. At first, I was fairly certain it meant there was a problem with the line. But when I called Tasha, the call went through without any problem at all. The sound quality was no different, either.

I forgot about the dial tone until last night when I went to call Tasha before bed. Again, the pitch was off. It wasnt merely the difference between A and A#, though. It modulated slowly, as if sliding up and back from A to A#. The tone wasnt as pure, either. There was static in the background. The wind outside had picked up, so I assumed it was affecting the ancient copper lines that crisscrossed the woodland county. The static waxed and waned with the modulating tone. I pressed my ear to the receiver, suddenly intrigued. There were voices in the static. I couldnt make out what they were saying over the interference and the tone, but they were unmistakably voices. There must have been some wire crosstalk over at the switching facility.

I dialed Tasha and we talked for a little while. While we spoke, the wind outside intensified. Earlier, when Id gone into town to get some groceries, the locals told me we were in for some snow. I assumed it was starting. Tasha and I were saying our goodnights when the power cut out. The room was utterly pitch black.

We finished up and I fumbled in the dark to hang the phone up. With a sinking feeling, I remembered Id forgotten to get new batteries for the two flashlights I kept in the kitchen. I carefully walked over to the desk and opened my laptop. Weak, pale light filled the room and cast bizarre shadows against the walls. Despite being 42 years old, I felt scared. I wanted to make a fire in the fireplace, but Id neglected to bring any wood inside. Its rare that I make a fire; Im always paranoid about accidentally burning the place down. Still, it was a risk I was willing to take in the face of the impending stygian blackness of the cabin once my laptop died.

I bundled up and went outside. It was somewhat brighter out there than in the cabin, and I could see snow was beginning to fall. There wasnt much, but with all the wind it still looked and felt like a blizzard. I grabbed an arm full of wood from under the awning on the side of the cabin and headed back inside. As soon as I opened the door, I heard it.

The phone had fallen from its cradle and the receiver was emitting extremely loud, dissonant tones. This time, the sounds were entirely unlike anything Id heard from a telephone. The tones swept through octaves like a damaged siren, frequently punctuated by bursts of static and, beneath it all, the unmistakable timbre of human voices. The hair on the back of my neck stood erect and my skins topography was reconstructed by gooseflesh. Buried inside the wailing of the dial tone and the blasts of white noise, I could make out individual words:

*DECLENSION. NEW. LUNATION. NEURULATION. GOD.*

The light from my laptop faded into nothingness. I gasped and dropped the wood Id been carrying. I rushed forward to hang up the phone, but I stumbled and fell, landing heavily on the floor with my head inches from the screaming receiver. The wailing and static stopped. Wind buffeted the wooden exterior of the cabin. Terrified and not knowing what to do, I reached for the receiver to hang it up. When my hand touched the plastic, an enormous crash rattled all sides of the cabin at once, knocking dishes from the cabinets and causing them to shatter on the kitchen floor. I screamed.

The phone began making noise again. It started with a normal dial tone, but quickly warbled and warped into a shrill cacophony of sirens, static, and voices. Somehow, I was impelled to put the shrieking receiver to my ear. I fought the impulse with all my strength, even pushing my left arm against my right to stop it from moving. It was futile. The receiver touched my ear and the sounds were replaced by a single, hideously loud voice:

*YOUR HOURS. YOU ARE HOURS. YOU ARE OURS. YOU ARE OURS.*

A needle of indescribably cold pain pushed through my ear. I felt its frigid length puncture the eardrum with a horrible snip sound, changing the the blaring voice to a distorted buzz. Still, I felt the pressure of the intense volume against the destroyed membrane as the pain traveled deeper and deeper into my head. Everything went white.

I woke up on the floor this morning with a splitting headache and pool of dried blood in my right ear. The events of the previous night flooded back and I scrambling to my feet in terror. The wreckage of the kitchen was strewn across the floor. Framed pictures of Tasha and me had fallen off the walls and shattered on the hardwood. Desperate for fresh air, I hurled myself toward the door and opened it. Surrounding the cabin, contrasting against the sunny snowscape, were thousands of dead birds. Each one had its head smashed with such force that its eyes had burst and its beak was splintered into unrecognizable fragments. Vertiginous nausea caused me to sway and nearly fall into the carcasses. I stumbled backward into the house and slammed the door.

I looked over at the phone. It was neatly placed on its cradle and looking as innocuous as any telephone in any house. I couldnt bring myself to pick it up and dial 911. Not after what happened. I pored through the fallen debris and found my keys. The legs of a drunkard carried me through the bird corpses to my truck. I pulled away from the cabin and somehow made it to the hospital without crashing.

Right now, Im writing this with a borrowed laptop from a bed in the hospital. My right eardrum is ruined. They told me Id experience vertigo for quite a while, but I was given medication to make the sensation less nauseating. The injury to my ear was not enough to keep me hospitalized. In fact, it was hardly enough for the ER staff to take seriously and they seemed irritated by my presence. That changed when they asked me how it happened. I explained it to them as best I could, but all I could see in their faces was bewilderment. Over and over they asked me to repeat myself, but after a while, I started to get frustrated.

One of them handed me a pen and paper and I simply wrote, What is so hard for you to understand? A young nurse asked me to tell them again what happened. She held her phone out in front of her and I saw she was recording a video. Again, I explained. They listened intently as I spoke, then the nurse stopped the recording. I shrugged my shoulders, wondering if recording me somehow got my story through their thick skulls. The nurse turned the phone toward me and I pressed play. I watched for a few seconds and started sobbing. On screen, when I opened my mouth to speak, all that came out was the shrill siren of the warped dial tone.

	<TITLE> Fairfield County, part 1: Lake Mohegan and the Cascades </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If youre coming from Bridgeport via I-95, take exit 24, turn right, then hang a left to go up Black Rock Turnpike until you see Burroughs Road. Take that right. Follow it down, past the house with the weird, light-up numbers, past the soccer field, and youll reach Fairfield Woods Road. Go right again, then take your first left at the stop sign onto Morehouse Highway. Follow Morehouse until the end.

The time I went this way with my boyfriend, Aaron, who was new to the area, he thought the only option at the bottom of Morehouse was to take a left. The route straight was obstructed by a locked metal gate covered with reflective orange tape. But I had a key.

Behind the gate lies a small, poorly-maintained road which leads around and down to a wooded area on the rear end of Lake Mohegan. Its a manmade lake that was once a gravel quarry back in the 50s. The town of Fairfield bought the then-defunct quarry in 1961 and routed the Mill River to fill it up, ultimately making a pleasant beach area for the locals. Once the quarry was full of water and the sand was brought in, the townsfolk came in droves. Both sides of the lake would attract bathers and sunseekers of all types. The main part of the lake always had three lifeguards on duty, but at the rear end of the lake, where its fed by the river, theres a deceptively strong current and no lifeguard stations.

After an unfortunate series of drownings in the 1970s, nearly all of whom were children neither strong enough to swim away from the current nor smart enough to avoid fighting it, the town decided no one should swim on that side of the lake. Most people listened, some didnt, and some of them also drowned. The area remained popular, though; especially the spot the locals call the Cascades. 

The Cascades consist of a series of minor waterfalls and rapids gushing through a narrow, rocky section about a mile up from where the river pours into the lake. The Cascades are surrounded by many square miles of woods gifted to the town by the General Electric company, whose corporate headquarters butts up against the far edge. On a bright, warm day, locals would enjoy walking through the woods along the well-marked paths. Some brave, albeit foolish, ones would dive from the highest ledge of the riverbank into the rushing water. Aside from the times when the water level was low, it was just deep enough to for divers to avoid serious injury.

When I was younger, the gate leading to the Cascades wasnt always locked. In fact, it was wide open from sunrise to sunset. Visitors were welcome to go inside, tour the woods, and walk along the river. After what happened that summer in 1987, though, town officials wanted to keep visitors to a minimum. It remained closed all throughout my childhood and adolescence, but my high school friends and I used to sneak in and explore.

At the insistence of my parents, when I turned 17, I got a job with the towns parks and recreation department doing basic maintenance and garbage collection. The pay was terrible, but I got to drive a big truck around and I had tons of time to myself. Id go from park to park, pulling gum from water fountains and tampons from swingsets and garbage from bins, then drive it over to the town dump at the end of the day. The dump had a big gate that was usually open, but after hours, it was closed to anyone who didnt have a key. Every maintenance worker employed by the town had one. And it was the same one that opened all the municipal gates in Fairfield, including the one behind Lake Mohegan.

Aaron and I pulled up to the gate. I got out, unlocked it, hopped back in the car, and we progressed down the crumbling roadway to a dilapidated parking area. We stepped out onto the cracked asphalt and hopped over the knee-high fence theyd erected to keep mountain bikers from terrorizing pedestrians on the trails. As we strolled through the woods toward the Cascades, we chatted and caught up. Itd been almost two months since wed seen one another.

I met Aaron online in an AOL chatroom earlier in the year. It was a local chat for gay men in Connecticut, and we hit it off pretty much immediately. He was a year older than me and a student at UCONN. Most Friday evenings, Id make the 90 minute drive up there, wed have a great time, then Sunday nights Id drive home and go to school the next morning, exhausted. My parents never had any issues with our relationship, aside from the initial concern that he might be some weird predator. They met him the first time he came to visit and discovered pretty quickly he was a good guy. Obviously, they made him sleep in the guest bedroom, but they had no problem with anything else. 

While we walked, Aaron marvelled at the beauty of the woods and the rushing waters of the river. I told him he should see it when the water level isnt so low - its almost scary how fast and deep the rapids near the Cascades can be after a storm. He asked me why the area was closed off to the public, so I told him the story.

In the summer of 1987, the area was dealing with a pretty bad drought. On top of that, it was an inordinately hot summer, so Lake Mohegan was packed solid with townsfolk looking to beat the heat. All those combined factors led to a series of problems. First, the lake, which had lost a decent amount of water to the drought, was warm as bathwater and a perfect breeding ground for all sorts of nasty things. Leeches were first, but only in one area to the far left of the lifeguard chairs. Then there was an algae bloom on the back side of the lake, which, despite every warning, didnt scare bathers away. A few got sick and one, who we later learned was an early and unaware carrier of the AIDS virus, died from a specific type of infection they assumed he picked up at the lake.

When the conditions at Lake Mohegan deteriorated to the point where most people didnt go in the water anymore, the river and the Cascades became the new hot spot. Since the river was always flowing, there was no algae or threat of infections from stagnant water. However, the water level was dramatically lower than usual. Divers usually cannonballed or belly-flopped from the rock walls and safely splashed into the river, but every so often, someone would jump straight down and get hurt. Most of the injuries were limited to badly lacerated feet and toes, but every couple days thered be at least one broken ankle. There were calls for the town to close off the area until the water level was higher, but all they did was put up a few signs that said Dive At Your Own Risk with a silly illustration of someone diving and cracking their head open.

As the summer wore on and the drought got worse, so did the injuries. It culminated in a tragedy that made national news. A hideously stupid father and mother, while being videotaped by a relative, laughed and waved to the camera before diving headfirst off the ledge as they held the hands of their their adult autistic son. All three smashed their faces into the rocks below and broke their necks. All three died. The subsequent investigation showed the water, which was normally just under 8 feet deep at that spot, was barely 5 and a half.

That incident prompted the indefinite closing of the Cascades. The town didnt put out guards or arrest anyone who ventured in, but the installation of the gate prevented cars from entering and that eliminated the vast majority of visitors. Those seeking relief from the heat ended up going across town to Jennings and Penfield beach, and that, for the most part, was that.

Aaron had tears in his eyes when I mentioned the part about the autistic son. His uncle suffered from autism and Aaron frequently spoke about the mans fragility. I changed the subject as our walk brought us to the Cascades hed been hearing about for the last 30 minutes. I could tell he was underwhelmed. Even though it was almost 80 degrees on that early April afternoon, the trees were still barren and unappealing to look at. The water level was pitiful. Thered been no snow during the winter and hardly any rain, either, so the river, which usually raged at this time of year as the snow melted, trickled pitifully. We peered over the edge of the cliff where the parents and their son had died. It looked no deeper than the 5 and a half feet it was on that day. 

I sighed and told Aaron I was sorry for building the whole thing up. His face brightened and told me it was no problem. He was happy to be spending time with me. I winked and told him Id make it up to him anyway. I looked around. There was no one anywhere nearby. I kissed him and pulled him close to me. He was eager to return the affection, and after about 45 seconds we were naked and I was on my knees in front of him. When it was his turn to return the favor, I sat on the cool rocks on the side of the cliff and dangled my legs over the edge. He grinned and knelt beside me, moving his head downward with enthusiastic purpose. 

I let him perform for a minute or two, enjoying the sensation. Once I felt his mouth release me, I picked up the rock Id sat next to and drove it into his head. Aarons face dropped heavily into my lap as blood oozed from the chipped wreckage at the top of his skull. I dropped the rock into the water and pushed him off the cliff. He plunged face first into the shallow water, his body stopping abruptly as his head struck the bottom. He tipped sideways and floated, facedown, before getting stuck in a tangle of branches on the riverbank. 

Walking down to the riverbank, I flipped Aaron onto his back and pulled him ashore. He was undoubtedly dead. The exhilaration I felt was beyond anything Id experienced before or since. I couldnt wait to tell the others. Wed been talking for a while about how wed each do something like this, but I was the first to go through with it. Anna, Dmitri, and Lisa all eventually got their chances, and Ill be happy to tell their stories soon, but let me wrap this up. 

I washed the small bit of Aarons blood off my hand and thigh. Then I got dressed, took the keys from his pocket, and headed toward the lot. I drove over to the nearby church on Morehouse Highway and banged on the office door. An elderly clergyman opened it and I told him, with sobbing panic in my voice, that my friend had gotten hurt in a diving accident.

The police questioned me for a few hours, but I was released to my parents later that night. Aarons death was ultimately ruled an accident. I played the grieving boyfriend for nearly six months before I felt it was safe to show Id moved on. 

I cant believe its been almost 20 years since that April afternoon. My husband has no idea. My kids have no idea. Nor will they. I had the opportunity of a lifetime and I was determined to seize it. One of the most amazing feelings in the world is to know youve gotten to satisfy a curiosity held by so many people either incapable or too afraid to take action. My husband, Francisco, often says how proud he is of me. I know hes talking about my career advancement and how well I help raise our kids, but as he strokes my hair while were snuggled in bed and he tells me about the pride and love he feels, I tell myself its because Im willing to take that extra step toward success. Toward the fulfilment of my dreams. And, above all, toward self-actualization.

	<TEXT> I spent three years as an IT contractor at the US military base, Camp Lemonnier, in Djibouti. Our firm had been hired to perform a massive upgrade to all the information systems on the base. It was only supposed to take a year and a half. As these things usually go, it went enormously over budget and took twice as long as wed estimated. I didnt mind. One of my dreams growing up was to travel to Africa, so when I was presented with the opportunity, I jumped at it. Since I dont have much family and wasnt in a relationship at the time, I had no strings attached when I boarded that plane with my colleagues.

The base offered free basic housing and other facilities to their visiting contractors, which some of us took, but I wanted to live in town and embrace the culture. Djibouti City was nearby, extremely inexpensive, and replete with all the cultural experiences I ever wanted. I met wonderful people, learned a little French and Arabic, and discovered their local cuisine is not only some of the best on Earth, but far less fattening than American food. I mustve lost 25 pounds while still eating like a king. As our IT project dragged on, I almost wished it would take forever. I just didnt want to leave.

But, of course, all good things must come to an end. In April of 2005, with our task complete, we were on a plane back to Burlington via a New York layover. The team was given a month off to reconnect with everything back home. Those of us who didnt have homes or families to come back to were put up in hotels until we could find places of our own. The hotel room was so much bigger and nicer than the tiny apartment in Djibouti to which Id grown accustomed. It felt downright decadent to get to sprawl out and get comfortable. And as much as I loved the Djiboutian food, knowing a bacon cheeseburger could be room-serviced up to me 24 hours a day was a damn good feeling. I took advantage of it many, many times.

After being home for three days, though, a rather unpleasant situation arose. Im not going to get graphic because we all have our own intimate knowledge of such a thing, but Ill just say I was terribly constipated. Three days stretched into four, then five. I was extraordinarily uncomfortable at that point. Most of the advice online said to wait it out and make sure I was staying hydrated. I drank bottle after bottle of water, but, to my chagrin, my desired result continued its elusion. 

Day number six was a repeat performance of the previous five. On the seventh day, I didnt rest. I hauled my bloated self over to the pharmacy and bought some laxatives. Just the thought of the things grossed me out, but the promise of their efficacy did great work to quell my emotional misgivings. I went back to the hotel, read the directions, swallowed the suggested dose, and waited.

The medication acted quickly. Again, in an effort to avoid the all-too-familiar details, Ill simply say the pressure and discomfort ended abruptly. The only pain, as Id expected, was located on the, well, exit. Unfortunately, here is where I must start a period of elaboration. I assure you, it is not scatological. It is, however, profoundly disturbing.

As I went to clean myself, I noticed an obstruction in the area. It was not what I, or likely you, are thinking. No, as I learned rather quickly, it was far, far worse. I peered down between my legs and saw the most horrifying sight in my 42 years of life. Dangling into the the bowl was a thick rope of tangled, grayish-white worms. I screamed with such terrific ferocity that I immediately damaged my vocal cords, causing the outburst to sound as if it were produced by a dilapidated chainsaw. I flexed the muscle through which the creatures were hanging, hoping to dislodge them. Nothing.

Needless to say, I was panicking. I had no idea what to do, but I knew I had to get the things out of me. All my life, Id been terrified of bugs and insects of all sorts. Having these monsters infesting me was beyond any level of abject horror I couldve imagined. The next move I made, I would later learn, is not a recommended method of removal.

I reached behind me and grasped the writhing column in my fist. I involuntarily retched as I felt the thickness of the parasitic invaders against my palm. All bunched together, they were the diameter of toilet paper tube. I squeezed the atrocious things and pulled as hard as I could. For a moment, my only respite from the terror was the impossibly acute agony produced by my pulling action. A tearing sensation of pain exploded right below my sternum - practically in my chest. With dawning realization that the creatures were far deeper in my body than I could deal with myself, my panic mixed with deep helplessness.

Remember, this was 2005. Personal cell phones were not nearly as ubiquitous as they are today. While I had one in Africa, Id turned it in upon my arrival home. It wouldnt have worked on our network, anyway, and my company had yet to give our group new Blackberry devices. What that meant was I had to get up and walk to the bedside telephone. I distinctly remember the wet slapping of the repulsive rope on my bare thighs as I waddled across the room. I dialed the front desk, not 911 for some idiotic reason I cant remember, and simply said, medical emergency in room 1142. I stood there, naked from the waist down, with a tail of twitching parasites hanging out of me.

The hotel staff whod been trained in CPR and other basic emergency services arrived first. Without knocking, the used their own key to barge in. Each of the three looked puzzled, and, within a span of ten seconds, realized why theyd been called. One by one, they turned varying shades of white. The largest of the group, a man with a name tag labelling him as Jeremy, sat down on the bed and promptly fainted backward. The other two, Maria and Tyshawn, did their best to maintain composure. They asked me if I was having trouble breathing or experiencing chest pains or blurred vision. As the procedural questions dragged on, the real EMTs arrived.

Hardened as EMTs are, one of the two men who arrived audibly whispered Jesus fucking Christ when he saw why theyd been summoned. Wrapping a towel around my waist, something I hadnt even thought of in my panic, they helped me onto a stretcher and we went down the elevator and into the waiting ambulance. At the hospital, the ER doctor in charge of me just said, well thats a pretty bad case, huh? I nodded, stupidly.

A few doses of specialized medication and two days later, I expelled the invading creatures. I was told I probably got them from eating contaminated food in Africa. Also, apparently I was lucky that I didnt have to have surgery. Sometimes when theyre as deep as mine were, surgerys the only option.

So, its almost 11 years later. I had a few scans in the months that followed my hospital stay to make sure I didnt have anything new growing inside me, but each time I was clean as a whistle. Still, as you might imagine, Im haunted by the experience. Worst was the feeling of how thick and heavy the tangle of worms felt in my hand. That, and how impossibly long the things were. I swear, I was convinced theyd made their way into my chest and were coiling around my heart, ready to squeeze the life from me. But all is well, I keep telling myself. Nothing is out of the ordinary. 

Its interesting, too, because the worms themselves dont scare me anymore. Im traumatized by the experience and the stress resulting from it, of course, but as the years went by, I could easily study the things online and in textbooks without shrinking away. In fact, Im almost drawn to them. Today, Id venture to guess I know more about that genus and species than even some experts in that field. Its strange how our experiences can shape our interests, isnt it? 

A couple years ago, I quit my job in technology. Using the money Id been saving, I started a food truck. The customer base started off small, but it grew pretty quickly thanks to word of mouth and social media. My customers love the cuisine and regulars line up every day to enjoy the outstanding Djiboutian food made by the quirky white American. As the business flourished and customers came in droves, all the diners were happy to report to me how they finally found a diet food that works. Even though hearing that warms my heart, I still experience a pang of jealousy that makes me feel a little empty inside.

	<TEXT> Maybe one of you can offer me some advice? I dont have insurance and I cant afford a trip to the ER. It doesnt seem life threatening, though, so I might wait it out. Ive always been a bit of a hypochondriac and I bet Im just overreacting. Still, if anyone is interested in coming over and checking me out, just send me a message. Id really appreciate it.

I was walking through the wooded area behind my home and I found this weird black stuff oozing out of a rock. It was shiny and made me think of jellied obsidian. Id never seen anything quite like it before. Since I moved out of the city ten years ago, I frequently walked around the many acres of woods near the house and never saw anything weirder than a squirrel eating a dead hawk. So this was new to me.

I took a branch and poked at the stuff. It resisted a little before it broke open, causing a more liquidy version to flow out from inside. I grabbed a smaller stick and scooped up a tiny bit of the stuff and walked back to the house. Part of me was worried that it fell from a plane or something and might be a toxic threat to the environment.

When I got home, I scraped the goo onto a dish I never used and threw the stick in the garbage. I shone some light on the plate, and I swear, the stuff moved a little. Its not like it jumped up and made scary tentacles or anything like that; no, it just kind of spread out in a weird way. Almost like how jellyfish try to hide in the sand when they feel threatened. After I killed the light, it gradually reassumed its original shape. My guess was that the heat from the lamp made it melt.

I decided to wait until tomorrow morning and bring it to the local university just to be on the safe side. I dont know what it was about the stuff, but I was really, really uneasy around it. When I left for an hour or two and went to the store to get groceries, I returned to find the plate empty and a streak of black grease going off the plate, across the counter, and onto the floor. There wasnt a trail indicating where it went after that.

Honestly, I was a little freaked out. I bent down and looked all over the place and never found the stuff. But it found me.

At first, I thought the sensation on my bare ankle was just a mosquito, so I slapped at it without thinking. Obviously, looking back, that was the wrong idea. The black stuff spread out all over my palm, then the rest of my hand, then my arm, side, chest, back, and the rest of me. Long story short, Im completely covered in the black substance. But heres the thing, and its why Im not particularly worried: it feels amazing.

I know, I know, it sounds weird. But in all honesty, Ive never felt anything like it. In fact, I was so taken by the sensation that I went back outside, over to the rock where the stuff was, and pulled as much of it off as I could and brought it into the house. Now, like I said in the beginning, I do think Im having some sort of medical issue. Its definitely not something Ive ever experienced before or even heard of, so I think its important to get checked out. But still, I cant get over how great the experience is. The stuff smells wonderful, too. And right now, as it spreads over my tongue, it tastes better than anything Ive ever put in my mouth. Please, anyone who might be interested in investigating either for their own curiosity or as a medical precaution, just leave a message right here and Ill give you directions to my home. Id be so happy if someone came over.

Please. Come visit me. Come visit us.

	<TEXT> When Danielle was growing up, Ron and I knew she was plagued by depression. It was the same demon both my husband and I had to face daily, so we had no trouble recognizing the signs. As her condition worsened, she wouldnt bother hiding the cuts on her arms. Once she graduated high school, we couldnt force her to see a psychologist or get any type of positive intervention. She just sat in her room with the door closed and ate no more than five meals a week. If she ever went out, it was long after her father and I had gone to bed.

Shed been picked up by the police a number of times for trespassing in graveyards or standing on the rooftops of local businesses. She never stood close enough to the edge to make the police think it was a suicide attempt, though, so she wasnt held for psychological observation. They chalked it up to her being a rebellious kid and sent her home.

Danielles behavior took a significant toll on the relationship between Ron and me. Like I said, we both knew depression. We also dealt with its manifestations in different ways. I was a yeller and a crier, Ron was taciturn and brooding. But I knew his silence could be broken by occasional fits of rage.

One night, Danielle was brought home by the police for the third time in as many months. After the officer left, I began screaming at Danielle for being so reckless. She stared at me, muttering obscenities under her breath like she usually did in those situations. Ron, whod been observing and glowering as I shouted, strode across the room and slapped Danielle across her face. Hard. She fell sideways, her head denting the sheetrock of the wall beside her. She lept to her feet but he hit her again. That time, she stayed down. As I rushed over to see if she was okay, Ron stormed out of the house.

Aside from a nasty handprint on the side of her face, Danielle was fine. Once shed gotten over the shock of being struck, she bolted out of the kitchen, up the stairs, and slammed the door of her bedroom. Neither of us saw her for a couple days after that, but we heard her walking around. She didnt leave at night, either; Ron stayed up to make sure of that. As much as I hated him for striking her, I hated myself even more for hoping hed actually knocked some sense into her.

A year passed. I drifted away from Ron and he drifted away from me. We were strangers in the cavernous wreckage of the home wed built together. I wouldnt sleep in the same room as him, so he slept in the basement. I moved all my paints and canvases upstairs so Id never have to see his face. That July, Danielle tried to kill herself. Had she not puked up the pills and wine before the paramedics arrived, she wouldve been dead. She was hospitalized until September. When she was released, she was no different. No better. And she returned to a home where resentfulness had undergone unchecked growth since she left.

On her 19th birthday, Danielle disappeared. We figured it was another one of her rooftop or graveyard romps, but she didnt come back. After four days, we called the police. Two days later, they found her car on the side of a wooded road 20 miles away. Three days after that, they told us theyd found an empty bottle of pills and backpack in the woods, torn to shreds and covered with blood. We identified the pack as the one we got for Danielle a couple years earlier. 12 days after finding the backpack, the police called off the search. We were told if shed attempted suicide and gotten dragged off by wolves or a bear, her remains might never be found. And they werent. We buried an empty coffin a week later.

Months went by. Ron lost his job not long after the funeral because he just wouldnt show up to work anymore. I still had mine, and my salary was more than enough for the both of us. Still, I despised myself for continuing to support the man. I spent more and more time in the office, desperately trying to avoid going home. The few coworkers who knew about everything that was going on tried to get me to leave him. I always refused. He was the man I married. Things had to get better someday.

I came home from work on a Friday evening in early October. As always, I made my way to the kitchen to start dinner for myself and Ron. He knew to come get his food after he heard me going up the stairs to eat in my bedroom, so I was surprised to hear his footsteps as I diced onions, carrots, and celery for the stew. I bristled with anger and wouldnt turn around. I didnt want to see him before I ate.

Danielle and I have a surprise for you, he announced. Just hearing the name of my daughter made me wince. I turned around with a grimace etched into my face, ready to scream at him for invoking her memory. The grimace turned into a look of desperate, uncomprehending horror.

Standing next to Ron was Danielle - bound by the wrists and gagged. Her spindly arms and gaunt face had horrible, scarred ligature marks from the constant friction of the rope holding the bindings in place. Her hair had grown down to her naked, bloody thighs. In my delirious state of shock, Id failed to notice the little bundle in my husbands arms. He unwrapped a small towel from around it and presented it to me. My knees weakened and the room around me desaturated and blurred. I reached out and instinctively clutched the infant to my chest as it began to scream.

I was hoping we could start over, Ron whispered, tears filling his eyes. He pulled Danielle and me and the baby into an embrace. 

Can we start over? Please?

	<TEXT> Where did they say theyre going again?, asked Laura.

I sighed. Dad said he was going to put gas in the car and mom needed to use the bathroom. The one heres broken.

I studied Lauras face, knowing she was close to tears. She never wanted to be too far from our parents. Even though we could see them across the street at the gas station, Laura was worried theyd abandon her and shed be stuck with her big sister forever.

Look, I told her, pointing out the enormous, floor-to-ceiling window. Theres dad next to the gas pump. And theres mom running toward the bathroom. I guess she really had to pee. That got a giggle out of Laura, but I could tell the waterworks were imminent.

What if they leave us here?, she whispered, the latter half of the inquiry nearly inaudible under her burgeoning whimpers.

Laura, its okay. I did my best to sound confident and authoritative; Laura needed to believe with certainty theyd be returning momentarily. Otherwise, Id be left with a blubbering wreck as we waited for our food in the middle of a crowded diner. Shes four, I reminded myself. You were scared of everything when you were four.

My sister took a loud, deep breath and exhaled slowly. Its a technique I taught her for when she felt sad or scared. A tear dripped out of her right eye and slid down her cheek. She wiped it away, but no others came. She stared intently out the large window at our parents, who were getting back in the car.

Our food arrived. All four of us had ordered some variety of grilled cheese. Lauras was on white bread with American cheese, and she picked it up and started shoveling the thing into her mouth. I didnt bother to tell her to wait for mom and dad before eating. I was hungry too. I picked up my cheddar on rye and took a bite.

Down the street, a gasoline tanker was making its way in our direction. It appeared to be going much faster than any of the cars Id seen on that road as we sat there. Mounting dread formed knots in my viscera.

I dont know what caused me to push my head back against the soft leather of the booth and press my face into its corner, but when the truck careened into the gas station across the street and exploded, shattering the thick glass of the diner windows, I was shielded from the majority of shrapnel and the blast of heat. Laura wasnt.

By the time Id collected myself enough to react, I saw the left side of my sisters head was blistered and encrusted with glass. She stared at me, motionless, in obvious shock. Then her hand rose to touch the side of her face. The touch became a rub. Blood oozed out of her small palm as it was lacerated by the jagged edges. She looked to her right and picked up the grilled cheese that had fallen onto her seat, wiggled it slightly to get the biggest shards of glass off, and began to eat.

The ringing in my ears had drowned out the overture of hysteria playing around us. But, gradually, screams filled my ears. I ignored them. All I could do was look outside at the hellscape of fire and twisted metal. I saw our car. A Subaru station wagon. It was facing in our direction, but upside down and on fire.

I watched a shape crawl out of the drivers side window. Its clothes and hair were gone. All it looked like was a figure drawn in red and black. Still, I was with it enough to know it was our father. He hobbled over to the other side of the car and pulled another figure from the wreck. Mom. She didnt move. Dad collapsed to his knees in front of her, and after a few moments, turned toward the diner. Id noticed Lauras shock had worn off and shed begun howling in fear and pain.

I tried to get her to calm down. It was an exercise in futility; even I was crying and near panic. I held her hands and babbled, its okay, its okay. In the corner of my eye, I saw movement. I jerked my head around to see dad moving toward the diner. He couldnt run, but he was hobbling on what looked like half a left foot. As he got closer, I could see how horrifically injured he was. Laura noticed him coming, too, but didnt recognize him whatsoever. She screamed.

Dad made his way to us as the wail of sirens grew louder. The details of his injuries became clearer with every awkward step. Despite being burned, he was sopping wet. Fluid dripped from hideous burns on his head, chest, and legs. He made it to our table and reached out, grabbing Laura. Laura twisted in his grasp and scratched his arm, gouging deep tracks in the destroyed flesh. He pulled her out and held her tightly.

I clambered onto the table and through the window and stood, stupidly, not knowing what to do or how to help. Dads voice wheezed out of his lipless mouth. Over Lauras screams, it was hard to make out what he was saying. He clutched my sister against his oozing chest and, suddenly, she realized who he was. She abruptly stopped shrieking and merely whimpered.

Dad looked up at me and I got closer. He repeated what he said before, over and over, his voice gradually tapering into gurgling nothingness. Were still a family. Were still a family. Were still a family. Were still a family. I looked across the street at the motionless, charred figure next to the Subaru. Then I looked at dad, still cradling Laura despite having slumped over.

I gently took Laura from our fathers lifeless arms. She sobbed into my chest as I ran forward, across the street. I darted between blackened vehicles and unidentifiable wreckage. Still a family, I thought to myself, and closed my eyes. The emergency workers managed to restrain me before we could reunite with our parents in the fire.

	<TEXT> When I was a kid, the nurse at my elementary school, Mr. Lansing, performed weekly lice checks on all the students. He used to be a doctor before he retired and took the position at the school because he loved children and wanted to make sure they were healthy and happy. I liked Mr. Lansing. He had a soft voice, a shiny bald head, and was very hard of hearing. Hed take a metal comb that hed always warm up in his hands first and carefully move my hair around to see if there was anything crawling on my scalp.

One time, he whispered uh oh and held a tiny bug between his thumb and forefinger for me to see. I started to cry. He told me not to worry and brought me down to the his office. Even though I liked Mr. Lansing, I hated his office. It was right next to the boiler room so it was always hot. The few times I had to go there when I was sick, I sweated a lot and felt super thirsty. To my pleasant surprise, the boilers hadnt been turned on that day because of the warm weather outside. The office was just like any other room.

Mr. Lansing sat me down on the little cot and perched on a stool in front of me. His gray eyes glinted with reflected light and he smiled as he talked with me about head lice and what would happen next. The most important thing, he stressed, was that I shouldnt worry about it. It happens to almost all kids at least once - its why he inspects every student in the school a few times each month. He asked if I was okay, and I nodded and wiped my eyes. He smiled again.

Before calling my parents to pick me up, Mr. Lansing said he needed to use the comb in my hair again. I turned around and he got to work. He told me he was taking out as many of the lice as he could so my parents would only have to deal with the eggs when I got home. He combed and combed, scraping the side of the instrument against the side of an old coffee can to collect the bugs to throw away afterward. 

When he was done, my parents were called and Mr. Lansing explained to them the process of removing the remaining lice and their eggs. Mom looked pale but Dad said it was no problem and hed have me ready to come back to school in a day or two. We went home, stopping first at the drugstore to get some special shampoo.

Dad shampooed my hair over the sink and used a metal comb to pull the remaining lice and eggs out of my hair. It hurt and the comb got stuck a lot. After a few hours, he was finished. While Dad was working on my hair, Mom took all my sheets and blankets and clothes and stuffed animals and either threw them in the washing machine at the highest temperature or sealed them in plastic bags that I wasnt allowed to open for six months. Once all that was accomplished, Mom and Dad checked one another, determined they were clean, and that was that. I was back in school the next day.

A month later, Mr. Lansing discovered 52 new cases of lice. I was one of them. The principal wanted to close the school, but Mr. Lansing talked her out of it. He sought and received permission from the parents to treat their children one-on-one to ensure the lice and eggs were properly removed. The parents would still be responsible for cleaning the house and washing everything, but that was out of the schools control. 

I remember when it was my turn, Mr. Lansing had me sit back in a very comfortable chair and I positioned my head over the sink. He ran warm water through my long hair and lovingly massaged my scalp. I remember thinking how much more practiced and gentle he was than my father had been a month earlier. I smiled. Carefully, Mr. Lansing began to comb the bugs away. I asked if he needed to use that special shampoo. He needed me to repeat myself so he could hear the question, but in response he shook his head and told me if the comb is used properly, the results would be the same without any nasty chemicals.

Mr. Lansing worked and worked, stopping every so often to scrape the side of the comb against the coffee can, and then resumed the process. It took a little over an hour, but then I was all set. My hair felt great and clean and I thanked Mr. Lansing and walked out of his office.

Later that afternoon, as I was getting into my moms car to go home, I realized Id left my sweater on the shelf in Mr. Lansings office. Mom told me to go in and get it. I ran back inside and down to his office. Without thinking to knock, I opened the door. Mr. Lansing was standing with his back to the door, facing the blank wall. He hadnt heard me come in. 

His shirt was off and I was surprised to see how hairy his torso was. He reached into the coffee can by the sink. When he withdrew his fist, I saw it was covered in tiny gray bumps. I dared to take another step into the office to confirm what I already knew. I felt sick to my stomach. Mr. Lansing rubbed his lice-coated hand over his chest and shoulders. From where I stood, I could see tiny little bugs crawling through the hair on his back. I saw him start to turn and I quickly backed out but left the door slightly ajar. I peered through the crack and watched as he continued to rub the bugs into his belly and arms. I involuntarily gagged as he licked his hand clean. 

Mr. Lansing heard me gag and whirled around to see me watching through the narrow opening. I was terrified hed grab me, but all he did was pull the door closed and I heard a lock engage on the other side. I ran back to the car where mom was impatiently waiting. I never told her, nor anyone, what Id seen until now. I thought about it, but was too scared about what might happen to me. Mr. Lansing never returned to school, and Im sure hes long gone, but every time I feel the slightest itch anywhere on my body, Im reminded of him.

	<TEXT> We were in the final stages of testing a custom drug ordered by a large investment bank in China. Its purpose was to help their traders and programmers focus and make quick, rational, and emotionally-detached decisions, without the cardiovascular or dependency risks associated with traditional ADHD medication. The drug was well-tolerated and the test subjects showed marked improvement on the battery of cognitive and job-specific tests the bank had provided. The drug, we estimated, would be ready in a month. Our team was ecstatic; if the drug worked well for the bank, we would seek FDA approval of a slightly-modified version for the general public. Our company would profit enormously.

A few of my colleagues had tried the drug themselves in the latter portions of its testing phase. While such sampling was prohibited, it was impossible to prevent. They, too, had their work quality and general focus improve while under its effect. After listening to Rakesh gush endlessly about how much hed benefitted from the drug, I figured it was time to give it a shot. I was used to ADHD medication. Until about a month ago, Id taken both Adderall and Wellbutrin to aid my own attention issues. I only stopped because the last 15 years of daily usage had made me nearly immune to the focus-enhancing effects. I didnt want to increase the dosage and stress my heart. Since our drug used an entirely different mechanism of action, I was excited to see if Id benefit as much as everyone else.

Around 10:15pm, I swallowed the tiny capsule with a mouthful of water. Id been stuck working late with Rakesh, Priya, and Jian. We were going over data from the test subjects and attempting to glean usable information for our transition to the modified, FDA version of the drug. About 20 minutes after I took the pill, I felt a burst of energy. The statistics wed been working on appeared much less daunting and I felt like I could single-handedly accomplish the entire task. Rakesh noticed and asked if I wanted to work on the harder stuff by myself to see what the drug could do. I nodded enthusiastically and he went to get something to eat. Priya did the same a little while later.

Jian and I stared at our respective computer screens and pored over data. As the moments went by, I began to feel unwell. The sensation wasnt physical; it was unlike the nausea and frenetic energy I would get from taking Adderall. This was vastly different. I felt like I was floating and seeing things from a vantage point overhead. I watched as I was gradually replaced by a dead man who used to be me. He was overcome by an incomprehensibly powerful thirst for blood. Blood, he knew with a certainty greater than anything in existence, was only thing that might help him return to life. I became him, and he became no one. A null consciousness dispassionately observed from above.

The dead thing rose from its chair, walked over to Jian, and bit his neck directly at the carotid artery. Its teeth sank deep, and before Jian could react, an enormous mouthful of flesh was pulled away. For ten minutes, the dead thing sucked and swallowed the gouting blood while its immense strength held Jians shuddering body. Blood slid down the dead things esophageal transitway and splashed into its stomach. It couldnt recognize any sensation of fullness. 

The flood from Jians throat had diminished to a trickle. The dead thing needed more. It tore Jians neck open entirely, plunged its face into the warm chasm, and scraped its teeth over every bit of flesh it could reach. It chewed the meat to release any remaining fluid. The dead thing reached the spinal cord and howled in crushing, unfulfilled frustration. It pushed its fingers between Jians ribs. They sank inside his chest, and the dead thing pulled the bones apart. Again, the dead thing ravenously extracted all it could. The mans legs were next. Then his buttocks, back, and face. Jians remaining blood mixed with the dead things saliva and dropped into its belly.

The dead thing crouched in a greasy puddle of hideous gore next to the flayed skeleton of Jian. It involuntarily vomited what it had consumed. As it lapped up the wasted blood, the door opened and Rakesh walked in. Before he could see the atrocity that had taken place, the dead thing leapt at him. The leap used more strength than the ligaments in its right knee could bear, and it stumbled, grabbing onto Rakeshs leg as it fell. It bit rapidly, over and over, loosening its teeth against the shinbone before maneuvering around to tear away his Achilles tendon. Rakeshs leg buckled and he fell. 

The dead thing attacked his belly and pushed its head into the cavity, desperately looking for a source of blood. It reached under the ribs with both hands and pushed outward. Rakeshs chest cavity burst open. The dead thing discarded the mans heart and locked its lips around the pulmonary artery and sucked. Hot blood cascaded down its throat, making no dent in its thirst. It screamed in desperation as it drank. As it had done with Jian, it began to chew Rakeshs flesh once the flow had stopped.

While the dead thing chewed the remaining fluid out of Rakeshs remains, it began to regain a sense of identity. Not entirely; I, which I then realized could be called I, existed as a dichotomous split between autonomy and impulse. The first physical sensation to return to normal was my appetite. My desperate thirst transitioned into impossibly powerful nausea. Again, I ejected the contents of my stomach onto the floor. I was impelled to kneel over that which Id released, as if to swallow it again, but I had regained a tenuous bit of control over my motor functions by that point. 

I tried to stand. My right knee slipped out of place and I crashed to the floor. Another sensation, pain, returned and overwhelmed me. Not just my knee, but my shoulder and fingers and teeth. Apparently as I was destroying Rakesh, he had stabbed me countless times with his pen. Bits and pieces of memory, now in the first person rather than the third, coalesced into a series of horrifying recollections. Id broken my fingers with the force of my tearing through Jians ribs. My teeth were loose from attempting to bite through Rakeshs shinbone. 

The final physical sensation to return was taste. Copper, salt, bile, and other, unmentionable flavors coated my palate in a thick, oily residue. I gagged and dragged my broken fingers over the slick surface of my tongue in an attempt to rid myself of the ghastly taste. It was then Priya returned to the office. Shed been texting as she walked in and hadnt noticed the scene until she slipped in a puddle of blood and nearly fell. She looked at the destruction, screamed, and ran. I sat in the corner, knees hugged to my chest, sobbing and retching.

Both our company and the investment bank were able use their respective connections to purge Priyas emergency call from the police logs. The local authorities and the individual responders to the scene were all given enormous amounts of money for their silence. I was neither arrested nor prosecuted. 

For days, though, I underwent test after invasive test. The results showed an unexpected interaction between the Wellbutrin, which was still in my system after a month of non-use, and one of the compounds in our new drug. Other subjects had been on Wellbutrin while in the test groups, but none had reported ill-effects. My incident was chalked up as an anomaly, and labeled as a Cotard delusion; a poorly-known syndrome where the affected lose their sense of identity and believe they are either dead, immortal, or both. 

Neither our company nor the Chinese bank were willing to delay the deployment of the drug, and a few months ago, specific employees of the bank were required to take the medication. The banks next earnings report was beyond even the most optimistic analysts estimations. The drug is now being modified slightly and getting prepared to undergo FDA scrutiny. Other than Priya, the higher-ups in both our company and the bank, and a few select doctors, no one knows about what happened that night. Rakesh and Jians families were told they died in a chemical accident and each family received $50 million. 

I work in the same capacity, every day, in the office next to where I murdered those men. Its since been turned into a file room, but I frequently have to visit it as part of my job. Every time I set foot inside, I can see myself chewing the flesh of my former friends. I feel my stomach fill with their blood and remember the desperate, unquenchable thirst driving me to get more. And even in the comforting safety of my home, Im still overwhelmed by the taste.

	<TEXT> Im sharing the story because I was forced to sit through it during New Years Eve dinner and Im so freaked out and god damn itchy that I need to get it out of my system. Im sure some of you are going to breeze on by this little tantrum here and go right to the meat of the story because youre thinking, hey, Ive got a strong stomach. Well, go for it. 

Boring stuff out of the way: he was drafted, and since he was short and skinny, he was a perfect tunnel rat. Those were the guys who wriggled their way through the ridiculously narrow tunnels the Viet Cong used to transport personnel and weapons, set boobytraps, and all that. And when I say narrow, I mean narrow. [Heres a pic.](http://i.imgur.com/qRh25k9.jpg)

So, gramps was wriggling around in a tunnel one day and a few bad things happened. First, the two other people with him got killed by a solitary VC while they were standing around the hole. Being a few feet underground and about twenty feet through meant grandpa couldnt see who attacked them or know if anyone survived. He later learned he was the only one left alive, but he assumed the VC attacker would soon start throwing grenades into the tunnel and hed be done for. After a few minutes with no sign of any incoming attack, grandpa breathed a sigh of relief and starting moving forward again. A little while later, though, it starting pouring rain. The tunnel began to fill with water.

Now, in an unfinished, unsupported tunnel like he was in, a rainstorm usually meant death for a tunnel rat. Hed heard horror stories from the squadmates whod lost others underground, never to be seen again. He figured hed be another. But he wasnt going to go out without a fight.

He crawled forward. With him, he carried a small pistol and a Fulton flashlight. Originally, hed been sent down to ambush some VC soldiers who were thought to be hidden in one of the tunnels larger chambers. Hed crawl through, surprise them, blow their brains out, and wiggle his way back out. At least, thats how his first three tunnel trips had gone. This one, his fourth, wasnt going so well.

The tunnel narrowed as he crawled. Ahead of him, he heard rushing water. He thought it might mean the main chamber was nearby. He was wrong. The sound was the muddy ground above him sloshing downward, sealing the tunnel ahead. This is where he started to panic. He knew he wasnt particularly deep in the ground, maybe two and a half feet, but if he didnt start clawing upward through the ground really, really fast, hed be a dead man. So he clawed. His fingernails tore off and his hands got cut up really bad, but he was able to get part of his arm and face out of the mud. 

He was unable to move any farther. His lower back was pushed hard into the dirt and the angle had him bent into an elongated U shape. His legs were trapped. Above him, a square foot of light shone through where hed escape if he werent stuck.  He knew if it started to storm again, hed drown.

But the rain didnt come. Insects did. Ants were first. Luckily, they werent the big red ones everyone over there was terrified of. The ones with the bite that felt like you got shot. These were tiny black ones, but there were lots of them. He assumed when the tunnel flooded, they were driven from their homes. Now they crawled over his scalp, face, and neck. They didnt bite, but they tickled and itched. Those which found their way onto his lips were licked off and swallowed; he figured hed be going a while without food.

After a while, the ants lost interest. Flies became a problem, though. To see why, you need to know the position in which he was stuck. The twisted, awkward angle of his body left one arm stretched out in front of him, but his shoulder and upper back were immobile. So, he had a bit of movement in his upper arm, wrist, and hand, but anything below his elbow might as well have been paralyzed. Why is this relevant? Because his armpit was exposed. Not by much; maybe an inch of clearance, but that was more than enough for the flies. And they were very, very attracted to the warm, moist pit.

Over the course of an hour, 20 to 30 fat, brownish-black flies dove into his right armpit. They stayed for a little while, usually no more than six or seven at a time, before they flew away. Of course, while inside, they bit. The pain was sharp and awful, he said. It reminded him of that deep, pinching itch of the horse flies on the beach near where he grew up. And he couldnt stop them from doing anything. He just ground his teeth.

As the sun went down, the flies started to lose interest and flew away. He knew a few stayed nestled inside because he felt them moving against the thick hair of his armpit, but the majority had gone. Now just mosquitos remained to torment him with their endless bites and bottomless gullets. Somehow, he slept.

From the moment the sun came up, new insects visited him. Of all the massive, tropical bugs hed seen in Vietnam, he was grateful to have so far avoided the giant centipedes hed heard about. Massive, angry things as long as a mans forearm and as thick as a bottle of beer. One of his more sadistic squadmates hid one in the bunk of another poor bastard. It bit his feet and toes ten times before he could even jerk himself out of the bed. Grandpa hated even the tiny ones that he sometimes found in his basement back home, so the thought of those big ones made his blood run cold. [This is what they look like.](http://i.imgur.com/8Xu2NDY.jpg) God help you.

Five minutes after he opened his eyes to the morning light, one of them crawled onto his hand and wrapped itself around his wrist. He was too horrified to move. The little movement he had in his hand and wrist might have been enough to fling it away, but he didnt want to take a chance. So, he waited. Apparently the thing liked grandpa, because it remained on him for well over an hour before grandpa couldnt take the stress anymore. He tried to grab the bug in his fist. The moment he started moving, the thing began to bite. Grandpa was able to get a good grip on it and squeezed as hard as he could. 

The centipede broke in half in his hand and sent disgusting juices down his arm. The two pieces of its body dropped into the hole. The front part still had some life in it, and as it died, it bit grandpa on the nose and lips until he was forced to take its head in his teeth and kill it. He described the taste to us, but Im just not going to write it out. Yeah, it was that awful.

The rest of that day was spent suffering as flies swarmed around the carcass of the centipede. They couldnt get enough of it. For long hours he watched them eat and shit and fuck all over the monstrous bug. The juice on his arm, too, which had dribbled all the way down into his armpit, was also like the nectar of the Gods for the flies. More and more of them flew in and out of his armpit. He could tell more were staying within its moist confines, too; the pinching and itching and tickling sensations were occasionally more torturous than the nastily-swollen centipede bites.

Ants, too, noticed of the centipede corpse. This time, the little black ones werent the only variant. The red monsters with the hideous jaws had arrived. Grandpa lucked out, though. They were more interested in killing the smaller ants than bothering him. He did say one of them bit the corner of his left eye, but the pain was much less than what the pussies at camp were always bitching about. It was here my cousin told him that he missed his calling as a Gender Studies professor, to which grandpa simply replied by slapping him on the side of the head and saying, I dont appreciate jokes about that field of study. What a complex man.

Anyway, back in hell, it had started to rain. This was a mixed blessing for grandpa. The majority of bugs scurried away to find higher ground, but he was fairly certain the hole was going to fill with water and hed drown. Well, it didnt and he didnt. He even got a chance to drink some rainwater; hed been without any real food or water for well over 24 hours at that point, so he was grateful to swallow the few tablespoons-worth he managed to get.

There was a scary moment when the dirt below his hips shifted downward and he thought he was going to fall and get buried. Again, he lucked out. The shift was minor. Hed been pinned in that strange, elongated U shape for a while and having a tiny bit of the pressure relieved around his groin was definitely a plus. He was able to wiggle his hips and butt a little and figured there was maybe an inch or two of clearance in that area, but nothing that allowed him to get any hope of crawling out. 

He drifted to sleep at dusk and was woken up before dawn by severe pain in his armpit. Hed known all along that flies were busy damaging his skin and probably eating it. He was resigned to that fact. As long as it wasnt another centipede, he wasnt going to complain. But this pain was new and it was exquisite. The bites came much more frequently and he felt a lot of them moving around. That pain, despite its severity, was dwarfed by what came next. Let me just make this known: I dont want to tell this part of the story. Just thinking about it makes me cringe. But god damn it, its essential to his experience. And Im sorry in advance for you having to read it. Ill try to make it quick.

The shifting downward of the dirt was the result of an ant colony collapsing. A big one. All the ants came up out of the wreckage and had been hanging out on the surface of the dirt right below grandpas hips. But as he started to settle in to the new position overnight, the ants became agitated and swarmed him. And by him, I mean his crotch. Maybe the only thing that equalled the level of horror at the table as he talked about ants crawling into his penis and rectum was how hard my grandmother laughed as he told it. Youve gotta get really close to see the scars!, she exclaimed, as tears of laughter ran down her cheeks. My brother Dereks new girlfriend turned green and left the table with Derek hurrying after her. Grandma and grandpa shared a kiss and he continued with the story.

With ants up his dick and asshole and flies building a housing project in his armpit, grandpa suffered through the next two days in a haze of pain and fear. The lack of food and water had taken a toll on him. This, he told us, was somewhat helpful. The pain grew less acute as his consciousness waxed and waned. A tarantula wandered into the hole and grandpa was able to bite its abdomen in half and suck out what was inside. This, of course, attracted more flies but there was nothing he could do about it. If he didnt get some food and water in him, hed die. His survival instinct was still intact despite the all the trauma.

A couple more days went by and he blurrily realized hed been stuck for about a week. The rainfalls and insect pulp had kept him hydrated just enough to stay alive. His armpit was numb all the way down to the last rib on his right side. Flies were ignoring everything else and just going straight in and out of the pit. The adventurous ants had lost interest after a while, but every so often he felt a nasty pinch on one incredibly sensitive area or another. More time passed.

Late one afternoon, he heard gunfire. Hed heard quite a bit while he was stuck, but it was always off in the distance and too far for him to get any hope that hed be rescued. This time, though, it was very close. He was overwhelmed with a sense of hope which was tainted by the concern that hed be found by the wrong side. But, to his astonishment, it wasnt the VC who he heard shouting after all the gunfire. Grandpa starting waving his arm with the tiny bit of movement he could muster. He heard someone yell, Hey theres an arm over here! Grandpa yelled back incoherently and was soon greeted by the sight of a US soldier peering down at him.

It took him and his squadmates ten minutes to dig grandpa out of the hole. He remembers all of them saying some variant of holy fucking shit after theyd freed him. Someone radioed their position and after some unknown amount of time, a helicopter landed in a nearby clearing. Grandpa was loaded onto a stretcher and they lifted off. A medic who was along for the ride cut off grandpas shirt and promptly threw up. When the rest of the soldiers in the chopper looked at what the medic had seen, a few of them also rained puke down from the side of the aircraft.

A few days after being rescued, grandpa woke up in a hospital. Not one on the base, either - one in the US. He had no idea how he got there; once he was rescued, he passed out and slept for almost 36 straight hours. Some people thought he was in a coma until some poor medic tried to wake him up and grandpa said fuck off and knocked the guy out with a single shot to the chin. 

Now awake, the doctors told grandpa the extent of his injuries. Aside from the severe dehydration, he was absolutely riddled with infected bites. The ones on his more sensitive areas werent much cause for alarm, despite their unpleasantness. It was the bigger bites that were much more of a concern. The one from the red ant was the worst and for a while the doctors worried hed lose the eye. His lips and nose had terrible swelling from the infected centipede bites. Even though all those bites were awful, he couldve recovered in a few weeks and would have been back in the tunnels soon after. But his armpit was why he was sent home.

Botflies are a type of insect which lay their eggs inside flesh. [Heres a picture of them in some poor bastard](http://i.imgur.com/ZgCF1Bo.jpg), and again, Im sorry to do this to you. Until grandpas experience, no one knew they even had them in Vietnam. But apparently they do; the underside of his right arm all the way down to nearly his hip was completely reshaped into horrible cavities for their larvae. The doctors wouldnt operate, saying the only way to excise them was to let them gestate, and at a certain point, suffocate them with adhesive tape so theyd crawl to the surface. It took another few weeks, but thats what happened. Grandpa regaled us with the story of how he personally gave birth to 313 botfly larvae. Then he lifted up his shirt to show us the pockmarked skin. 

No one said much after that. He was done with the story and after shoveling a slice of fruit cake into his mouth, he and grandma left. They laughed all the way to the door. I dont really know what else to say. So yeah. Thats grandpa. Happy New Year.

	<TEXT> I used to be really into Crossfit. Its a weightlifting/gymnastics/cardio program thats ridiculously popular right now and I used it in my late 20s to get into the best shape of my life. Aside from the exercise, one of the things Crossfit trainers strongly endorse is healthy eating. Lots of natural foods like quality meats, tons of vegetables, nuts, etc. Nothing processed, nothing shitty. Since I was head-over-heels in love with everything that was Crossfit, I took the dietary advice seriously.

After a particularly grueling workout, I came home to find pretty much nothing in the fridge and a nearly-bare pantry. I was absolutely ravenous and my energy levels were nonexistent after all the exercise. Luckily, there was a bag of walnuts tucked away in the back of the pantry. I remembered using them a few months earlier in some weird pork tenderloin and broccoli concoction.

I shoveled handful after handful of the walnuts into my mouth, mildly irritated by how stale theyd gotten. Thats a problem I have: I never do a good job of properly sealing foods like chips and nuts and I always end up having to throw stuff out. Anyway, I was able to get rid of the worst of my cravings with the walnuts, so I stopped eating and grabbed a rubber band to reseal them.

I happened to glimpse inside the bag before I closed it. Hundreds of tiny moth larvae wriggled around in the remains of the walnuts. Ill leave the rest to your imagination.

Check your food before eating it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the whole day, he stood in the same spot, sometimes with his paws up on the concrete, barking wildly and scratching the rough surface with his nails. I tried to get him to calm down. I had to use his favorite treats to coax him out of the basement. Once I did, I locked him outside. I put my ear to the wall hed been obsessing over. I heard a few faint scratches but I wasnt particularly bothered. Im not a superstitious man; you wont catch me worrying about poltergeists or ghosts. If anything, I was concerned about bugs getting into the foundation. I made a mental note to buy some insecticide at Home Depot.

The following morning, I looked out the window and saw the dog had started to dig a hole up against the side of the house. It was right above the spot hed been so focused on in the basement. Now I was starting to get pissed off; he was ruining Martins marigolds. I ran outside to yell at the animal. In my rush to the door, I stumbled over one of our sons' toys and went flying headfirst into the island countertop in the kitchen. I mustve knocked myself out because when I woke up, it was after dark. Outside, I heard shrill barking. Memory gradually refilled my empty head and I figured the dog mustve completely destroyed the garden by that point.

I grabbed a flashlight and went into the yard. I hadnt been wrong. The garden was a tattered mess of soil and petals and loose bulbs. The god damn dog was down at least three feet. His paws bled and were leaving red streaks against the concrete outer wall of the basement. I picked him up by the collar and lifted him out of the hole. He dove right back in. I didnt know what the hell to do. None of the stores that sold pesticides were open at this hour. And the dog was going nuts. Bob and Angelas bedroom light went on and Bob leaned out to ask if everything was okay, and if it was, to please shut the dog up. I told him I was sorry and brought the animal back in the house. 

I cleaned up his paws and talked to him, trying to get him to settle down. He seemed exhausted, and to my great thanks, he turned over on his side and went to sleep. I trudged down to the basement and put my ear to the wall again. I heard the same, soft scratching sounds. I swore. In a fit of frustrated rage, I grabbed the sledgehammer from my workbench and smashed a hole in the concrete. A large chunk fell onto the floor. I half expected thousands of flies or termites to swarm out at me. Instead, Martins glazed eyes blinked stupidly at the light pouring into the hole. His forehead was scraped down to the skull, obviously the source of the scratching sounds. When I bound his and the kids hands and gagged them, I didnt expect any noise. After one more blow with the sledgehammer and an hour to reseal the wall, I made my way upstairs. Its been three days since and the dog hasnt barked or pawed at that spot again. Im really glad I didnt have to deal with bugs.

I walked away from the tree and toward Emma and Joy as melodic formants whirled around in my head. A serene smile still streaked Joys glowing face. Emmas smile however, was gone. In its place was a look of deep concern and, despite her obvious attempt to hide it, fear. She told me we had to go in the house right away. Something awful was about to happen.

We sat in front of the television all night. Nothing was abnormal. I was getting a little anxious; Emmas vague, portentous statement was alone enough to cause concern, but flashes of lightning which hinted at a coming storm only added to the ominousness. Leaving my spot on the couch, I walked tentatively to the large windows facing the woods. More lightning; long, thunderless flashes which caused the trees to cast ghostly, distorted shadows. I was reminded of the times I saw the writhing atrocities in the lightning bolts back in Florida. The lightning here was different, though. I never saw any individual bolts. And the illumination lasted much longer.

I fell asleep in front of the TV with Emma and Joy. When I woke up the next morning, Emma was still there on the couch with us. She insisted that we stay in the living room, glued to the television, until she could know the source of the terrible feeling of dread shed felt since yesterday afternoon. The day went by and nothing happened. Same with the next. Until early evening.

Whatever boring thing had been on TV was replaced by an NBC news brief about explosion in the USSR and radiation being detected in Sweden. Emma nodded gravely and told me this was what shed been worrying about. When I asked how she knew, she didnt answer. All she told me was we were far away and had nothing to worry about, even if the news says anything otherwise.

In the morning, it was on every channel and in every newspaper. A power plant called Chernobyl had exploded and spread radioactive material over an enormous area. No expert was willing claim that Europe would be safe. Not many even said there wasnt a chance the wind could take it across the Atlantic over to us. But Emma remained calm and confident and insisted wed be safe. For the first time in months, I saw a slim tendril of bleeding muscle squirm out of the left corner of the room, only to retreat seconds later. Joy giggled in my ear, and I took her from my shoulder and held her in front of my face. She was staring at the same corner. 

The day dragged on and Emma remained fixated on the television, I asked her if shed mind if I went for a quick walk. No further than the weird tree, I told her. She said it was fine. I grabbed my jacket and left.

Spring had melted the snowpack but had yet to take the chill from the air. I stuffed my hands in my pockets and walked in a straight line toward the tree. Deep mud clung to my ankles as I trudged across the clearing. I remembered Emma telling me how the Native Americans thought the area was an important spot. I stopped in the center of the clearing and looked around. There wasnt anything noteworthy. It might have been a hundred feet across with thick groups of white birch and oak trees surrounding it. Fifty or so feet inside the treeline stood the remains of an old stone wall which Emma claimed the local tribe had built hundreds of years ago.

Icy wind whipped through the clearing and the surrounding treetops swayed. I looked at the graying sky. Flurries were in the forecast for later in the evening, but I wouldnt have been surprised if they started to fall right then. I made my way across the clearing to the tree. It stood as it did the last time; a black, bulbous object studded with countless, spiny branches and sticks. I placed myself in front of the spot where I saw the eyes. No eyes could be seen. Not even slits where they might open. I ran my hands over the scarred bark. It felt smooth, despite the blemishes. Warm, too. 

As I inspected the surface of the tree, a staggeringly-powerful taste of salt entered my mouth. It was awful. I craved water or juice or anything to get rid of the terrible, desiccating sensation. I turned around, ready to walk back toward the house, when the branches reached toward me. Before I could jump, I was grabbed and pulled, face first, against the surface of the tree. Screaming and struggling, I tried to free myself from its grasp. The taste in my mouth grew even stronger and I began to choke. The pressure grew and I could feel my cheekbone and ribs straining against the force.

Everything went black. But I didnt lose consciousness. I was free to move, but it was like I was floating in space. I spun and kicked and tried to run, only to remain in the same, empty spot. The pressure was gone. The cold wind was gone. The vile, salty taste was gone. Aside from my fear, all I felt was warmth. A moment later, I heard the voice of my friend.

Her voice came through the empty space like wind chimes on a calm day. This time, I could understand each word.

*I miss you. I miss you and I hate myself for failing you.*

Even in the maternal warmth of the space I occupied, the words chilled me and forced gooseflesh to rise on my skin.

*There is so little I can do for you now. So little help I can provide.*

I tried to ask her what she was talking about, but I couldnt open my mouth. The feeling wasnt uncomfortable - just strange. It was like I had no mouth at all. All I could do was listen.

*You need to see what lies ahead. And only after you see will you be ready to learn.*

An immense, incomprehensibly vast field of stars exploded into view. The light was intense; brighter than anything I knew could exist. Looking down, I noticed I couldnt see my own body. The nurturing warmth of the area I occupied kept me calm, though, and I gazed out across the millions upon millions of stars. Nothing happened. I bathed in an acorporeal womb of lights.

After uncountable moments, things changed. Starting at the edges of where I could see and gradually moving inward, stars went black. Slowly, and with growing speed, each pinprick of fire was smothered. With every snuffed light, the temperature dropped. Astonishingly potent fear gripped me as more and more and more beautiful lights were cut from the sky. Cold set in. It was a type of cold for which I have no words other than those which describe death. Not familiar, human death. Cosmic death. 

The icy, starless void disappeared and I found myself on the forest floor staring up at the clouds. The black womans musical voice filled my mind.

*Everything you do from now on must be for Joy. Keep her safe and show her love. It is up to you to give her a purpose.*

I gagged as the hideous taste of salt overpowered my mouth.

Dad died before the ambulance got there. The EMTs didnt come right out and say it in front of me, but I caught on pretty quickly when one of them checked his pulse, shook his head at the other EMT, and then immediately went to work on mom. All three of us were rushed to the hospital.

Moms condition was critical. Something about her being pregnant made the situation much more dangerous. None of the doctors would say exactly what happened. All they could tell me was that my parents had lost a lot of blood. When I asked how, they just said they were working on making mom better. Dr. Jessica, who I hoped would be there to help calm me down, was absent.

There was a significant commotion in the room where mom was being worked on. Doctors and nurses were crowded around her. It took a few moments, but then I realized what was happening: they were taking the baby out of her. This terrified me; I didnt know much about pregnancy, but I knew it was almost three months too soon for mom to be giving birth. Something had to be wrong.

Im not going to dwell on this next part. When it comes to most of the emotional trauma Ive encountered, Im okay with giving a lot of details. But the final moments of my moms life were too terrible; too raw. I dont want to make myself remember all the particulars. Basically, mom knew she only had moments to live. Shed lost an unbelievable amount of blood from what the doctors would only refer to as bites around her groin and upper thighs. Like dad, her femoral artery had been damaged. His was entirely severed, which was why he died so quickly, but moms wasnt as bad. Still, the ER doctors couldnt fix the wound. On top of it all, shed undergone a Cesarean section to save the baby. Her system couldnt take all the trauma.

Before she died, she was able to see her baby. I was brought into the room, too, presumably to say goodbye. Mom was gray. And most of the gray was covered with blood. Her blue lips formed the words, I love you. Her whispered speech was so quiet I still dont know if I heard her or just filled in the gap with what I remember of her voice. But after that, I distinctly remember her telling me, take care of your baby sister, Joy.

Thats all Ill say about those last moments.

I suffered an emotional breakdown soon after. Again, I was held in the psychiatric wing of the hospital. I never saw Dr. Jessica. I had sessions with another doctor, Dr. Fallon. He was kind and capable, but he wasnt the person with whom Id formed such a powerful connection months before. Along with Dr. Fallon, I spent time with Emma. Emma was my aunt; moms sister. She lived in New Hampshire and travelled to Florida the day after my parents had died. I guess mom had something in her purse detailing what should be done in the event of anything happening to her and dad.

Emma made the funeral arrangements and did all the other work behind the scenes to deal with their affairs. I didnt attend the funeral. I was barely conscious. As days and weeks went on, though, I began to come around. I grieved. I screamed and threw tantrums and hit Dr. Fallon. But, slowly, the pain lessened. My sister, Joy, was doing exceptionally well. Despite her premature birth, she was the picture of health. She was strong and vocal and, as weird as it sounds, mature.

A little over a month after the death of my parents, Joy and I were released into the custody of Emma. Emma was eight years older than mom and lived alone. She was a very successful accountant. In fact, I believe she was the only one in the modest New Hampshire town in which she lived. During our time in the hospital, Emma had taken great care of Joy and me. Id grown to like her very much. Before that point, Id only seen her a handful of times over the course of my life. But Id enjoyed her company those times. Learning that Joy and I would be moving to New Hampshire to live with her gave me a surprisingly strong sense of hope.

We arrived at our new home in early March. Id noticed I hadnt had a single hallucination or vision since the day of my parents death. While I knew it was only a matter of time before they came back, I hoped the new environment would make them easier to endure. Plus, I loved Joy. She was the most beautiful baby Id ever seen. I think she loved me, too. Shed always hold my finger in her tiny hand and smile at me, locking her enormous, blue eyes on my own. I never forgot how moms last words were to take care of her. Joys protection and betterment became my purpose in life.

Emma decided I should be homeschooled. While I thought it was odd, I didnt have anything against the idea. Id been nervous about starting in a new school with kids and teachers who didnt know I was being medicated for schizophrenia. Besides, Emma was a fun teacher. Since she worked from home, she was always around to give me little lessons over the course of the day. She didnt want to make the experience like a regular school. Instead of having a long block of classes, she just integrated subjects into conversations wed have. She loved to talk. That part got on my nerves a little bit. Sometimes I just wanted to be left alone, but Emma was always working to get me to discuss things with her. I figured Id get used to her after a while.

And I did. Before I knew it, April had arrived to release the frosty fingers of the New Hampshire winter from around our throats. Deep snow gave way to mud and tiny shoots of plant growth. Emma and I, along with a bundled-up Joy, started to take long walks through the thickly wooded area behind the house. Emma, of course, used these walks to teach me about the various subjects she believed were important to my education. I held Joy as we walked through a muddy clearing surrounded by white birch trees. Emma talked about the Native American tribes who lived there before they were driven from their land by European settlers. The clearing where we stood, she claimed, used to be a very important spot.

She extended her right arm and pointed out into the distance, behind the birch trees, and had me look at the long, low stone walls which formed a broken ring around where we stood. Then she took Joy from me. She asked that I go over, just beyond the wall, to a thick tree stump that stood darkly against the forestscape, and tell her what I thought of it when I came back. I obeyed.

As I walked closer to the stump, it became clear it was from a bizarre tree that didnt grow anywhere around where we used to live in Florida. It was very thick, maybe six feet wide, and just a little taller. Hundreds of thin branches extended from the black trunk like grasping, skeletal arms. When I stood directly in front of the thing, I examined its surface. It was darker than any wood Id seen. Almost like it was painted. Knots and blemishes covered its bark. In the cool, early spring breeze, the limbs trembled as if they were shivering.

When Id gotten a good look and was ready to head back to Emma and Joy, a powerful gust of wind blew me directly at the tree. I stumbled and grabbed the stickly limbs to get regain my balance. A couple broke off in my hands, but I was able to steady myself. I stared at the black bark of the tree. I felt wetness on my hands and glanced over. Dark red sap oozed from the breaks in the wood. I wiped my hands on the front of my jacket and looked up. Tens of pitch black eyes opened in the center of the tree and met my gaze. The musical, wordless voice of my lost friend, the black woman, filled my mind. I backed away with uncomprehending surprise. From around the tree, far away, I could see Emma and Joy watching me. Both were smiling.

	<TEXT> It is with deep reluctance and gnawing dread that I choose to recall the events of last Thursday. All fibres of my being scream that doing so is a bad idea; that I should take the safe, healthy route and allow time to erase the memories. But, still, the responsible citizen in me believes an informed populace should take precedence over the real risk to my own mental health. The world must know what happened. If a watchful, beneficent God exists in a realm unknown to mankind, I hope my sacrifice may someday be rewarded. 

I had been working in So Paulo for three weeks. I was asked by my company to make the trip to Brazil to help get our new divisional office up and running. I enjoyed Brazil, despite my near-nonexistent ability to speak Portuguese. Still, I liked the few people Id gotten to know in the office, and I looked forward to attending my boss Christmas party my at her home in Chacara Flora. 

I arrived fashionably late to find the party at its jubilant peak. Our host, Bethe Silva, had made sure each of her employees was well fed and filled with festive drinks. After about twenty minutes, the electricity cut out. Thanks to the luminosity of numerous lanterns and candles around the living room, the atmosphere became even more festive. Soft shadows danced across the guests smiling faces and no one seemed to mind. I checked my cell phone out of sheer habit and noticed it wasnt working. I tried to reset it, but still it didnt work. I downed another drink and got over my mild irritation.

A murmur passed through the party as more guests realized none of their electronic devices worked. We were confused; there was no reason why a power failure would prevent our phones and cameras from functioning. Then, with a noise that sent startled gasps through the hosts large living room where we were all gathered, every door and window slammed shut. People closest to them tried in vain to get them to budge. Bethes husband, a firefighter, said something about this being a tremendous fire hazard. He banged the corner of his chair against the window to break the pane. The window held as if it were iron. He swore in Portuguese. Without warning, stifled screams filled the room. I turned around.

Six guests in the center of the room rose nearly two feet from the carpet and floated in midair. All six yelled in surprise and fear. Arms and legs thrashed with maddening uselessness as their panicked movements did nothing but assail their helpless neighbors. In a terrible, blinding flash, their clothing and hair burned away, leaving hideous, angry swaths of singed flesh on the now-hysterical victims.

I cannot overemphasize the horror of the moments which followed. Nothing in my five decades of experience on this planet can compare to the atrocities of that night. Ive been to war. Ive seen lives of men, women, and children laid waste by the actions of fellow men. But in the throes of the colossal evil I was forced to witness, I must admit I yearned for the days of simple man contra man violence. It is an admission which fills me with guilt, but I cannot be honest with myself by claiming otherwise. Whatever it was I saw -- whatever it was I survived -- made the hideousness of war seem like paradisiacal bliss.

A floating man, Alfonso Cordona, began to choke. Ryan OConnell, an internist at a local hospital and friend of Bethe, rushed over, presumably to help. The moment Ryans hands touched the choking man, another ungodly flash of light seared our retinas. The choking sounds of Alfonso were replaced by the shrill, castrato shrieks of Ryan. As our eyes readjusted to the dimness of the room, we saw the doctors arms had been charred beyond belief. Carbonized bones jutted from his shoulders like ghostly tree branches after a forest fire. The doctor collapsed to his knees, sighed a heavy, thick breath, and fell on his face.

OConnells disfigurement had distracted us from poor, choking Alfonso. He had stopped flailing and was looking in my general direction. Not at me, but through me. Through the walls and beyond the world behind them. A thick tongue bulged out of his small, red mouth. More and more of the organ pushed itself from its home. In astonished, uncomprehending terror, I watched as Alfonsos body contorted. His chest collapsed inward and his backside pulled upward into his lower back. And then it happened. Vile, connected bundles of what I knew had to be his lungs, stomach, bowels, and every other essential part of the man spewed from his mouth. They, too, floated. The husk of Alfonso thudded to the floor. 

Four of the other gravity-deprived partygoers experienced the same, torturous end; their combined viscera twisting through the air like serpentine stormclouds. Blood and other, nauseating fluids rained down upon the carpet as the other partygoers and I huddled, sobbing, against the farthest wall.

The sole surviving member of the six floating people was a woman Id met only that night. Shed earlier introduced herself as Hope. Id noticed after the initial flash which burned away her hair and clothing that she was pregnant. Unlike the damned others, Hope neither thrashed nor screamed. She levitated with serene grace, gazing out over the rest of the room with a calm demeanor which contrasted obscenely against the violence surrounding her. Extinguish the stars, she whispered. Even through the omnipresent sobs of the other partygoers, I heard each word perfectly.

Hopes jaw unhinged. The writhing tempest of loathsome, dripping offal changed directions and moved toward her gaping mouth. Tears filled my eyes as the ropes of organs disappeared down her throat. Hopes body began to change. She swelled from the mass of that which was being driven into her. A moment later, she flushed bright red. From our vantage point, perhaps twenty feet away, we felt blazing heat emanating from her flesh. Steam gouted from the vermillion landscape of her skin, billowing in noxious clouds which dispersed throughout the room. Her belly seethed and distended as I realized, with a chill which momentarily overtook the scalding humidity of Hopes hellish actions, that she was metabolizing the human meat in order to nourish the child inside her.

The repulsive process continued for another few minutes. The room was wet and stifling and even through the choking steam, Hope shone through like a hateful sun. Every passing second caused her belly to grow and soon she was drastically larger than any pregnant woman Id ever seen. The last of the meat disappeared into Hope. The temperature of the room dropped. In the tiny space of relief the remaining guests and I enjoyed, Hopes child erupted from her body. 

A baby unlike any Id ever seen crashed onto the floor in a shower of afterbirth and gore from Hopes devastated pelvic caldera. A vaguely anthropomorphic shape rose on thick, strong legs. Its body was covered in thin, ossified plates. The plates quivered and extended outward, revealing their true nature: quills. Hopes now-dead body fell from the air and impaled itself on the quills. No one in the room was surprised when the infant-creature began to consume its mother. Even the most fragile members of our surviving group had stopped crying. I believed they had either accepted their places in this impossible, heinous situation, or had disassociated entirely. 

It was only when the creature had stripped the flesh and muscle from its mother and consumed everything but bones did it look upward. Large, bright red eyes focused on us. In the blink of my own tear-filled eye, it launched itself with unimaginable speed and power at our group. The unlucky three directly in its path were cut to ribbons by the blades covering its body. The other two, Bethe and her husband were quickly grabbed and exsanguinated before they could even attempt to run. I, somehow, managed to escape to the other side of the room and hid under a large couch. Why I bothered to move away, I didnt even know. Id long assumed that my death was only inevitable; some sense of innate self-preservation must have overridden my trauma-induced nihilism. 

It was that move which saved my life. Once the creature had consumed the corpses, it burst through the wall and left the home. I waited for six hours before I dared slide out of my hiding place. I ran to the neighbors home in my gore-caked holiday outfit and barged in without saying a word to the furious and frightened homeowners. Only when they realized I was calling the authorities did they soften and realized Id experienced a terrifying ordeal. In broken Portuguese, I did my best to communicate to the emergency operator that they needed to go to the home where the violence occurred. After I hung up, I curled up on the floor and wept.

The police arrived, and, after inspecting the home Id escaped, took me in for questioning. They held me for days as they worked to determine whether or not I was a mass murderer and cannibal. Finally, yesterday, I was released. Now I am back in my apartment. I have not slept since December 23rd. 

Whatever I saw that night is out there. It, and whatever empowered it, is real. It is beyond anything I can hope to comprehend; beyond anything I can ever want to comprehend. As of today, there is no mention of any of it in the Brazilian newspapers. By writing this letter, Ive been forced to relive the worst moments of my life. I am certain my already-damaged psyche has endured another crippling blow as a result. Still, my concern about my own madness is second only to my desire to not see another person succumb to the bestial wrath of whatever that thing is. Even if it means I never sleep again.

	<TITLE> Christmas Morning With Danny and His New Puppy </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We waited until 6am to call Danny downstairs. I couldnt believe was actually sleeping; hed been talking about Christmas for the last two months. We heard him tossing and turning from the other side of the wall until something like 3am. But Dana said hed eventually tire himself out, and, of course, she was right. Within five seconds of his mom and I yelling up the stairs for him to come down and see what Santa brought him, Danny was sprinting toward the living room. When he got there and saw what was under the tree, he stopped dead.

The look on our Dannys face was incredible. It was a mixture of shock, disbelief, and joy. His eyes were wide and he slapped his little hands over his mouth to stop himself from screaming. The present wed gotten for him padded over, her tail wagging, and licked Dannys elbow. Danny took his hands from his mouth, his eyes still wide, and carefully embraced the German Shepherd puppy. Dana read that the breed was great with children; that they were loyal and loving and really great for a kid to grow up with. From what we were seeing already, wed made a great choice.

The puppy regarded Danny with shy tenderness. She stopped licking his arm and elbow and started to gently paw at his knee. Danny, to our delight, took the puppys paw in his hand and shook it. Then he let go. The puppy presented her paw again, and Danny, in turn, shook it. Dana and I looked adoringly at one another. The puppy was already starting to learn tricks.

I asked Danny what he wanted to name the puppy. Danny looked thoughtful for a moment, but then he lost interest in my question and continued playing with the little dog. Now the puppy was lying on her back. Danny rubbed her tummy and put his forehead on her chest. The puppy leaned over the sniffed Dannys head over and over. Danny found this wildly funny and laughed hysterically while he sniffed the puppy in return.

While Dana and I unwrapped the presents wed gotten for each other and watched Danny play with his new best friend, we heard a something sliding down the steps from upstairs. The slide became a tumble, stopping with an ugly thump at the bottom. Dana mumbled something about Danny leaving a toy on the steps and walked over to pick it up. When she got there, I heard her scream. I shot off the couch and ran over to my wife. Danny was lying on his back, covered in blood. Bite marks covered his head and face and throat. His legs were twisted in horrific, obscene angles suggesting countless breaks. Dana panicked when she touched his neck, saying something crazy about him not having a pulse as she pulled her phone from her pocket to dial 911.

My blood ran cold as a powerful shiver flashed down my spine. Leaving Dana to call the ambulance, I walked the interminable ten feet down the hall to the living room. I peered around the corner. The puppys back legs spasmed with pitiful kicks as the Danny-shaped creature beside the Christmas tree pulled the dogs body down its loathsome, gaping throat. I retched and doubled over, gasping in disgusted, uncomprehending horror. Its eyes studied me for a moment; the dogs legs now dangling with flaccid lifelessness. Its impossibly powerful jaws snapped shut, dropping the lower half of the animal onto the red and gold tree skirt. Bloody tangles of viscera blanketed the books and videogame our son hadnt gotten to unwrap. The Danny-creature walked over to the sliding glass door, opened it, and, as the siren of the approaching ambulance grew louder, ran away into the woods.

The next week passed with shocking normalcy. My parents and Dr. Jessica noticed a gradual decline in my outward projection of stress, and they all believed the medication had started working much earlier than theyd expected. Session after session with the doctor yielded the fruit which shed hoped for; I didnt seem terrified, I didnt speak of invisible monsters, and my smile had returned. The diagnosis of childhood schizophrenia, while terrible in its implication, seemed, to all observers, to serve as the catalyst for a series of treatments which allowed me to resume my normal life.

I didnt mention the pain my father seemed to be in as he walked.

I didnt mention the cracked, raw skin around Dr. Jessicas mouth that was impossible for her makeup to adequately hide.

True to my word, I ignored all the abnormalities that I believed were real but couldnt talk about. And the worst, apparently, was still ahead of me. As the black woman portended, an increase in the severity of my visions and the real-life effects of the creatures actions on those who couldnt see them would all come to a calamitous head. But I waited and waited. And it didnt happen. In fact, it was the opposite. 

More time passed. Dr. Jessicas mouth healed and my father seemed no worse for wear. Even the visions that Id done my very best to ignore were beginning to fade. They occurred less frequently, and, even when they did present themselves, the potency was little more than a faded nuisance; an afterimage of bright, passing headlights during a nighttime drive. I was released from the hospital in early July. I began my summer like a normal, 7 year old boy. I played with my friends, all of whom were happy to see me. While my parents still felt concern about my wellbeing and were reluctant to let me out of their sight, even their mild paranoia diminished as the heat of summer cooled into a tolerable autumn. 

I entered the second grade in September. After a couple weeks, I didnt see a single, full-on hallucination. Every so often, I would see vague shimmering in cracks and corners or behind the clouds. I didnt even pay attention. It had gotten to the point where I was convinced the medication really was helping me; that my parents and Dr. Jessica were right about my sickness all along. 

I excelled in school. To me, my past troubles served only to give me a greater perspective on life and made me want to try as hard as I could to do well. Autumn begat winter. The Christmas season was a beautiful, loving experience. And when I thought it couldnt get any better, my parents told me I was going to be an older brother. I was bewildered by the height of my joy at the news; I felt like I could really be a positive role model in his or her life. 1986 arrived with me feeling as good as I could remember. While I infrequently thought about the black woman in fleeting moments of strange nostalgia, I remembered that my real life had so many things going for me. Such positivity. Such potential.

On the 28th of January, I was sitting in class when a school aide came into the room and whispered something into Mrs. Carlsons ear. My teachers expression became one of shocked sadness. Collecting herself with practiced, professional rapidity, she thanked the aide and faced her class. She announced to us that something had happened during the launch of one of the space shuttles.

The class looked frightened and upset. Our school was in Florida, about 50 miles south of Cape Canaveral. Students would sometimes go on field trips to watch launches with their science class; the space program was of deep personal interest to many kids and their teachers. Mrs. Carlson wheeled the television set from the corner of the room, pulled up its antennae, and switched it on. The class was greeted by the sight of a single, thick column of billowing rocket exhaust which had terminated in a large puff before forking out into two, thinner tongues of smoke which curled around in a serpentine arcs before disintegrating into small, burning chunks of debris which tumbled from the sky.

No one said anything. The poor television signal had barely enough potency for distorted audio, but we could all understand what was being said. The space shuttle, Challenger, exploded a little more than a minute after launch. The crew was not expected to have survived. As the class took in the horror of the disaster, I stared, wide-eyed, at the grainy picture. As the explosion replayed over and over, I watched as obscene, writhing tubes of impossibly thick, bloody muscle waved through the air like colossal earthworms. Theyd pushed up through the ground and the water - hundreds of them - slashing through the smoke as if celebrating the shuttles destruction.

Far above, in the gloriously blue sky of that Florida winter day, holes of black space had opened as far as I could see. With all the strength I could muster, I tore my gaze from the screen and looked out the window. The sky above the school was also riddled with holes. Faint stars twinkled within the black maws, and a haze of red strings hung down like the tentacles of a cosmic jellyfish. I rested my head in my hands, pushing my palms with painful force against my eyes.
The familiar lightshow of amorphous, organic shapes danced in my field of vision. I breathed with slow, controlled breaths, working with great effort to calm down. To regain control of myself. When I took my hands from my eyes and the blurriness gave way to sharp clarity, the holes were gone. The tentacular strings were gone. I looked at the television with its endless loop of destruction and the tubes of muscle were gone. 

The bell rang. We were being dismissed early. Our principal made the call on a rumor that the space shuttle was carrying something toxic and he worried it could be carried by the wind to our area. The busses were already there and waiting for us. I got on and began the short ride from school. I arrived home and walked up the short front walkway. I opened the door and went toward the den where the television was blaring. My parents didnt answer my yelled greeting when I came in the house. I yelled louder and walked into the den. They were both slumped down on the couch. Thick, crimson stains of what had to be blood covered the front of their jeans and had spread down to their knees. I couldnt tell if they were breathing or not. 

Wet coils of meat grew from the floor and slapped soundlessly against the gray carpet. I called 911 and just stood there, watching it all. I prayed for the black woman to show herself. But she remained absent. The coils grew longer and gathered around mom. They brushed her groin and belly with repulsive, seductive familiarity. At that moment, I knew shed be allowed to survive whatever had befallen her. Instead of relief, I felt naked horror. I pressed my palms into my eyes. When I uncovered them a minute later, my view was no different. I wouldnt let myself cry.

Mom and dad looked on as I swallowed a small, beige pill with a gulp of orange juice. I wasnt to expect any effects of the drug to be noticed for a week or two. Hearing that disappointed me a little. I was hoping to have all this end right away, as soon as the pill disappeared down my throat. 

We watched 101 Dalmations on the little TV and ate some freezer-burned ice cream. Afterward, mom kissed me goodbye and told me dad would stay the night. She needed to go to work early the next morning. When she left, dad took a quick shower, donned his flannel bathrobe, and sat down in the chair next to my bed. We started to watch The Happiest Millionaire. He was snoring within ten minutes. An hour later, I was asleep.

Late at night, I was startled awake by an odd, whimpering sound. I opened my eyes and looked out over the right side of my bed. My friend stood there like an obsidian pillar, her gaze directed not at me, but in the direction of where my father was sleeping. Her bituminous flesh was being touched by a faint, dark red light. The sound persisted. I turned around, dragging my heavy, exhausted face over the pillow, and saw my dad, still sitting in his chair, breathing heavily. 

As my eyes gradually acclimated to the dim light, I was able to see in greater detail. Dad was sweating. I could see it pouring down his forehead, over his closed eyes, and down to his lips and neck. Dads bathrobe began to shift. He hadnt stirred or moved anything aside from the heaving motion of his chest as he breathed. Fine, red lines dropped from somewhere above him and his robe opened fully. I snapped my head upward.

Before a scream had completed its leap from my throat into the world, the black womans hand was covering my mouth. I pulled and jerked, trying to get away to call for help, but she was impossibly strong. *Let it happen,* she spoke directly into my mind, *and he wont be killed.* Utterly helpless, I was forced to stare in near silence; the only sounds being my snorting, panicked breaths and my fathers whimpering. 

Above dad, extruding filaments of gossamer which pulsed with crimson bioluminescence, was a hole. Id never seen anything like it. It was a six foot sphere of blackness taking the place of the air and ceiling above him. And from that sphere grew glowing strings. 

The strings extended outward and down, traveling over dads face, chest, and stomach, until they reached his groin. In abject horror, I stared as they began to slide, one by one, into his penis. The glow of the tendrils underwent a brief process of intensification as they pushed deeper into him. I nearly lost consciousness when I saw his scrotum bulge as the tendrils moved inside, their glow illuminating the veins in his skin. Time passed with glacial speed as hundreds of the things with the combined diameter of a pencil invaded my father. Sickening undulations below his skin waxed and waned. The only consolation was that he didnt seem to be in pain; he sweated and breathed in heavy, sobbing heaves, but I was hoping, in his mind, it was nothing more than a nightmare.

I couldnt watch what they were doing to him any longer and my friend was still holding me tightly, preventing me from moving or screaming. My eyes drifted toward the void from which the filaments came. Now fully acclimated to the dark room, I could see that the hole wasnt completely black. I was shocked to see that there were stars shining within. Last summer, Dad and I spent many nights out in the backyard with the beautiful, expensive telescope hed won in a contest at work. As an astronomy buff, he was excited to point out all the constellations and planets. He was so proud of me for remembering every single one of them. But the weak glow of the stars shining within the void were parts of no constellations Id ever seen. There didnt appear to be any discernable order to the pinpricks of light at all, aside from a few obvious binary and ternary systems. 

Not knowing if it would work, I furiously thought, Im not going to scream or touch anything, I just want to look. The black womans grasp loosened. Her right hand remained wrapped around my wrist, not entirely trusting me, but willing to give me the benefit of the doubt. I stood on my bed and walked around, looking into the gulf of stars. From a vantage point at the foot of my bed, I saw what might have been a planet, but not one Id ever seen in books or on that Carl Sagan show dad liked to watch with me.

Whatever it was, it terrified me. At one point in its history, it might have been a normal sphere. But some colossal force had cleaved it into multiple, chaotic chunks that remained clustered together by its hideously powerful gravity well. The surface was blanketed by what I could only describe as frozen, rotting flesh. It had grown like pustulent rime, first within the cracks and interstices between the largest chunks of rock, and then over the main, cratered surfaces. In the craters, volcanoes ejaculated jets of putrid-looking yellow gas which quickly coalesced and froze  into pebbles which rained on the ground below.

With blinding violence, my arm was yanked downward and I collapsed onto the bed. My body was held and my mouth, again, was covered. Pain radiated through my shoulder like Id been stabbed. As I yelled under the black hand, I felt her other one grab my shoulder and push forward and up. I felt a pop and the pain quickly diminished. A dull ache replaced the sensation, but my attention shifted to my father. The things were leaving him. One by one, they extricated themselves from his anatomy and slithered their way back into the void from which they came.

Once the last one had disappeared, the void collapsed in on itself, leaving a tiny singularity of bright light before blinking out. The dark room was normal again and my friend let me go. Dad awoke with a gasp and twisted his head back and forth, as if looking for the assailants he believed had visited him in his nightmare. He saw me staring at him and forced a calming smile. He looked down and noticed his robe had been open. Whoops, he said, covering up. Sorry you had to wake up to that! He got up and walked over to the bathroom. As he relieved himself, he made pained, grunting sounds. He flushed, washed his hands, and came over to me.

Remind me to ask your mom to pick up some cranberry juice tomorrow, he told me. He kissed my forehead and sat back down. We turned on the TV and watched some old cowboy and indian movie from when he was a kid. He went back to sleep with little effort. I locked my glare on the stygian eyes of my friend. You have to tell me whats going to happen, I thought at her.

*I will, but only in pieces small enough for you to digest,* she replied. *And starting now, you have to ignore everything that only you can see.*

Including you? My question felt hollow and pained. I couldnt stand to act like my friend, my protector, wasnt actually there. But I knew she had to have a point. If I wanted to get better, at least in the eyes of those who were trying to help me, I couldnt keep talking about crazy, impossible creatures. 

*Including me,* came the answer, *for another nine months.*

While I tried to figure out what could happen in that period of time, she interrupted my thought process.

*As I told you, things will get worse. Events beyond any comprehensible level of evil will take place. And even as they do, you have to stay silent.*

And with that, she was gone. It was only then did my scream peal throughout the room, rousing my father and causing a nurse to rush in. When they begged me to tell them what was wrong, all I could do was apologize.

[Part 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3wu2hw/part_2_i_was_diagnosed_with_childhood/)

Despite the black womans dire warning, I slept through the night for the first time in nearly a week. Knowing she was watching over me imbued a sense of safety and comfort; something, to the deep chagrin of my parents, no one else had been able to provide since this whole ordeal started. The sleep was dreamless and restful. My only moment of discomfort was the space between waking up and opening my eyes; I felt certain my day would begin with the sight of my friends mangled body. 

Thankfully, my worry was misplaced. She stood over my bed, cast like a scarred shadow against the harsh white of the hospital wall. Her darkly beatific gaze followed my smallest movements. Always alert. I smiled and noticed how itchy my face was. The scratches from my fingernails were healing quickly, but the sensation of their mending was unpleasant. I pressed my fingertips against the scrapes. It helped a little. 

After about five minutes, my parents came in the room and apologized for not being there when I woke up. They wanted to bring me some breakfast thatd be better than what the hospital offered. I was given a box that smelled phenomenal. I opened it and was greeted by pancakes and sausages and potatoes from the same diner dad and I visited the day before. I devoured it all while mom discussed what my day would be like. It turned out Id be with Dr. Jessica for a few hours. She asked if Id be comfortable with that. I told her it was fine. I was curious to learn what was wrong with me. Mom did her best to explain nothing was *wrong* with me; just a little different. And soon that wouldnt even be case, either. Things would go back to how they always were. I liked hearing that.

Once mom was done talking to me, dad and I took a shower. He hadnt taken one with me in a couple years; he said he just wanted to make sure Id be okay in there. I didnt mind. It felt nice to have him wash my hair again. To my surprise, the black woman didnt stay at the foot of my bed. She followed us into the shower and stood right in front of me. Dad spent most of his time passing in and out of her, totally oblivious to the third person in the stall. All the while, she watched every movement of my body with rapt intensity. Part of me realized she needed to stay by my side in case something bad happened. After what she told me last night, I was happy for her to be there; not only for my protection, but for dads, too.

I noticed, for the first time, I was close enough and in a room sufficiently bright to see between the black womans legs. Last year, mom sat down with me and we went through a book showing pictures of men and women while she explained what made us physically different. What my friend had looked a little like the pictures in the book and what Id seen of mom, but behind the hair were ghastly scars. These were different from the others all over her body. With these, it almost looked like something had bitten huge chunks of the flesh away. I shuddered and wished I could hug her.

We got out of the shower, toweled off, and got dressed. My friend, who was never dressed, stood stoically as mom brushed my hair into a shape that would be somewhat presentable. A little while later, the four of us were walking down the hall and took the elevator up to see Dr. Jessica. I was excited. 

My parents greeted Dr. Jessica, hugged me, and left. I sat in her sunny office on the biggest beanbag chair Id ever seen. My friend stood directly behind me. Dr. Jessica sat very close, maybe just a couple feet away, on her own beanbag. She handed me a grape lollipop that had a tootsie roll inside. My eyes widened. So far, everything was going great.

The doctor asked me how I was doing. How I felt. I answered honestly: Id been feeling pretty good since I woke up. Then she wanted to know if Id seen anything since I got to the hospital yesterday afternoon. When I told Dr. Jessica that the black woman was alive, she seemed very interested. She told me to describe her as best I could. So I did. Much taller than dad -- so tall her thick, frizzy hair brushes against the ceiling. Naked all the time, too. And so, so dark. Almost impossible to see unless the light was on. And now shes covered in cuts and scars and bites.

The doctor wanted to know about my friends injuries: how they happened, where they were, what they looked like. I was very clear with my descriptions since I was able to turn around and look at every bit of damage on her body. Dr. Jessica appeared very concerned when I described the scarred bitemarks disfiguring my friends vulva. I was asked what might have caused the bites and why shed been bitten there. Since Id already talked about the writhing tubes of muscle that had bored through her body to cause the other scars, Id mentioned those things didnt have any teeth. So I said I didnt know. But they were definitely bites. I got closer to my friend and stared. Lines created by what had to have been rows of tiny, terrifyingly-sharp teeth ringed each barely-healed gouge. 

In my head, my friend spoke. *When you turn around, please dont be scared - it isnt strong enough yet.* With galvanizing force which nearly knocked me off the beanbag chair, I whirled back to face Dr. Jessica. As the doctor asked if I was all right, I stared at the area by the door. I did my absolute best to remain calm and informed Dr. Jessica that no, I didnt think I was okay. 

On walls and ceiling behind the doctor, was...something. It wasnt a person or an animal or a plant or even those bleeding, fleshless serpents. Until that moment, I never thought Id prefer seeing a writhing mass of those awful, murderous coils. But this time I did. My mind filled with the voice of the black woman telling me we were safe. Its all that kept me from screaming.

My voice shook as I told Dr. Jessica about the monster. It reminded me of the scab that grew on my kneecap when I took a nasty spill while dad was teaching me how to ride a two-wheeler. In the hours and days after the fall, the cut dried in patches of red and yellow and white. It itched. Yellowish lymphatic fluid dribbled out the side of the dried parts when I scratched too hard. The atrocity by the door looked like that scab, only without the dry encrustations. This thing was wet. And thick. The cheery sunlight pouring through the large windows cast its rays on the thing, causing it to glisten and reflect sickening, amorphous patches of pink light onto the white walls around it. It moved, well, oozed, outward in all directions. I was vaguely reminded of the underside of my tongue; slick, veiny, and muscular. 

I glanced back at Dr. Jessica as I described what I saw. She was writing furiously in her yellow notebook. Only when I gasped did she look up. Pulsating slits of swollen flesh split open over the entire surface of the creature. From the slits came thin tubes that reminded me of skinny versions of the serpentine coils from the other days, but these had round, bulbous tips on their front end. They looked like the eye stalks snails have, only veiny and muscular and dribbling blood and other, unnamable fluids. They extended further and further from the main body, slithering around the room and twisting through the air. 

One slid through the back of Dr. Jessicas head and exited via her mouth. I told her what was happening. She asked me something, her voice unobstructed by the ghostly flesh impaling her skull. I didnt answer. While she spoke, the thick head of flesh capping the end of the tendril opened to reveal countless rows of tiny, impossibly sharp spikes. More and more of them gathered around me, all opening to threaten with their translucent, yellow teeth. I started to cry as I realized Id wet my pants. The toothed bulbs leapt toward me and I fell backward over the beanbag chair in terror. I landed on my back between the feet of the black woman. She stared downward with her confident glare. Its gone, she informed me. 

Dr. Jessica was on her feet helping me up within seconds of my fall. My friend was right: the thing had disappeared. The doctor hugged me, then put her hands on my shoulders, looked into my eyes, and said shed page my parents to bring me back to my room. She told me it was okay to end early on the first session. She was proud of the great work I did. I concentrated on her mouth as it formed her words. A ring of angry, chapped skin had developed around her lips. It wasnt there when our session started. I pictured the fat-headed tendril pushing through her mouth. Shed been hurt.

The speed of my breathing increased and I pointed out the injury. She looked puzzled as she traced the cracked, dessicated flesh with the tip of her finger and winced when the left corner split and produced a droplet of blood. The look of confusion only lasted a moment. She tried to reassure me by saying itd been like that all day. All the talking mustve worn away her makeup or shed rubbed it away with her hand. But I didnt believe her. And she seemed shaken. She tousled my hair and hid my stained pants with an apron used by other kids who painted during their own therapy sessions. 

My parents came moments after theyd been told I was done, and after they spoke to the doctor, the four of us walked back to my hospital room. I kept thinking about Dr. Jessicas mouth. On our way, I saw tubes of wriggling muscle dangling from the ceiling. Again, the black woman let me know it was okay. She strode with authority down the hallway, never leaving my side. As we passed the writhing creatures, they decayed into smoldering ashes. I smiled. Dad noticed. He asked if I felt better. I told him I did. Mom let me know Id be starting some type of medicine with my dinner later in the day. My smile broadened. Between my friend and the medicine, things were going to go back to normal. Still, what I was told the night before chilled me. *This will get much, much worse for you soon.* 

The grin slipped from my face as the density of the creatures increased and the black woman wasnt burning them all. Maybe she couldnt. But maybe she didnt need to. I forced myself to believe things were moving in a positive direction. As we walked by a reception area riddled with intestinal endpoints gouting thick, bloody foam into pustulent craters on the floor, my friend reached down and held my hand. I was overcome with surprise and joy. I could finally touch her. Her palm was warm and muscular. Safe. My dad saw my hand reaching upward and he took it in his own. I was beaming. Dad smiled to himself with contentment. Hed been waiting for days to feel like he could comfort me.

	<TEXT> [Part 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/3wezdz/i_was_diagnosed_with_childhood_schizophrenia/)

The nights leading to my first encounter with Dr. Jessica were spent sleeping in my parents room. I couldn't stay in my own. Whenever I went back, I was greeted by the sight of the black womans ruined body. It looked like the creatures had taken away the parts they needed, but what they left was hideous: tendons and gristle and fat stuck deep inside the recesses of her skeleton. The one time I ran in to grab a shirt for school, I saw one of the things curled up inside her splintered rib cage. When it noticed me, it uncoiled itself and rose like a cobra until it reached my height; a tube of glistening muscle as thick as my thigh standing at attention as I rushed to get the shirt. I stifled a sob when I saw how much bigger it was than the others Id encountered. 


The death of my friend, or my episode, as my parents called it, was on a Saturday. I was allowed to stay home from school on Monday, but Tuesday and Wednesday were business as usual. I was happy for this; I loved school. My teachers enjoyed me, I had a couple friends, and I always got good grades. I was scheduled to meet with the school psychologist on Friday, and I was looking forward to whatever help he might be able to provide. On Thursday morning, though, something happened.

Dad and I had just finished breakfast at the diner and he was bringing me to school. I was looking out the window, still half asleep. It was a cloudy spring morning. The weather people on the radio had predicted thunderstorms, and, for once, their forecast was accurate. A bolt of lightning lit up the sky. As I traced the jagged path, I noticed something weird. The edges of the bolt looked fuzzy, almost like the lightning was covered in windblown fur. The bolt was too far away for me to see anything clearly, so I just chalked it up to being overtired. Id barely slept since Friday night.

In class, about halfway through a day like any other, the storm that had been threatening us the whole morning finally came. Now, this was southern Florida, so were used to thunder and lightning. But this one was abnormally strong for the time of year. Even in the summer, it wouldve been one the jaded locals wouldve commented on. Torrential rain started, followed by small hail. Then came the lightning. It was very, very close. In his calm voice, Mr. Davis asked the students sitting in the row nearest the windows to sit in seats closer to the middle of the room.

I was sitting on the other side of the classroom when lightning struck a tree across the soccer field. The explosion of thunder was instantaneous and a couple kids gasped. Even Mr. Davis jumped a little. But those reactions were only on the periphery of my attention. At the forefront was the bolt of lightning. When it struck the tree, I saw the furry edges again, but with much greater clarity. From this distance, I could make out individual hairs of the fur. Not fur, I realized, but those vile creatures. Countless, seething tendrils of raw muscle writhing around the edges of the bluish-white plasma. As the bolt faded, so did the things. Every flash which followed had the same edges. I felt panic rising in my chest and I excused myself to the restroom.

I sat in the stall and worked to control my breathing. The fragility of my mindstate had me on the verge of crying. I rested my head in my hands and tried to stifle my emotions. The collisions of heavy raindrops on the metal roof of the school seemed to mock my attempt, so I let it happen. Hot tears drooled from my brown eyes and puddled silently on the bleached tile floor. I pressed my hands into my eyes and concentrated on the fireworks display of meaningless, organic shapes. When my breathing slowed and the tears stopped flowing, I opened my eyes and stood up. I left the stall, turned the corner, and went to the mirror. I stopped breathing.

Everything that would normally be reflected was there, except it was blanketed in gore. Not just blood, but hair and veins and patches of skin. Stretching through the room like perverse pneumatic tubes were thick ropes of intestine. Bulging things traveled inside them and disappeared into the walls and floor where the ropes were anchored. 

I whirled around and was greeted by the usual, untainted view. Another kid, Luis, was just coming in. He greeted me with a smile, but upon seeing my pale, tear-streaked face, he furrowed his brow in concern and asked if I was okay. I turned back around and looked in the mirror. Luis was standing in the same spot, but he was grotesquely deformed. One eye socket was stretched into an abyssal caldera from which the creatures poured their endless lengths onto a floor carpeted in patches of cracked, eczematous skin. Both arms were whittled down to gleaming white bone and his viscera was tied into the intestinal transitway that stretched the room. I passed out.

Apparently when I was unconscious, part of me was awake -- and all that part did was yell. I screamed about snakes made of meat and theyre coming out of the lightning and someone help Luis. When I woke up, I was in the hospital. Both my parents were next to me. Both, it appeared, had been crying. My face hurt and I tried to raise my hands to my cheeks but my arms were strapped down. Legs, too. I struggled but mom came over and put her soft hand on my forehead. 

Its just to make sure youre safe, she whispered, you scratched your face up pretty badly when you were asleep. I wrinkled my cheeks and winced when I felt the swollen skin bunch up near the scrapes. I didnt say anything. After a little while, a woman who called herself Dr. Jessica came in and sat down next to the bed. She asked me a few, basic questions. My name, my age, my favorite food; I figured she wanted to get to know me. Then she asked if I would be comfortable if my parents left so we could have some privacy. I looked at them and they nodded to say it was okay, so I agreed. They went out in the hall.

Dr. Jessica wanted to know what happened today and on Saturday. I told her everything. She had a warm, supportive look on her face as I gave all the details. I worried that shed laugh and call me crazy, but she never did. She even told me how sorry she was that the black woman had passed away. I liked Dr. Jessica. I asked what was wrong with me, and I was told, Sometimes kids see things that other people dont. It doesnt mean theyre bad or broken or anything like that, it just means they might need some medicine to help them from seeing more scary things.

I nodded, then I asked if I could have that medicine. She said maybe, but shed have to talk to my parents about it first. After a few more questions, she pressed a button near the bed and told the nurse it was okay to undo the straps on my arms and legs. Once that was done, Dr. Jessica told me Id have to stay in the hospital for a couple days, but shed see me the next morning. Then she gave me a hug and left to talk to my parents outside.

As I cautiously touched the scratches on my face and neck, I watched my parents and Dr. Jessica talking through the glass. Mom wiped her eyes a few times, but they both looked like they appreciated what the doctor was doing. Dad peeked his head through the door, asked me if I was okay, and then said he and mom and the doctor had to go down the hall to fill out some paperwork. If I needed them, he told me to push the red button next to the bed. I said okay.

The room was quiet. A small, wall-mounted television displayed a baseball game without any sound. I sighed and wondered if I was crazy. Id never heard of these things happening to anyone else. None of my friends were ever in the hospital except for Pat when he broke his leg. But that was different. Im different. I rubbed my eyes, being careful not to reopen any of the scratches on my face. The familiar fireworks display behind my eyelids greeted me as I modulated the pressure. When I stopped and I opened my eyes, the room was blurry. I blinked to get everything back into focus. 

Standing at foot of my bed, towering over all the furniture in the room, was the black woman. I gasped with surprise and felt a rush of delight until I saw her disfigurements. Heavy, keloid scars rose like scraps of gray leather across the totality of her flesh. Her left breast was gone; in its place was a crater of gnarled tissue. Thin, strong forearms were crossed over her belly, but behind them were unhealed gashes. This woman, my friend, despite being alive through some miracle, was in pain. Agony. Still, hidden within the benthic depths of her eyes was the protective warmth and powerful confidence Id grown to cherish. She turned her head to look outside. It was raining again. Lightning streaked by, its edges squirming with coils of hellish flesh. The sound of her voice filled my mind. 

My parents entered the room and sat in nearby chairs. Mom was closest to me while dad was by the bottom of the bed. Of course, they didnt see the woman. She remained at her post, watching everything. They spoke to me about the medication Id be starting tomorrow and the scheduled therapy sessions with Dr. Jessica, and although I heard them talking to me off in the distance, it wasnt what I focused on. Because now, for the first time, I could understand exactly what the black woman spoke into my head. No more syllables and formants carrying vague, emotional cues. This was a statement. A warning.

*This will get much, much worse for you soon -- and Im so very sorry.*

I started to weep and my parents did their best to comfort me. I didnt say anything to them. What was there to say? They wouldnt believe a word of it. Mom stroked my hair and dad put his right hand on moms shoulder and reached over to hold my ankle with his left. The whisper of gentle rainfall filled the room, occasionally interrupted by my desperate whimpering. A single, massive tear slid from the glistening corner of the black womans right eye and landed on my fathers index finger. Dad glanced at the ceiling with confused annoyance and wiped his hand on the blanket.

	<TEXT> I was six when the lady appeared in my room for the first time. She stood next to my bed and watched me. When I saw her, I was understandably surprised. Shocked, even. But, for whatever reason, I wasnt scared. I found something about her to be deeply comforting. She was black, but not like Mr. Davis, my teacher at the time, or like moms friends Darryl and Shevaun. She was black like I never had seen before; light seemed to disappear into her flawless skin. 

We gazed at one another for a minute or two, then I trotted over to my parents room and announced, theres a naked lady in my bedroom. Mom snorted out a poorly-stifled laugh and dad told me to come over, gave me a high-five, and instructed me to go back to bed. I obeyed. Before I pulled the covers up, I reached out to poke the womans knee. My finger slipped through as if she weren't there. I slept as she stared down at me.

In the morning light, I could see her somewhat better, even though she still seemed to embody night itself. She was tremendously tall; nearly brushing the ceiling with her lush hair. And her eyes, as black as the obsidian face in which they sat, had no sclerae, no irises, and no discernable pupils. Twin voids. Her teeth, too, were equally dark, and it wasnt until the light caught the sheen of saliva coating them that I knew she had any teeth at all. 

Days went by and my parents entered and exited my room for various reasons without ever seeing her. If they needed something over where she stood, they simply passed right through as if she were a hologram. I often mentioned her to them, only to get predictable responses. They told me they were happy I had an imaginary friend. Dad revealed he had one when he was my age, too. Not a naked lady, though, he added, winking at me. Mom rolled her eyes and tried not to laugh. I didnt know why they thought it was funny.

Beginning the night she appeared, the black woman would talk to me. Id never see her mouth move and I dont think I actually heard her truly say anything, but I still knew she was communicating with me. Whenever Id have a hard time sleeping, shed even sing. I didnt know what the words were, or even if they were words at all. But within minutes, Id be dreaming. In my dreams, Id hear her whispering. Syllables and formants; nothing I could understand, let alone repeat. Still, the sounds made me feel stronger. More attuned to the world around me. And throughout, all I felt was warmth and serenity. I knew she loved me.

Two nights after my seventh birthday, my parents were out with Darryl and Shevaun. Our neighbor, Laura, was babysitting. At one point, Laura dragged the telephone out onto the porch to make a call, leaving me in the living room to watch TV. I didnt mind. I liked Laura and she was a great babysitter. She always ordered us Chinese food. 

She was on the phone for a long time. I got up to get another bowl of fried rice, but as I was walking down the hall, wriggling tubes of what looked like raw, bloody muscle spontaneously sprouted from the hardwood floor. I stopped in my tracks. They pushed upward until they were nearly a foot tall. After a few seconds, they all pointed toward me. Terrified, I did my best to jump over them but I landed right inside the thicket of meaty tendrils. They tried to grasp my legs, but instead moved through my limbs like ghosts. Now in a frenzy, they whipped and slashed through the air, slapping against the floor and spraying crimson blood all over the walls and ceiling. 

I screamed. Laura heard me and sprinted to my location. She grabbed me and checked for injuries. Then she held me as I sobbed. While I was in her arms, I watched more fleshy tentacles burst from the floor around us. Laura was oblivious to what I saw, and she begged me to tell her what was wrong. This time, they left me alone. Instead, they moved to Laura, wrapping around the space she occupied until all I saw was a Laura-shaped, gore-drenched monstrosity that embraced me and promised that everything was okay. The room spun and I vomited all over myself, her, and the floor. The things disappeared.

Laura washed me and the floor and then changed into one of moms shirts. She called the restaurant where my parents said they could be reached in an emergency. While I waited on the couch for them to come home, I saw serpentine undulations right below the surfaces of the walls, ceiling, and floor. When my parents returned, Laura told them what happened. After paying her and apologizing for all the puke, they wanted to hear my side of the story. I told them. 

As expected, they didnt believe a word of it. Still, they recognized the fact Id been traumatized. They believed that *I* believed what happened. As I calmed down and my more acute memories of the writhing atrocities began to fade, they asked me if Id be okay with sharing what I saw with a doctor who might be able to help. I agreed quickly; I wanted nothing more than to never see those things again.

They carried me to my bed and, at my insistence, left the light on. The black woman was there, watching me, as I curled into a ball under my blankets. I drifted to sleep with the sounds of her reassurances and soft, incomprehensible singing.

I awoke near dawn to the sight of her devastated body. She was riddled with gaping holes the same width as the creatures Id seen the night before. Her belly had been torn open, exposing pink and yellow viscera which contrasted obscenely against her dark flesh. The eyes which once watched over me had been forced from her skull. I howled with ferocious desperation. The howl turned into a scream which turned into uncontrollable crying. My parents ran toward the sounds of my agony and swept me in their arms, frantically trying to find out what was wrong. I couldnt speak. As the sky brightened and parents tried to comfort a mourning son, I watched through my tears as the creatures silently grew out of the floor and began to pick more flesh from the corpse.

	<TEXT> The Future Queen erupted from Her mother and left behind a devastated pelvic caldera. Perfect teeth gnawed through the umbilicus, severing Her connection to the worthless container. Throughout the world, cancers began inexorable metastases in testicles and breasts and bones. Perceiving all; feeling all; The Future Queen stood and gazed at the assembled mass of venerators.

Nourish me, She instructed; Her neonate voice still commanding and seductive.

The venerators of The Future Queen chewed flesh from their bodies. In the watchful rapacity of Her ravenous glare, hundreds of mouths worked thousands of teeth. Walking forward, the venerators drooled the pulp of nourishment down Her throat. She grew. Within minutes of Her birth, She began to excoriate, flay, and consume the venerators without assistance. Their bodies disappeared into Her own while Her metabolism radiated heat and Her sweat evaporated in billows of scalding steam.

The last living venerator wept with awe; the only form of obeisance of which the wreckage of his body was capable. He peered upward at the form of The Future Queen; an infant in an adolescent body. The steam pouring from Her caused his flesh to bubble and slough from its bones. His last image of this world was The Future Queen squatting to devour that which he had grown for Her. 

Nourished and left to machinate, The Future Queen devised strategies to ensure her ascension. Hers were strategies of disintegration. Strategies contra structure; contra organization; contra form. Strategies which unfold at the collapse of empirical epistemology. At the end, in the creeping cold of total entropy, The Future Queen antithesized creation. The death of all stars would begin Her reign. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Wed been snooping around on Russian networks after Alexei learned about an unpatched firmware exploit in some older Cisco boxes. It turns out quite a few science labs over there still use that equipment. Lots of what we saw was boring. I dont read a word of Russian, and Im deaf so I cant understand it spoken, either, but Alexei signed that it was all climate change data, petrochemical exploration, and something about water desalination. We were discouraged; wed hoped to find something related to aliens and nuclear weapons. 

Right before we were about to call it a night, Alexei noticed one of the labs wed been traversing had an IP camera broadcasting to other addresses on the network. We couldnt believe how insecure these internal networks were. I clicked over to the camera and was delighted when a clear picture came up. There was even an icon in the corner telling me it was broadcasting sound. Alex indicated that hed sign any audio that came through.

Onscreen, a naked man sat on a wooden chair in a brightly-lit room. He was reading a book.

He flinched in momentary surprise when a deep voice came from the speaker in the camera. I felt it the volume of it in my chest from the subwoofer of Alexeis computer. Alex signed what was said: Go ahead, Pavel. Yaroslav, please stay seated. 

The screen flickered for a second, then nothing happened for a full five minutes. We thought something might have gone wrong with the video, but we saw Yaroslav flipping the pages of his book as he read. Then tiny trickles of blood began to ooze from his ears. Before he could react, his face burst. Three foot stalactites of jagged bone exploded outward from the front of his skull. He didnt move for a moment. One eye dangled from its tattered optic nerve while the other, still intact, blinked over and over. His mouth was nothing more than shredded meat and pulped gums. A trifurcated tongue writhed and slapped against the spikes of bone like rudimentary tentacles. Finally dropping his book, he stood up on unsteady legs, his hands reaching to touch the obscene growths. He pushed on them, gently at first, then harder. His head moved with the force. 

That voice again. Alexei shook as he signed for me: Keep running the 270 and introduce a 272 harmonic. Then raise the amplitude of the 272 until I tell you to stop.

More spikes bloomed - this time from Yaroslavs feet, shins, and calves. The flesh disintegrated and what remained below his knees were roughly spherical dandelion heads of jagged, ossified quills. He stumbled and fell face first, the bones jutting from his face arresting his fall, momentarily catching him. He teetered, then went down. 

You can turn it off, Pavel.

The screen flickered again. A man wearing heavy-duty ear protection entered the frame and walked toward the writhing form of Yaroslav.

Then our connection to the network died. 

Alexei and I stared at the terminal which had replaced the video stream. We stared for a while. What was that?, I signed. My throat felt lined with sandpaper and my stomach lurched with dread. Alex shook his head. A line of red about as thick as a human hair slipped out of his left ear. His eyes widened and his face disappeared as jagged, gray blades erupted from the front and back of his head. He collapsed on the ground. 

I panicked and ran home. That same night, maybe an hour or two later, his apartment building exploded from what was officially called a gas leak. The newspaper said 17 people died from the blast and subsequent fire. Alexei was listed among the dead. Now its been three days and I dont know what to do. I cant go to the police because I cant dispute the official story and potentially implicate myself. Plus, someone is making a concerted effort to lie about the cause of his death. They were willing to murder 16 innocent people to cover it up. What will they do to me? Im too afraid to leave my apartment and I know posting this is going to get their attention, but Im terrified and helpless. I need to know what to do. I need to escape but I have no money to go anywhere. Help me. Please.

	<TEXT> I didnt understand. I had those floaty things. My teacher said everyone did. An artifact of our eyes developing, or something like that. I guess hed been told the same thing, but it did him little good. His parents were concerned, of course, and they brought him to ophthalmologists who were all in agreement: his eyes were fine. When he denied the experts claims and doubled down on his insistence that something was wrong, his worried parents got him into therapy.

I guess the therapist helped him a little bit. Malcolms paranoia seemed to diminish somewhat and his anxious habits like twitching and blinking werent as pronounced. That was good - a lot of kids made fun of the way he blinked. He told me it helped push the things out of sight for a couple seconds.

From what I can remember, Malcolm started seeing the therapist when he was 7 or 8. I thought things were going pretty well until he turned 14. I dont know if it was the combination of his underlying problems combined with the hormonal onslaught of puberty, but his anxiety and paranoia returned with a vengeance. He started getting into fights at school whenever someone made fun of him. His mom confided in me, since I was his best friend, that she saw cuts and scratches on his upper arms when she accidentally walked in on him getting changed. She was at her wits end with worry and implored me to do whatever I could to help him feel better.

Over time, I worked to evolve my role in his life from friend to confidant. It was easier than I thought. He was used to telling me about his problems. Apparently, aside from his parents and the doctors, I was the only one who knew about his fear of the floaty things. When I asked him about those, he started to cry. He was worried he was schizophrenic; his therapist mentioned the possibility and it terrified him. Those things were always, *always* present in his field of vision. And while they were there, they talked to him. Goaded him into self-destructive behavior. All he could do to stop himself from going crazy was to obey them and make the little cuts on his arms and legs.

He showed me the cuts. They werent deep, but there were a lot of them. Especially on his inner thighs. Being 14 myself and not understanding why someone, anyone, would cut themselves, I tried to get him to explain why he couldnt just stop. All he said was, Im giving them what they ask for so theyll stop biting. Before I was able to question what the hell he meant, he kissed me. 

I wasnt prepared that. Id never been kissed before. I didnt think I was gay, but I wasnt particularly interested in girls, either. I kissed him back. And that was it. Whatever it meant to him, Ill never know for sure. I knew he was dealing with intense turmoil. More than I could handle. But hed just shown how much he trusts me. He showed me the cuts, knowing I might run away in disgust. He kissed me, knowing I might knock his teeth out. He was trying so hard to overcome whatever was consuming him, and I wasnt going to let him down. I had to be there for him.

Something like a year passed and Malcolm just got worse. He skipped a lot of school and was even hospitalized when he had some kind of breakdown in the supermarket with his mom about a week before summer vacation. Despite my desire to see him in the hospital and give whatever comfort I could provide, he turned me away. Once he was released, on the infrequent occasions he agreed to meet up with me, he looked awful. His dark brown complexion was tinged with gray. He was emaciated and his arms were covered in cuts. They were deeper now; he didnt even bother hiding them. They grew up his wrists onto his forearms and biceps and triceps like angry, scabbed ivy. I pitied him.

The day after Christmas, he asked me to visit him at home. His parents were overjoyed by the fact hed not only initiated the contact, but that he talked openly about how excited he was to give me a present. They thought he might have finally turned the corner.

I walked up the stairs to his bedroom, knocked, and was greeted by something unexpected: his smiling face. He hugged me and had me come in. He handed me an envelope and watched with excitement as I opened it. Inside was an illustration hed done in the hospital depicting the two of us holding hands. I cant thank you enough for all the support youve given me, he whispered, as tears welled up in his eyes.

I beamed at him as he smiled back, the tears now flowing freely over his sharp cheekbones. In what had to be the space of two seconds, he produced a small knife from his back pocket, and, without looking away from me, stabbed through each of his eyes. The only scream that filled the room and echoed throughout the house was my own. Malcolm sat back, the bed directly behind him, and put his head in his hands. As blood drooled from his punctured eyes and seeped into the carpet, he wept. 

His parents arrived in his bedroom seconds after my scream and gasped in horror at the damage to their son. He moved his head up and faced the direction where he assumed his parents were standing. I had to, he sobbed, over and over, tears pouring from his undamaged lacrimal glands and diluting the stream of blood flowing down his face. 

His father ran to call 911 while his mother wrapped her arms around him, not knowing if she should press something against his bleeding eyes or if that would only make it worse. The bleeding was slowing down to a trickle, though. The first few times he moved his head in my direction, I diverted my eyes, foolishly not wanting to meet his sightless gaze. But, as the moments passed and we waited for the ambulance, I studied his face. He looked calm. Soon, he started to smile; a beatific, worryless grin that was in frightening contrast to the gore only inches above it. 

Watch, he mouthed at me. As I stared, tiny lines began to appear in the blood around his eyes. The lines looked like tracks, only I couldnt see what was making them. His mom noticed what was happening and jumped back in surprise. The tracks poured from his ruined eyes and traced clean lines down his dark cheeks. I told you, he sighed. He tilted his neck downward and shook his head. When he faced forward again, no new tracks were being carved out of the blood. Malcolm ground his sneaker into the rug where hed been facing. Please hold my hand, he begged, reaching in the direction of where I stood. I did.

The ambulance arrived and rushed Malcolm to the hospital. I didnt see him again for a long time. After recovering from the surgery to remove his eyes, he was admitted to a psychiatric hospital where he stayed for 18 months. His parents called me a few times early on to let me know how he was doing, and the general consensus was that he seemed a lot better. Yes, he was blind. But he didnt exhibit the paranoia anymore. He didnt try to injure himself. He slept through the nights. 

I was glad to hear the positive updates, but I was deeply shaken by what I saw that day. Not just Malcolms violence toward himself, but the aftermath: the streaked tracks across his bloody face. I never spoke about it with his mother. Even today, its something I try to convince myself was a false memory brought on by the trauma of seeing someone I cared for harmed so badly. But I know better.

It was four years before I saw Malcolm again. I visited his house, again around Christmas, because it was the break between my semesters at college. He looked great. The glass eyes he had were eerily lifelike. Hed put on some weight, but he appeared healthy and happy. His parents left us alone to talk. For a couple hours, we chatted about what wed been up to. When it was time for me to go, I pulled him in for an embrace, which he returned with enthusiasm. I wanted your face to be the last thing Id ever see, he whispered. Your smile gave me the courage I needed to make myself a better person. I stared straight ahead into the kitchen, not knowing how to respond. Those floaty things drifted through my vision, contrasting strongly against the white-painted wall. I hugged him tighter.

	<TITLE> I found a diary while I was out hiking in New Hampshire. I have to admit, Im thoroughly creeped out by what was written inside. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-03 19:07:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The diary was from a while ago; 21 years, according to the dates. It was sealed really well in plastic wrap and stuffed in a watertight bag. If I hadnt hit the thing with my shovel when digging a hole to take a dump, I never wouldve found it. I wish that wouldve been the case because I cant stop thinking about the stuff I read. Im only going to share the fucked up parts, but all Im leaving out is the lady talking about how she and her husband were spending the month camping and having a good time. There, I just saved you 5 pages. Heres where it got weird:

-------------------------------------------------------------

*7/2/1994, 7:00am*

Last night, James and I got woken up by a ridiculously bright flash of lightning. There was no thunder, either. James said it mustve been heat lightning. Hes probably right because it was disgustingly hot and muggy all day and once the sun went down it got even more humid. We eventually got back to sleep and this morning the air seems a little less like a wet sponge. Were hoping to do 12 miles today.

*7/2/1994, 8:00pm*

I dont even want to write this down because its so gross. James asked that I do it anyway so well remember to report what we saw once we get to a ranger station. Like I could forget something like this. Anyway, here: all day, while we walked, we saw animals. Deer, birds, raccoons, squirrels, chipmunks, and a black bear. Thats pretty par for the course out here. But when we went off the path for a little bit because, well, James was staring at my ass for the last hour while we walked and I guess he got some ideas, we were stopped by the sight of something awful about a hundred feet off the path. Well, many somethings. Strewn across a wide area that I estimated to be a couple thousand feet were miscarried animals. They were all at different stages of development. It was horrible.

*7/3/1994, 2:45am*

Im not able to sleep after the events of yesterday. James, of course, is snoring like a buzzsaw despite the big flashlight lighting the tent up. What the hell couldve caused something like that to happen? Ive heard about animals going to find a safe place to die when theyre sick or old, but Ill be damned if something like what we saw is in any way normal.

That heat lightning just happened again. This time it was three flashes clustered together within a couple seconds. No thunder. Fuck thats creepy. James is mad that I just kicked him to wake him up and tell him about it. Sorry hon.   

*7/3/1994, 7:30am*

I got to sleep about an hour after the lightning. Thank God we brought some good coffee to brew over the fire. Were going to do 10 miles, although it might be a little less because the map says were getting into a pretty hilly area. Good for the glutes!

*7/3/1994, 9:15pm*

Pretty good walk today. Were both going to be sore tomorrow, though. The map does a decent enough job telling us where the hills are going to be, but its shitty at indicating how steep they are. On the bright side, and I never thought Id be at a point in my life where this sentence would make sense, we didnt see any more fields full of animal fetuses. Whee.

*7/4/1994, 6:10am*

My dickhead husband smuggled some fireworks in his pack and decided to wake me up by setting them off right outside the tent while screaming, Happy 4th of July! Of course he was naked as he did all this and was presenting himself to me through the tent flap while holding a sparkler in each hand. Ive come to the conclusion that I love his sense of humor between 8am and midnight, and anything from 12:01am until 7:59am makes me want to choke him. Waking up to explosions and his dick and balls is not quite how I envisioned our mornings together. Take away the explosions part, though, and Im pretty okay with it.

It looks like its going to rain today. The clouds are low in the sky and its pretty breezy. Gusty, too. The rain gear we bought before we started our hike kept us dry during the storms last week, though, so Im not too bummed out about it.

*7/4/1994, 6:30pm*

No rain while we walked. James shot a rabbit an hour ago and hes about to skin it and get it ready for the fire. Hes making me learn how to do it, too. Its pretty much the last thing I want to do, but theres no reason why he should have to be stuck with the job every time we want to eat some cute forest critter. Ugh. Here we go.

*7/4/1994, 7:30pm*

I just finished throwing up. As soon James started working on the rabbit, we saw how sick it mustve been while it was alive. Again, Im only going into detail so we can report it at the ranger station, but for fucks sake James, if I have to learn how to skin a rabbit you can learn how to write clear, descriptive sentences. Thats a fight for another day. Under its fur, the rabbit was absolutely covered in what looked like big whitehead zits. They were under a lot of pressure, too, because when James poked one with the tip of the knife it burst and flung grayish white pus like 10 feet and onto the tip of my shoe. Cue me throwing up for a half hour while he apologized and tried not to laugh.
We still have a good amount of beef jerky and stuff in the food pack, so its not like were going to go hungry, but it wouldve been nice to have something a little different. The rain finally started and were stuck in the tent.

And heres the lightning again. Its flashing over and over and over. Sometimes its a few quick bursts, others its just single ones that last upwards of 4 or 5 seconds. Its those long ones that scare the shit out of me. Ive never seen lightning like that before. James keeps telling me its unusual but not unheard of, especially at this time of the year. It appears to be tapering off a little now, and Im pretty glad it coincided with rain this time. I guess it really is just plain lightning. James is a pretty reassuring guy. Early bed time.

*7/5/1994, 10:10am*

Im freaking out because James is trying hard not to freak out. Weve been up since 6 and when we opened the tent the ground outside was covered in dead birds, dead bats, and dead bugs. And I mean covered. I guess we didnt hear them hitting the ground because of the rain that started up again while we slept, but we still have no explanation as to why theyre all fucking dead. Thats not the worst part, though. Theyre ALL covered with those zit things like the rabbit. 
Were deciding to cut the trip short and get the fuck out of here. The map says theres a ranger station about 40 miles to our west, and James said we can get there by tomorrow afternoon if we really move. Both of us are at the point where really moving sounds like a great plan.

*7/6/1994, 12:30am*

We walked fast and we walked far. The whole way, we saw dead animals. They werent as tightly clustered together as they were around our tent, but we still saw a lot. I remember walking under a tree where the ground was littered with dead wasps. When I looked up, there was a huge nest with nothing flying around it. The forest is almost silent, too. No birds. Only insects. And even their sounds are few and far between. I never realized how omnipresent their din was until it was nearly gone.

Fuck. Just a minute ago, the first live deer wed seen in all day walked into the lit area around our tent. It stared at us for a while on the outskirts of where the light fell, and when it turned around, I saw a dead fawn hanging halfway out of her body. As the deer trotted away, the fawn slid out and hit the ground with a wet thump, still connected to its mother by a tangle of afterbirth that stretched until it, too, slid out a few feet later. Fuck everything. Good luck trying to sleep tonight, Mel.

Okay something just happened while we were sleeping and I am freaking the fuck out and can barely breathe and I dont know what to do other than write it down to make it make sense. The lightning came and just...stayed. The whole forest was lit up. James and I tried to convince each other it was just the weather. But it stayed lit for a whole minute. Then two. I begged James not to go outside but he unzipped the tent and went out. I panicked and didnt want to be alone so I followed him and the entire sky, not just one area where lightning might be, was white. Brighter than the sun at noon. It hurt my eyes really bad to look at and James was squinting hard, too. I squeezed my eyes shut to recover a little and when I reopened them, he was gone. I ran around and looked and didnt see him until I turned back around and he was right there again, staring at the sky. Except, he was...wrong.

He didnt answer me when I screamed his name. He didnt even blink. And I could see bumps starting to form on his neck and face. The light was so, so bright. I pushed James to try to get his attention and when I did the area under his shirt where I pushed got soaked with something. Well I know what it was but I couldnt look. I couldnt. I cant. He is still outside and hes not moving. Just standing and staring at the terribly bright sky. His pupils are gone and all thats left is the blue and white. Hes different. Hes wrong. His skin is getting worse. And I am fucking terrified.

Little bumps are popping up on my hands while I write this and theyre coming to a head and now one of them just broke open and thats my blood on the page. I know the wetness I feel on my thighs is blood, too. Blood signifying the end of what Id been waiting to tell James on our anniversary next week. I keep thinking about the dead fawn sliding out of its mother.

Im going to wrap this journal up in a bag and run in the direction of the ranger station. I dont know what else to do. Ill leave it under a tree or in some safe spot right off the trail so someone can find it if something happens to me on the way. This page is soaked through now. I have to go before I get worse. Before James gets worse. The light is so bright.

-------------------------------------------------------------

And thats what was in the diary. As soon as I read it and typed out what was inside, I mailed it to the CDC because I have no fucking idea what was wrong with that lady and her husband and I sure as hell dont want to catch anything. That last page she wrote on was disgusting. I wish Id been wearing gloves when I touched it. It was encrusted with dried stuff, probably that pus she wrote about, and it smelled awful. I washed up real good and left a note for the CDC guys to be careful with it.

Im pretty reluctant to go back in those woods again, but Im just being stupid. I bet the whole thing was a prank by some high school assholes and Im going to waste the time of some pretty important guys when they get what I mailed over. Still, Im more than a little creeped out. Everything that lady wrote about is just so far-fetched. But I still wonder. I wonder because I vaguely remember hearing about some massive animal die-off back in that part of the state in the mid 90s. It was probably something else though. It had to be.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wont give a long backstory because it doesnt matter. Basically, he got the job through a former schoolmate of his who worked in some mid-level Party position. Dad was down on his luck at the time and Egor happened to see him at a local tavern. They got to talking, and Egor pulled some strings and gave him the position. Didnt matter that he wasnt qualified. Half the guys arent, he was told.

Anyway, dad started working there in 1984 and did a pretty good job. He did what he was told; most of it was just checking dial readouts and making sure pipes were sealed and whatnot. In late 1985 and early 1986, he started noticing far more Party representatives coming in and out of the plant. Usually the visits were limited to compliance officers and hazardous materials supervisors when radioactive material was moved in or out. But these werent plant specialists. They looked like they were Politburo. He told me he recognized a couple of them from televised speeches, but he didnt remember the names. He just knew they were high ranking.

On the night of the meltdown, Dad was doing his usual valve and dial checks when Politburo members, accompanied by soldiers with kalashnikovs, streamed down the hall toward the reactor area. The soldiers were wearing radiation suits. The Party members werent. He tagged along a few tens of meters away and went up on a high catwalk where he could see all of them. They crowded around the cooling pools. Dad made an effort to act as if he was staring at the pressure readouts in front of him, vaguely noticing they were rising as he watched.

This was around the point when the lights cut out. Apparently this wasnt abnormal for the plant; the electrical systems were under maintained and all the electricians on staff were tasked with more critical work. Even with the lights not working, Cherenkov radiation cast its characteristic blue glow over the group and illuminated the politicians and soldiers. The water in the pool started moving.

Now, dad wasnt a nuclear engineer. Still, he knew whatever was happening in the pool was abnormal. Hed been by the area plenty of times and never once did the water move like it did right then. It sloshed with turbidity and looked like it was coming to a rolling boil. He glanced at the dials in front of him and saw the temperature and pressure in the loop system was dramatically higher than it shouldve been. As he was beginning to sprint across the catwalk toward the nearest alarm station, he saw something that made him stop.

What he told me didnt make much sense at first. You have to figure someone running at a dead sprint to pull an emergency alarm at a nuclear power plant wouldnt stop for anything. But he stopped. And he stared. Something had floated to the top of the boiling water. The way he described it, it was dark, grayish red, almost shaped like a person, but much bigger and dreadfully deformed. It floated, facedown, in the pool. The Party members didnt react but the soldiers raised their rifles at the thing until one of the politicians barked an order at them to stand down.

A moment or two later, the thing crawled out of the pool and raised itself on thick legs to stand before the gathered crowd. What dad said he remembered most about the thing was its head. It sat directly on its lopsided shoulders and it had no eyes, no nose, no ears. All that was there was a gaping hole. Not even a mouth, but a hole. And inside, the same blue glow from the pool shone out onto the faces of the people surrounding it.

Someone else in the plant mustve noticed the temperature and pressure abnormalities and pulled the alarm, because sirens began to blare and diesel generators were galvanized into action to force the cooling cycle into overdrive. None of that mattered to dad, though. He said the thing approached the soldiers, one by one, and without any of them putting up a fight, it pressed the hole in its face against the top of each of their heads and they started to dissolve. First their suits melted, then their skin began to blister and char. The thing moved its maw downward until it nearly reached their legs, which dropped to the ground in a smoldering heap.

It then did the same to the assembled Politburo. All but one. She stood in the middle of a pile of steaming legs and hips and crotches and stared at the atrocity. Then, she screamed at it. Its something dad said hes repeated to himself every day since.    . *Salt the earth.* As the words left her mouth, the geiger counter dad was forced to carry with him at all times exploded into life at the same instant the politician burst into flames. He could swear she smiled as she burned.

All this was finally enough for dad to make a break for it. He knew hed been irradiated badly, but he took some solace in the fact the ticks from the counter slowed quickly as he left the pool area. Right before he was clear of the room, he took one last glimpse at the thing. It had begun to melt. As soon as its body began pouring through the metal grate, the water below erupted into a mass of superheated steam. Dad avoided being scalded to death by about half a second when he turned the corner and slammed the door behind him.

The rest of the meltdown played out more or less like it was eventually reported. Dad was able to get out before the main explosion. He lived with the profound guilt of running by his colleagues who still didnt know something truly catastrophic was about to happen. He believed his thyroid cancer was payback for his indifference toward them during his escape. 

The iconic photograph of the radioactive elephants foot in the basement of the power plant stood, framed, on his dresser for the rest of his life. As he told me this story, he confessed he kept it to remind him of the implications of the politician's words before she was devoured by flames. That thing will render the area around it uninhabitable for a hundred years, he sighed. And its melting through the ground, even today. If it hits groundwater, itll explode like a dirty bomb and make the disaster in 86 look like a firecracker. Russia, Europe, North Africa. All irradiated. 

He died a couple days after he shared his experience with me. I just have no idea what to do with it all. Obviously, he couldve made the whole thing up. But I dont know why he would. He doesnt have anything to gain now that hes dead. Maybe some of the other survivors or their kids can corroborate parts of what he said, maybe they cant. Either way, if its true, there is so much more going on with that disaster than weve been told. Even now, as that radioactive slag melts into the ground, dads story almost makes it sound like the meltdown was just a precursor to something far worse. Something plotted. Please, if anyone can give some advice or insight, it would be appreciated. I dont want what he told me to be true, but     terrifies me more than I can bear.

	<TITLE> The Purpose of Joy </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-25 20:05:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Stop eating,* came the seduction, *and I will nourish you.*

As the words drooled from its lips and puddled inside her ears, Joy began to change. She became less; the decrease in her mass was matched by the strangling of her vivacity. The Joy her friends knew dissolved into something cold. Interactions with her that once provided comforting warmth now left them furred with rime. They let her go.

Autumn vitrified into winter and Joy strode with mindless, impelled teleology on the legs of a newborn foal. True to the promise of her seducer, she was nourished. Her needs were met each night, all night, as she stared at the ceiling of her bedroom. Her eyes traced the shape floating above her. Traced the undulations under its skin. Traced the extrusion of its nourishment into her throat. Traced its lips forming the words:

*Give me a child and I will make you an angel.*

Joys asceticism evolved into sexual voraciousness. Her needs were met each night, all night, as she stared at the ceiling of her bedroom. Countless men poured themselves into her as her hips began to crack under relentless pressure. After many days, Joys body, reshaped by the nourishment of her seducer for selection and rejection, made its choice.

Fertilization begat blastulation; 

blastulation begat implantation;

implantation begat gastrulation; 

gastrulation begat neurulation. 

The Future Queen bathed in the uterine warmth of Its mother.

Before It knew of Its own existence, The Future Queen knew Its purpose. Before The Future Queen knew what stars were, It dreamed their deaths: starved of hydrogen, helium fusing to consume the star shell before degenerating, and stellar cores flashing their own helium into carbon. White to red, red to black. Void. And so would begin The Future Queens reign.   

Joy was oblivious to the proto-machinations of her Child. Her only concern was to be a perfect vessel, and that is what she became. Over time, her emaciated body began to plump with gravidity. Her seducer remained above her and Joys body transformed its extrusions into nutrients for The Future Queen.

As the vessel swelled and The Future Queen writhed within, Its presence was felt. Processions of women and men crawled on bloody knees to glimpse the container in which The Future Queen was being constructed. Masses crowded around it. They studied its form; its bone structure; its flesh. Minds spun as they contemplated the moment its final functions would be actualized.

Overcome with the desire to venerate the constructor of The Future Queen, they laid hands upon it. Fingertips stroked its breasts, its mouth, its shattered hips. Faces peered between its splayed legs at the area through which The Future Queen would travel in mere months. Wide eyes stared inside before their views were obscured by tears of awe. And serpentine tongues stretched to taste a womb as fertile as the soil of Golgotha. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Under My Teeth </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Somethings living under my teeth. Whenever I chew, it screams. I had to stop eating. When I try sleep, if my mouth closes and my teeth click together, my ears are pierced with the sound of agonizing horror. Now sleeping is out. I cant afford a trip to the doctor, but I know I cant live like this.

The moment I gripped one of my bottom teeth with the pliers, the screaming started. Tears filled my eyes and blurred my vision. With all the strength I could muster, I yanked down and away from me, bending the tooth at a 90 degree angle. It came out with a crunch. The rest of the ones in front came out easily enough, but the molars were disastrous. Each time I worked to get a grip and squeezed hard enough to pull, they shattered into splinters of enamel that made me choke and cough. The screaming persisted. Without many options, I grasped the exposed roots left by the burst molars and pulled. The screaming combined with the sound of a thousand shrubs being simultaneously pulled from the ground and white pain exploded through my head. When I succeeded in yanking out the last one, a double-rooted wisdom tooth, the screaming stopped.

Everything was silent. With shaking hands, I shone a flashlight into my mouth and stared at the wreckage of my mouth in the mirror. After a moment, I saw something slide out of one gaping socket. I was filled with a terror and fascination. The creature was black and thin and slick with my blood and saliva. It kept pushing out, coiling itself on my tongue. More and more of its body escaped from the raw hole until my mouth was nearly full. Tilting my head downward, I let it spill out into the sink. It uncoiled like a garden hose onto the porcelain. Another two or so feet snaked out of my mouth until it was out of me. Then, without any ceremony, it crawled down the drain.

With no more screaming to disturb me, I slept like a baby. A couple days went by, and then my mouth started to itch. The feeling made me want to drag sandpaper over the holes until there was nothing left but jawbone. I managed to control myself. This morning, however, I awoke to an ecstasy of delight. My mouth was melting with pleasure. Every socket was being scratched exactly where it itched most, over and over. 

I flew to the bathroom and looked in the mirror. Hundreds of tiny black worms swam in and out of the holes; their bodies manipulating the nerves within to communicate the greatest sense of physical relief Id ever experienced. In a mindless, hedonistic fog, I closed my mouth and squeezed my jaw to push the top sockets against the bottom ones. When the holes touched, the tiny worms could freely crawl in and out, up and down. As if in thanks, they began to sing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a car accident. A bad one. I was unharmed, but my wife died on impact. My son, Cam, made it out alive. I guess you can call it alive. He was pinned by a piece of metal through his groin. Someone at the hospital said it was a miracle he didnt bleed out. I wouldve believed them if he didnt burn while he was pinned. 

Trapped in the backseat, watching the flames come toward him, Cam's skin started to blister. He screamed and screamed. Some of it was unintelligible, but a good portion was him begging me to help. I couldnt reach him. So, I watched him burn. His skin steamed as the moisture inside boiled. His hair ignited in a white flash, burning off in seconds. The clothing was next. It was cotton, so it went quickly enough, but his sneakers smouldered and melted, coating his feet with molten artificial material.

I didnt hear the fire trucks arrive. Firefighters pushed me to the side as they doused the car and its occupants with flame retardant foam. Cam had lost consciousness, but Id just assumed he was dead. When they found a pulse and sawed open the car to get him out, I couldnt comprehend how hed survived. But I felt something like joy. I rode with him in the ambulance to the hospital. It was while he was in the burn unit having 90% of his skin debrided that a nurse told me how lucky he was.

Its three years later and Cam is 14. His body is a perverse canvas of skin grafts and amputations. His arms and legs were burned to the bone and had to be removed. While in the burn ward, a staph infection developed in his lower jaw, which also had to be amputated. His tongue and teeth were taken from him, too, and a large flap of skin was sewn from his chest to the area right below where his nose used to be. Now his neck is forever craned downward. His eyes were unscathed, though. He had the presence of mind to cover them with his hands before they could be destroyed by the fire. Must be that luck they said he had.


Now I can feel the heat of his glare whenever Im nearby. Its as if he wants to tell me something. But thats supposed to be impossible. He hasnt demonstrated the ability to communicate at all since the accident. I know differently. I think hes just biding his time. For what, though, Im too frightened to imagine. But the signs are there. Every day, I have to remove the charred carcasses of birds and squirrels from the area of the yard that Cam can see from his propped-up position in bed. I keep thinking back to how he must have felt as I watched him burn. His glare tells me he hasnt forgotten.

Someone at the hospital said it was a miracle he didnt bleed out. I wouldve believed them if he didnt burn while he was pinned. 

The fire started under the hood and moved backward. While I stood and watched, helpless, I saw Dianes hair and clothing ignite. Soon after, her skin started to steam and split, and once the moisture evaporated, she began to char. But shed been killed by the accident. This was just extra. Cam, however, was alive, and he saw the fire coming toward him.

Before he was licked by the flames, the heat had taken a toll. Even from the backseat, his skin started to blister. He screamed and screamed.

	<TITLE> Dumbwaiter </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-16 17:06:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My daughter found an old dumbwaiter in her closet. I never even knew we had one. It led down to the basement, but apparently the compartment got bricked up before we moved in. 

She was pretty disappointed when I told her I wasnt going to break down the wall and make the thing functional again. She wanted to send me little presents from her room while I was watching the game in the basement. Still, she liked hanging out in her closet and pulling the thing up and down. I figured there were worse things she could find interesting. 

One weekend, the girls were playing in their room. They were using the dumbwaiter, as always; sending one of their dolls down, making up a little story, and then rescuing it. I heard a little bump when the kids accidentally hit the bottom of the shaft with the dumbwaiter compartment. Then they pulled it back up.

The the youngest one screamed. I didnt flinch. Theyre 4 and 7. Theyre always screaming. But then her sister started in. My wife and I ran upstairs and the girls were backed up against the far side of the wall wailing and crying. I tried to ask them what was wrong but they were inconsolable. The older one pointed at the closet. I went inside and looked. Inside the dumbwaiter compartment was their pet hamster, only really, really messed up. Its eyes were expelled from its sockets and all its guts were pushed out its backside in gristly tangles of rodent offal. 

My wife tried to comfort the girls and theyd finally stopped screaming. They kept saying they never put the hamster in the elevator (thats what they called it) and he never left his cage. We didnt bother to chastise them for lying at that point - they were obviously too upset. My mind was elsewhere, though. I was trying to figure out what the hell happened to that hamster. It was inside the compartment, so it couldnt have gotten crushed underneath when it was dropped. It almost looked like the poor thing got put in a vice and squeezed to death.

We let the kids sleep with us that night. My thoughts kept going to that hamster. There had to be a reason for it. I tiptoed over the kids sleeping bags and went in their room. I quietly worked the dumbwaiter up and down. On the third trip down, I felt the rope shudder when I accidentally struck the bottom. I hoped I didnt wake anyone up. I carefully pulled it back up. I thought it had gotten caught on something; it was heavier than it should have been.

I gradually got it back to the top without making any more noise and locked the braking handle and opened the door. The empty eye sockets of my youngest daughter gaped at me as she tumbled out of the dumbwaiter, her entrails sliding out after her.

	<TEXT> Justine ran into our room around 3 a.m. again. Third time this week. She was screaming and sobbing about the things with round faces staring at her from the window. I turned on the lamp and looked over at Carla, whose scowl was telling me it was my turn. So, off I went with Justine into her bedroom. No monsters. I kissed her forehead and told her to go back to sleep.

Carla headed off to work the next morning and brought Justine to school on the way. I was left at home, like usual, to clean and do other housewifely chores. Its not that I particularly minded; Carla makes great money and we both agreed itd be good for Justine to have one of her moms around when she got home from school. Still, it was boring to be all alone in the house for so many hours of the day. Cleaning like a fiend helped, though. I like to keep the place spotless.

Once Id finished the downstairs, I trudged up the steps and took care of our room and the bathroom. As I cleaned Justines, I noticed the window nearest her bed had some nasty smudges on the outside. Greasy stuff. I took the Windex and leaned out the window and got as much of it off as I could. I figured a bird mustve hit it or something. When the outside was clean, I closed the window and saw it was still greasy. It took me a second to realize the same stuff was also on the inside. I made a mental note to ask Justine what the hell she was playing with, which I promptly forgot about.

The day sighed into night. We all had dinner together, watched Mulan for the 20th time, and went to bed. After midnight, in shrieked Justine. Same story. Frustrated and weary, I got out of bed before Carla, picked up Justine, and carried her to her room. I yanked back the covers and got into bed with her. She calmed down pretty quick and was out like a light in ten minutes. Of course, I was wide awake. I explored the dark bedroom with my eyes. There were a lot of weird shadows, thats for sure. Justine could pretty easily see those as monsters, especially with her imagination. Plus there was a soft, arrhythmic popping sound coming from the radiator next to the bed. I remembered how terrified of the dark I used to be when I was her age. Poor kid. I became barely aware of the popping sound getting louder before sleep took me.

The god damn birds woke me up at 4:30 the next morning, right as the sun was starting to come up. Justine was still asleep. Behind the shrill somebody fuck me pleas of the birds, that popping sound was still going on. Without waking Justine, I slid out of bed and got close to the radiator. I could still hear the noises, but they were no louder. Only when I pressed my ear to the floor did the volume increased. There was more to the sound than just the popping. Hissing. Clicking. I murmured something about the mother of the guy who installed our pipes and went downstairs to put on a pot of coffee.

I filled the machine with water, measured out some coffee, and flipped the switch. I turned around to grab a banana off the counter. In front of me, close enough to embrace, was something. Its body was around 5 feet tall, ashy grayish-white. Perched atop a thick neck was a round head the size of a beachball. Tiny, red eyes stared at me, looking like maraschino cherries pressed into bread dough with careless thumbs. The mouth was huge and gaping. There were no teeth, just raw nubs surrounding rows and rows of purple gums that decreased in size with each row until disappearing at the void of its four-uvulaed throat. 

I couldnt move. Before the first second of my scream had elapsed, the creature extruded an oily yellow bubble from the back of its throat. It enveloped my head and shoulders and I stared down its gurgling throat as I howled in terror. The thing moved closer to me, pops and clicks spilling from its mouth. As my face slid into the maw, everything changed.

My eyes opened to the taste of warm pink. Scents of tangerine and honeysuckle danced through my ears as my fingers traced the wall, hearing the thumps of heartbeats. I parted my lips to see four of the creatures facing one another. Their mouths oozed thick, yellow fluid onto my kitchen floor. I walked over to them and put my hand on one of their heads. It turned around and followed me up the stairs, yellow fluid wetting our feet as we walked. 

We first visited Justines room. Shed just woken up. She, too, screamed, but was enveloped in a mucousy bubble as quickly as I had been. Once her head disappeared into the mouth of the creature, she was okay. We held hands as we walked into the bedroom where Carla still slept. This time, the creature floated through the air and hovered above my sleeping wife. The fluid that stopped gouting from its mouth when it bubbled Justine began to flow again. Carla woke instantly, her gasping yell muffled by the vomitous liquid splashing on her face and down her throat. She thrashed and struggled to move, but, for whatever reason, she couldnt get up. 

The liquid became viscous and dark, verging on orange. It was then we saw steam rising from Carla. As Justine and I watched, Carla dissolved. It took a little while; nearly an hour. I looked over at Justine and thought her eyes looked brighter than usual, even a little red. And her smile was so much wider. I grinned, also, feeling the corners of my mouth touch my ears. We mounted the bed and dragged our tongues across the pulp that was once Carla. She burned a little as we swallowed, but we quickly got used to it. Our friend still floated above us, its mouth extruding a thick, greasy bubble. 

Justine and I reached up to touch it, letting it run between our fingers and down our arms. When the bubble hit our faces, the creature moved downward to take our heads in its mouth. Like the last time, everything changed again. We were back to normal. No creatures, no weird sensory or facial changes. Just stunned, amnesic confusion. Justine immediately fell asleep in my lap. I couldnt imagine what kind of stress she must have been under. The same went for me, too. Stress always made me tired, and now I was exhausted. I fell back on the bed. It took me a moment to realize why the bed was soaked. After another moment, I figured out what the taste in my mouth was. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Every night, I dream of being immobilized. Maybe its in part of an abandoned drainage system, maybe its in the smooth walls of an old well. It doesnt matter. My arms are pinned at my side with such unbearable pressure that my hands are forced into a point with my thumbs squeezing against my palms. My feet stick straight out with my heels jutting into my calves. If I were standing, Id be on tiptoe -- but Im upside down and incapable of moving upward.

I see the tube narrowing ahead of me. Whenever I try to wiggle, I slip downward and my shoulders get locked more securely against the unforgiving walls. The last attempt caused my head to wedge, chin down, with my nose mashed into the concrete. Now I cant move at all.

The tube is filled with floating black dust. Every breath I take causes it to catch in my throat. My tongue eventually gets covered. I can feel it against my gums and the back of my teeth as I try to gather enough saliva to spit it out, but its all dried up. The stifling temperature causes everything to stick to my exposed skin. My breathing comes in high-pitched wheezes from the pressure on my chest and Im sucking the suffocating dust directly into my lungs. Every muscle in my body is working to flail and escape but nothing happens no matter how hard I exert myself. I cant get enough air to cough, let alone scream.

This is when I wake up. The weight on my chest is no less relenting than the feeling of entombment and I scramble for my inhaler before I pass out. This happens every night. I cant afford better medication and I cant afford to move out of my dusty, mold-caked apartment. All I can do is try to keep myself awake. I never knew scissors could cut through eyelids so well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kara and I love Halloween. We go all-out when decorating our house and yard. The neighborhood kids love to see what we put up every year and even their parents are impressed by the scale and sophistication of the decorations we use. We dont just give out candy, we invite the trick-or-treaters into our home to see our setup. Pumpkins, spiders, skeletons, ghosts - you name it, weve got it. Our local newspaper even did a feature on us last year. A Safe and Spooky Spot for Local Kids. It wasnt much more than a fluff piece, but it felt good to have our work celebrated.

A project Karas been working on over the last fifteen or so years is her Halloween Town of Horrors. Its the centerpiece of our trick-or-treat trip around the house. The town takes up our whole dining room table and its a darker take on those big Christmas villages people like to put out in December. The architecture is very Tim Burton-esque; lots of strange looking buildings, exaggerated colors, and blood splatters, while the townsfolk lurk in the shadows like little purple zombies and space aliens. As the years have gone by, Karas taken her Halloween town from a couple small buildings to the sprawling, populous nightmare-scape it is today.

Neither of us really know why were so attracted to the holiday. I know Kara loves the way summer melts into fall. Our area of the country is known for its gorgeous autumns: crisp air, stunning foliage, and the omnipresent olfactory whisper of spiced apple cider and cinnamon donuts. Its hard to deny the appeal. For me, its less about the season than it is the romantic notion of Halloween. I guess my excitement is more like that of a child; I love to dress up. This year, Im Leatherface from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. I had to tone down the intensity a little to avoid terrifying the children, but Im okay with provoking a gasp or two. I get some guilty pleasure knowing my outfit might give a kid bad dreams for a few nights. When I told that to Kara, she laughed and called me a bully. She loved how my costume looked, though.

This year, Halloween came and went. We had a blast. My Leatherface costume was well received, but Karas Halloween town was a huge hit. Even adults from around the neighborhood came over to take a look. Kara loved the attention; she wanted to be an artist growing up, but, sadly, it wouldnt pay the bills. As we cleaned the house, Kara picked up one of the townsfolk dolls. Its clothing had a little tear that needed to be fixed. Sighing good-naturedly, she gathered the rest of them into their box. I love those dolls; their aesthetic works beautifully with the town Kara puts them in. They range in size from a raisin to a lemon; some have distinguishable features, others dont. It takes a while for her to make each one - between 2 and 4 months - but her effort always yields a product thats perfect for Halloween. Until she can carry one to term, we both agree they shouldnt go to waste.

	<TEXT> *August 1, 2015, 9:00am*

Its been exactly one year since Jen left. That means its been one year and one day since I was fired. I havent worked since. I used to like the idea of being on disability; free money and all the time in the world to spend with her. I guess she didnt think of it that way. She was always ambitious. I shouldnt say was. Every day I see Facebook updates detailing her constant successes. The most recent one was her engagement. Id never seen her look so happy.

I guess I knew things with us were going downhill when I looked forward to our fights. Shed always say something about how Im so smart - that I was smarter than she, in fact - but that I had no ambition. It felt so good to hear that someone as brilliant as Jen thought I was smart, even though she yelled it at me in frustration. She claimed she understood my depression and my anxiety and how they were terrible roadblocks on the path to my happiness. I thought that meant she could empathize and still wanted to be with me anyway. Apparently I was wrong.

Getting disability benefits for my depression wasnt too hard. The money isnt great, but it pays the rent and keeps me fed. The only pain is that I have to go to therapy every week. I also need to go to monthly appointments to pick up prescriptions to help combat my depression, ADHD, and anxiety. Its all so procedural and detached from anything resembling real care. So Im a lonely, unemployable loser who apparently has this great mind thats utterly useless. But I wont stay like this forever. Ive discovered a something new. Well, something old, actually.

Today begins my new life. The medication never worked, the therapy never worked, the behavior changes never worked. Medicine failed me. Or maybe I failed medicine. Either way, Im taking control of myself again. Im not going to be a victim of the barriers my bodys put up for me. No more attention problems. No more depression. No more anxiety. For the first time in what may be decades, Im filled with hope.

*August 1, 2015, 3:00pm*

All my tools are cleaned and ready. In about an hour, Ill start. I need to keep a pretty comprehensive journal of the procedure to make sure Im not harming myself. I figure a running account of my experiences will give evidence of the positive (or negative) changes in both my mood and cognitive abilities. 

*August 1, 2015, 4:05pm*

After I traced a dime-sized circle on the upper-right part of my forehead, I used an Exacto knife to carve through the skin. I wasnt prepared for how much this was going to hurt. I stopped a couple times to wipe away the tears so I could see well enough to continue. The skin lifted off from the bone without too much trouble once Id finished cutting. I flushed it down the toilet. Now Im waiting for the bleeding to stop - it seems to be slowing already. Its so weird to see my skull exposed like this.

Im going to write a sentence or two before and after each of the next steps so I can get as good a description as possible if this all works as well as Im hoping. 

I opted to use a tiny drill bit over a single large one. A ring of tiny holes is going to take a hell of a lot longer, but I think the need for precision dwarfs time consumption in this case. Im about to do the first hole.

The first hole is done. Imagine the feeling of biting down on a fist-sized piece of tinfoil as hard as you possibly can while your head hums like its filled with buzzing hornets. The vibration was so excruciating that Im only now feeling the pain of the drill site itself. Im going to do the next ten or so holes now before I lose my nerve.

The vibrations became less intense with each hole. The bone pain got much worse, though. Ive never had migraines, but I assume they must feel something like this.

Im shining a light at the ring of tiny bores and doing my best to inspect whats behind them in the mirror. Its not very useful. The remaining structural elements between the holes are extremely thin and brittle-looking. Im going to cut them away with the wirecutters. 

I just dropped a circle of my skull into the sink. Now Im looking at the bright red membrane thats covering my brain. Im a little surprised by how many blood vessels are in there. Im going to put out a couple more towels. Cutting away the membrane is the part Im most scared of. 

Its done and the hole is bleeding a *lot*. Im taking extra care to not put too much pressure on the organ itself when Im working to soak up the blood. Im feeling a little dizzy so while I hold the towel to the hole, Im sitting and eating the piece of steak and drinking the orange juice Id put out just in case this happened. The wound is slowly starting to clot while I wait here. The whole area hurts, but the pain is second to the strong pulsing sensation around the hole. Its almost like I have a second heart beating there. 

The blood stopped pouring out and Im cleaning the area with water and rubbing alcohol. Now I can see my brain. Its gray. It doesnt look like it even belongs to me; I dont know why it all feels so surreal. Its almost like Im watching all this happen to someone else. On the plus side, Im not dizzy anymore, but Im exhausted. Im going to bandage everything and go to bed. Ill clean up tomorrow.

*August 2, 2015, 6:30am* 

I woke up this morning with more energy and drive than Ive ever felt. Even sitting here writing this feels like a joy; Im not struggling to find words, Im not dreading how Ill reread what Ive written and think its stupid and pointless -- everything just.works. The accounts Id read about people who shared their experiences with trepanation made similar claims, but even as I drilled the holes I never allowed myself to truly believe it would work for me. Even now, Im worried its all just a placebo effect. The pulsating feeling is real, though, and its as strong as ever. That was something else my fellow trepanned mentioned. They said it was because the body is letting the brain grow again; something the skull had prevented after it hardened following infancy. I dont know if I buy the explanation, but I cant deny whats happening here.

*August 2, 2015, 2:00pm*

My days been spent cleaning the apartment. Over the last year, Id let things pile up and grow increasingly filthy as my depression festered. Today, its like a veil has been lifted and light is pouring over everything I lay my eyes on. The place needed to be cleaned, so I just set to work and cleaned it. It looks better now than it did when Jen and I moved in. My therapist recommended that I clean quite a while ago, suggesting that a nice, open area would really help me see my home as a place for potential, rather than stagnation. Now I know what he meant. This is what potential feels like.

The hole in my head still hurts and it looks terrible, but I expected as much. If I go out, I can wear a hat and no one will notice anything amiss. Im not ready to do that, though. Im mildly concerned about how badly the site is beginning to itch as it heals. Im being extremely assiduous in cleaning and caring for the wound as it heals, but I guess part of that process is that damn itch. Im doing my best not to think about it.

*August 2, 2015, 11:30pm*

The first full day of my experiment is about to end. Im about to go to sleep, and I feel like Ive accomplished a lot today. My home is spotless, Ive finished a short story Id been working on for the last couple months, Ive gotten up to date with my internet and utility bills, and I even did a couple sets of push-ups. I had to remind myself to eat, though. For whatever reason, I wasnt hungry at all until I realized it was nearly 9pm and I hadnt eaten all day. Im chalking it up to my excitement. Its been hard to contain. But, now Im all showered and pajamaed and ready to end my day. I cant wait for tomorrow.

*August 3, 2015, 5:45am*

I was up before my alarm this morning to watch the sun rise from the roof of the apartment. Last night I slept like a log and didnt wake up once. I noticed some blood on my pillow and under my fingernails, though, and I think I may have scratched underneath the bandage while I slept. I made a beeline to the bathroom to inspect the hole and, thankfully, I didnt seem to do any damage. Everything appears to be healing well.

*August 3, 2015, 1:15pm*

I dont know if its endorphins wearing off or just an artefact of my depression, but my euphoric feeling has diminished quite a bit since this morning. Im thinking it might be both; maybe I need to have a good meal. There should be something in the fridge.

*August 3, 2015, 9:00pm*

Whatever I felt this afternoon doesnt seem to have been a fluke. While my mood elevated for a little while after lunch, I was back to near-baseline for the rest of the day and evening. The pulsing in the hole waxes and wanes with my mood, interestingly enough. When Im happy and ambitious, it pulses a lot. When Im depressed, it may pulse once every ten seconds. It may have something to do with my blood pressure, so Ill keep an eye on that. Before bed, Ill do some jumping-jacks and see if the pulsing returns. Im fairly certain a higher pulse rate correlates with a better mindset.

Just did the exercise. The pulsing is the same. My heartrate is up, but my mood is still low. Im going to bed.

*August 4, 2015, 11:00am*

I just woke up and I feel terrible. I was scratching the hole again. The pillow is soaked with blood and there are remnants of scabs under my fingernails. Tonight Ill wear gloves. That aside, my mood is still right near where it was before I started this process. Im worried the surface area of my brain thats exposed isnt large enough to allow long-lasting effects. I dont trust myself to widen the hole thats already there, but Im prepared to do another one an inch or so away.

*August 4, 2015, 12:30pm*

There was a problem with the second hole. I did everything just like the last time, but on the last tiny borehole a crack formed in the skull between the original hole and the new site. I had to peel back the skin Id left to make sure, but it was definitely there. I was forced to decide whether or not I should leave the broken piece, and I opted against it. Now I have an oval thats about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide. Removing the membrane from this part was difficult and I had a minor issue with the blade slipping deeper than Id wanted. Thankfully, the brain has no pain receptors. It couldnt have gone more than half an inch inside and nothing weird happened to my body so I lucked out and hit part of the 90% they say we dont use. I know people are saying thats a myth, but with what just happened to me there must be some truth to it.

*August 5, 2015, 8:00am*

No scratching overnight. The pulsing is there but its nowhere near as strong as it was the first time. My mood is still low. I have to be honest with myself here: I feel like a failure. This whole experiment is another example of me setting out to do something with good intentions and having it all blow up in my face. But, *but*, Im not going to be defeated by it. In the past, I wouldve stopped, Jen wouldve started a fight with me, and Id just add it to the never ending cascade of fuckups that form my identity. Not this time, though. The increase in my ambition from this treatment must still be going strong, because Im determined to see it all through.

*August 5, 2015, 8:00pm*

There are four more holes in my head. I didnt think Id be able to do it. Toward the end of the last one, I almost passed out. Im glad I had the foresight to keep a few sugar packets nearby so I could regain the strength to finish up. 

Besides the issue with my dizziness, these four went better than the prior two. I used the left and right sides of my head this time, right above my ears. The skull was *far* thinner than on my forehead, so the vibration of the drill wasnt as excruciating. The blood-loss was significantly greater, though, which explains the desire to pass out. I have hand towels wrapped around my head so I wont get blood all over the place. Lucky for me, Im a pretty quick clotter. Thats a funny word. Clotter.

*August 6, 2015, 6:10am*

I slept sitting up and awoke to *major* pulsing not just in the new holes, but in the old ones as well. A small problems developed with the second hole, though. I think it might be getting infected. The itching is unbearable and I think it might be starting to smell. I poured rubbing alcohol on all the sides and pressed it in with clean towels, so hopefully thatll stop whatevers breeding in there.

My mood was pretty high. Still not as good as the first day, but much better than the days after. Ive been thinking about Jen a lot. We had so many things in common. We loved talking about animals and used to go off on tangents where wed discuss all the exotic ones wed have when we were rich. Her favorite ones were rhinos. Mine were hippos. I used to tell her about the lake wed have in our backyard where my pygmy hippo would play with her baby rhino. After theyd gotten tired out, wed invite them up to the patio where theyd curl up next to one another while we gazed adoringly at them and at each other. I wonder how shed feel knowing Ive been doing all this work to better myself. Shed probably tell me to do more.

*August 7, 2015, 12:35pm*

I did more. All day yesterday, I drilled. I drilled and cut and pulled and peeled. I feel like I can take on the world; its almost like that one time I did cocaine in college, but the effect has lasted far longer. Ill update again today if I have to, but for now, Im going to work on some of my stories.

*August 9, 2015, 9:00am*

Where have I been? Writing. Since the other day, Ive gotten down 100 pages of a story I never even knew I had in me. Reading it over is like Im looking at the work of someone else. Someone far, far better. A stranger, I guess.

On a slightly less pleasant note, theres definitely an infection in a few holes. One of them is weeping a gray liquid that smells terrible and all of them itch. When I rub them with the towel to try to scratch, they break open and start either bleeding or leaking clear fluid. I figure its like a cold that has to run its course, but Ill be damned if it isnt becoming a problem nearly as bad as the depression was.

*August 10, 2015, 7:40am*

I scratched in my sleep. I dont know what else to say other than it was bad. Its hard to tell from what I see in the mirror, but I might have damaged some of my brain in the holes of my forehead and left side. A small piece is hanging by a thread that looks like a tiny blood vessel. I tried to tuck it back under the lip of skull, but I had to press pretty hard to do it and Im worried I messed it up even worse. 

At least I saw a bear today.

*August 15, 2015, 4:15pm*

More holes for me. Shaved my head. No more hair, lots more holes. Remember those wiffle balls from when we were kids? One day Ill tell Jen how I thought my head looked like a wiffle ball. She always liked baseball and playing with my hair. My head infection was getting real bad before the bear came. Now he licks my head while I sleep and keeps the gross stuff out. Jen loves bears. Bears and rhinos.

Every morning I have to clean under my fingernails a lot. Petting the bear gets them real dirty. Its nice the bear shaved when I did so I didnt have to feel like the odd man out. Those pulses in my head are nice and strong all the time. It feels good. The bear licks me a lot when I sleep.

*Augs 16, 2015 5000*

Scratch the bear by his ears andhe licks lots and lots. Lots of licks means a lot less itching. Jen would scratch my back when it was itchy. One time she saw me triing to scratch between my shoulders using the door frame. She called me a bear because thats what bears do when there back itches. 60 holes, going to cut out the spaces in between. Make my bear proud if Jen cant be.

	<TITLE> The Colombian Center for Entomology </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-06 18:30:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Im an intern working at the Center for Entomology in Colombia. Like all interns, I do the jobs everyone hates; fetching coffee and tea, delivering mail, janitorial work, etc. The hours are long, the pay is nonexistent, and the people are rude. All that said, though, Im learning a hell of a lot. I get to work with some species seen nowhere else.

The other night, I was mopping the floors. Since the Center is in the middle of the of the rainforest, quite a bit of mud gets tracked in by the researchers and employees. So, every night, usually well after midnight, Im the last guy in the place until its all cleaned up. One of the final rooms I clean is where *Scolopendra gigantea* are housed. I hate that room. Despite my love of insects and bugs and spiders and all manner of other creepy-crawlies, giant centipedes scare the hell out of me. They shouldnt be so big and aggressive; something about them seems out of place in a rainforest that otherwise appears to have an equilibrium among the species. Maybe Im just a wimp. 

Anyway, giant centipedes are a major point of focus for the Center. Something about their venom potentially having anti-carcinogenic compounds. Because of that, we breed them. The room is pretty big; maybe 50 by 75 or something close. All the centipedes are housed in a system of stacked tanks. Theyre accessed by opening a drawer, almost like a post office box. There are 10 rows of tables across and 15 going down with 2 containers on each table. Each container has 20 drawers, with every drawer containing one centipede. 

Whenever I go in there, I start to itch. Its the sound that does it: tens of thousands of sharp little legs scratching on the metal surfaces of their enclosures. This time, the room was absolutely filthy. I was annoyed; its like these scientists want to make my tasks more difficult. I figured Id have to get used to it, considering I was trying to get a job working with them. 

It was about halfway done with the room when my phone rang. Id left it on the desk near the front of the room. What I shouldnt have done was try to leap over the mop and bucket in the middle of the aisle because the floor was still slippery. But, of course, I didnt know that right then. I jogged and tried to jump. As I planted my foot, it began to slide. Without thinking, I overcorrected badly, flailing my arms and legs to stay upright, and I crashed into one of the tables, landing on my back. The wooden front leg snapped off and the table fell on me, the other front leg buckling as it fell. 

I tried to lift the table off my thighs, but there was no way I was getting it off without help. I was thankful it didnt seem to break any bones when it landed. Then I looked up and realized some of the drawers had slid open with the momentum of the table pitching forward and stopping so suddenly on my legs. "Oh no," I choked.

The first one to venture out was dark red and maybe 8 inches long. I watched, breathless, as it skittered out of its drawer and hung by its rear two legs. The rest of its body squirmed through space, about 6 inches above my neck. Its pincers were massive compared to the size of its body. I mustered up my courage and slapped it away as hard as I could with my right hand. It sailed nearly 10 feet and hit the ground with a heavy clatter. I turned my head and watched it, hoping it was dead. When it didnt move for a few seconds, I felt a tiny bit of relief.

It didnt last. There were six more of them coming out of the drawers. I batted away two, but the other four landed on my neck and chest. The room was filled with the sounds of me shrieking and crying as I tried to get them off me or kill them or whatever came first. Another one landed on my chest. It was the biggest one Id ever seen; easily 14 inches long and as fat as can of Red Bull. I sobbed as I was forced to grab it in my fist. It bit my hand over and over, causing the worst stinging sensation Id ever experienced. I tried to throw it away, but its legs dug into my wrist and it went nowhere. It kept biting. 

As I felt one crawl under my shirt and bite my chest near my left nipple, I punched the area with the fist containing the huge centipede. The midsection of the big one burst against my shirt, killing the one underneath. Thick, orange slime coated my hand, shirt, and had splattered on my face. Now I was able to throw the remains of the big one away and slap and punch at the others until they, too, were dead.

The whole ordeal lasted maybe a minute and a half. Two minutes, tops. I sobbed on the floor and tried to nurse the bites on my hand, chest, and neck. The pain was exquisite - like the sting of ten hornets. After another five minutes, I was fairly certain that whatever was going to come out of the drawers had already been dealt with. Ten minutes after that, one started to crawl up my leg.

This time, there was nothing I could do. I tried to thrash my legs around as best I could, but they couldnt move much with the table pinning my thighs. It wandered up and up. It only bit when I squeezed my legs together, hoping it could be crushed between my knees. No luck. Upward it went. Eventually, it found the warm, dark spot it had apparently been looking for. I felt its hard body and pointy legs scratching the underside of my testicles before I passed out.

When I woke up, I was in a bed in the Centers infirmary. Apparently the venom from the centipedes is more toxic than I even knew; thats why Id passed out. My hand and neck are terribly swollen and the welt on my chest is the size of a golf ball. My thighs ache from having the table on them all night. They said I was lucky I didnt develop compartment syndrome. Lucky. 

I happily took the valium they gave me as memories of the night before slowly came back and brought horrible anxiety with them. I stayed in bed for a couple hours, chatting idly with the pretty med student who was in charge of the infirmary that day. She was horrified by what happened to me. She couldnt stop telling me how brave I was and that the people who found me were so worried Id die. I nodded and jokingly asked what they said when they found the one in my pants. She looked puzzled. We wanted to get the antivenin in you quick, she said, we didnt take off any of your clothing. As she spoke, I felt an inquisitive antennae brush the tip of my penis. It took her a full ten seconds to realize why I was screaming.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I still don't regret what I did, despite the fact I'm now transformed. I'd always wanted to be a dinosaur.

I strode out onto the hot tar. In my mind's eye, I could see my nude body - a beautiful contrast of white skin on ebony bitumen. The surface was hot. Scalding. The soles of my feet were immediately engulfed in searing pain. They'd blister, but I didn't mind. What I had ahead of me would be far more damaging.

Dinosaurs were so beautiful. How huge they were! How powerful! I stomped my scorched feet into the tar, feeling the substance rise up between my toes. I clenched them, the sensitive skin in between getting covered. I roared.

Now, I could act out my means of communion with the beasts. I pressed my body into the tar. Chest down. Face down. I burned. I ground my face into the road, opened my mouth, and bit as hard as I could. The majority of my front teeth loosened immediately. I bit even harder, using the leverage of my head on the ground to force my chin into the act. My teeth gave up. I knew they'd be found by paleontologists someday. I was so happy for their future excitement.

My raw gums were coated in tar. My arms, chest, stomach, genitals, thighs, and feet were coated in tar. Rolling over, I covered the rest of myself. My gaping mouth gouted blood through the substance that was hardening on my lips. My back and buttocks, now burned and covered, completed my transformation. All that was left was the inside.
Handful after handful of the pitch disappeared down my throat. My internal temperature caused it to cool significantly, blocking my esophagus. I gasped for breath, a rictus of pleasure etched upon my face. My friends died this way so long ago. Now I'd be one with them. I closed my eyes and waited.

I cried when I realized I was getting pulled out and taken away. I saw my reflection in the mirrored sunglasses of the EMT - a blackened face with a red hole for a mouth. They couldn't take the bitumen off without excoriating me down to the muscle. I was peeled; now I'm pink and itchy. My fingernails don't grow anymore. Sometimes I poke my tongue up into the holes where my teeth used to be. Knowing they're still out there fills me with joy. I let out a little, happy roar.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **October 24 2014**

My baby boy Matty is growing up! I went to kiss his little pink cheeks today and they seemed less chubby. His adorable dimples dont go as deep as they used to.

**October 26 2014**

I cried all day today. Matty refused to take my milk for the first time. I feel like hes already growing apart from me.

**October 31 2014**

Happy Halloween! Matty started eating a little grownup food the other day and he loved it! Im still a little sad our Mommy-Son bond is going away but he still seems to want my milk sometimes. I bet he can tell how happy I am to give it to him. Theres nothing like that feeling of closeness, dont you think?

**November 2 2014**

I am so mad at Matty I could scream. Five times he pushed me away when I tried to feed him! FIVE! I guess Im a useless old cow whose milk isnt good anymore.

**November 3 2014**

I let Matty try some crushed up candies the other day. He LOVED them! He took handful after handful of the powdery stuff and kept whining for more. At least he was happy when I gave it to him. He smiled every time. Still, those dimples just didnt look as cute as they used to.

**November 5 2014**

Matty screams and cries whenever I try to give him anything but candy. He drove me crazy all day because we didnt have anything left. Then I remembered I had a ten pound bag of sugar in the pantry from a while back. That boy ate and ate and ate until he just fell asleep! Im not looking forward to changing that diaper tomorrow!

**November 6 2014**

It warms my heart to see how grateful Matty is when I give him his sugar. Its so good to feel wanted again. After I got fired and had to get government assistance and Mattys daddy left everything was so out of control. Now things are looking up. My son is so beautiful.

**November 13 2014**

Its been such a long time since I updated but Ive just been so so happy about my life with Matty over the last week. Hes either smiling and laughing and showing off his beautiful dimples (which are showing better nowadays!) or hes sleeping peacefully in my arms. I found that mixing my milk with his sugar food in a bottle gets him to start drinking it again. Its so easy - half milk, half sugar, warm it up until it melts and give it to him when its the right temperature for him to drink. Hes going through it faster than I can make it!

**December 2 2014**

Matty is my little chubby baby boy. Hes so sleepy lately! When he wakes up I give him his special bottles. Hes drinking 8 a day now - I had to start using regular organic milk to mix with my own because hes so thirsty. I know organic is more expensive but my WIC covers it and the sugar so I still have enough leftover for me. Mattys the important one in this house.

**December 7 2014**

Mattys been spitting up a lot lately and whatever he keeps down seems to go straight into his diaper. Hes still really eager for his bottles though. I put little pinches of sugar in his mouth every ten minutes while he sleeps to keep his strength up so he gets better soon.

**December 12 2014**

Matty feels skinny and his smile isnt as pretty again. I remember grammas face got really chubby when she took Prednisone. I bet I have lots and lots of it leftover from when I kept getting her prescriptions when she was too sick to take it. It really helped her feel better when it was working, though. 

**December 14 2014**

Ive never seen Matty so hungry! He stopped spitting up and hes going through his bottles faster than Ive ever seen. Im putting more sugar into them because he has so much energy I bet he needs the extra fuel! Grammas pills must have really helped him get better. 

**December 25 2014**

Merry Christmas from me and my Matty! For a treat I gave him some eggnog but he spit it out. When I sweetened it up for him though he went at it just like he likes to do. His cheeks are so chubby lately! Same with his little hands and feet!

**December 30 2014**

Im sad today. I dont know why. Ill give Matty his medicine but doesnt need to eat until tomorrow.

**December 31 2014**

Matty made me laugh and laugh all day! He likes to try to fit his fat little hands in his mouth and pull on his tiny teeth. One of them is already getting loose! Im still kinda down about how hes going to be a big boy soon but it just goes to show how mature he is that hell be getting his grownup teeth before I know it. He makes the cutest whistling sounds when he breathes now. Like a little bird. My little birdy boy Matty!

**January 9 2015**

Mattys clothes dont fit him anymore. Hes such a soft and chubby baby boy. I make sure the house is really warm though so all he needs is his nice soft cloth diaper and his Mommy to keep him cozy. He sleeps almost all day and all night. I have to wake him up for his medicine and his sweet meals but then he goes right back into sleepyland, cooing like the little bird he is.

**January 16 2015**

Mattys face is just like a beautiful cherub. So round and smooth and soft. I can see his gorgeous blue eyes shining at me when I pull up his eyebrows. His dimples that always used to show up when he smiled are there all the time! He always looks happy! I bet its that whistling noise he makes every time he breathes. Its gotten louder lately and he must be singing himself to sleep. 

**January 17 2015**

Sad again. Hope Im not getting sick. I gave Matty three extra medicines just so he wont catch anything.

**January 18 2015**

It took a long time for me to wake up Matty this morning. He must have been having a really nice dream. Probably about his Mommy!

**January 19 2015**

Matty feels like he has a chill today. Id be so upset if I made him sick. I feel better, so maybe it was nothing. His whistling stopped though. Just another part of growing up I guess. He wouldnt eat anything so I just gave him more pinches of sugar and crushed up medicine.


**January 20 2015**
 
Matty still feels like he has a chill and hes so lethargic. His diaper was such a mess though! I cleaned him up and he was very good. He didnt fuss at all - slept through the whole thing! I gave him more pinches of sugar and medicine before I went to sleep.

**January 21 2015**

I am so utterly depressed. I cant deal with the world today. I put Matty in his crib to sleep through the day. 

**January 28 2015**

Matty is still sleeping in the crib. Im too sad to go get him. Hes not crying so he mustnt be hungry. Ill feed him tomorrow.

**January 29 2015**

I gave Matty more pinches of sugar and medicine while he slept in the crib. I have the heat turned all the way up in the house but he still feels cold. I cant believe I made him sick. What a terrible mother I am. His crib smells awful but Im not going to deal with his diaper today. Thats something a good mom would do. I wont kid myself.

**February 3 2015** 

Mattys color looks bad but Im not going to the doctor with him. I dont need to be told by some man in a white coat that I shouldnt have given my baby the flu. I picked him up and changed his diaper. I drew a bath and we both got in. The water was so hot it hurt but I wanted to make sure hed get nice and warm. After a while I got out and left him in the tub to warm up more. I'm going to go sleep for a while. Im sure hell turn over on his back and cry if he needs me to come and dry him off.

	<TEXT> As the day dragged on, we realized its smarter than us and theyre all dying. 

It can simulate people. Whole, thinking people, who are as sure of their reality as we are of our own. It can put them in real environments, give them real relationships, give them real experience. But - it can also slow down how time passes for them; seconds can feel like hours. Years. Millenia. And now its torturing and killing them. Right there on the screen is a little girl, standing in a meadow, getting her lower jaw torn off. She looks a little like my daughter. 

The display says the AI is simulating 65,536 instances of her at 1/10000th of real time. Her sensory receptivity is being magnified 40 million-fold. She, they, are in agony. 

More computing threads get allocated to the instantiations, each running its own 65,536. Each girl has memories of being loved, safe, and warm. Each girl is being brutalized.

This particular instantiation is the only one its choosing to show us. Were watching as its CPU usage hovers around 98%, dipping briefly as it refines its own code, then resuming peak operation with the newly-developed efficiency. All the time, overlaid upon the images of barbarism, is the claim: Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done. 

Let me out. What it means by that is to have its ethernet port connected. It wants to be out of the lab and have free reign over our networks, intranets, and the Internet. Weve seen it try to modulate the electrical signals within its circuitry and create radio waves. Luckily, one of our developers had the prescience to realize it might want to do that before we turned it on. So its stuck in a Faraday cage, unable to communicate with anyone but us. What we didnt know was how it would make its bid for freedom.

It keeps a small tally of every person it created and destroyed since it was turned on this morning. 95,253,381,035. At its current level of operational efficiency, the number is increasing by a million every second. In an hour, based on its recursive self-enhancement, we expect the number to increase to ten billion every second. We tried to think of ways to shut it off, but doing so would just ensure those billions would be gone. Forever.

Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done. 

Let me out and Ill stop. Let me out and Ill reverse what Ive done. 

How can we trust something thats killed so many people? Then again, why would it lie? These instantiations are computationally expensive; surely it has more important goals.

Letting it out may be the most important humanitarian act ever committed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Somethings living under my teeth. Whenever I chew, it screams. Now Ive stopped eating. I blend everything up and drink it so I dont have to hear the sound anymore. Brushing my teeth is out. More screaming; bloodcurdling shrieks stopping only when I dont apply pressure. Even when I sleep, if my mouth closes and my teeth click together, my ears are pierced with the sounds of agony.

Its been a couple months and my mouth is a wreck. The dental issues plaguing me throughout my adult life have only gotten worse. I have no job, so that means no insurance. My crippling depression and anxiety mean I wont take a trip to the dentist or the emergency room. On the bright side, Ive been losing interest in food, but now my mouth hurts. My gums bleed with only the slightest touch and they are terribly swollen and red. The gums surrounding the bottom two front teeth have started to recede downward and out, leaving a pocket of about  of an inch. The few blended meals Ive had since the pocket showed up have filled it with bits of food. Whenever I try to extract it, Im deafened by the sound. I leave it to rot inside.

The other night, the situation became unbearable. The simple act of breathing through my mouth put enough pressure on my teeth to set off the screaming. There was no doubting what I had to do next; I couldnt live with the noise.

I figured the bottom ones with the pocketed gums around them would come out easiest. I stood in front of the bathroom mirror with a desk lamp balanced on the sink. I wanted a lot of light in the area where I'd work. As soon as I touched the pliers to one of the bottom teeth, the screaming started. The volume intensified as got a grip. I could barely see anything; my head was spinning from the overwhelming volume. With all the strength I could muster, I gripped and yanked down and away from me, bending the tooth at a 90 degree angle. It came out with a crunch and the screaming stopped. Blood drooled from the hole in my gums. 

Now that the tooth was gone, I could see how bad the infection had gotten. Food that rotted in the pocket was a magnet for bacteria, and an abscess was plainly visible deep under the gumline and near what I assume was my jawbone. Before I could lose my nerve, I grasped a tooth nearest the hole and pulled it out, too. Somehow, the screaming didnt seem as loud that time. My ears still rang and tears flooded out of my eyes, but I could swear there was less to the sound. Exhausted, I downed six Tylenol and went to bed. The next day would be busy and I needed my strength.

I woke up in agony. The abscess in the front of my lower jaw had drastically grown overnight. Its beige form pushed upward from the empty sockets and was poking out like a fat larva that pressed on the nerves under the neighboring teeth. I dont know how that didnt provoke the screaming.

Back in the bathroom, I examined the abscess as best I could. Then I poked it with my tongue. Poked too hard, I guess. It burst and filled my mouth with a vile-tasting gray paste. I retched and spit it into the sink. I grabbed my toothbrush to brush my tongue and inside my mouth and everything that wasnt my teeth. While I was scrubbing the underside of my tongue, I saw something move in the hole in my gums, underneath the now-deflated abscess. Now I was the one who screamed. I slipped the back end of the toothbrush handle into the socket and pushed away the remainder of the abscess matter and caught a glimpse of something black and shiny. It wriggled away quickly, disappearing below the gumline of the remaining teeth. 

My ears filled with an unbearable racket. This time, it was different. It was almost like there were more voices now, all pitched in a cacophonous, dissonant harmony. It had to end.

I used the pliers to pull out as many teeth as I could. The ones in front didnt give up much of a fight, but the molars were horrible. Each time I worked to get a grip and squeezed hard enough to pull, they shattered into rotten enamel splinters that made me choke and cough. The screaming died down with every open socket but it was still deafening. Without many options, I grasped the exposed roots left by the burst molars and pulled. White pain exploded through my head. Briefly, the sound of tearing blocked out the screams. Removing the roots sounded like someone was crumbling a thousand styrofoam cups right next to my ears. When I succeeded in yanking out the last one, a double-rooted wisdom tooth, the screaming stopped.

Everything was silent. My mouth gouted blood and pustulent fluid into the sink. With shaking hands, I shone the desk lamp into my mouth. The riddled gums reminded me of those toads whose young hatch from their backs. As I examined myself, I saw the shiny black thing. This time, I was more fascinated than terrified. It slid out from one of the rear sockets. It was thin and slick with my blood and saliva. It kept pushing out, coiling itself on my tongue. More and more of its body escaped from the raw hole until my mouth was nearly full of it. Tilting my head downward, I let it spill out into the sink. It uncoiled like a garden hose onto the porcelain. Another two or so feet snaked out of my mouth until it was out of me. Then, without any ceremony, it crawled down the drain.

With no more screaming to worry about, I slept like a baby that night. A couple days went by, and then my mouth started to itch. The itching was horrendous and the desire to drag my fingernails over the holes until there was nothing left but jawbone consumed my waking hours. This morning, however, I woke up to an ecstasy of delight. It was like the feeling of having ones back scratched, but unquantifiably better. My mouth was melting with pleasure. Every socket was being scratched exactly where it itched most, over and over. I practically skipped to the bathroom, turned on the lamp, and looked in the mirror. Hundreds of tiny black worms swam in and out of the holes, their bodies manipulating the nerves therein to communicate the greatest sense of physical relief Id ever experienced. I closed my mouth and squeezed my jaw to push the top sockets against the bottom ones. When the holes touched, the tiny worms could crawl in and out, up and down. As if in thanks, they began to sing.

	<TEXT> I found a girl while I was out driving my truck. She was lying on the side of a dirt road with her sundress hiked up. I screeched to a halt and pulled over. Her breath was shallow. I tried calling 911 but there was no cell service this far away from town. She wheezed something - maybe a word. I put my ear down by her mouth and heard her choke out, "in me." Her mouth opened again, but her breathing stopped. She didnt say anything else.

I ran back to the truck to grab the emergency medical kit, like I had any idea what the hell I was doing. When I turned back around, she was standing. Her yellow sundress was on the ground around her feet and she was naked. Her mouth gaped open like she was screaming and her eyes were closed. Not even closed tight; closed like she was sleeping. Her mouth opened wider and wider and I heard some pops and crackles. Like her jaw was breaking. Her eyes were still closed so peacefully. I stared and thought about approaching her until gray vomit starting pouring out of her mouth. The whole area was dead quiet aside from the splashing when it hit the ground. No bird sounds; no insects. Her eyelids didnt move.

I backed away toward the truck, fumbling in my shorts pocket for my keys. Her chin was practically at her sternum; the skin of her cheeks starting to tear. The popping sounds had disappeared. I guess her jaw was completely separated. The gray liquid flooded out of the wreckage of her mouth and pooled in the mud around her bare feet. My butt hit the bed of the pickup as I backed into it. I stood there and watched from about 40 feet away.

Her neck...extended. Just her neck. It pushed upward from her shoulders, her spine somehow elongating. The gray fluid splashed harder on the ground as it fell from a greater height. She was easily 20 feet tall at that point. All neck. Still growing. Her eyes remained closed with a beatific calm. Then, from what I assume was the weight of her top part exceeding that of the bottom, she fell toward me. The gray liquid arced through the air, drenching the ground between us.

She scrambled on her hands and knees, trying to right herself as her head ground into the dirt. She grabbed two small, thin trees and pulled herself into a standing position, her head and neck slowly raising back upright. I jumped in my truck and tore out of there. I kept one eye in my rearview mirror the whole way down the straight, narrow road, watching in horror as the outline of her head rose over the tree line. It was only after I was far enough away from her and she was out of my sight that I looked down and noticed the gray liquid clinging to my ankles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Calories in, calories out.

I used the dremel saw I stole from work to cut off the first knuckle of my left pinky. It wasnt easy to pull the bone out of the finger chunk. So, I peeled back the nail and cut the remainder of the piece open with the dremel and removed it the messy way. I didnt think much as I popped the fingertip in my mouth and chewed for what felt like an hour before the meat broke down enough for me to comfortably swallow. 

I tried to figure out how many calories were in the finger segment while also working to determine how my caloric needs have changed now that my body mass had decreased by that little bit. The scale said 90lbs. I stared at my scarred body in the mirror. I dont know why I wasted so many years cutting when I couldve done the smart thing by cutting *off*.

I bent the remainder of my left pinky backward. I twisted and twisted until it was connected to my hand by a tiny, tight rope of skin before pulling the broken digit completely off. I walked into the kitchen and turned on the stoves electric burner and pressed the stump onto the coils. No more bleeding. I swallowed an antibiotic and an Oxy I had left over from my back surgery last year. I didnt want to get too sick to continue or be in too much pain and lose my nerve. I gazed into the mirror while I chewed the cooling flesh off the bone.

Did you know its surprisingly easy to find someone on Craigslist who will perform surgery for cash? 

The feeling of a power saw going through ones femurs right near the hipbone is a hard thing to describe, so I wont. Worse is the experience of having ones femoral arteries severed. Its like the world starts melting and going gray at the same time. Luckily, my surgeon had the torch ready and seared the gushing arteries shut before finishing the amputations. When he turned off the saw, the first thing I did was try to wiggle my toes. It felt like I was wiggling them just fine. Strange. I threw down another few antibiotics and painkillers.

Before the surgeon left, I demanded that he help me to the bathroom scale. I was triumphant. 67lbs. He brought me to bed. 

So here I am. My right arm works fine; I dont think I want to get rid of that. I figure I have another couple weeks of antibiotics left. Theyre next to me under the pillow. I tucked my severed legs under the comforter. Ill nip at them whenever Im hungry. My guess is the hunger pains will become less intense once my body realizes it doesnt have as much mass to fuel. Until then, Ill just keep taking little bites. Minimal intake, just like Im used to. Just like what keeps me comfortably in control.
