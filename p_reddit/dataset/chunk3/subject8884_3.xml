	<TEXT> I like the way it looks a lot! But know that albums are a thing on imgur, which are easy to make and saves everyone looking through them a lot of trouble :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This looks great! It reminds me of the hand-drawn texture pack, but more Minecraft-y, if that makes any sense.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sounds like a good idea, but I don't know if Kurt is one to sue others... Etho seemed like the type who would sue the B-team for things they've done, while Kurt just looks like he would let things go. I feel like he wouldn't be able to press any hard charges, but that's just my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This, my sir, is the best fan art I've seen for a long time.I laughed for an entire ten minutes.

The part that says "criticism" might be a little much though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Think of this as the "Beef has no legs" or "Pause is going on vacation" or "Nebris cheats" type of joke. It's a lore people joke about in good humour, but gets old after a while. Eventually it would start to die down. Plus, it's something even the Mindcrackers themselves are talking about, so the subreddit obviously hype about it ;-) </TEXT>
