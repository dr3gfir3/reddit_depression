	<TEXT> Usually with city-builders I build and grow a city organically and plan as I go. After seeing some of the amazing cities posted on here I plan on having a go a building a properly "planned from the start" city using "unlock everything" and "unlimited money". 

Has anyone got an tips for the best way to start? Should I lay out all my freeway interchanges and roads before zoning? Do people have a full plan of what they plan to build before they start?

Also does using edited assets disable achievements or this just for mods that change game mechanics? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't got above 5k yet without my city crashing down. I am a pretty experienced "city builder" but struggling to get this game off the ground. Even though I am still loving this game! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have similar problems. I am an experienced city builder but having big issues with the 2 road connections to start. I have tried merging them and keeping them separate but both have resulted in huge jams at the connection to the outside world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How do you connect the 2 roads at the start? Just combine them into one? Keep them separate and have one as an "in" and "out"? </TEXT>
