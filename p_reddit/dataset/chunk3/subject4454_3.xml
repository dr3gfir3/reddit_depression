	<TEXT> You know what truly helps people with mental health issues? Actually medical intervention. 

Prayer might help.
Exercise might help.
Therapy might help.
Medicine might help.

But if you go to a physician and tell them your symptoms, and get help for suicidal urges, they can monitor you so that you don't end up dead because your prayer didn't work. 

I get it God helps people. I'm a Christian I believe that. 

But when I had a 5cm tumor in my uterus, I didn't just pray it would go away. I went to a physician. God gave mankind education, knowledge, and skill to be able to help other people. 

Yes, when I was going under for surgery, I asked my congregation for prayers, I asked my pastor, my friends, my family, to pray for my recovery and for my health. 

But I went to the doctor because I had a medical problem. And that doctor was able to monitor my health and make sure that I didn't die. 

Now maybe God would have done some miraculous healing without me going to the doctor. But, I relied on the gifts that he bestows upon others to heal me. And thankfully that worked. But there's no harm in praying for healing and help and going to the earthly services and providers. 


I love God. I know that he watches over us and provides to those in need. But if I'm starving and can't pay my bills, I'm not going to just sit around my home and pray. I'm going to go get food stamps and welfare, or food banks, and charitable organizations. Why? Because God gave humans abilities to help other humans and sometimes those services are his way of helping us.

	<TEXT> Well with a stupid response being that /u/suntank seems to rather someone die than get the proper medical attention that they need, a negative response is necessary. 

What kind of jerk move is that. 

Oh, you might kill yourself well don't listen to this sound advice about seeking medical help cuz the bill will make you wish you had kill yourself. 

Thats almost as bad as "pray the depression away"


You wouldn't tell someone who has severed their finger to not go seek medical help because it might be really expensive. You wouldn't give that advice to a diabetic with super high blood sugar, or someone with all the symptoms of a heart attack. But people always say that stuff to people with mental health issues. They're just as serious. And if op ends up dead tomorrow from his own hand because he didn't want to maybe be saddled with a medical bill, this dude is to blame.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh, I'm not going to argue about any of that. All I am arguing is that you don't have to do anything extraordinary to grow an infant. Idk how you got that many people don't do any of those shoulds to me arguing that women should be forced to carry infants to term. You're reading wayyyyy to much into things. 

Yes in 2016 people often take extra steps for pregnancy. 

But in 5000bc I doubt they did even half of what we do now. 

Nor did they in 35ad. 

Point being that people don't have to see expensive doctors or buy special clothing. 

I didn't buy special clothing when I was pregnant, I just brought larger sizes. Which is what anyone would do if they have gained weight, it's not some undue burden. It's just a fact of life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've given birth. Please tell me how me saying that people don't have to do anything while pregnant = they don't have to do anything while giving birth. 

Also, watch any episode of "I didn't know I was pregnant" those women typically didn't know they were pregnant did absolutely 0 of the things you're supposed to do and the baby still grew. 

That isn't a 100% of the time you don't need to do anything. It's that even without any intervention by the mother a child will continue to grow to term without any outside influences. 

Ex: if I get pregnant and decide not to see a doctor, to eat shit I shouldn't, to smoke, and drink, and do whatever I want. There's still a very good chance that the baby will grow to term. 

All I'm saying is that you don't have to do anything to make your pregnancy viable. I know many people who have tried to have babies for years, done ALL the right stuff and still ended up miscarrying. And then you have crackheads who smoke crack and do all the wrong things and carry a baby to term. Now how healthy that baby is is obviously dependent upon further examination. But without outside Intervention a embryo will often continue to term. 



For example: if I buy a model airplane kit and don't do anything it won't become a model airplane. I have to act in order for it to become an airplane. 
With embryos unless I remove the embryo from the womb it should (barring other factors) continue to grow to an infant. Sure there are things I can do to make sure that infant is healthier, but even if all I do is have unprotected sex and get pregnant and then do nothing else but live my life how I had for years before, I can end up with a full infant in 40ish weeks. Not so with the model airplane, I have to do something to end up with an airplane. There's no natural progression from boxed kit to model airplane that doesn't involve human intervention. </TEXT>

Just like. If a man breaks into my house and I deem it a threat I can shoot him. 

He could just be a lost man with no intent to harm me, but he's in my house I deem it a threat it's a threat. I can still be made to op answer why and the authorities can attempt to charge me with something based upon those answers, but ultimately the use of deadly force is based upon whether or not you believe there is a threat.

It's slightly different with cops but almost essentially the same. The exception is the can use deadly force on people fleeing a scene if the think that the person might harm someone else. As a regular citizen if a criminal is leaving my home I cannot shoot him because he might return later to kill me, I just have to be ready for later or rely upon the cops to protect me. 

Cops can shoot a fleeing suspect if they believe that he is either going to harm someone or comeback to harm someone. 

The important thing here is "believe". Yes, one should try not to kill someone who isn't really a threat but if they seem to be a threat thats enough of a reason to use deadly force.

However, cops do tend to shoot people when they are resisting arrest and might have a weapon or are fighting the police. 

Yes, it's not ideal, but people do review a cops reasons for why they discarged their weapon on duty. Internal Affairs is usually invovled. Sometimes there is a lengthy investigation. At least from what my family members have told me. They drug test them. they take statements and more.

	<TEXT> Even if that's the case, it doesn't make situation A a situation where racism was the factor. 

In my op I even say, I dont see how people immediately make that choice that it's racism. 

That would be like me taking statistics that show that rapists rape redheaded women at a higher rate than blondes. And being like well, this guy raped this chick because she had red hair. 

Hair color could have never been a factor in it. Why then should I say well statistics show redheads are raped more than blondes even though there are more blondes. 

Why can't the guy just be a rapist and not a redhead hating rapist? Why must I jump to the position that if a redhead is raped it's because of hatred against redheads? 

Just like in my op if a black person is shot it's all of a sudden because this cops are racist as opposed to "this cop is bad" or "cops need better training" 

Look at black lives matter. It's all about race, it's not "we need better policing" or "Stop Bad Cops" but they automatically make it a race thing. 

Sure if it's a race thing that will come out eventually, but I can't accuse a specific situation of being racist because of other situations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is possible that training may need to be adjusted. 

However, my view wasn't that they could be it was that, it's obvious upon the initial situation and not after an investigation that it's racism. 

Yes, I can if given evidence say, oh this shooting was because of racism. 

What I can't do is say, this shooting that just happened 2 days ago is because of racism. 

I can even accept someone saying that covert subconscious racism is in play, I might disagree but I can accept that as their opinion based upon history. 

My problem is that if news breaks right now that a white cop shot a black man and the black man turned out to be unarmed. You'll see people like black lives matter, or others immediately say, "this is because of racism" with no evidence to prove that. 

Even the name of the movement purports that it's because of anti black racism. 

I'm all for, let's investigate, as I think all shootings should be investigated. 

I just can't get to "this shooting is most likely because of racism even tho no evidence proves as such. 


But, I guess your argument is that it is racism until proven not because of history? Am I correct? </TEXT>

The 24 hour news cycle? And the increased militarization of police officers. 

Now, I have a huge problem with the militarization of police and the increasingly large US vs THEM mentality with the police force. And you can even see it in many areas. Especially the last few years, I've noticed police are very much more suspect of people average beat cops not so much, but they are more "on edge" but I don't consider that a race thing and more of a militarization of police thing.  </TEXT>

I don't deny that cops can be either racist or bad. But what creates the assumption that this bad thing they did is because the cop is racist as the first assumption. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think there is a large pool of bad cops nor of racist cops. 

But what I don't see is how you seem to think that bad equals racist. 

If I'm a bad person, I can be a bad person and not racist. I'm not also a racist because I'm bad. 

If a cop is bad, he's a bad cop. But there has to be some extra evidence for me to say, this cop is a racist cop. 

If a cop shoots an unarmed man and it turns out there was not compelling reason and that man is white, is that cop a racist or just a bad cop? 

Even if I were to automatically assume that every suspicious police shooting was a bad shooting and the cop was wrong. That would rise me to the level of "these cops are bad cops, there should be reform in Training." 

Yet, in all these shootings people seem to go "these cops are racist cops, they need to be trained to not be racist" which is the leap I just can't take.

	<TEXT> A law can be unjust, all laws should be moral. 

Stealing is wrong not because the law says so but because it is morally wrong. 

Slavery being legal was immoral and an unjust law. Laws are based upon morality and what is just to the person and society. 

The big question you have to ask yourself is if prostitution would be just to society and the individual. 

If prostitution being legal reduces all human trafficking, then maybe it is just as it ends a morally reprehensible practice. 

But there is a good chance that mostly poor  women will end up prostituting themselves. And even with very strict laws about condom usage and testing many will end up with diseases. See any of the HIV outbreaks in the porn industry. 

While it being illegal doesn't stop poor women from being abused and exploited. society accepting prostitution would most certainly create a system where if a girl is poor there is immense pressure for her to sell herself for money. 

It will most certainly end up into a system where people are oppressed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay, I can see unknown racism to be impactful. But even if that is the case, then how does one then say, "this cop did this because he's a racist and it was unjust" 

I just can't get to that, I can see your pov that racism might play a part. But I'm struggling with where it becomes "this situation happened and it was illegal because the cop is a racist" 

I just can't make that leap that says a possible subconscious racism suddenly equals a purposely racist shooting. Or that it's not a good shooting because of possible racism. 


I know it was years ago but there was a guy in NYC who the cops sodomized with a plunger. But the main cop in it was I believe married (might have been engaged) to a black woman. Yet everyone has that as racist. But I consider that just a corrupt, perverse, asshole cop. Maybe if he had said racist stuff in the past I could say, well this illegal thing he did was because of racism. 

But like the CCW guy I think Castile(?) I can't say it was a good shoot, and I know I err on the side of cops and think well maybe he reached into his back pocket without being told to do so. Or maybe the cop was overly scared for no reason and as such shouldn't have been a cop. 

I just don't see the part where, I accuse the cop of doing it because he's a racist. And say that it's because he's racist.

	<TEXT> But then why are the majority of my interactions with cops nice? Even when I was being a dick to cops most of the time they treated me just like anyone else. 

When I broke the speed limit I wasn't treated shitty, the cop even asked how we enjoyed out Trip, we had a bunch of Disney stuff in the car. And I was doing some felonious speeding levels. And he didn't even write the ticket for the full speed to give me a break. In fact he even gave me a good defense for the ticket, so I wouldn't have to pay it. 

If racism was as big a factor as it is then I'd have way more stories of cops treating me like shit. And I lived in the projects, and dealt with cops in the projects where stereotypes would dictate,m that I'm a criminal black person. But they never treated me badly. 

The worst I've gotten was cops that were overly by the book and snippy, and they were snippy with everyone.

	<TEXT> But then okay, I'll say maybe societal racism is there. But imo, that still doesn't rise to, "this shooting is because cops are racist". 

I just don't see how people can automatically just say, "officer Bob here who came to this scene where this black guy had a gun and used deadly force, is a racist and did this because of racism." 

I can say, how unfortunate. I might even be persuaded to agree that it's possible that unconscious racism took a part, but I'm not going to call a shooting murder and unlawful based upon something someone isn't even aware of psychologically.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Idk I just don't see any evidence that police aren't trying to treat everyone the same.

Even if they aren't, I just don't think that they are doing it consciously and I don't consider that racism. 

Even in these cases where black lives matter got involved, I don't think any of them came back with courts saying that the cops involved were racist. I might be wrong tho. 


Again im not saying all cops arent racist or that they're right. But even the autistic shooting, I'm like "this cop is a bad cop" and not "this cop is a racist cop"

I'm not a person who thinks all cops are super awesome, I've met some super dickish cops. But if I have a shitty interaction with a cop, it just doesn't automatically hit me, oh, this cop is a racist. I just assume he's a dick.

I guess I can see how people can say these cops are dicks, just not these cops are dicks because they're racist.

	<TEXT> Well, If someone says that a person is a criminal because they're x, y, z race then that would be racism. 
If someone says something like, "I hate blacks" copious use of the N-word as a derogatory thing. Or other slurs would be racism. 

If someone said, so and so shouldn't do that because of their race, i'd think that was racism. 

I suppose, I'd consider it racism if someone said, "this person is good at X because of their race". As long as it wasn't something sensible like, This mexican guy is good at speaking spanish cuz their mexican. I mean without context, that seems sensible. If the guy was from mexico, it would just be logical that he would be good at speaking spanish. If he's born in the us, it wouldn't. And even if it were racist for someone to assume a hispanic person speaks spanish, i wouldn't consider it to be racist enough that I'd call that person a racist. 

My husband is hispanic and his grandmother assumes that he speaks spanish and he doesn't. I dont think she's being racist for doing so. And I don't think that when we go to spanish restaurants that they're being racist for immediately talking to my husband in spanish (I speak more spanish than him). 

I wouldn't consider it racist if You were faced with 2 potential employees both with the same skills, work history, and interpersonal skills, and you just happened to pick the person of X race because you perceive them to be smarter, but wouldn't be able to verbalize that was why if asked. If asked why you chose person A over B, and you said because Asians are smarter, that would be racism. but if it was because I just thought person A was smarter and didn't immediately know why, that's not racism. 

Idk if that helps.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Deadly force can be used if a suspect is considered to be dangerous and is resisting arrest. It's not ideal obviously as no one wants to end another human beings life (mostly). 

I guess I can see how, IF the police department has been in the last 25 years known to do racist things, I could see it. But I don't think you see that kind of information in these reports. 

I dont think the NYPD has a history of being very racist, at least not in the last 20-25 years. And yet people just assumed that they purposely killed that cigarette guy because of it. And I lived in staten island and I've never encountered any racist cops.  </TEXT>

Maybe if every cop was given this ambiguous object experiment test prior to hiring and while it wasn't included against them it was just in their file and it could be looked at when people claim racism? 

Idk maybe it's that Every single cop I've met has been not racist. I've gone into cop stations at night to ask to use their bathrooms and phones. I've had cops just take drugs from me and tell me to get it together. And 90% of the time they are white cops.

	<TEXT> I get that idea, but if it isn't overt then I don't see why they would go around actively wishing for these people to be charged.

It just doesn't make sense to me that people would riot, march, and call for people to go to jail, and when they aren't indicted cry racist jury. 

If a cop shoots a person, I'll think well, lets see the facts. And if the facts include a person resisting arrest, then I assume the cop did what he felt was the right thing and there should be no problem. 

But it seems that whenever a cop shoots anyone who's black, it's HAS to be racism. And I don't see how you can get mad at something that someone doesn't even know they are doing. 

Lets say I'm automatically suspicious of black men because of societal racism. If a black man is tresspassing on my property and I shoot him, and it turns out he was just drunk and lost. I didn't shoot him because he was black but because he was on my property. Is it possible that I might have maybe hesitated for a few more minutes if it was a white man? Maybe. But I don't think I can be considered a racist for shooting the guy. 

It wasn't motivated by race. 

I just don't see how people can call for people to be prosecuted and jailed, and ruin their lives based on something that they don't necessarily have control over. Especially in situations of life or death. 

Lets say, same situation a man is tresspassing on my property but now I'm thinking, "Oh, this is a black man, and I don't want to be racist and just shoot him" So instead of immediately acting I don't do anything and try to solve the problem some other way and then it turns out the guy is there to cause me harm and I end up dead. 

Cops can't just go into a call, be told the suspect has a gun, and then try really hard not to use deadly force because they might subconsciously be racists.

	<TEXT>  In this specific instance, they shot a black man who was pretty clearly unarmed and cooperating rather than the white man the suspected had a gun and was ignoring their commands. In that view isn't it clear why people are suspicious of the officers actions, and the component race played?

For 1, everything I know about firing a gun and about police training proceedures is that cops are taught to shoot to kill. You aren't supposed to fire your gun unless you're trying to kill someone and the cop shot him in the hand. I mean, maybe he's a crappy shot, but it seems as tho he just fired his gun. So isn't he just a really shitty cop. Shitty =/= racist. 

Also consider that most cops don't ever fire upon anyone, let alone kill anyone. I just dont see any proof as to why these people are automatically racist, it's like 2016. I don't really think most people born past 1970 are racist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even still, that still doesn't mean that the shootings are racially motivated. 

Even if I thru society perceive that asians are good at math and then am faced with a decision to hire Either the asian accountant or the white accountant, is it really me being racist if I hire the asian accountant even if they both interviewed well, both went to the same schools, same grades, and everything is the same? 

If they aren't aware of it, then I don't consider that racism. 

I just don't see how it can be racism if they aren't actively racist people. 

Ex. Like one of my uncles who was a state trooper is in fact a racist, he never really liked my husband who's hispanic (didn't overtly say anything, but I've heard him say degrading things about puerto ricans in the past and even after I had been dating my husband, been enganged, and was married). And I know he hates white people, cuz he said he definitely will be more strict (before he retired) with a white person who he stops than a black person because he dislikes white people. So if he were to shoot a white man in a police situation, i'd say, this was probably racially motivated. 

But many of these cops, in the situations that have occured over the last 2 or 3 years, have black friends, many had nonwhite spouses, most had no history of racism or misconduct. So I don't see how it can be racism.

And I definitely don't understand why people just automatically say, this has to be racism.

	<TEXT> I'm the child of a family of cops. I have 10 uncles who were cops in various areas including (Military Police, DEA, Port Authority, State Troopers, Homicide Detectives, Sargents, Heads of Departments, Deputy Chiefs, and more) all of them are black. I have a bunch of friendly cop experiences, I knew a bunch of white cops from my town all of them were really nice to me. And I wasn't always the most law abiding person (I'm a recovering Alcoholic and Addict). Even when I got pulled over in Virginia doing well over 90 in a 70, the cop was really nice and only wrote that i was going 10 miles over the limit so i wouldn't get a felonious speeding ticket charge (and he was white). And a whole mess of friends from AA are either current cops or retired cops and some of them helped me out when I was getting scammed by some guy who backed up into me and tried to get me to pay for his "damages". All of them are white. 

Whenever I see stories on TV about a cop shooting a black person I always feel bad for the cop first and normally look at the evidence to see why the cop did it. Usually I don't see the shooting to be racially motivated at all, and rarely do I think they did anything wrong. 

Example: the Staten Island Guy, he resisted arrest (I know this wasn't a shooting) 

The guy in baton rouge resisted arrest, and was reported to have been brandishing a gun so it seems sensible for the cops to use deadly force in that instance. 

I'm not saying that their aren't any racist cops. But I just don't understand how people automatically assume that cops are racist and that a cop isn't just a shitty cop. 

For example, the cop who shot the autistic mans helper in Miami, I assume he's a shitty cop but not racist. But even white friends of mine automatically assume it was racially motivated. 

I feel like I must be missing something. So can you change my view?

If the rule is no dyed hair, then no dyed hair.

	<TEXT> A good friend of mine was banned from wearing his tench coat because of it. Meanwhile it was a very expensive trenchcoat his father brought for him.

His parents, rightfully so, told the school to fuck off. 

Meanwhile, the school told me that cuz I made some shit joke "imma buy a tench coat cuz they come with guns" or some shit. That I either had to get therapy with their school doctor or be suspended til I did. I was suspended until I did. Tho while my parents were battling it out the school had to pay for homeschooling by private tutors and eventually had to let me back cuz they were wrong.  </TEXT>

It was raining, and I was a teenager so I didn't give a fuck about rain. Get there, take off my pans, my legs are blue as fuck. It was very awkward. Also i chafed the shit out of my legs on the walk back to school. And had to wear my gym pants the rest of the day. Which was stupid cuz everyone knows, no sweats during regular school.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! I cannot stand wine moms. Even as an alcoholic I was never that  boned up about drinking on fb. It grosses me out. They'll be like 

"I need a bottle of wine a day to get thru summer vacation" or "this blizzard is  a 3 bottle blizzard" "can't wait til the kids go to bed so I can drink a box of wine." Or "I'm not an alcoholic, I'm a drunk!" 

I'm always like bitch, I was downing 1/2 liters of jd before noon, and no one knew because I'm not drinking for attention.  

Like they think being constantly  drunk and on fb is cute. Needless to say I don't hang out with them much. Not cuz I can't be around drunks. But because I can't be around people who talk about drinking so much.  </TEXT>

Meanwhile, I planned to have my kid, had him early at like 24, took prenatal vitamins from pre conception, all thru, didn't eat canned food, exercised, water, no caffeine, no drugs, no alcohol, no smoking, no cold cuts, no soft cheeses, folic acid up the ass. My son has autism. Which is probably genetic. But still it just seems horribly unfair. </TEXT>

Am an alcoholic, and I can deal with my husband drinking occasionally. But if I were to remarry, I'd probably do only a total abstainer. Just cuz I know I'm going to end up drinking again. </TEXT>

No.  I don't believe so. and not in the past 2 days anyways. The last water I drove thru that even made a splash was on Wednesday. 

I don't think it got higher than maybe a few centimeters if that. but i don't know what kind of damage that might do. it's just like really wet floor mats and  the flooring is wet and stinky as hell. 

My deductable is 500$ if that makes any difference. I mean if the damage is gonna be $500 and i have to pay 500 before insurance pays anything then i'm not going to report it.  </TEXT>

Basically, the entire back passanger side is soaking wet, like more than a spilled soda, and there was flooding in the area on Saturday / Sunday night/morning. 

It might just be that it's musty and wet inside but it might be big problems. Should i make a claim to my insurance? Or should i just dry it out.
