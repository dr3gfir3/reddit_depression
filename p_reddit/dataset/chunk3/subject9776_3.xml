	<TEXT> I'm having problems with making my submarine stay in level. The problem is weird because it acts like a half-full water bottle. If the stern starts sinking, it just keeps going unless I fire up my props and get the nose down... and then the nose starts sinking rather than trying to butt-dive again. 
I know people use jet stabilizers for that, but I can't tell if mine are working properly or not.

	<DATE> 2015-09-06 21:52:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Even with three engines (144 cylinders each + all the necessary junk) and 61 huge props, 4.2 m/s is pretty much an unbeatable barrier for it. I had one engine with about half the props before that and the performance is still exactly the same.

[Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/RbYbpOg.png)

It's 387 blocks long with mass of 21552.33 whatever units this uses. 

Is there a limit as to what kind of speed can objects of certain dimensions/mass reach?

EDIT: Thanks for all the tips guys. The main issue was the fact that props were stacking one after another with no proper 8 block gaps, so with 61 props only like 7 produced thrust. Fail. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> "External" oxygen level indicator and couple of other questions. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-17 00:39:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I haven't seriously played SE for quite a while, despite keeping up with updates and everything I just didn't have the time or the will to play around. But a couple of days ago I finally got back and started playing around with oxygen systems and I'm nearly done with my first large oxygen-enabled ship.

First of all, is there any way I can put up some sort of an indicator in front of an airlock to know if it's pressurized or not? When you have two entrance airlocks and three in the bulkheads across the ship, it's kinda hard to just keep mental track of it, and having to check the vent status through the door control panel is a pain in the lower back.

Second question, since I'm testing stuff out in creative as of now, the oxygen levels in my tanks are pretty much always 100%. Which becomes a problem when I want to de-pressurize an airlock, because the air doesn't have anywhere to go. I tried putting vents outside the ship, but they don't seem to function (oxygen doesn't drain, at least not in a reasonable time). I have to run on offline generators so the tanks aren't 100% full at all times. I'm not sure how much of a problem is this going to be in Survival mode, but I'd sure love to know a sensible solution.

Lastly, anyone else REALLY hating playing on DX11 because of the shadows/bloom making it pretty much impossible to build in some cases? </TEXT>
