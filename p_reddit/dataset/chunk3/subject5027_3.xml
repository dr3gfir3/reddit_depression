	<TEXT> This is blatantly inaccurate. Innumerable societies have not protected women. Where the fuck did you get that idea? You don't need to run your mouth with no education on the subject matter to look like an asshole because I assure you, you look like one anyone.
Furthermore if there's inherent value in reproductive systems of women, why on earth would men need to "prove their worth" when they are the other half of the reproductive puzzle? Not only is this illogical it seems made up by a child with very little analytical capabilities. They are both used in the process, but only one should be treated accordingly?
Men and women are generally interchangable and can be treated as equals as, no offense, you seem like a completely uneducated child and I know many men and women alike that are much smarter than you and your uneducated tripe you've laid out here kid.
I would also suggest you are an embarrassment to the species and you should talk less and read more than Jaden's Twitter feed.
And also go fuck yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Build one, don't be a sucker. You'll save a fuck ton of money and it's so easy to do. Helps to have a friend but you can use one of the many communities. Couple of hints, Intel is a name brand, AMD will get you what you need and save you money. Do not skimp out on your GPU. 4gb GPU should run just about everything currently released on high to ultra graphics. But look to the future. Windows wants to own the world so it's pretty easy to get for free from them rather than shell out the money. 
Just do some reading for a few weeks, put together a fake build, take it to the community, then slowly buy the parts as you see them on for decent prices. Bust out a bag of blow and a bottle of Jamieson's and then fucking COMPUTERS!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strange to me to see a build like this for a gaming PC? Over double the capacity of the GPU put into the CPU reads more like a rendering or editing computer. Of course to each their own but would recommend ditching the Intel to save some money, ATI FX 4300 would more than kill for all triple A games and throw the money saved at the GTX 970 like others have pointed out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's amazing how willing people are to say the pasta must be plain and 'a polished turd' when we cook in a world where by that doesn't even need to be fucking pasta at all. I'm sure it's small batch and baked after a blanch, but it could be resembled pork with meat glue and formed with kelcogel for fuck sake. It could taste like literally anything. Honestly it doesn't appeal to me personally, but don't let the illiterate hillbilly "I don't eat off square plates" mentality sway your attempts at creative dining </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should learn to handle eggs. They are legit miracles. Fried, poached, coddled, scrambled, mother sauces, Zabaione, Meringue... 
They are all remarkably easy just a matter of a quick internet search and some mild practice. Eggs are readily available everywhere, quick, easy and the diversity will keep your tastebuds interested and help every meal all day long.

Other than that learn to roast potatoes properly, a lot more can be done with them but it's easy, effortless and a great side
