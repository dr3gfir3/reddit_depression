	<TEXT> Webdesign and website creation is a time demanding process, and needs a lot of knowledge and skills, so it is not very cheap. I'd not expect $12k, but maybe something around $8k would be reasonable.

That's the reason most small businesses create their own websites using software for beginners, like WebsitePainter or LogoMaker. It works for them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is great news. All the software I am working on is using it, and it is a very complete and stable framework. I prefer it over Qt, which is somehow more popular. And for all the people claiming they have not yet seen a complex software using wxwidgets, take my 3d editor, [Coppercube](http://ambiera.com/coppercube) as example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Zombies would really be the obvious choice for this type of game, right. :) It's planned more as simulator game, but since everyone loves Zombies (including me), I'm thinking about adding a selection of apocalypse scenarios to be chosen from in the beginning, including probably also zombies. :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **EndTime at Home**

Working on this game for only a few weeks now, and just released a tech demo last week. It's a post-apocalyptic simulator game, implemented in HTML 5 (using WebGL), and happens in a huge, entirely procedural generated world. The basics of the world generation engine are implemented, and it already creates simple terrain, trees, houses and streets.

	<TEXT> Recently, I get a lot of game press releases wrongly submitted to [gamedevnews.com](http://www.gamedevnews.net/). And they have horrible, horrible content, so I wrote a short blog post about what to pay attention to when promoting your game using a press release here: [Some tips for promoting your game using a Press Release](http://www.subject46403d.org/pivot/entry.php?id=1394)

Very basic tips, but Might be useful.

	<TEXT> Yes, also really like your work with libgdx :)
It's not that bad actually once you wrote a wrapper for unifying the API calls a bit. iOS: Planned, but not sure when. JS in Flash: I first thought about porting one of the JavaScript VMs to Actionscript, but actually, you can just use the VM of the Browser where the flash app is running in easily in Flash, using the ExternalInterface API. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think programming and doing graphics both kept the balance, it was about the same amount of work. What I didn't anticipate was that creating levels, quests and dialogs also was quite a lot of work. For now, I'm not planning a new game for the near future, but I definitively will create another one some day, since gamedev is a lot of fun. </TEXT>

Since I also did 'Darkness Springs', and I also did all those graphics, believe me, Gates of Destiny was a bit crappier :) </TEXT>
