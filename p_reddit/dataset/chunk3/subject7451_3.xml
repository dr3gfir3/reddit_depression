	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't remember a lot of details, unfortunately.  But some years back I remember discussing with a friend a book in which it turns out that the Bible and/or religion was created by Satan as a way to deceive us.  It might have been...no I don't think it was written by Kazantzakis.  Though over the years I did link the 2 books (and The Satanic Verses) in my mind.  For obvious reasons I guess.

Anyway, thank you for any help you can provide!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any good informational sites about verbal tics? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-27 05:45:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I apologize if this isn't the right place to ask this.

My son, 8, a brilliant and gentle little boy, earlier in life (around the age of 4-5) had a kind of throat-clearing tic which eventually went away.  Over the past few months, he's developed a kind of purring, cooing sound that happens mostly when he's...well, I think of it as kind of in an unfocused resting state--while he's playing, in bed getting ready for sleep, and so on.

I'm just beginning to educate myself about what might be going on.  I don't think he has ADHD; I just haven't seen any other symptoms.  OCD maybe.  His focus has proven to be strong at times, and he's had a fascination with his belly button that seems to appear at times of stress.

Though generally we've protected him from most forms of stress, (in my ignorance) I'm wondering, if it's not neurological, whether it might have environmental causes.

Also I'm wondering if it's something he'll outgrow.

Anyway, we're preparing to talk with his pediatrician, possibly to see if an extensive blood test might provide some insight, maybe a neuropsych consult.  

We're not discussing it with our son at all; don't worry about that.  I find the tic somewhat comforting; it's just my little boy being himself.  But I worry that if it continues it might become a social issue for him one day.

Thank you for any help you can provide.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about increasing memory on Galaxy S5 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-26 14:32:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi.  I have a Galaxy S5, and I'm trying to figure out how I might increase its memory.  Right now I don't have any real reason to, but I'm trying to learn how to make the phone more useful to me, so I figured I'd ask.  
  
Currently the phone has what I think is a little sim card which, based on what I'm reading online, only can hold a relatively limited amount of data.  If I wanted to increase the storage capacity of the phone, what would I need to do?  Buy another SIM card?  Or would it be better for me to buy an SD card?  And would I basically need to swap the cards back and forth?  
  
Would I interfere with my cell phone's functionality if I installed a different card?  (Seems like I'd read that these cards were how the phone companies identified their customers' phones.)  
  
Sorry for so many newbie questions!  But thank you very much for any info you can provide. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any way to slow down The Witcher (first game) for a modern machine? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-15 14:17:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I wanted to replay it, and instead of reinstalling it from my original disks, I took advantage of the Steam sale to download it.  But the game runs a little fast; Geralt zips around almost like he's on ice.  This is particularly noticeable when he's standing still, then starts to move--in effect he glides for the first several steps.

It's not as bad as really old games, but....

So I figured I'd ask if anyone knew a way to slow it down?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not a B movie; probably like a D movie.  Black and white almost certainly.  
  
I seem to remember the woman's husband had died; maybe the aliens had taken him over.  Whenever the eyes would get superimposed onto the screen it would mean the aliens either were controlling the person shown or trying to communicate (I don't remember).  

I seem to remember it had some innocuous title like *Night People*.  But nope that's a Gregory Peck movie.
  
It is *not* Killers From Space (though those aliens have big eyes).    
  
Thanks in advance for any help! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-05-04 13:48:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After receiving advice here about which type of 1440 monitor to buy, I ordered [this one](http://www.amazon.com/Acer-XG270HU-omidpx-FREESYNC-Widescreen/dp/B00VRCLHYS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8 qid=1430740115 sr=8-1 keywords=acer+xg270hu) from Amazon.  The first arrived with 2 little scratches in the lower right.  So I contacted Amazon, which facilitated an exchange.  Then, when I unpacked the second one, I saw that it had these weird streaks, which looked almost like rub marks, near the lower right, very close to the area where the scratches had been in the other one!

I was very careful unpacking them and I'm certain I didn't cause the defects.  Particularly given how new the monitor is, I'm curious if anyone else has encountered this problem?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've seen [here](http://www.geforce.com/whats-new/articles/nvidia-g-sync-worlds-first-144hz-ips-monitor-unveiled), [here](http://www.cnet.com/products/acer-xb270hu), [here](http://www.pcworld.com/article/2863745/new-acer-27-inch-panel-brings-ips-144hz-and-g-sync-to-a-high-res-monitor-at-last.html), and [here (Acer's own press release)](http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/press/2015/151682) that the XB270HU has displayport and HDMI connectors.  

But I've also seen [here](http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/reviews/acer_xb270hu.htm) and [here (Acer's tech sheet)](http://us.acer.com/ac/en/US/content/model/UM.HB0AA.001) that it only has a displayport connector.

Does anyone know which of these conflicting statements is correct? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> As of this minute my life has been longer than either of my parents </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-28 05:22:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's a strange feeling.  My father died when I was very young, my mother a few years later.  I'd grown up with a sense of loss, thinking of my father maybe not so much as old, but simply an adult.  

I'd passed the number of years he'd lived a couple of years ago.  I can't say it was cathartic; there was no great revelation.  Not even of my own mortality, as I'd lived with that sense my entire life.  Just a realization: my father's life encapsulated.  In the time I'd had.  As incomplete as my life had seemed, it was all the time he ever was to have.  Increasingly mystified by the fact that I first became a father at the same age as my father.

And then this, like the tolling of a clock, ticking down the intervening years.  To see my mother's life as a whole.  

What a hard life she had, trying to raise children on what I once calculated was the equivalent of about $5.80/hour in today's dollars.  What an unhappy life she had.  She would come home at night, sometimes cry.  For years.  Read books.  They were her respite.  Zane Grey.  Doc Savage.  Science fiction.  Anything to take her away.

I was her hope.  She used to tell me I would support her in her old age.  The joke was on her, though.  On us both.  

I still don't have answers.  Except that we don't last.  None of us.  My parents.  All who've come before us.  Your parents.  Me.  You.  

We are the universe expressing itself as human.  Yet it tires of each word so quickly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seem to remember, way back when the game first came out, that in one of those big vertical silos in Blight Town, a glowy was out on one of those horizontal logs, and you had to do these really harrowing drops to get to it.

But recently I haven't seen it.  Am I imagining this?  Or am I just missing it on the latest play-throughs?

Thanks for not making too much fun of me about this.  I'm hardly an expert in the game.  I just like it a lot! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How to teach an 8 year old about light? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-12 04:28:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My 8 year old is somewhat advanced mathematically. For instance, I expect him to be learning calculus by the time he's 10. So he can handle slightly more advanced considerations in science. 

He is asking me these days about light, and I would like to explain issues like wave lengths to him in a way he would understand, but I'm not sure how to do it.  He's seen a prism, of course, but I don't know how to explain how it works to him.

Would anyone know of any resources I could use to teach him about light, frequencies, wave lengths, heat, and maybe very basic explanations of quantum issues?

I'm pretty sure he could grasp concepts quickly if I just knew how to teach him.

To give you an example of how I helped him understand gravity's effect on space, I showed him [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTY1Kje0yLg).

To introduce him to the idea of air resistance and Einstein's idea that gravity may not exist I showed him [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E43-CfukEgs).

I don't necessarily need a video.  A book aimed at an 8-10 year old's vocabulary would work too!

Thank you for any suggestions you could provide.

	<DATE> 2015-01-11 01:36:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Title is kind of convoluted.  I wasn't sure how to describe it, though.

But a South Carolina mother gave birth to twins (29 weeks) moments after being involved in a car crash--then died.  The newborns of course are in critical condition.

I don't have anything to do with this father or his family.  Never met them.  I just read the story.  

And [the story is heartbreaking](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/dying-pregnant-mother-newborn-twins-death-dad-article-1.2072447), but apparently entirely authentic.  The employees of the restaurant where the mother worked have set up [a gofundme account here](http://www.gofundme.com/AshtonHughes).

Quick note to the mods: if this doesn't belong here, please remove it.  It's just so incredibly sad.

I've got to quit reading about things like this.  I can't take it.  But those little ones need help.  </TEXT>

Copy and paste, then bold the team you think is going to win for bragging rights.  (Never seen the point in guessing the score.  You can put it if you want I guess.  But it's not necessary!)  

I'll start.

**BAL** at NE  
  
CAR  at **SEA**  
  
**DAL**  at GB  
  
IND  at **DEN**

Yeah yeah we could've done the wildcard round, but I didn't think of this until just now.  So maybe next year we'll start earlier!

Probably there's a better way to do this.  Hm.  Oh well.

	<TITLE> DSFix causes glitch with boss health bars? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-10 20:45:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As long as I've been using DSFix (updated to 2.3.1 today), I've had a glitch with bosses' health bars.  I get a big yellow bar near the middle of the screen, then a smaller red bar near the lower left.  As I damage the boss, at first nothing happens.  Eventually the red bar begins to drop until I kill the boss.

Has anyone else had this problem?  Any suggestions on how to correct it?

I generally have AA off (in game and in DSFix).  This happened on my old system and on my newer one, so I don't think it's related to my hardware.  In any event, I run Win7 64 bit 16M RAM and I have 2 GTX 780TIs.

Thanks for any info you can provide! </TEXT>
