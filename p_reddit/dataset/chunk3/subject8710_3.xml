So this Persian chick that I met goes clubbing 24/7 and I don't know about the UK but clubbing in Toronto is expensive as hell. $40 to get into the club, $20 for parking, $10 for smokes, $20 for food, $100 per bottle, etc. it all adds up week after week.

How did Mike Ditka turn the Bears into a Super Bowl winning team and what was the "46 defense"? Also, who were the standout players during that season from the WR, RB, TE, QB, etc.? And also their standout LBs, CBs, etc.? 

Chicago also drafted William Perry who was a DT in the draft that year in round 1, how did he turn out? 

Chicago went 15-1 that season, losing to the Miami Dolphins, what made the Dolphins so good that season? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's an article I found from a few weeks ago: http://dairylandexpress.com/2016/10/17/packers-aaron-rodgers-brett-favre-comparison/

Honestly, the stats between the two are so similar it's really surprising. 

Take a look:

*Rodgers record in those eight years was 80-39 (.**672**) with a 7-6 playoff record, two NFC championship appearances, and one Super Bowl title.*


*In Favres age 25-32 seasons, he went 86-42 (.**672**) with a 9-5 postseason mark, three NFC championship games played, one Super Bowl title and a second appearance.*

Between the two, who do Packers fans, NFC North fans, and football fans in general feel is greater? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Favorite Halo pro of all-time? (MLG) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-13 17:44:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been following Halo since the early days of Halo: CE - like I'm sure a lot of you guys have been as well. I've watched so many different players and teams dominate throughout the years in each era (Halo 2, Halo 3, etc.). 

If I were to pick a favorite pro, I'd have to go with Tsquared. 

Final Boss was the most dominant team in Halo's history by far but T2 and his team, Str8 Rippin, were just as dominant and even better at times. I remember watching T2 on MTV's True Life and along with Walshy, he signed a quarter-million dollar contract with MLG - a first in eSports if I remember correctly. T2 always had personality and skill which I why I liked him.


Honorable mentions: 

- Ogre 2 

The most winning-est player in Halo's history. The numbers speak for themselves. Ogre 2 was one of, if not the greatest slayer to grace the game. 

- Karma

4 of the top 5 highest-earning Halo 2 players were from Final Boss. The other 1 was Karma. One of the other greatest slayers to grace the game. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For me personally, I'm a huge fan of Starcraft and always have been (see username) but it wasn't the first eSport I got into.

Back in the Halo 2 days, I got heavily into Halo and the Halo eSports scene. With Halo came organizations like MLG which further propelled the popularity of Halo. I remember teams like Final Boss, Str8 Rippin, Carbon, etc. who were the prominent teams in those days. Fast forward to Halo 3 and the popularity of Halo got even bigger with tournaments all over America. And, as far as I can remember, Halo was the first eSport where we saw mammoth-sized contracts in gaming. I remember Walshy, Tsquared, etc. signed MLG contracts for a quarter-million dollars. In the mid-2000s, that was ridiculous money and even today, that would still be considered ridiculous money. 

Halo for me will always be one of the pioneer eSports in terms of what it did for gaming and what it did to legitimize this sport that we all love.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After the end of World War I in 1918, thanks to the [Treaty of Versailles] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_Versailles) Germay was forced to accept responsibility of the war. The Allied Powers forced Germany to disarm, make territorial secessions, and pay reparations.

According to TIME magazine, the reparations Germany was ordered to pay equal [$402 billion] (http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2023140,00.html) in today's money which is a ridiculous amount. I'm interested in how did Germany go from broke, battered, and ruined overall to a global superpower yet again in a mere 2 decades after the end of World War I.

French was lingua franca of the world to the point where all countries in Europe spoke French - even aristocrats in Imperial Russia spoke French. This [book] (http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057%2F9780230597037_6#page-1) states that King Louis XIV (1600s) is responsible for the rise of French as the world's lingua franca as he demanded French replace Latin in Europe as the language of commerce, diplomacy, etc. French also remained the lingua franca of the world for centuries well into the late 19th century and early 20th century. It still remains the official language of the UN, the EU, the Olympics, and FIFA however it obviously isn't the lingua franca of the world anymore. Although it is still spoken over a wide area from France to Belgium, Switzerland, central Europe, Africa, Asia, the Caribbean and Canada.  </TEXT>

I couldn't find an .edu source but...

according to investopedia.com (http://www.investopedia.com/articles/markets-economy/090516/10-countries-most-natural-resources.asp) China and Russia both rank among the top 10 countries richest in natural resources. The disparity between the resources Japan had compared to what Russia and China had was huge. Therefore, what were the reasons both Russia and China lost? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A Google search reveals that Napoleon's Grande Arme consisted of approx. 680,000 men at Napoleon's height of power. Those numbers are impressive even by today's standards as the number of active personnel for countries like Russia, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, etc. is around the same number. However, I know that size does not and never will win wars. What made the Grande Arme so successful in terms of tactics, innovations, formations, and things of that nature?

Napoleon even almost conquered the Middle East:

	<TITLE> Canadians: Is it worth it to learn Spanish? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I speak fluent English and I'm semi-decent at French.

However, it's a numbers game and outside of the US and Canada, literally every other country in North America and South America bar Brazil speaks Spanish. Of course French is still spoken in Canada, Europe and Africa so it's still a great language to learn and as Canadians for jobs, government, etc. But I would like to learn Spanish to travel to Mexico, Cuba, Colombia, Argentina, etc. and conversate with Spanish women and enjoy Spanish culture.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Spanish Empire vs. British Empire </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm Canadian and my first language is English and I know this is an English sub therefore we all may lean towards the British Empire in terms of historical importance. However, I also speak French and I'm aware that French is nowhere near as widely spoken as Spanish.

More people speak Chinese in terms of sheer numbers but all those speakers either 1. reside in China or 2. are Chinese.

Spanish and English are spoken over such a wide area throughout the world. Spanish is spoken in Europe, North America, South America, the Caribbean and other parts of the world. English is spoken in the UK, US, Canada, Australia, the Caribbean, etc. The official numbers put English and Spanish at both over 500+ million speakers throughout the world. 

Spain claims that they had the world's first global empire under Queen Isabella. England claims they had the world's biggest empire under Queen Victoria. Both empires were extremely wealthy and possessed powerful navies. The similarities between the two are endless. 

In relation to the time of their existence to their legacy upto today, which of these two empires would r/history consider to have a bigger legacy?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As a Terran player, I enjoy a competitive PvZ from time to time. 

There has been some good PvZs throughout the years but I think my all-time favorite would have to be the 2014 GSL Season 3 semi-final (Zest vs. soO). Zest vs. soO is among my favorite rivalries in Starcraft history and they've had some memorable series throughout the years. soO defeated Zest to advance to the finals of the 2014 GSL Season 3 and one of the most memorable games I can remember was set 3 where soO proxy hatched on Overgrowth. I've seen a lot of Zerg players throughout the years but few have been as intelligent, cunning, and strategic as soO.

	<TEXT> For me: 2014 Hot6ix Cup semi-final (Zest vs. MarineKing)

2014 was a year of Protoss dominance. Just to give you guys an idea, in the 2014 GSL Season 1 there was only 3 Terrans. From January until July there was a Protoss in every single premier tournament final. MarineKing returned after switching to League of Legends and was up against the Protoss at the forefront of Protoss dominance in 2014 - Zest. Zest won the GSL Season 1, the GSL Global Championship, semi-finalist of GSL Season 3 and was the finalist of IEM Toronto. And although r/starcraft 'experts' favored Zest, he lost. One of the best TvPs of all-time. </TEXT>
