	<TEXT> Miss going out and be able to start talking to  a random person  and make  a  friend. Now most people  would prefer online  chatting. I used  to just go  out  and do things. Now people do  things to get  likes on Facebook and Instagram not necessarily only to enjoy things.  
People are easily replaceable now. You can add tons of  people  on social  media to  distract yourself. You can talk  to  someone else if  one annoys you. Basically, we are losing  meaningful friendships and relationships because  replacing them has become easier  than  ever.  
Likes and followers on  social media gives people a false ego boost. They start to  think they are the real deal while in reality no one cares   about their likes.  </TEXT>

As much as the society doesn't accept it,  truth is  that looks will always give you an upper hand and wealth will always  determine your value in the society. Poor person has no  friends or at least not more than a handful. World is a cruel place for many people. Life is just so absurd. One  day you are  living  and  the very next day you might not be here. Seems so surreal. It's like an illusion.

	<TEXT> Who are never serious. I get having humor is important but it shouldn't mean  you always  have to joke.  Sometimes  it is  important  to be serious. I  have a friend  who is  never serious and as  a  result nothing gets done  whatever I plan with  him. He also thinks  he can start his own business  but I don't think  it is possible  with that attitude. You have to  be stern and serious at times to  get the  work done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. You know what sucks more? When I started college  I hung out with different people and most of the girls I hung out with kept glued to their phones not talking to me when I was right in front of them. I tried talking to them and they'd talk back  but immediately after  replying would check their phones again. It was quite disrespectful and I started questioning myself. But  then most of the girls were doing this and I just thought  maybe that's what today's  people actually enjoying doing. It was so stupid.  
Or maybe there is something wrong with me but really people are always glued  to  their phones now a days. A lot of people would rather text than  to talk face to face. </TEXT>

Your smile makes me feel alive.  


Your eyes hide so many secrets  


I want to know whats hidden in there.  


 

I never felt this way before  


Until I saw you and met a beautiful soul  


Youre a diamond among dull stones  


I admire you so much,  


You might never get to know.  


 

Keep moving forward, the world is yours  


Ill stay here and remain indoors  


All my troubles, I wont allow to be seen  


I will live like a slave but will make you my queen.

	<TEXT> My close friend talking about him and his relatives all the time. And the guy gets upset when  I talk about job struggles as we are college  students and  it's going to be  tough for us when the pressure rises to get one. He says I am "overwhelming" him with that stuff but if he doesn't acknowledge it then it's going  to  hit him so suddenly. I don't see any point in running  away from  real world stuff.  
The thing that annoys me is that he tries to filter the conversation. When I talk about anything that might be uncomfortable for him he starts telling me he doesn't want to  listen  but then he'd bore me to death by talking about his relatives/cousins and himself. Also, he refuses to appreciate anyone else's art and thinks he is hot shit. He has  a decent singing voice and  he records small clips of him singing then  goes on  to send those clips to  everyone he knows. It was okay at first as I thought the guy just wants feedback but it's been  getting ridiculous because he starts sending the audio clips as soon as he meets someone  new. As if he is just trying to impress others and is not too serious about singing. Also, he  sends the  audio mostly to girls and not guys. I have really started to feel that he is just trying  to impress girls and that looks like a huge show off.  
I would like to call him out but we have  been friends for a long time and I'd see him regularly for 2-3 months more or maybe 1-2 months more  then I am planning to slowly drift away. It feels  like our friendship has been getting dragged for a long time now because instead of feeling good about seeing him I have started to feel annoyed  by him. I think we have  changed a lot. I want to maintain the peace so I wouldn't want to end it on bad  terms.  
I am telling myself to keep at it and after  a few months I'll be able to move on with my life and then see him once in a while. Some people might perceive me to be a "bad" friend here but honestly, I think as a friend it is his duty as well to listen to me and let me express myself freely. I think if I am having a trouble regarding something then he needs to listen and offer advice. During our conversations, it's mostly him speaking and me listening. I think once in a  while, he  should let me express  myself too and just listen but nope, it doesn't happen.  
Now just the several weeks back, I was talking to him about my worry for money as my dad  hasn't been working for years and my relatives are pressuring me to find any job because..well, my father doesn't work and he never will. So, I was  telling him that I am getting desperate for money and the next day dude  comes up to me  and tells me he has found a website that pays for clicking ads. Then he goes on to tell me about a  trick he discovered  that  allows him to  watch more ads than he can with a standard membership. I was like "you're a great guy, buddy. Helping me out like this. Now, tell me the trick so that I can earn more money as  well." The dude refuses  to tell me the trick and says it's for only  him and he won't tell anybody including me. I was like "wtf dude! Then why the fucking hell you told me  you had  found a trick?" It felt as if he was rubbing salt on my wound. Thankfully, due to my good brain I found an alternate  way to make some money  but jeez! I shouldn't be hanging  out with a guy who knowingly tries to fuck  with me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that guy is me now a days. I often say things  in a  heartbeat  these days to people  because I  never give a fuck about what  they think. If it hurts them, let it hurt.  
Recently a girl who I know sent an audio clip of her singing  and I straight up  told her she  needs  a  lot of practice while  others  were giving  her  false appreciation.  
Also, I always imagine if some  day somebody laughs at me for doing whatever thing I am doing, I will tell them that- "Laughing at  me  won't  make your life better."  
I have been being too honest these days and people often assume I am being a pessimist while in reality I am just being a realist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So far dropping out of college after  being  1.5 years in. I dropped out in 4th semester and it's a 3 year degree  in my country. I dropped out due to a number of  factors but mainly it was due to very poor grades. I wasn't ready  for college and I got thrown  into one  where I had  to commute daily for 3 hours overall. I  think it could have been  prevented  very easily if I  treated it just like school as  in  my country, there really  is no party culture and people live at  home so being in college is a lot like high school 2.0. I could have   gotten average  grades simply by showing up and taking  tests. </TEXT>

Give it time, engage yourself in hobbies, exercise etc. The truth is you will take a lot of time  to get over  something  like that. You have  memories attached  to that person.

	<TEXT> I found it better than any other social media. It's like it's a club which has clubs within it(subreddits).  
You can join anything that suits you and it's entertaining. Much better than Facebook, twitter, instagram and snapchat. People really connect with each  other here with stories and it's  a fun place  as well.  
Facebook glamorizes the lives of  people  and it's  not  a true portrayal of real life.  
Reddit can be  a huge waste of  time  as well  depending on how you use  it but  it is  surely more entertaining than  any other social media. </TEXT>

When I  went to college I  was overwhelmed by the  fact there   were grown ups  over there and my peers were so  confident and you know..looked like big people. It  took me one and a half years to realize I myself am a  part of them and I am legally an adult now as well.  It took me so long to realize this  because I  was always sheltered by  my parents. I never realized when  did I grow up lol.  
So, the question is  do anyone  know how to  adult or you just go with the flow? </TEXT>
