	<TEXT> Well this song...this song. I love this song. People diss the cheesiness of the lyrics, but they need to understand that the entire album is cheesier than a slice of provolone. But that doesn't stop it from tasting great when put to this music (or on an italian herbs and cheese bun). They all blend so perfectly, it'd just feel wrong to hate it.

That said, this song is a classic that I wished they did live. It's a very unique Rush song, so cool. The acoustic guitar is a beautiful touch and the lyrics, be a bit cheesy, are the flavoring on top of an already rad song.

	<TEXT> I mod /r/Rush and I made a kik group specifically for the younger age range there as we're quite a minority there. It's worked really well, is a lot of fun, and has introduced us all to a lot of great new friends. Is there something similar for /r/thefence or should I make one?

Edit: please PM me your kik and I'll add you to the group I just made for this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a new Coheed fan, but I love these guys. I saw them at Royal Oak in January and am likely seeing then in Grand Rapids this fall. I think the music is astonishing and some of the smartest song writing I've heard, the prime examples being the Prog classic that is 21:13 and, my personal favorite, the slight dissonance in The Velourium Camper II. But I digress.

I know their discography is all part of a story, but is there a site that tells the story song by song? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Happy post-America day, guys! Today we get to finish our run through Counterparts. This song, I feel, is very underrated and often forgotten. I think that if it had been on Test For Echo it'd get more attention, but being on an album with Animate, Cut To The Chase, Nobody's Hero, among others, hurt it.

	<TEXT> OH MY GOD. Okay, I absolutely adore this song. The lyrics are amazing, the bass line is rocking, the melodies are haunting, the everything is so amazing. It's like...oh my god. How about that solo? Or the drum work? The bluesy, almost countryish, feel to the rhythms and chords. I so wished they played this on R40! Honestly, I may put it on my top 10 Rush song list.

Not to mention its use in the Clockwork Angels universe as an unlimited energy source. So awesome.

Anyway, this song kicks SO MUCH ass! It's one of my all time favorite songs to play on bass and always so much fun to jam to. The ending is especially great where there's room to improvise. But let's not ignore the drumming! He's going absolutely psycho on this track, I love it. Probably one of the coolest ones on this album.

It would be better placed in Vapor Trails or Snakes And Arrows, two more bluesy albums, but here it seems to just get masked by everything else on CP.

That said, it's a good song and would be a blast to see live.

	<TEXT> Welp I've already fucked the listen through up but I hope I can be forgiven.

This is a wonderful song and was the first I heard on Counterparts. Its theme is very heavy hitting and philosophical. What *is* a hero? Is it the woman battling cancer, the lifeguard saving lives, or the model on tv that gives young women a positive outlook on life? Or is it all of them?

I feel like this song is extremely relevant with what happened recently in Orlando.

 It's a depressing yet awesome song with an unsettling yet great video too.

* Black Waterpark
* Damnation
* Heritage

If I'm not huge on screaming but am using Opeth to get there. Are these three good starting points? My favorite bands are Rush, Genesis, Dream Theater, Gentle Giant, Yes, all the prog classics

Edit: 2 songs into Black Waterpark, it's super fucking good, already one of my new favorite bands </TEXT>

This is a decent song, but a bit similar to Cut To The Chase. I used to mix the two up and still do sometimes but more rarely. Honestly, it's one that changes from good to eh depending on the day. The music itself isn't super varied or catchy, not much to see here.

I went to do the links and realised that I was thinking of Cut To The Chase when I was praising this song so I fixed that.

	<TEXT> IIRC Shattered Memories was a reimagining of Silent Hill 1 and I loved SM, it's in my top 3 for the series.

Recently I got Downpour and it feels so much like Silent Hill 2. The horror aspect is very similar and one that we haven't seen in a while from this series. The heavy focus on melee weapons reminded me of 2, the enemies, the very minimal appearances of the Big Bad, and the lore building all remind me of aspects of SH2. Am I wrong about this? I think I am, but it just feels like this. </TEXT>

This will be a quick post as I'm at a coffee shop about to work on a review, so I'll just say I love this song. It's great to sing, air drum, and play bass to. That sexy flamenco style is so in your face, I love it! This song also follows my belief in the anima and animus, or the feminine part of a man and masculine part of a woman.

 Just another winner, pours his life down the drain. Just another island in a hurricane. Just another loser, like a cat in the rain. Just another day, ace up in the path of a speeding train.

Yet another bright happy sounding song with a kind of depressing meaning. You live your life how you want (that's how I interpreted it at least). The synthesized voice reads contradictory terms, my favorites being:

 Hindu muslim catholic creation / evolutionist

All of those religions based on a story and faith and one based on a scientific theory

 Minimal expressionist post-modern neo-symbolist

Those who are emotionally closed and those who are the exact opposite

 Arm chair rocket scientist graffiti existentialist

The logical and the emotional

 Deconstruction primitive performance photo realist

Those who destroy and those who create

...

You get it.

Pretty much you live your life on the one side that you choose and you're putting the entire course of your life on the line.

**Cut To The Chase**

I love the light synths in the background, the guitar part on the verse is classic and catchy, the bass is simple but fun, and the vocals are sassy. The drums don't much stand out on this track. It almost feels like a song off of Power Windows if it were lightened up about 70%.

	<TEXT> ***R40 documentary and reissues that we haven't seen before:***

 Aside from prepping the 40th anniversary deluxe edition of 2112 and a documentary of Rush's R40 tour that is looking to be released in 2016's fourth quarter, Curran is pouring over the catalogue to prep long-unavailable titles for reissue, digitally, on CD and on vinyl...

Possibly meaning live stuff getting a re-release among other things?

***Strong chance of new music:***

 "If I was a gambling man, I would say those guys are going to record some more music," Curran says. "The live component is certainly a question mark with Neil, but they're still quite young at heart. I don't see those guys sitting still for too long and we'll be working with them in the future."

***Al plays Rush classics at charity show:***

	<TITLE> LISTEN THROUGH - Neurotica </TITLE>

	<TEXT> **The Words Of The Profits**

 Fortune is random, fate shoots from the hip. know you get crazy, but try not to lose your grip. Life is a diamond you turn into dust looking for trust, and I know that you just don't get it.

**Lessons**

Neurotic: "often or always fearful or worried about something." [(Source)](http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/neurotic)

-Ica (suffix): "acollectionof things that relate to a specific place, person, theme, etc." Also commonly used as a feminine form. [(Source)](https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/-ica)

Erotica: "literature or art intended to arouse sexual desire." (Source is just Google)

Thus I think Neurotica is about...I really don't know. Maybe women being constantly anxious of men? That's all I can think of.

**Cut To The Chase**

It's just a fun song with kind of goofy lyrics, cool instrumentation, and just a fun feel overall. Definitely an overall favorite!

	<TEXT> **From The Pages Of History**

 I don't believe in destiny or the guiding hands of fate. I don't believe in forever or love as a mystical state. I don't believe in the stars, or the planets, or angels watching from above. But I believe there's a ghost of a chance we can find someone to love and make it last.

**Cut To The Chase**

If you don't like this song I don't know if we can be friends. This is hands down the best song on the album (in my opinion). The melodies are so calming, the synths are in the background but still very present. The guitar solo is absolutely classic and the way the song flows is absolute perfection.

Lyrically, I think this song is up there with the best work he's done ever including Freewill, Hemispheres, Limelight, among others. It once again is a cliche meaning (love) that is tackled in a unique fashion that doesn't glorify love but also doesn't shame or deny it. This is a prime example that his writing is just as good as before.

The live performances are also really awesome. ~~It's a shame they didn't do any after the RTB tour.~~ I wish they played it at R40, the one show I saw.

	<TEXT> Now that they've announced a South American leg, what do you think will follow this. I think that they'll do a reverse Metropolis 2000 and will do a regular tour after this with few Astonishing songs. I'm sure they won't do a round 2 tour as, though it was an amazing show, it's too controlled and feels like watching a movie.

What I'd love is a Neverender type tour from them. A Neverender tour is a thing that Coheed And Cambria does where they play an album in full. My personal pick would be Octavarium because listening to the album in full is awesome enough, imagine a live version! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is gonna be a quick one because I have family matters to attend to. Really, this whole listen through has made me fully realise how busy my life gets which is both good and bad.

Pretty much, I love this song. It's really relaxed and, while the anti-war meaning is quite cliche, Neil nails it in a pretty unique way, but not as unique as tomorrow! The chorus is really awesome and beautiful.

	<TEXT> I used to hate this song, but I'm not sure why. The intro is really cool, the verse isn't any cheesier than the rest of the album. The chorus's vocal line has almost a country type feel to it but is super catchy. The guitar part is great and so is the drum part. The bass is very average but the synths make up for that. It's really just an awesome song even if it is kind of odd.

The bridge reminds me of the little xylophone+bass break down in Marathon slowed down.

	<TEXT> I think this is a good song, but it really doesn't live up to the pure awesomeness of the classic Gangster Of Boats Trilogy. It's very catchy, but is a bit *too* repetitive.

But looking at this seriously, what would the other 3 parts be? Personally, this is what I think is best fitting:

1. Limbo
2. Leave That Thing Alone
3. The Main Monkey Business
4. Where's My Thing?/There It Is

	<TEXT> What do you guys think of The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (the album) I think it's awesome and the second disc is my favorite. How about you?

Edit:

Every inch in this album is packed with what seems to be a million metaphors, references, and meanings. It's truly a masterpiece and probably one of the most complex stories of the last 100 years.

 If you think it's pretentious you've been taken for a ride. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 15 and am at the crux of the hormone change. I can't feel happy, I can't do work, I can't do anything. I constantly feel suicidal while I've been able to resist it. It feels almost like something's latched onto my back and is trying to destroy me. I know high school is only 4 years out of many but it feels so stressful and so daunting. What do you watch/listen to to get through this? I've really latched onto Rush but I need something visual. </TEXT>
