	<TEXT> I couldn't agree more with this, When it comes to the more advanced areas of Rust I'm still a beginner and trying to understand code that uses only names like foo, bar and baz makes the code incomprehensible to me. I really wish blog writers especially would stop doing it.

Edit: I actually went and read the Traits chapter and it really does just adds to the complexity of it. I really don't know why it's so pervasive in the Rust community either, maybe it's just me or maybe it's just I read more Rust posts but in other languages there doesn't seem to be anywhere near the number of Foo, Bar or Baz's.

	<TEXT> EconomyGerman trade surplus swells to fresh record

Germanys bloated current account has long been the fodder for the countrys economic critics.

Well, some some more fuel arrived today. Germanys balance in goods, services and payments with the rest of the world  known as its current account  has now grown to a record 30.4bn in March, its highest monthly reading to date, writes Mehreen Khan.

Measured on a quarterly basis, the current account swelled to 65.7bn in the first three months of the year, according to the countrys statistics office.

Europes exporting powerhouse also saw its trade surplus hit a record 20.6bn in March, as it managed to sell goods worth 107bn compared to imports of 80.9bn.

Germany exported 62.6bn worth of goods to the European Union, and imported products to the value of 53.9bn from the bloc.

On the one hand, thats a good sign that foreign demand has picked up despite jitters about a slowdown in global growth.

But only yesterday, the International Monetary Fund issued another warning about the size of Germanys dominant trade position with the rest of the world, arguing the country should use its considerable fiscal space to fund infrastructure rather than racking up bumper savings.

Mario Draghi has also hit out at the state of Germanys sizeable trade surplus, arguing that it has helped push down interest rates in the eurozone.

**Germany has also long fallen foul of EU budget rules which limit member states to running current account surpluses of no more than 6 per cent of GDP. The current account is set to hit 8.5 per cent this year, compared to 8.8 per cent in 2015, according to the European Commission.**

Useless for things like paper. About 100% of trees can be pulped to make paper, hemp is about 50% and it's also more expensive.

thorium

I really don't get the obsession reddit has with Thorium, like it's an interesting avenue to explore for energy generation but what benefits is there in comparison to classical reactors that use plutonium / Uranium? Why not just go all in with Gen lV reactors which already have experimental reactors up and running ([BN-800](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BN-800_reactor)) or are at least under construction or are being planned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> IDE support is literally the only keeping me from diving into rust more. It's happened a few times now contributing to the compiler where I'd run the command to build and run the tests only to have it fail to compile after an hour or hour and a half (my laptop is slow very slow) because of a simple thing like leaving out an ` ` before a variable but if I was using an IDE like Visual Studio it'd be picked in an instant. Even with small programs that only take a second or 2 to compile it's still very irritating because every time you compile there could be another little error that is only picked up after a compile failure. It's only after trying to program in rust have I come to appreciate all those little red underscores when programming in C# in Visual Studio.

The compiler support there is now for the like Visual Studio Code also isn't incredibly useful, I'm using RustyCode which does help but Racer seems to spend more time crashing than working and for beginner like me there was an awful lot of overhead just to get it up and running (if it even is set up right, I'm not really sure) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Hopefully AMD can light a fire under them again.

I've seen this said countless times on this sub and other places around I just don't understand what people are expecting. Silicon is dying, like we are at the very end of pure silicon cpus, it isn't possible to get massive gains out cpus anymore all the low, medium and most of the high hanging fruit has been picked, there is nothing left. 

Even if AMD does knock it out of the park and even matches Intel's CannonLake in every way it still won't make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things because that could very well be the final pure silicon cpu AMD releases and Intel is in a much better position to design, manufacture and release a post silicon cpu. It was posted here a few days ago how Intel have made a massive Photonics breakthrough which shows they are once again on the cutting edge of cpu design and thinking in terms of the future not present like AMD. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll never understand the mentality people have that Intel are somehow being willfully slow making progress and that they don't innovate anymore. Intel is fighting multiple wars on multiple fronts and is winning everywhere and people seriously think Intel is sitting on their laurels doing the absolute minimum to soak up inordinate amounts of money. Their only competitor in the desktop area is Amd and Amd's latest, boom or bust, possibly last hoorah cpu is estimated to be about 2 generations behind Intel at release just in terms of speed (not even comparing things like TDP, Branch prediction, how good the caches are etc etc all things that make a massive difference in the grand scheme of things). Then there's Intel's foundry advantage which is still ahead of TSMC, Global Foundries and Samsung, Samsung is way bigger than Intel and the other 2 are completely dedicated to the foundry business and still none can catch up to Intel.

It followed the decision in 2011 by Mr Donohoes predecessor, Leo Varadkar, to instruct the NRA to withdraw its application to An Bord Pleanla for the M20 because the economic downturn meant capital funding for the estimated 720m cost of the project was unavailable.

...

The NRA had already spent 15m on the planning application for the M20.

	<TEXT> You should be able to debate things without resorting to petty insults. 

CaisLaochach is everywhere in this thread questioning why we need to focus investment outside of Dublin even though he admitted in his own comment above that the other cities in Ireland are underdeveloped. They're as ignorant as they come.

Any who, the point of investing in Cork, Limerick and Galway is to increase traffic between them. There probably isn't the traffic to justify it *right now* that doesn't mean that with a motorway and the necessary investment in each city that there never will be. Also I see the Waterford motorway as more proof of centralised investment in Dublin, no major projects would get built unless Dublin was involved, a motorway from Cork to Waterford would've benefited both more than Dublin and Waterford are benefiting from their motorway now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There doesn't seem to be any original thought here tbh. I don't follow this sub too closely but it just seems to be the equal but opposite of whatever the racists and fascists of reddit say. In regards to the migrant crisis in Europe the feeling I get from this place is that all should be rescued and brought to European shores no real discussion of how to solve it or what to do once they land on the shores. 

Same with the economy at large, complaining that capitalism is ruining the world and creating inequality and saying that everything would be better if everything was state owned (or worker owned, whatever) isn't a solution. You actually need to provide answers on how to organise the economy, how you'll grow it, how you'll get people to start businesses that flourish etc. 

I really think there should be a new socialist movement that completely and totally breaks away from the past, because I think that's one of the main problems: Focusing on the likes of Lenin and Marx et al and what they thought. Those men lived and died so many years that their opinions on organising a modern, technological economy aren't valid. </TEXT>
