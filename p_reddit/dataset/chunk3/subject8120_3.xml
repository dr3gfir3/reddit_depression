Not bad, I would of taken a few players before Rice. WR is fine. RB is fine. QB is fine. You will most likely make the playoffs as long as something doesn't go wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That sucks. I know for about a 5 month span I was feeling like that and was having panic attacks on a daily basis.

I ended up going to see a therapist and havent had one since. He taught me some breathing techniques.. But i'm not sure that you are having panic attacks right?

anyway here is a link to some breathing techniques that he gave me. (it's acutally him doing this) http://www.hillcounseling.com/DeepBreathing.mp3

	<TEXT> So I haven't posted in awhile here, mainly because i've stopped having my panic attacks that I used to. I just wanted some opinions on something though. I have had a chronic shoulder pain for over a year now. Some background (i play softball and through with this arm too.) The pain/tension that i have radiates from the back of my shoulder blade to under my armpit to my collar bone. Sometimes I do not notice these pains. If I run or exercise I feel good for awhile but it always comes back. I still have a higher level of stress but i'm haven't had a full blown panic attack in almost 4 months now. (I have had xray's done on my shoulder and found nothing) I think the biggest concern is that i have some sort of cancer there (i don't know why)

In short... Could this pain in my shoulder be caused by anxiety or should I get this checked out by a doctor and go get an MRI?

I just want the opinions of others on this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ativan will only help with the short term effects (panic attack) it's not to be used for daily medication, in fact doctors will not let you stay on it because of the addicting affect it has on people. Not saying this won't help but it's not a long term solution. Antidepressants will probably be more effective in the long term if you are intent on taking drugs.

	<TEXT> This guy has the right answer. Also running eases stress too. I have the same issues always worried about my shoulder and if I have cancer in it when in all likelyhood ive just hurt it playing baseball with a rotator cuff injury. But ive came to the realization that my shoulder doesnt hurt when I dont think about it and when I exercise I feel great.. ive been on the fence for awhile about going to the doctor to get a mri or something on it for over a year now. But keep having these moments where it just goes away for awhile and then I change my mind.. I can say that ive been without a panic attack for over 4 months now. I always felt crappy on meds and decoded I didnt want to be dependent on a substance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You will get more bias toward Xbox on this subreddit. Just like you would have more bias toward a PS4 at r/ps4

My take on the consoles is this. (in a very brief format)

* If you like to play multiplayer more than single player Get X1 (I fall into this category)
* If you only play single player get a PS4 </TEXT>
