He told me that the one episode adventures end and get replaced with a season/series long adventure with more filler episodes? Is this true? Please someone tell me it isn't. When does this change happen? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why are non rhotic accents dying out in the South? For example, my grandfather had a one hundred percent non rhotic accent and was born in Northern Virginia (Winchester to be precise.) I was born in Northern Virginia as well (about fifty miles  away from Winchester) and I have a non rhotic accent too. Though, not many other people do around here. Why is this accent dying out?

Examples of a non rhotic accent:

"River" is pronounced "Rivuh" 
"Spider" is pronounced "spiduh"
"Winchester" is pronounced "Winchestuh

This isn't homework, I'm genuinely fascinated. </TEXT>
