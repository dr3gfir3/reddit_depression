	<TEXT> We will be getting a 12 week old male soon in addition to our year and a half old female. At the start he will obviously sleep in a seperate crate for housebreaking, training and general comfort. However, I'm just curious whether or not we should/could crate both together eventually? In my head I think it would be good for them because our Sky sleeps with us on weekends and loves it. On the other hand I don't want to put then in a situation that would cause them harm or discomfort. Any advice? </TEXT>

Doesn't the distinction create more beurocracy and hassle between the two departments? In Ireland we just have the Garda Siochana who police rural and city areas. The city police simply have better equipment and are more concentrated. Granted we have a less gun crime. </TEXT>
