	<TEXT> I have a memory of knowing that the Russians put a man on the moon. The memory is not actually seeing it as I saw the US landing but rather is a recall of the knowledge I had of this - one of the things I knew - as I was growing up.

I even have a memory of finding out it wasn't true and recall being somewhat shocked - I can't recall when this was exactly but I would guess about age 12 (I was 5 when the US moon landing happened and recall seeing this).

It's an abiding memory that for a long time I 'knew' the Russians had also put a man on the moon (more than once) and though they lost the Space Race they still succeeded in getting there.

I can recall a kind of graphic image with the US flags showing the US landing and 2 (I think) Soviet flags showing their landing areas. It was in some book but again, I cannot recall which. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to eliminate toxins from plastics for health reasons and was wondering if anyone else is into this issue and can help with a few questions I have?

I'm thinking Bezoya is the best bottled water out there but does anyone know if the plastic they use is free from BPAs? I know Brita filters are but that doesn't really give the purity I want in terms of water - tap water here is not good. 

If the plastics are not BPA free then would filtering the Bezoya water eradicate them?

Pretty clueless on this so any input I'll be grateful for!

	<TEXT> It has some merit... God is **No Thing**

".....whats wrong with at least one argument still advanced as a clincher by anti-religious polemicists. Everything must have a cause and the cause of everything must be God: so the atheist paraphrases the religious case. But, the atheist continues, if everything has a cause, so must God. Argument over: the idea of God cannot function so as to avoid an infinite regress, so the religious case falls to the ground."

"But Shortt points out that, whether or not you accept the argument in anything like this form (and he notes that recent analytical philosophers of religion have found some plausible ways of restating it), the secular advocate has misunderstood a basic point. Whatever can be said of God, God cannot by definition be another item in any series, another thing (hence the books title)."

"The claim made by religious philosophers of a certain kind is not that God can be invoked to plug a gap, but that there must be some fundamental agency or energy which cannot be thought of as conditioned by anything outside itself, if we are to make sense of a universe of interactive patterns of energy being exchanged. Without such a fundamental concept, we are left with energy somehow bootstrapping itself into being."

	<TEXT> Yes, it was taken down and made into a cushion which implies that if it was haram as a curtain but not haram as a cushion (when you could still see the figures on it) then there is a difference ascribable to usage.

I tend to think that the problem was that a full length depiction of a human in the dark *could* possibly trick someone into thinking it was a real human and this would very likely be under the prohibition of 'attempting to create' life.

I think where something was clearly *not* an attempt at rivalry with God in this way it was seen at that time as ok. Also the prohibition was only really ever in a religious context - which is why there are thousands of paintings of the Prophets but has never been an illustrated Qur'an or mosque. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. No. 

2. No such command. 

There are many depictions of the Prophet. I could link you to about 10 right now off the top of my head. 

It is - supposed to be - part of a wider ban on depicting images and applies not specifically to the Prophet but to all human forms. The thinking behind it is kind of literalist: that the only point in making an image of a person would be to try to rival God by creating something. Obviously not something allowed. 

Clearly though the early Muslims did not think that this was the point of creating such an image. 

Muhammad let A'isha play with dolls, had cushions in his home with human figures on, protected the painting of Mary and Jesus in the Kaaba from destruction. Omar had a censer for incense in the mosque with human figures on. 

And many other examples - as well as the hundreds of paintings we have of prophets and people. </TEXT>

My landlady was murdered in her flat. I've also had numerous confrontations in the street. It's not common but it happens and it's getting worse.

	<TEXT> The fact that ISIS kills other Muslims doesn't make them any less Islamic. Look at Islam's history and you will find lots of instances of Muslims killing other Muslims and still being considered authentic Islamic movements or branches of the religion.

I was not claiming they were less Islamic because they killed other Muslims. 

I'll be clearer: If person A kills person B over a dispute over who is 'right' because they have opposing views then at least one of them is 'wrong'.

I'm sure there's been many revivalist movements within Islam that have sought to 'set it all right. Just look at the Wahabis.

ISIS are Wahabi

Likewise ISIS is operating based upon their reading of the Koran, and they are not the first Muslims to promote this interpretation.

*upon their reading of*

I suppose you need to draw a distinction between the actual thing and a reading of the thing.

If you look at sex magick  (sorry for this example, can't think of another) it is not the lead-up or release but that nanosecond after where the manifestation is 'sealed' as it were. 

I think this is why psychic abilities can't be replicated in a lab. No emotional build-up.

Btw - I don't mean to say emotional build-up is not part of it, it is - but it's not where it happens... that happens when you 'wear it out' as it were and go beyond it. It's essential to have the emotional part in order to transcend it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's more about what Obama's understanding of the term Islamic is, not mine.

Well yours plays into it as I think is reflected in your question - it would not be confusing if there was general consensus would it? At the very least, as you admit, your understanding is different to Obama's so one of you at least is wrong. 

Obama claimed that ISIS was not Islamic. By this he meant that they were somehow not reflective of the teachings of Islam. Based his logic then should it follow that the Inquisition could also be said to not have been Christian?

So are they reflective of the teachings of Islam? I would say clearly not. 

I don't have to quote Hadith and Qur'an here (though that could certainly work as an argument) we can just use logic:

* ISIS kill Muslims
* The rationale for this is that these Muslims are not really Muslims - ie not ISIS
* So one of these groups is *not Islamic*
* Which one is most likely? A new group arising after 1400 years or the communities that have existed since the early days of Islam (ie the ones getting killed)?
* Following on from this, if ISIS are the true Muslims, and they only just showed up - how could Islam be the 'false Islam' for 1400 years? With nobody trying to set it all right till the 21st Century? Did it only just get noticed now?

We can do the Scripture thing with your Inquisition meme:

Jesus (founder of Christianity): Do not kill. Love your enemies. Forgive those that do you wrong. 

Inquisition (Product of Schismatic Sect 1000 years or more later: we are going to kill, torture and not forgive. 

I suppose it comes down to what point you need to make how you deploy this info but I am pretty sure you'll see some contradiction. Again, the question is more which one is more likely to be correct - the original idea of the founder or a doctrine that contradicts from centuries later.

In a historical sense Obama is obvious wrong in his understanding. I think that the Inquisition should be considered a Christian issue, just as ISIS should be thought of as being an Islamic one.

Interesting. How do you get from the Sermon on the Mount to the Inquisition - theologically. What is the process? 

I know many right-wing US 'Christians' are into guns and war and think Jesus would be the same but here's the thing: they're batshit crazy. And they can't justify their position. 

Can you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, but I should clarify. I don't mean to say that Muslim groups and sects have not created dogma but rather that they are free to do so as the minimum requirements of belief leave them a blank canvas to do so as it were. 

I think the idea of Allah/God as creator is kind of a side-issue in Classical Islamic thought. It's not that He's not seen in that role but more that it doesn't really matter because the only existent thing is essentially God. Or rather, Islam envisages a time where everything that ever existed will no longer exist. Except God. 

I don't think the mythic view is really in line with Feynman. More possibly akin to Joseph Campbell. 

The idea is not that God was invented to explain anything at all - the Muslim thinkers had science for that - but rather the conception is more that they think there is a non-material 'space' which they see as the Imaginal realm, a liminal place which they relate somehow to the cause of being. This is called *alam al-mithal* - interestingly Dune uses this motif, speaking of sci-fi:

http://dune.wikia.com/wiki/Alam_al-Mithal

The Imaginal realm is a place where archetypes manifest as signs and can thus communicate with the 'real world' though this Imaginal world is held as the real world and the place where we really exist. "Heaven" and "Hell" would be archetypes in this world. 

It's hugely complex and a whole field of philosophy in it's own right. Mostly from Ibn Arabi but Henry Corbin is the modern scholar most associated with it. 

Some people associate it with Jung's Active Imagination and I think his accounts of Philemon etc would be in line with it.

	<TEXT> Also, it seems heightened emotions promote stronger phenomena.

Disagree completely. I think the opposite is true. 

In magical ritual (for example) the aim is to heighten emotion - this is the purpose of the ritual, dire warnings, trappings, demons etc - to the point where one transcends it. 

It is in the 'space' created when desire is transcended that 'paranormal' phenomena or mystical experience happens. The heightened emotion is just a means of exhausting the emotion. If you don't get past that nothing will happen. Ever.

You can verify this quite easily just by pondering it. Nothing ever happens in high-emotion scenarios like football matches, scary movies, religious rallies, TV shows which specialise in drumming up emotion. If your initial contention were true it would be happening all the time every day.

Oth, meditation aims at the same thing: getting past emotion and desire to the place of 'nothing'.

	<TEXT> Well according to the god a lot of people worship, it is immoral.

No, according to *their understanding* of what they think their God is it is immoral. 

If morality didn't exist outside of this alleged creation heaven and hell would serve no purpose, since morality wouldn't exist there.

Unless the concept is a mythic one. Or allegorical. 

This is a poor analogy to the human condition and the hypothetical existence of a deity, unless you are admitting there is more than one god.

Now lets say there is only one being, and that being makes a video game, I don't know why the only being in existence would do this but lets just roll with it. The only being alive makes a video game, but the being who is making this video game finds sex and violence to be reprehensible. 

This being then programs the video specifically to not only include the possibility of sex and violence, but programs it in such a way that sex and violence has to occur in order to complete the story the video game tells. The game designer then punishes all the virtual people, who he programed to be violent sexual deviants, after the game ends for doing things the programmer doesn't approve of.

You're assuming that what the video game 'God' appears to want is the same as the 'Programmer God' wants. This may not be so. 

If I program a game with a serial killer in it and I model this serial killer on myself in looks and character.... well, you know where I'm going. 

Now you understand why religion makes no sense to some of us atheists. Humans are allegedly set up to fail from the beginning, then punished for failing, despite being created to fail.

Yeah, I do understand that. And I feel the same. The God that the atheists reject is exactly the same God that I reject. The atheist criticisms of religion I pretty much agree with. 

The difference would be that I don't think that's all there is and it's case closed - I would argue that there's something else beyond those obvious fallacies. The strange thing is that I get the same objections - from a different angle - from fundie religionists as I do from atheists. Both of them have agreed on a definition of what is 'on the table' in the attic and one is arguing that it is there and the other arguing it is not there.... but both are agreeing that the question of whether there's 'something on the table in the attic' is what's at stake. 

I don't think 'what's on the table' is even at issue. I think there's more interesting stuff in the basement.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. In some way. 

I kind of like the model of existence being a 'simulation' that is quite in vogue nowadays. I don't believe it literally obviously but the characters in the simulation clearly would not be able under any circumstances to apprehend the nature of the programmer - let alone 'prove' one existed - unless the programmer had programmed that possibility into the software. 

My take is that God just didn't program that in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While it's possible to point to scientific errors in the Quran, I think the practical problems brought up are much more important. We're talking about core values here - whether religious belief or critical inquiry should be considered as the basis of our values. 

I would dispute some of those claims on the Wiki- there are people with an agenda on both sides and neither are really objective. Generally people need Arabic and a good grasp of Islamic theology to get into it properly though and a lot of people on both sides have neither. Maybe that's for another place.... happy to discuss it elsewhere though!

To claim that science and religion are wholly separate domains is to claim that neither affects our behavior, which is clearly not the case.

That's different though. At least in Islam's case. In Islam there is no priesthood or orthodoxy and no dogma to a certain extent. So it really can't conflict. An example of this would be that there are Muslim theories of evolution way before Darwin. 

The question whether science and religion can be reconciled is beside the point, as that very reconciliation has to be done on one basis or another. The real question is: Which one we look to first, when they at least appear to be in conflict?

Yes, I think that is the question. The answer depends on who you are and how you self-define. There may not be a 'right' answer.

Obviously a fundamentalist would reach for religion first but it isn't either/or. If it was then the Medieval Muslim scientists would not have been what they were as they faced this issue. 

From Wiki:

"From an Islamic standpoint, science, the study of nature, is considered to be linked to the concept of Tawhid (the Oneness of God), as are all other branches of knowledge. In Islam, nature is not seen as a separate entity, but rather as an integral part of Islam's holistic outlook on God, humanity, and the world. The Islamic view of science and nature is continuous with that of religion and God. This link implies a sacred aspect to the pursuit of scientific knowledge by Muslims, as nature itself is viewed in the Qur'an as a compilation of signs pointing to the Divine."

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relationship_between_religion_and_science#Islam

If we look to the scientific method, which, on a societal level, is freedom of speech and inquiry, everything can be critiqued, improved upon and cast aside if found lacking. If we look to a religious belief of any kind, that core belief is beyond reproach. The belief can be positive, but it is immutable. Even if we allow for critique (which arguably only lasts for as long as there is no real danger of losing societal control), it is only to prove that very critique wrong. There is no real openness for change, as long as belief trumps logic.

That's not true in Islam, I can't speak for other religions. Or rather it **IS** true now because of literalism and fundamentalism but it's not part of the original religion.

Originally there was the concept of *ijtihad* which essentially a belief that if God created humans as logical and rational then the exercise of logic and reason would lead to God - they could not lead anywhere else. So therefore questioning God was not a problem if one was looking for Truth. 

Obviously things have taken a different turn and that is far from the case these days. 

Now, on the original topic, I think that thoughts like this can be explored by any author regardless of their background, as long as they have the openness to do so. Orwell was born in British India. Nietzsche was studying to become a minister. To diminish a writer to their background (or lack thereof) is not only short-sighted, it just doesn't work.

Yes, I agree. But my point is that these things overlap even if they have different and seemingly opposed labels. Nietzsche is a good example, his view was impinging on the Islamic in many ways and I think he even wrote about this. 

This is especially true with science fiction, where the whole point is to surpass the limitations of everyday ideas.

Yes, that's why this is all relevant - isn't that what religion is too?

The only real point of contention is (imo) *literalist* interpretations as opposed to mythic interpretations. I'd argue that religion, by definition, is mythic and that those who misunderstand this (believers or atheists) completely fail to grasp it. 

A classic example is the people who believe that the 'winged horse' in Muhammad's vision as outlined in the Qur'an is literal. Many Muslims believe this literally (despite it being obviously a vision and stated as such) but also many atheists claim that this is what Islam teaches: literal actual winged horses exist.

This is the problem. If people read religion in a mythic way there would be less problems. I think the article is suggesting Islam is suited to this and that it is a viable way forward - not Islam *per se* but the mythic approach which Islam encapsulates.

	<TEXT> Let's break it down into two contentions:

1 I disagree that Islam is fine with science.

2 I don't think I'd get a great response if I went into a mosque in Saudi Arabia and said "God doesn't exist! You're all wasting your time".

These are two different concepts and you have linked them in an unscientific way.

2 is true (though your application is wrong as claiming God does not exist is not science) but it does not relate to 1 unless you can prove that Saudi are representative as a benchmark of what Islam is. Which is not possible because it is not in fact the case and can be demonstrated to be such. 

But getting back to 1. You'd need to prove this and I suppose the way to prove it would be from core texts rather than the behaviour of people who *follow* core texts.

	<TEXT> Not really. Allah is the word for 'something that is uncreated'. It is not a name. It is a word that translated into English is taken to mean God (which it does) but which in Arabic can also mean Reality or Truth. It is not a person. 

There is a verse in the Islamic tradition that says "everything that exists passes away except the face of Allah" and conversely implies that whatever does NOT pass away is Allah. 

Really it all boils down to a belief that 'there is something that has no beginning and no end'. There is nothing in science *per se* that would disagree with the possibility of such a thing on principle. 

Another way it's often put is that everything you see or can conceive of (ie everything measurable or observable by science and everything that ever could be) is a 'thing'. 

If you take the position that only 'things' could ever exist it is not a scientific or rational position. 

So if you take a metaphorical list of all these possible 'things' that ever existed AND you admit the possibility that there might be something that could possibly be off the list because it is NOT a thing. Then this is how Islam sees God.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But I'm guessing what /u/hauty-hatey means is not that a Muslim cannot be a scientist, but that the ideas of faith and reason are based on completely different values.

If he is then I agree 100%. Which is why you can't apply scientific reason to personal conception of God's existence. You CAN critique religious thought, that's different. 

I think this is why the Muslim scientists saw no conflict with faith and science btw too - they realised they were too separate things and kept them apart. 

Today science refuses to keep the two distinct. We need to look at which approach is the best way.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Science and religion (of any type) are not good friends. Science draws conclusions about the world from research and logic, while religion works by assumptions and faith. The agenda of both is irreconcilable.

Which is why I suppose the Scientific Method as we know it was developed by Muslims who in turn were making scientific discoveries we still use today.

The Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) used experimentation to obtain the results in his Book of Optics (1021). He combined observations, experiments and rational arguments to support his intromission theory of vision, in which rays of light are emitted from objects rather than from the eyes. He used similar arguments to show that the ancient emission theory of vision supported by Ptolemy and Euclid (in which the eyes emit the rays of light used for seeing), and the ancient intromission theory supported by Aristotle (where objects emit physical particles to the eyes), were both wrong.  Alhazen viewed his scientific studies as a search for truth: "Truth is sought for its own sake. And those who are engaged upon the quest for anything for its own sake are not interested in other things. Finding the truth is difficult, and the road to it is rough. ...

Ibn al-Haytham also employed scientific skepticism and emphasized the role of empiricism. He also explained the role of induction in syllogism, and criticized Aristotle for his lack of contribution to the method of induction, which Ibn al-Haytham regarded as superior to syllogism, and he considered induction to be the basic requirement for true scientific research.

	<TEXT> Well yes, obviously. A God with attributes in the sense you outline would fall into that category. 

Islamic tradition has certainly historically lapsed into this on occasion historically but I think it's quite clear in Islamic philosophy that no-one can know God. The nearest one can get - in an Islamic sense - is apprehending the way He manifests in Creation. On the whole Islam never really defines God. It may outline what God 'wants' or, rather, ways to approach 'God' but it never defines what God actually is. He is just God.  

These are slightly different issues though they are interesting. Things like the 72 Houris and the punishment for 'sinning' - I agree, these would not occur in a natural sense. 

This is why they always come from some form of Scripture or other purportedly revealed text/doctrine in religions. One can argue that these Scriptures come from God directly or they do not - but that's slightly different than the 'natural' approach and obviously, where the trouble starts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I disagree. 

Santa presupposes the following:

*An older gentleman wearing red clothes who inhabits a region in the colder climes of earth though is, to all appearances, human, and who employs a regiment of non-human helpers to construct gifts which he delivers during the course of an evening to children on the basis of their behaviour during the year which he records.*

I submit to you that none of the above would occur naturally to anyone contemplating the possible origin of a present they had come into possession of. 

God, on the other hand, has none of those accoutrements - not in the sense I am using it, I am merely using the term as shorthand for 'a Creator'. 

If you mean the *Christian* God specifically or Zeus, or Shiva or A God with defining characteristics then I agree... this would be analogous to Santa but that is not the sense I am employing the term. 

Of course, as you know, Santa is obviously in effect the Christian God (ie a specific being with defined characteristics) once removed. So he is essentially the same thing.

For sure if one was somehow growing up on a desert-island and able to observe flora, fauna and the stars above, I believe the question of where it comes from would occur. Questions of where life comes from and whether it is created or accidental I think are also naturally occurring. "God" would be merely the postulated creator of these existing entities.

	<TEXT> I guess I mean that most of us can be seen as normal humanity who are seeking the answers to the questions we generally discuss under the religion/spirituality banner.

Not everyone is interested in this but those that are we can call Seekers. Sometimes Seekers convince themselves they are Finders. Then you have religion. 

They do this self-convincing because they connect with some truth in the system - ie that Jesus or Muhammad or whoever had found the answer. In a way it's a cop-out - to not tread the path yourself but to *believe* instead in someone who did. In fact religion encourages this - the last thing it wants is for a follower to actually BECOME like Jesus or Muhammad. So it makes an artificial divide between us and them - calling them "God" or "Holy" or whatever so as to differentiate them. 

But really we can be what they are. To some degree. "Realised" for me means someone who has reached the full possibilities of evolution open to them.

Yeah it can be. But the legal ruling of what constitutes a Muslim is someone who subscribes to the *shahada* which is affirming "There is no God....... except God. And Muhammad is a Prophet of God". 

As long as you believe that you're a Muslim. It's a pretty mystical formulation too if you think about it. Affirmation and Negation. Also 'God' is held to be undefinable and can be rendered as 'Reality' or other terms. Actually, this 'looseness' is what makes Islam traditionally so rigid in some sense paradoxically - you can have an ISIS under this umbrella as well as a Rumi. But that's a digression from books I guess.

	<TEXT> True, I agree. The Islamic Golden Age which produced the scientific discoveries of the day was an amalgam of Muslim, Christian and Jewish thinkers.

But my point is not really about religion per se but rather the degree to which a philosophical conception of God can fit into the sci-fi genre. With Christianity obviously it can't (I don't say this in any partisan way) as to express a Christian theme would necessitate depictions of the Trinity, Jesus, possibly the Vicarious Atonement etc. 

Islam would be more of a blank slate in this respect and there's nothing against (and even quite a lot for) interpretations of God in line with current physics or Quantum theory. You could even shoehorn the Matrix/Simulation models into it and still have no conflict with Islam. 

I think this is what the article meant with its hints at some sort of Universalism. 

As to writing it, I think *any* written Sci-fi could be seen as an Islamic take in essence. Because all Islam really boils down to is: "There is a higher 'something' that we can call God. In essence nothing else really exists". It's a pretty flexible model lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. So write it. Just don't expect others to share this sentiment

Not sure where you got the idea that I did. It's probably been 40 years since such a thing were possible for me and certainly in the last 15 only a moron could really expect more than 1% of any random group to share it. 

Also, science has a tendency to prove some religious views as wrong so if this Muslim perspective means diluting or corrupting the science in the story to fit a Muslim belief, then I would imagine the story would be nothing more than preaching instead of science fiction.

Yeah, Muslims have quite a track-record in science. I guess we know a bit about it having laid the foundation of quite a lot of it. 

But I think you didn't really read my post above - or else I am misunderstanding you here. I hoped I'd quite clearly separated belief/dogma from a wider view but it seems I might not have been as successful as I'd hoped. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is again not taking into account the concept of Scale.

If you create a robot that kills another one in a created mini-environment then do **YOU** have compassion for them?

**Should** you have compassion for them?

You could equally ask does God have compassion for the micro-organism that is one of billions you've killed every day by breathing in. Are you responsible? Is God?

Should you be? 

If you think not then why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're ignoring the concept of 'scale' which renders the question moot. 

Put it this way: if I make two robots and one of them smashes the other to smithereens then am I responsible? Does it matter? 

If I reside in a massive expanding universe and have, in effect, created a tiny insignificant miniverse with a couple of robots in it - how can this possibly have any impact or significance to the main existent reality? 

So what if robots kick their heads in? They might not like it, it may even matter to them, but to use it as an argument about morality on the scale of the Creator of the robots is ludicrous.

	<TEXT> My take - this is from a Muslim viewpoint so ymmv - is that it's seen, at least by Progressive Muslims (probably the only ones reading sci-Fi or even perhaps modern lit lol), as an encompassing paradigm of belief in one over-arching Deity which represents the 'human experience'.

Obviously, by definition, it rules out atheism but it would encompass all other religion and transcend them. In Islam 'Allah' is not a name but is merely the word for God, Reality, or Truth.... Arabic-speaking Jews and Christians use it and atheists discussing God in the abstract as a concept use it.

So the idea would be akin to a sort of 'Star Trek' take where a united humanity of differing races and beliefs set out into the stars with a concept of this 'Something Higher' which they express and search for in the different human ways that we all know. Obviously, as in the Star Trek analogy, when humanity has reached a certain point of transcendence. So it would be 'humans' doing this not 'the US' or 'Russia' or whoever. 

It's obviously a dream (or an ideal if you prefer) but that's why it's Sci-fi I guess. There are numerous books in this genre. I think they may gain traction. It's not religious as such... it's more the world view than any dogma. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also- and this is where atheists go very wrong - religion is not actually a response to natural phenomena (or, as they usually more stupidly have it, 'made up' apropos of nothing) but a response to perceived *numinous* phenomena. 

For example, someone might have a 'mystical' experience and interpret it (rightly or wrongly) as 'God'. Others who don't have that experience believe them and then you have a religion with followers.

Atheists can't admit the existence of numinous phenomena so they aren't in a position to investigate and isolate what it might be if not God. It could well be a natural human experience or even something of evolutionary benefit. 

We probably won't know for a very long time because materialists have defined the terms of the debate - and defined them according to their own lack of perception.

	<TEXT> Very, very badly thought out. If at all. 

First we'd need some evidence. Luckily we can argue that point and look at human history. Secondly we need to make a distinction between religion (as a social construct) and awareness/belief in a God or gods.

Let's go back to when we were in our caves, grunting and pulling women around by the hair (I know some of us still are but work with me here). Most likely on current evidence humans at this stage had a conception of 'something higher' but no organized religious or moral framework. That is to say, acceptance of 'God' was not linked to good or bad behaviour.

If your neighbour in the cave next door was a better hunter and had a cuter wife there was nothing to stop you whacking him over the head with a club, stealing his bison and shagging his missus. None of this would be related to your belief in higher powers. 

Religion evolved to stop this sort of behaviour and clearly early societies are *prima facie* evidence of this. Society basically would not be possible if everything was run along lines suggested by a Neolithic Ayn Rand.

So this would seem to militate against the OP's contention: society would not evolve the way it has with its current legal/moral systems if religion were indeed a cover for bad people to do bad things.

Before religion Bad People **WERE** doing bad things. Without let or hindrance. Why would they need to invent a system to enable them to do it when they already were doing it - and moreover 'cloak' this system as a 'good thing' so nobody could tell their dastardly plan. 

Very poor.  </TEXT>
