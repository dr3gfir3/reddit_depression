	<TEXT> Especially after his comments this weeks, it is not suspicious at all to need emergency surgery for a 12 yr old injury. I'm guessing what he has seen regarding Flynn is so bad that he is getting out asap.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The answer you are looking for is going to vary wildly between discipline, institute, and even lab. That being said, I would count on 55-60 hours a week. Some labs work less, but they are few and far between. A PhD can be intellectually stimulating, but research is often tedious and repetitive. Can I ask why you are interested in a PhD? What do you want to do with it?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These photos are very interesting and capture the essence of new President Obama. There are many photos of him cool and collected, goofing off with his wife and staff. In others, you can see him working, where there are hints on uncertainty with his new responsibilities president. Finally, some frame him alone, showing the enormous weight of responsibility and history on him.  </TEXT>
