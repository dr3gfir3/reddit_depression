	<TEXT> Shit my seminary teacher said today: 
(Copied my comment from another post)

My seminary teacher today said: "There are actually health teachers and doctors saying that masturbation is actually healthy for you and is natural. And that there's nothing wrong with doing it." Blah blah blah usual mormon bullshit. But then a little bit later he says "and if you want to debate whether or not it's healthy, whatever, but we do we stay away from it for health reasons? No, we don't do it because we're told not to. The prophet told us not to. When you're debating whether or not it's healthy, they can give you all the reasons they want that it's healthy, but all you have to say is 'I don't do it because Jesus said not to.' There's a difference in not doing it for health reasons and not doing because you were told not to." 

Well answer me this oh wise seminary teacher: why the hell does Jesus or the prophet care if I masturbate? Oh! And last time I checked "Thou shalt not masturbate" was not one of the Ten Commandments. 

*Quote probably isn't exact, but it's pretty close.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's odd. You must have Seminary as a class in high school? I have mine before school and the teacher is just a calling, so the get called for four years and then are released and also students shuffle teachers every year. 
My parents are relatively strict Mormons. I actually wasn't planning on telling them tell I was out of the house. Because when my brother told them, all it did was cause problems, so I was gonna wait. But then one day out of nowhere my sister starts yapping to them about how she doesn't believe the church. So now my parents think we're in cahoots and so they were really suspicious of me and were interrogating me. And so I just came out with it. It was a big ol' mess, honestly. 

Your decision is going to come down to which is going to harm you less. Your parents knowing that you don't believe or enduring 4 years of seminary. Things often go bad when a kid comes out to his parents with non-belief (from what I've seen) so if you can push through seminary, that's probably the best option.   </TEXT>

He hasn't mentioned anything specific about that verse. I do recall one time when I was young and stupid I said "It's just so hard for me to imagine JS sinning." And his response was "Really? He had a printing press destroyed because they were printing bad things about him."  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't believe they can actually like kick you out of the house; however, they can make your life hell. You know your parents better than anyone here. How do you think they would react? I don't know your parents, but maybe if you told them what you just posted (about the nervous breakdown and what not) they would be understanding? Seminary is tough as an exmo. I'm in my last year of it. I don't know if it's like this other places, but I've had a different seminary teacher every year I've been in seminary. (Is it like that for you?) 


What you need to decide is this: 
If I stay in seminary, will the consequences be worse than if I tell my parents I don't believe? 
If yes, tell your parents. 
If no, I would wait till you're out of the house. 
Or if your parents are like mine and still make you go to seminary even though they know you don't believe, I would wait. 
Best of luck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The last part was like this:
A=Know 
B=believe 
C=think I believe 
D=don't know if 

And then had a series of statements like (these probably aren't worded exact, but close):

Joseph Smith was a prophet of God that restored the true church on the earth and translated the Book of Mormon. 

Jesus Christ suffered for everybody's sins in the garden of Gethsemane and died on the cross. 

The Book of Mormon is the word of God and is the only absolutely correct book on Earth.  

ETC.

I found this mildly irritating. None of those options apply to me. The scantron had an E and an F for sure and maybe even a G, so where's the "know that it's not true" option or the "don't believe" option or even the "don't think I believe" option? It was mildly irritating that it was either know or believe, or don't know. 

Sorry for the irrational rant.

	<TEXT> John Mozeliak said adding the the competition at second base is not unlikely. Meaning they still could sign a second baseman (or I guess even a 3B, but to me 2B seems more likely.) Anyways, there's a chance that the cubs will non-tender Darwin Barney. What do you think about the Cardinals signing him if that happens? His 2013 numbers were atrocious, hovering around the Mendoza line, but his defense is stellar and his 2011 numbers were solid. Probably unlikely, but just a thought I had. I don't know how I feel about it either. What're your thoughts? 


EDIT: Darwin Barney was tendered, so there goes that.  </TEXT>

God: 
"You donated every penny you ever earned to the less fortunate. You started your own charity for the disabled. You built homes and schools for poor people in the slums. You didn't wear the underwear? Get the fuck outta my face."  

And like I don't see how people can't automatically see that something is up. They teach that you can't get into heaven without these temple Covenants and when you make these covenants you HAVE to wear these garments. But then you have to pay them a whole bunch of money to buy the garments from them.
