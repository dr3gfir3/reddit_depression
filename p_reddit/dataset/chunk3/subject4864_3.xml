	<TEXT> There is a learning curve, but it will be worth it. The ASDM actually makes more sense with 8.3+. Don't worry about losing your command line street cred. I've been managing the ASA since it was called the PIX and I never used the ASDM until 8.3 and I don't care if purists look down their noses, it's saved me countless hours.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. I only have one Cisco device on my network and that is the ASA and for what we pay for smartnet you would think that support would be better - just navigating the support site is its own challenge. I guess that's why so many of my colleagues work directly with Cisco partners and leave the mothership out of the loop as much as they can.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sector was ruled by Cisco for over two decades. I know they have a wide product line, but their bread and butter has always been switches and routers sold at high margins. I've been in the IT business for 22 years and I've always felt that Cisco never wanted to cater to anyone but the Fortune 500 and everyone else who wanted to play had to pay. Now, Brocade, Extreme, and other smaller players are offering all of the same features for much less. I hate to see layoffs as much as the next guy, but Cisco has to reinvent at least part of themselves to stay competitive or they'll end up like Microsoft - trying to rule a market that they no longer control.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've had 5 bunnies over the last 10 years and none of them were friendly or affectionate. The closest we came was a huge lop who I think was just too big to move so she let us pet her. Georgie (the marsh that just passed) was there first and outlasted them all. I just assumed that bunnies were more for looking than loving. It's nice to know that there are friendly, affectionate bunnies out there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She never stopped being skiddish and only my wife could touch her - she fed her kitten formula from a bottle until she could eat solid foods. We let her out of the cage a few times a week to run around the bedroom and she tolerated me. I was the bunny housekeeper,  changed her litter box every week and broke her cage completely down and washed it once a month. That with fresh veggies several times a week must have kept her healthy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the problem with critical reviews, critics compare everything to their view of perfection instead of for what it is. Using the Godfather as a yardstick for measuring Happy Gilmore just doesn't do it justice. Critics would not give 5 stars to both of those movies because he or she is comparing them to each other. Happy Gilmore is a great movie for a sophomoric comedy and the Godfather is a great drama. I guess I am saying that's why ratings are crap and objective reviews should carry more weight.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good points! For someone who doesn't want to leave one in the chamber, it does make more sense to at least consider it based on where you are (as one person said on this thread "mitigate risk"). If you're at the house and you have small kids and just are not comfortable leaving one in the chamber that makes sense - you've decided to play the odds. On the other hand, if you're on a long drive and stop at rest stops, unknown places, or other questionable or nefarious locations, leaving one in the chamber would also be a wise way to play the odds.

	<TEXT> I agree with some of the other posts that say it's pretty much like in most places. At some point moving up the chain, managers become less technical for a variety of reasons. Rank and file employees often do not know or understand what their managers do or why they do it. They judge their managers solely on technical merit.

I am not defending your managers because I don't know your environment. Over the last 22 years in IT, I have worked my way up the ladder in a variety of environments with the last 8 as a hands on IT manager in a small department, but I have been on both ends.

I used to think about most of my managers 'what do they do all day?'  Until, the job was mine. I ran into one of my old managers at an IT conference in Orlando. I walked up to him and just apologized. He laughed and said "for what?" I admitted to him that I wondered what he did in his office all day. He must have laughed out loud for 2 full minutes. The he said "It's ok, I used to think the same thing about my manager!"

The moral of the story here is that we only know what we know. I am sure your middle managers are catching hell from their managers who are catching hell from upper management. The higher you go up the chain, the less it becomes about the work or product and the more it becomes about profit and productivity. The low end managers get it the worst, because the usually understand the how and why the most, but their bosses just don't care. To them it's better, faster, cheaper. But in their defense, they have to keep a company competitive in the market. 

I know I drive my most technically skilled guy crazy with my pace and requests, but I have to deal with a bigger picture. 

The take away from all of this is don't think your managers are just being like this for its own sake. Understand that they have a whole bunch of different things they have to provide. It may not make your situation any easier, but maybe it will give you some insight I to the madness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fantastic!  Just downloaded it and gave it a 5 star review. I've been trying to keep this info in my head and sometimes that doesn't help over time when I am trying to track it - especially around things that set it off. I was wondering of there was a way or plan to add some general notes to a day, maybe 500 characters max. I am stopping prilosec after a month or so (I would know exactly how long if I knew about this app sooner) and just wanted to make a note. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I think that long pull is because of the lack of a safety. Agreed, there is almost no reason not to carry it since it's so small. I can't carry at work, but I usually have it most other times.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting that many people, including myself, do not enjoy shooting the LCP, but love it for it cost and concealability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree, the LCP is not an enjoyable gun to shoot, but it's very easy to conceal. It's my first choice as well.  </TEXT>
