	<TEXT> Because I mistook the salt for the sugar while making caramel. Regretted it instantly, thought I could turn it into salt-caramel, until I did it a SECOND time. I bought new a new canister for my sugar after that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trust people. Sorry to say it, but don't leave your bag on a table to save your seat, don't let a stranger hold your luggage or your camera, and don't believe it when a dude comes up to you looking for donations or "bus money." Don't walk alone late at night, and know how much it ought to cost you when you hitch a ride in a cab. Stay vigilant.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Japanese sake. Won't drink the cheap stuff. (I learned this the hard way - far too many hangovers.)    
* Shoes. Found a brand that fits me well, won't buy anything else. Same goes for jeans and bras.     
* Face creams and lotions. I'd rather pay a few cents extra and get the effective stuff. 
    
* Sunscreen. Every day. And generously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess so. But I wouldn't want them to get hurt. I try to have a little sympathy, especially the way that overtures of romance and gestures like that are so idolised in our media. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We both have a fetish for sleep-sex. So, we "should be sleeping," but naturally the right touches in the right places turn each other on. We play that we're still asleep, or perhaps just having a really sexy dream. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rock-climbing did it for me. You're completely focused, and it's very near life-or-death (or at least lots of pain if you're not). When it's over you feel exhilarated, like having come out of a meditative trance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> (I'm a chick, and straight, so I'll just switch the pronouns.)    
    
Not at first - we were just friends for a long time before it got serious. When the crush developed and the relationship began, it was a couple months before I saw him as "the one." Even after seeing him as that, though, there were times when I (momentarily) wanted to give up. We had our stormy fights, but it always ended in an apology, from one side or another. In retrospect, I think that's important, too. Apologies and forgiveness.  </TEXT>

Before that, I saw "Nihon de Ichiban Warui Yatsura" *(English Title: Twisted Justice)* and enjoyed it thoroughly.     
Then before that, I saw the "Jungle Book" live-action movie. I enjoyed that, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Emotional reasons. Sex isn't everything in a relationship - a good portion is just hanging out, living together, travelling together, sharing responsibilities, enjoying good times, holding each other in bad times. Money will be spent in a relationship, it's true, but it's spent more broadly and is more of an investment than a fee. </TEXT>
