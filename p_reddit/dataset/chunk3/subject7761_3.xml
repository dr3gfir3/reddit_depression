	<TEXT> I like Fallout a lot, though I don't play many RPGs. Lots of people here seem to like Borderlands. I bought Borderlands 2 ages ago, so I should probably get round to actually playing it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like the safety of living in a town, having lots of people nearby. But I'm in a flat right now, and really miss having a garden. Not having that connection to the outdoors makes me feel a bit cut off sometimes.  </TEXT>
