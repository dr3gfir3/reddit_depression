	<TEXT> A stake in the heart of Trump Place?

 Concerned about illicit money flowing into luxury real estate, the Treasury Department said Wednesday that it would begin identifying and tracking secret buyers of high-end properties.

 The initiative will start in two of the nations major destinations for global wealth: Manhattan and Miami-Dade County. It will shine a light on the darkest corner of the real estate market: all-cash purchases made by shell companies that often shield purchasers identities.

 It is the first time the federal government has required real estate companies to disclose names behind cash transactions, and it is likely to send shudders through the real estate industry, which has benefited enormously in recent years from a building boom increasingly dependent on wealthy, secretive buyers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Migration is an enormously dangerous topic.  That is because mass migration is a reflection of a world in disequilibrium, driven by inequality and strife.  Anything short of a global resolution of the underlying issues creates pressures which are destabilizing. Unfortunately, simpleminded "solutions" like those offered by Trump and other anti-immigrant populists, appear attractive.  "Am I my brother's keeper?" they ask.  It is a Faustian trap.  Give up your soul and keep your benefits.   Don't feel compassion, don't feel anything for others, and you will be free. That path leads to an endless war of all against all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The assaults are, of course, intolerable.  Respect is at the heart of social solidarity.  That means reasonable accommodation for differences -- whether that is for disability or gender or language or religion, etc.  It is not "natural" nor comfortable to have to be conscious and respectful of others.  But we must bear the cost of diversity if we want to live in free and complex societies.  Those who want to live in walled off ghettoes of their own making, limited to their own kind, do not understand that they are in fact embedded in, and dependent upon, a functioning and complex world.  Their gated communities in fact live in fear of attack.  They cannot trust the servants they hire.  Freedom only becomes sustainable when it celebrates diversity, and structures society in favor of increasing equality in the power of each of us to express and meet our needs.    </TEXT>

People from different cultures are not automatically integrated into existing society, and that society, itself, must be open to some change.  All this requires people who are willing to engage, person-to-person, and to mutually set the terms for a respectful relationship.  It is not easy to get to a happy resolution, but you can be certain it will never happen if we simply assume our common humanity is enough to assure harmony.  What we do know is that exclusion takes us down the self-destructive path of reactionary utopianism.  Purity is a myth, as Germans know only too well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reason magazine quotes one analyst, who finds that undereducated rural residents are dying faster because they're not fit to survive market forces.  And they shouldn't be helped:

  "The provision of subsidies to induce people to stay in that place delays the inevitable. At worst, such subsidies effectively retain the kinds of people who are the least able to adjust, ultimately, to market forces."

Letting the economically weak die sooner is a sure way to raise average income.  At last we have a credible libertarian prescription for reducing poverty, which does not claim that the magic of the untrammeled market will actually make us richer as individuals.   It makes a more modest claim: Collectively, We are richer, when we let market forces do the job of killing off the losers faster.

The cut-line for survival-of-the-fittest is a sliding scale.  It used to be that a growing portion of the population got to live longer.  That is no longer true. Ask not for whom the market bell tolls. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These Commentaries put the Paris Agreement in perspective, from an establishment academic point of view.  Taken as a whole, they show that there is a sea change in the conventional wisdom on long term prospects for energy investments.  The rationale for future fossil fuel exploration and development appears to be reduced to the force of inertia, rather than any more rational calculation.  Yet inertia is powerful.  The Paris Agreement cedes to us all of the arguments, and none of the power.  We already had on our side science, justice, and an appreciation of the adverse consequences of inaction.  Now we have hypocrisy on our side ("Hypocrisy is the homage that vice pays to virtue).  Ultimately it will be social pressure, organized in movements, but also incorporated into a new conventional wisdom, that must be a strong enough force to turn the ship, and take us on a new course, whose end is not the end of the human project.

	<TEXT> Expensive dangerous drill-baby-drill fossil fuel energy has hit a dry hole. But the whole project was predictably unsupportable. It was doomed by the overreach in development of "unconventional oil". It was the increase of supply, from the Bakken and other unconventional plays, that eroded Saudi market share at $100+ per barrel. The Saudis have responded to their loss of power and control in the global market for oil by abandoning monopoly pricing, effectively killing OPEC.  But so far, cheap oil is not enough to reflate a stagnant world economy, and prices have failed to rebound after the shake out.  Meanwhile, new high-cost production has suffered a fatal blow.
Shell's decision to abandon exploration and development in the Arctic sends strong warning to investors.
Shell's CEO in fact exited the project at the first sign of trouble.  He, at least, understands how to abandon a sinking ship.
The NY Times, reporting on Shell's decision, lays it out:
"The decision indicates that even though the oil industry believes the Arctic has major resources, the costs, a tricky environment and other risks are so high in the area that the hidden oil and gas will be difficult to develop if oil prices stay low." 
http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/29/business/international/royal-dutch-shell-alaska-oil-exploration-halt.html

This is a huge loss for Shell, not only in money, but also in credibility.  They had believed their own propaganda rather than recognize the new reality.
Wishful thinking by locked-in investors may convince some to hold on, and wait for an upturn in global demand to save the day.  But would new investors, untied to their previous commitments, decide to place their bets now on Shell and its confreres?  I think not.
The grounds for investment are no longer the same.  New conditions require a new strategy, and urgently so. Leadership is needed among institutional investors to withdraw their stake quickly and responsibly from fossil fuels.
At the Paris COP 21 meeting at least some institutional investors, are putting the developers of new high-cost, high-risk production on notice:  [More Than $3.4 Trillion in Assets Vow to Divest From Fossil Fuels](http://insideclimatenews.org/news/02122015/divestment-campaign-grows-more-34-trillion-assets-vow-exit-fossil-fuels) 

The fossil fuel industry must commit to a new game plan, now, shelving their previous plans, and become part of a sustainable future, or lose sophisticated investors.  And with that loss, the true risk of their practice -- financially as well as to our environment --will become apparent to the wider community of investors.  That is a warning they cannot afford to ignore, and a risk they cannot afford to take. </TEXT>

Deutsche Bank: solar at grid parity in most of world by 2017
http://www.energypost.eu/deutsche-bank-solar-grid-parity-world-2017/

Mohammed El-Erian makes the point that the decline in the price of oil may be long lasting because the objective is to restore Saudi institutional predominance, rebuilding its market share, which takes time.

Elias Hinckley sees the Saudis as playing the fossil fuel endgame.  He has an amazing quote:
       In 2000, Sheikh Ahmed Zaki Yamani, former oil minister of Saudi Arabia, gave an interview in which he said:
     Thirty years from now there will be a huge amount of oil  and no buyers. Oil will be left in the ground. The Stone Age came to an end, not because we had a lack of stones, and the oil age will come to an end not because we have a lack of oil.

These articles should serve as a warning to investors against fossil-fuel holdings.  If the Saudis are letting the fossil-fuel ship sink (carrying off as much of their winnings as possible) then it would make sense for prudent investors to re-balance their portfolios.

The critical question is whether these analyses of Saudi policy are credible.  Can they be easily dismissed as "alarmist"?  If not, what are the implications for decision-makers?

An analysis of long-term Saudi policy options must consider the maximization of net revenue,  Saudi geopolitical objectives, and the constraints they face in achieving these goals.

Let the risk assessment begin!

	<TEXT> Chelsea Manning understands that you can't bomb a hostile sea into submission.  Nor can you sink new foundations to build "from the bottom up" when you are dwelling in a penthouse in a different society which itself has a rotten foundation. We all see the decay here, but deny its implications: "We" are in no position to build a world of justice and opportunity -- the basis of real security -- until we cede our ambition to control other people.

Chelsea Manning does have the answer.  It is what she has already done -- seeing injustice, and doing what conscience demands.   Personal courage rooted in a belief in our common humanity is a motive force. There is no higher purpose than respect -- of oneself and of others.  We need each other's otherness.  We cannot recast other nations as our servants, or even as our clones.  

Because we are not complete, we cannot be closed and be alive. Openness is not weakness. It is what we need: personal connection knitting life's fabric, which has been torn apart.  Refugees become us when they are taken in and respected, not as victims but as peers.  In that human relationship, we change. That is the hope which overcomes terror.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kasparov is right about the folly of allying with Putin and those seeking Shi'a hegemony in the region.  It will only harden Sunni determination to fight.  Terrorism is the last desperate card played by the weak.  It itself offers no hope for peace.  It is endless war, and the weaker party eventually must fail, even if it imposes huge damage on its adversary.  But Kasparov is wrong about the power of NATO to rid the world of such terrorism.  It would be as popular as having the IDF lead the charge -- precisely because Israel's aggressive "self-defense", squeezing the Palestinians into ever-shrinking ghettos, is a moral blindspot for the West.  It makes it impossible to overcome the humiliation-revenge syndrome in the Arab world, which is the bedrock of jihadi nihilism.  The only hope for a healthy peaceful future for us all is to renounce domination, and press, and provide assistance, for changes in Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the whole region, to meet the material needs of their peoples, and open themselves to popular governance.  Israel must understand that it will be defended only if it reduces its ambitions to, essentially, its 1967 borders.  That is the political sea change that offers hope -- a world that young Muslims might be willing to fight to defend against the dark night of ISIS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> private consumption today accounts for only around 38 percent of Chinas gross domestic product. That is a sharp contrast to the industrialized nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, where consumption on average accounts for more than 60 percent of G.D.P....  Because of a reliance on state investment  often in wasteful projects or loss-making industries  the country accrued record levels of debt, which stands at nearly 300 percent of G.D.P.

China's problem is that its expansion depends on raising its market share in other countries.  But that requires it to remain competitive with other poor countries, like Vietnam and Bangladesh.  Raising the domestic standard of living without raising the cost of labor is a neat trick to accomplish.  The only way that could be done is by investing in public goods which allow people to live better, even if their incomes are low -- like public transportation and subsidized housing.  But the Chinese model assumes that final demand will pay back investments.  That's what's not working.  Both speculative investment and Statist planning produce failure.  What China needs is Democratic Socialism.  China needs its own Bernie Sanders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The Unesco director general, Irina Bokova, expressed her objection to the resolution on Tuesday in a stern statement, saying it could be seen to alter the status of the Old City of Jerusalem and its Walls.

 The Western Wall, as part of the Old City of Jerusalem, is a Unesco World Heritage site adjacent to the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, and its protection is central to the Unesco mandate. The protection of cultural heritage should not be taken hostage, the statement from Ms. Bokovas office said.

Perhaps the only good result of the Arab proposal is that the U.N. staff has come out so strongly against their provocative action.  There must be a limit to Israeli ambitions, but limits also apply to Arabs and Muslims.  Sovereign control in a land which must be shared in common is an illusion.  These illusions, acted out, are the transgressions which justify all of the blood, all of the suffering. Enough.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This makes divestment from fossil fuel developers an urgent task for those who are entrusted with our pension funds, and with the endowments of hospitals and colleges. Expensive dangerous drill-baby-drill fossil fuel energy has hit a dry hole. The Obama administration's decision reveals a deeper fact:  the drill-baby-drill project was a bubble -- an unsupportable mirage. It was doomed by its own overreach, pouring billions into the development of "unconventional oil". It was the increase of supply, from the Bakken and other unconventional plays, that eroded Saudi market share at $100+ per barrel. The Saudis responded to their loss of power and control in the global market for oil by abandoning monopoly pricing, effectively killing OPEC.  But so far, cheap oil is not enough to reflate a stagnant world economy, and prices have failed to rebound after the shake out.  Meanwhile, new high-cost production has suffered a fatal blow. Wishful thinking by locked-in investors may convince some to hold on, and wait for an upturn in global demand to save the day.  But would new investors, untied to their previous commitments, decide to place their bets now on Shell and its confreres?  The Obama administration is signaling it is time to stop enabling a losing gamble. The grounds for investment in developing fossil fuels have proven to be a sinkhole.  New conditions require a new strategy, and urgently so.  Divestment is not just the socially responsible thing to do.  Leadership is needed among institutional investors to withdraw their stake quickly and responsibly from fossil fuels.  As we enter the run-up to the Paris COP 21 meeting in December, institutional investors must put the developers of new high-cost, high-risk production on notice:  They must commit to a new game plan, now, in Paris, to shelve their previous plans, and become part of a sustainable future, or lose the confidence and the funds of these sophisticated investors.  And with that loss, the true risk of their practice -- financially as well as to our environment -- will become apparent to the wider community of investors.  That is a warning big oil cannot afford to ignore, and a risk they cannot afford to take. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So who's the maniac?  Here's what Wikipedia has to say:
[Egomania is also known as an obsessive preoccupation with one's self and applies to someone who follows their own ungoverned impulses and is possessed by delusions of personal greatness and feels a lack of appreciation. Someone suffering from this extreme egocentric focus is an egomaniac. The condition is psychologically abnormal. The term egomania is often used by laypersons in a pejorative fashion to describe an individual who is intolerably self-centred. The clinical condition that most resembles the popular conception of egomania is narcissistic personality disorder.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egomania) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The program has been under siege from the start, including from the insurance industry. Before the law's passage, government grants to help them get going were switched to loans. None of that money could go for advertising - a wounding rule for new insurers that needed to attract customers. Moreover, the amount available was cut from $10 billion to $6 billion and then later, as part of the administration's budget deals with congressional Republicans, to $2.4 billion. Federal health officials abandoned plans for a co-op in every state.

	<TEXT> Your economic analysis is correct.  The question is what regulatory intervention would serve the long-term best interest of society (remember, corporations are totally dependent on laws, infrastructure, a healthy economy that can support demand, etc., no matter how much they would like to deny their dependence on the well-being of society). 
We want to allow enough profit to provide sufficient incentive to assure a continuing investment in safe effective pharmaceutical products.  But patent monopolies grant unlimited profits by creating artificial, unnecessary shortages, denying most people the benefits of life-saving drugs.  There must be better solutions.
One way to go is for the government to use its power of eminent domain to purchase selected patents from drug companies, for drugs which prove vital to life.  The cost becomes socialized, and production can be licensed for free, allowing production at generic commodity costs, thereby maximizing availability.  The caution here is that the price has to be high enough to defray the risks drug companies take in developing new products, many of which fail or are not profitable even if they get to market.
What is that price?  That is an empirical question.  It can also vary over time.  Let's say it's ten times the cost of developing a specific drug that is purchased by the government.  That's still going to be a lot less than the monopoly price.  And when you put a value on the lives saved by making a uniquely effective drug available, you have an economic as well as moral argument for regulation, which I believe is compelling. </TEXT>

But climate change is not the only reason to divest from fossil fuel companies. Shell's abandoning ship in the Arctic, after only one disappointing attempt, reflects their recognition that the game has changed. The Saudis can't keep market prices up by withholding their own production. So they've switched from OPEC monopoly pricing to a new price regime: pump up the oil supply, which makes new oil exploration uneconomic. And the world economy is stagnant.

	<TEXT> This is a huge loss for Shell, and not only in money, but also credibility.  They believed their own propaganda rather than recognize the new reality.
What is the lesson to be learned?
Expensive dangerous drill-baby-drill fossil fuel energy has hit a dry hole. But the whole project was predictably unsupportable. It was doomed by the overreach in development of "unconventional oil". It was the increase of supply from the Bakken and other unconventional plays, that eroded Saudi market share at $100+ per barrel, which convinced the Saudis to abandon monopoly pricing, killing OPEC. So far, cheap oil is not enough to reflate a stagnant world economy, and prices have failed to rebound after the shake out.
Wishful thinking by locked-in investors may convince some to hold on, and wait for an upturn in global demand to save the day.  But would new investors, untied to their previous commitments, decide to place their bets now on Shell and its confreres?  I think not. 
It's time for investors to wake up and smell the fumes -- or lack thereof.  Its time to divest from oil exploration.  The end of the bridge to nowhere is also the end of the rainbow.  And there's no pot of gold.  Only a multi-billion dollar dry hole -- under water.

	<TEXT> The subject of Bernie's email note today to his supporters is "Why would Bernie go there?"  This was his answer:

 Earlier this week I spoke at Liberty University. For those of you who do not know, Liberty University is a deeply religious institution. It is a school which tries to understand the meaning of morality and the words of the Bible, within the context of a very complicated modern world. It was founded by the Reverend Jerry Falwell, and the vast majority of people at Liberty strongly disagree with me, and perhaps you, about abortion, marriage equality, and other issues.
You might be asking yourself, "Why on earth would Bernie Sanders go there?" It is a fair question within the context of our modern politics.
I spoke at Liberty University because I believe that it is important for those with different views in our country to engage in civil discourse  not just to shout at each other or make fun of each other.
It is very easy for those in politics to talk to those who agree with us  and I do that every day. It is harder, but not less important, to try and communicate with those who do not agree with us and see where, if possible, we can find common ground. In other words, to reach out of our zone of comfort.
So I went outside of my zone of comfort. Watch this video of my remarks there and read what I have to say about the ideas of morality and justice as they relate to income inequality and other critical issues facing our nation.
The message I gave at Liberty University is that the moral choice is to fight income inequality, and that the just thing to do is to work to make our society more fair. Below are some of my remarks to Liberty from the video above, but I think it is important to share them with you here as well so that you can share with others how I approach these issues.
I am far, far from a perfect human being, but I am motivated by a vision which exists in all of the great religions  Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Buddhism and others  and which is so beautifully and clearly stated in Matthew 7:12. So in everything, do to others what you would have them do to you, for this sums up the Law and the prophets. The Golden Rule. Do to others what you would have them do to you. Not very complicated.
I told the crowd at Liberty University that I understand that issues such as abortion and gay marriage are very important to them, and that we disagree on those issues. I get that. But there are other issues out there that are of enormous consequence to our country and the world and that maybe, just maybe, we dont disagree on them. And maybe, just maybe, we can work together in trying to resolve them.
Amos 5:24, But let justice roll on like a river, righteousness like a never-failing stream!
Justice. Treating others the way we would like to be treated. Treating all people with dignity and respect.
It would, I think, be hard for anyone in that room where I spoke to make the case that the United States today is a just society or anything resembling a just society.
In America today there is massive injustice in terms of income and wealth inequality. Injustice is rampant. We live in the wealthiest country in the history of the world but most Americans dont know that because almost all of that wealth and income is going to the top one percent. We are living at a time where a handful of people have wealth beyond comprehension  huge yachts, jet planes, tens of billions of dollars, more money than they could spend in a thousand lifetimes. But at the same time, millions of people are struggling to feed their families or put a roof over their heads or find the money to go to a doctor.
When we talk about morality and when we talk about justice, we have to understand that there is no justice when the top one-tenth of one percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent. There is no justice when all over this country people are working long hours for abysmally low wages, $7.25 an hour or $8 an hour, while 58 percent of all new income being created today goes to the top one percent.
There is no justice when, in recent years, we have seen a proliferation of millionaires and billionaires while, at the same time, the United States has the highest rate of childhood poverty in the industrialized world. How can we talk about morality when we turn our backs on the children of this country? Twenty percent of the children in this country live in poverty and that includes 40 percent of African American children. There is no justice when, in the wealthiest country in the history of the world, children in our country go to bed hungry.
There is no justice when the 15 wealthiest people in this country saw their wealth increase by $170 billion dollars in the last two years. That is more wealth, acquired in a two-year period, than is owned by the bottom 130 million Americans. And while the very rich become much richer, millions of families have no savings at all and struggle every week just to stay alive economically, and the elderly and disabled wonder how they stay warm in the winter. That is not justice. That is a rigged economy designed by the wealthiest people in this country to benefit the wealthiest people in this country at the expense of everyone else.
There is no justice when thousands of people in America die each year because they dont have health insurance and dont get to a doctor when they should, or when elderly people are forced to choose between food or medicine because our citizens pay the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs. That is not justice. That is not morality. That is simply an indication that we are the only major country on earth that does not guarantee health care for all as a right.
There is no justice when low-income and working-class mothers are forced to separate from their babies one or two weeks after birth and go back to work because we are the only major country on earth that does not have a paid family and medical leave policy. That is not justice. That is an attack on family values that everyone should be appalled at.
There is no justice in our country when youth unemployment exists at tragic levels  with 51 percent of African American high school kids unemployed or underemployed. No. We apparently do not have the funds to provide jobs or educational opportunities for our young people but we sure do have the money to throw them into jails. Today, the United States has more people in jail than any other country on earth, and many are serving time in inhumane conditions. That is not justice. That is the destruction of human life.
I am not a theologian or an expert on the Bible or a Catholic. I am just a U.S. senator from the small state of Vermont. But I agree with Pope Francis when he says: "The current financial crisis originated in a profound human crisis: the denial of the primacy of the human person! We have created new idols. The worship of the ancient golden calf has returned in a new and ruthless guise in the idolatry of money and the dictatorship of an impersonal economy lacking a truly human purpose."
He also states: "There is a need for financial reform along ethical lines that would produce in its turn an economic reform to benefit everyone. Money has to serve, not to rule."
In his view, and I agree with him, we are living in a nation and in a world which worships the acquisition of money and great wealth, but which turns its back on those in need. And that must end. We need to move toward an economy which works for all, and not just the few.
Throughout human history there has been endless discussion and debate about the meaning of justice and the meaning of morality. I hope that by getting out of my comfort zone and speaking with the students at Liberty University that I can be a part of a dialogue with people who might not agree with us. I hope that some of them conclude that if we strive toward morality and toward justice, that it is imperative that we have the courage to stand with the poor and working people of our country.
In solidarity,
Bernie Sanders  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In the starkest sign of how unsettled the situation is, what once seemed unthinkable  that Mr. Trump could win the Republican nomination  is being treated by many within the Republican establishment as a serious possibility. And one reason his candidacy seems strong is a change by the party in hopes of ending the process earlier: making it possible for states to hold contests in which the winner receives all the delegates, rather than a share based on the vote, starting March 15, two weeks earlier than in the last cycle. Ten states have said they will do so. 
If Mr. Trump draws one-third of the Republican primary vote, as recent polls suggest he will, that could be enough to win in a crowded field. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With 41 Senators now in favor of the Iran agreement, it will not be possible to get cloture to stop debate, thus preventing continuation to a vote on the resolution of disapproval.  But this need not be an ordinary filibuster, in which debate is abandoned if the measure under discussion cannot get cloture.  Rather, it would be better for this country's democratic process for this to mark the return of the old way in which filibusters operated: discussion continues, until the Senate votes to withdraw the motion from further discussion (because it is pointless to continue).  That is not an immediate stop to debate.  It allows everyone to make their point to their Senate colleagues and to the country.  Opinions can still be changed through argument, and, if that happens, a vote may become possible.  That's what democratic process should be about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Senator Gillibrand has proven that she does not live in Chuck Schumer's shadow.  Her statement is substantive and thoughtful. Her conclusion:
 If we reject this deal, we do not have a viable alternative for preventing Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons. Without a deal, and without inspectors on the ground, we will be left in the dark as Iran resumes its pursuit of a nuclear weapon, with only months to go before it could enrich enough fissile material for a bomb. Without a deal, our options will be limited to insufficient unilateral sanctions, an invasion with yet another massive and costly land war in the Middle East, or a bombing campaign that offers nothing more than short-term gain under the best-case scenario.

Compare this with [Schumer](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/3ghygn/my_position_on_the_iran_deal_senator_charles_e/), who proposes extending U.S. sanctions to all nations who are not with us -- "us" being the U.S. and Israel.  Lots of luck, Chuck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When is an American not an American?  When they are Puerto Ricans living in their unrepresented homeland.  

 My message to the federal government is simple: If you continue to treat Americans living in Puerto Rico poorly, they will exercise their rights and move to the U.S. mainland, where they will immediately be entitled to equal treatment, said Pedro R. Pierluisi, Puerto Ricos nonvoting delegate in the House of Representatives...

 Puerto Ricos health care woes began in 1968, when Congress placed a cap on Medicaid in the United States territories that sharply limited the federal governments contribution.

 For Medicaid, this means that Puerto Rico typically gets $373 million a year from the federal government and has to pick up the rest of the $2.5 billion tab, Mr. Rivera of the Puerto Rico Health Care Coalition said. Last year, Oklahoma, which is wealthier than Puerto Rico, received $3 billion from the federal government, according to data compiled by the coalition. Mississippi, also not as poor as the island, received $3.6 billion.
A similar discrepancy exists with Medicare and Medicare Advantage. Puerto Ricos Medicare reimbursement rates for doctors are 40 percent lower than the mainlands, and the Medicare Advantage program is paid 60 percent of the average rate in the states </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Syriza's program required a Europe that was open to new policies, that recognized the failure of austerity as a program for people.  There was no Plan B.  But Europe decided to snuff out the democratic experiment of governance by Syriza.  The Institutions EU/ECB/IMF put Greece into an economic state of siege.  And Syriza was unprepared to protect itself against its enemies.  Varoufakis' secret Plan B would have kept Greeks alive, but as outcasts from the capitalist world economy.  And no one was ready to take the place of Europe -- not Russia, not China, nor anyone else.  What is left now to do is to make an honest attempt to learn from the mistakes of Syriza's original analysis.  For Syriza's program to have had a chance, it would have required the Greek people to have voted for it on the understanding that, if the Troika is intransigent, the proud Greek people will go it alone, in poverty.  Default would then have costs that the Troika could not overlook.  And survival as a free people would have made Greece the light of the world -- like Cuba, but with individual freedom.  History does not end, but for it to move on, lessons must be learned, no matter how painful. Thessaloniki Program -- Never Again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> James K. Galbraith did careful (and covert) work for Varoufakis on what could be done for Greece to survive a continued clampdown on the banks by the Troika. Plan B is better than nothing, but very limited.  In the Troika's economic war against Greece, Greece was under siege.  Plan B would have Greeks living in a long term emergency, on short rations.  The artful workarounds of Plan B make clear that the Tsipras government does not control the banks, or other vital institutions. The state and the economy remain, for the most part, in hostile hands.  It is not surprising, therefore, that Tsipris decided to play the Alec Guinness part in Bridge Over the River Kwai: Better a managed surrender than a failed escape. The tragedy of that story is that Guinness ultimately identifies with his role of manager of the prisoners for his Japanese captors. He is a good soldier, and accepts his orders from a repellent chain of command -- anything less would be subversive.  It would be tragic if the captive Tsipras is similarly transformed.  And while Varoufakis escaped with his honor intact, he, and the other opponents of surrender in Parliament, have not been able to enlist the international support they would need to force Greece's tormentors to let go of their grip.  Merkel and Schauble and Dijsselbloem, etc. must learn that there is a price for their overreach.  But right now, they feel on top of the world. </TEXT>

The problems are deep in the system -- worldwide, not just in the U.S.  The only hope I have is through the mobilization of people who are conscious and smart, doing their own thinking, and who have the morale to keep fighting institutions dominated by wealth.  Hillary's notion of order would snuff out that uncontrolled liveliness.  My hope is that the people mobilized by Bernie will not dissipate their energies after the election, but stay together in action organizations, like 350.org and the Black Lives Matter movement.  Corporate Democrats deserve to be challenged, both within the party, and from the outside, by the Green Party, or any other independent electoral campaign that gets critical issues onto the political agenda. </TEXT>

 However, the drilling permit granted by the Interior Department on Wednesday bans Shell from drilling into oil-bearing zones until critical spill-response equipment is in place - and that equipment is aboard a damaged icebreaker en route to Oregon for repairs...

 The conditions puts further limitations on Shell's plans to open up the Arctic for oil exploration.

 An earlier decision from the Fish and Wildlife Service required Shell to keep active rigs 15 miles away from walruses and other wildlife.

 The company had initially planned to drill the wells much closer, allowing Shell to move more easily between the two sites.

 The new conditions following growing pressure from campaigners against Arctic drilling.

 Al Gore, a former vice-president, said this month that drilling for new sources of oil in the harsh conditions of the Arctic was "insane" - especially given scientists' conclusion that the majority of fossil fuels must stay in the ground to avoid dangerous climate change...

 So far, the company has got in one short - and disaster-prone - season of Arctic drilling, after its Kulluk rig ran aground on an island in late 2012.

Exploration and development of sites for new fossil fuel extraction can only be justified if the cost is expected to be less than existing reserves which must be used as the world transitions to renewable and non-carbon energy.  Adding in the cost of adequate protection of the environment under extreme conditions, like that in the Arctic Sea, make it clear that Shell cannot meet the economic standard for justifying its investment.  If, however, Shell can avoid paying for the environmental and climate costs of this project, it makes good economic sense to "drill baby drill". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course, the details are important.  Trust is out of the question. If Kerry, Moniz, and the rest of the P5+1 negotiators have not significantly reduced Iran's likelihood for building a deliverable bomb during the life of the agreement, then the agreement is not worth much.  But what can the U.S. do?  It can be the only other nation, besides Israel, preventing its businesses from trading with Iran, after having given the Revolutionary Guard a huge political boost against the moderates within Iran.  It can join Israel in attacking any known nuclear capability in Iran, with a diminished capacity to discover covert nuclear development in that country in the future.  Or, it could occupy and attempt to directly govern Iran, which would give greater assurance that Iran could not build a nuclear weapon, but that effort would destroy the United States as an economic and political power in the world.  Waiting for a "better deal" with THIS Iran is not credible.  We've maximized the sanctions we have the power to mobilize.  It's downhill from here.  Why would the current regime in Iran self-depose and institute a regime we can trust?  But that seems to be the argument for why this agreement should be rejected. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tragic when capital controls are done badly, making a bad situation much worse.  This is where market mechanisms can make public policy work efficiently, minimizing bureaucracy and opportunities for corruption (and stupidity).  The primary mechanism for the equilibration of international trade balances, and to raise revenues for the state, should be through an exchange control mechanism which would prevent the leakage of s outside of Greece. Foreign exchange permits could be auctioned by the government.  Permit issuance would have to be limited to be sure that s do not exit the Greek economy faster than they re-enter, via Greek exports, or new investments in Greece.  Since Greek imports now exceed exports, the initial supply of permits would, of course, be less than the demand, and the price would rise until excess demand is choked off.  The sale of foreign exchange permits would supply the government with revenue.  Exporters should be required to repatriate earnings to Greece, or purchase foreign exchange permits for any earnings retained abroad.  Euros which are repatriated to Greece can be used to enable imports.  In effect, foreign exchange permits could be created, backed by these repatriated funds.  The private holders of the repatriated funds should receive a return for this use of their money, providing exporters with a market incentive to repatriate their euro earnings voluntarily.  The effect of this would be to add to the profit associated with the export.  It would provide a competitive advantage for Greek exporters, and therefore, tend to increase Greek exports, moving towards import-export equilibrium. The government can use some of the revenues it receives from the sale of import permits to subsidize the import of vital supplies -- imports required for the most "basic needs". For example, medicine which cannot be produced domestically, would meet this standard.  The question should be asked: "Can domestic production be substituted for the import?"  The cost of the subsidy should be explicit and regularly subject to review.  Bureaucratic decisions which are open and reviewable are the least likely to gum up the works.

	<TEXT> Tsipras and the Greeks real error was in their trust that the long-term interests of the European project would prevail. They believed in solidarity, in a Europe seeking to develop its poorer parts through investment, and genuine reforms, against corruption.  Syriza could offer a new transparent law-based order because it reflected the Greek people's  rejection of the old political establishment.   Tsipras expected a good faith response.  All he got back was stonewalling and a diktat.  But it was only when he brought the Greek people into the negotiations, through the referendium, that German Europe engaged in a full-scale assault on Greek economic survival, by throttling the Greek banks.  The fact that the Greek people, nonetheless, rejected the diktat, was simultaneously a great act of courage, and of faith, that, for their fellow European, Greek Lives Matter.  They were wrong.  And now everyone knows that the tender mercies of the Chancellor will not save them.  Greece has been sacrificed, and, as the pace of the forced march picks up, if they fall behind, they will be next.  In this new order, previous sacrifices count for nothing.  And failure of Austerity to produce growth doesn't count, as long as the bonds are secure.  </TEXT>

That the SPD dutifully followed the marching orders of the  bloodsuckers (thats what leeches do), in complete contradiction to social democratic economic theory, shows the intellectual bankruptcy of a party that has no beliefs of its own.  Up until Tsipris called a referendum, the bullying was rhetorical.  But then the gloves came off the iron fist, and the Greeks faced banking collapse, without an alternative.  And the SPD's kinder gentler rhetoric also vaporized.  The reality is that social democratic decision-making is incompatible with the higher calling of protecting profitability in a declining Europe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is how thieves fall out.  No one wants to be left holding the unsustainable debt bag.  Greece is already over the cliff.  The bill collector thugs have demonstrated their power to break the will of a resistant people.  But the kitty is empty.  Greece has no genie with the power to print euros.  That supernatural power rests with the ECB and only the big banks know how to rub the genie the right way to emit some quantitative easing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For regulations to be truly protective, the profit incentive to violate rules must be eliminated.  At a minimum, limited liability entities must purchase insurance to cover the full potential damage that their actions could cause.  Enforcement efforts must be robust, and never compromised by fiscal stringency. Fracking operators must pay these costs.  And enforcement agents must have incentives to stay independent, with no prospect of being captured by the regulated.  That requires total economic separation, before and after working to enforce the rule.  The assessment of adverse impacts should be an ongoing function, leading to periodic updating of the regulations.  For all these reasons, the kind of regulatory protections supported by Nocera are a mirage.  They would probe to be an inadequate defense of public health and the environment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  One issue has been access to military sites, and under the Additional Protocol the international inspectors would have access to such sites if needed. If Iran denies access, a joint commission would take no more than 24 days to review the request and, if Iran still doesnt comply, the sanctions could fall back into place.

 Administration officials have stepped back from the idea that there would be access to Irans nuclear sites anytime, anywhere, as some had declared previously.

 We dont think that anytime anywhere inspections are feasible, a senior administration official said Its just not something that happens anywhere in the world. While its a nice thing to say, it simply doesnt exist.


The question is whether an imperfect inspection regime is better or worse than no inspections.  Note that U.S. unilateral sanctions would just leave the U.S. as a non-player in the region. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Panitch's hope for a Syriza victory, however covert, appears to be wishful thinking.  Panitch seems to share Tsipris   Co.'s belief that Grexit is intolerable for the Greeks.  But without a real willingness to employ that option, Greece's leverage is limited to the pity of Europe's lending institutions.  Think of the face of Schauble.  For Greece to credibly threaten Grexit, it must do the work to make it thinkable.  It must develop the technical means for floating a credible currency that people will accept, and capital controls that are effective enough to meet vital import needs, within the limits of balanced trade (imports not greater than exports).  This is a difficult, but probably not an impossible task.  The structure must be conceived.  When the Euro curtain comes down, it will then be Syriza's task to present its alternative, and let the Greek people decide whether they are willing to take a leap for freedom, outside the grinding depression of Business As Usual.  If Grexit fails, there will be ample opportunities to surrender to German Direct Rule, and the humanitarian mercy that it offers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   a German finance ministry paper... called for Greece to be expelled from the eurozone for a minimum of five years and demanded that the Greek government transfer 50bn of state assets to an outside agency for sell-off.

The debt should be repaid by those who benefited from the obligation, in proportion to their gain.  The Greek people, who were the prime victims of the Euro gang (crony state capitalists and crimiinals) can be faulted for their gullibility and failure to overthrow the political order that was established by the West after WW II when the British suppressed the anti-Nazi resistance, importing Georgios Papandreou as Prime Minister and restoring the monarchy.  (Stalin had already agreed in Yalta that Greece was within Britain's "sphere of influence".)  Greek people have lived, ever since then, within a corrupt order that they have been too weak to overthrow.  Sadly, having justice on your side is not the same thing as having power.  The weaker a people, the more their exploitation is a temptation -- a cash cow -- and their suffering, however pitiable, is an inconvenience not worthy of much attention. Now the self-righteous winners, led by the Germans, want to expropriate whatever is left of value in Greece.  The New European Order is cold, and without shame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Government is the only organization that the whole people belongs to, and in which they have voting rights.  It is this egalitarian bias that has made government a threat to private power.  Starting with the peaking out of the social justice accomplishments of the New Deal, in the late 1960s, there has been a steady and largely successful attack on the legitimacy of government.  As people become more cynical, and feel impotent in using government as an agency that they can employ to achieve life goals, trust in government has ebbed, and inequality has risen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "E.P.A. has an obligation under the Clean Air Act to develop a model federal plan, something that many states have asked E.P.A. to do so it can provide an example for states developing their own plans," said Thomas Reynolds, a spokesman for the agency. "E.P.A.'s strong preference is to approve state plans, but we know that setting out a federal plan is an important step to ensure that our Clean Air Act requirements are fulfilled."

 Environmental policy experts say that the federal government could ultimately force a policy created in Washington on the economies of each state. But that could mean the process would be extended for years.

Time for the Republican Governors to run up the Confederate flag and re-start the war against the Federal system.  The Supreme Court has already ruled that EPA has the authority to set standards and regulations under the Clean Air Act.  Unless the Republican Governors successfully secede from the Union, they will only succeed in delaying cleaner air, and add to the burden of carbon in the atmosphere, which is already changing the climate in a destructive direction.

	<TEXT> Tsipris has said that a European solution is needed for Greece's problem.  It is a general repudiation of austerity as public policy. It is an inappropriate means to deal with loans which cannot be repaid.  Austerity, in fact, places all the burden on the weaker party, between countries, and within countries.  It is an attempt to force income redistribution to compensate the wealthy and powerful for the outcomes of their investment choices.  It directly tracks with the failure of growth to materialize.  At the base of this failure is a development paradigm that depends on ever-expanding demand, while cutting labor costs.  The gap between peoples' stagnant income and the assumption of growing expenditures, is filled by expanding indebtedness, with increasingly unfulfillable promises to pay.  This cannot last.  At the end of the road is a cliff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The most acute problem is, in FDR's words, "fear itself".  People will hold onto their cash, cutting their paper money spending to the minimum.  But I see nothing in the article that indicates why the banking system should collapse for transactions within Greece itself.  Checks should clear, and credit card use should be authorized -- as long as the recipient of the transaction is in Greece.  The somewhat longer term problem is purchases from abroad.  Greece now has to live with balanced trade, because credit will not be available.  Capital controls must last until real balance is established.  It must be managed much better than is currently the case if the economy is to survive.  The least bureaucratic constraint would use market mechanisms to allocate limited permits for foreign purchases.  Money earned from exports also needs to be repatriated to Greece to keep trade balanced as a revolving fund.  Market-based incentives (e.g., a premium paid to Euros entering the Greek banking system) may not be enough, if there is no trust that the money will be secure. Long term capital control policies would undoubtedly be considered in violation of Eurozone rules, and thus could be tantamount to an exit from the Euro system.  A temporary waiver of the rules by Eurozone members is the only hope of keeping Greece connected to Europe, and the world economy.  It would alleviate unnecessary suffering,  The real danger is from the animus of those whose Austerity Orthodoxy is now so deeply in crisis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  "If necessary, we will issue parallel liquidity and California-style IOU's, in an electronic form. We should have done it a week ago," said Yanis Varoufakis, the finance minister. California issued temporary coupons to pay bills to contractors when liquidity seized up after the Lehman crisis in 2008. Mr Varoufakis insists that this is not be a prelude to Grexit but a legal action within the inviolable sanctity of monetary union....

 Italy's Matteo Renzi said the sight of pensioners weeping in front of banks was a black mark on the conscience of Europe. "We must start to speak to each other again, and nobody knows this than better than Angela Merkel," he said....

 Syriza sources say the Greek ministry of finance is examining options to take direct control of the banking system if need be rather than accept a draconian seizure of depositor savings - reportedly a 'bail-in' above a threshhold of 8,000 - and to prevent any banks being shut down on the orders of the ECB....

 Government officials recognize that this would lead to an unprecedented rift with the EU authorities. But Syriza's attitude at this stage is that their only defence against a hegemonic power is to fight guerrilla warfare.

	<TEXT> The problem with extreme wealth is that it is too easy to use the concentrated power it confers to game the system -- directly through economic power, and indirectly through control of the state.  Eventually all the chips are yours, and several hundred other folk who you know, and respect, and who are in the same game as you: being topmost at the game of "winner take all". The whole world is your oyster -- suck out the value, and discard the shells.  As the rest of us play the only game available -- a complex system we can't control -- our bargaining position weakens.  We get poorer to stay "competitive".  And more afraid to buck the powers that be.  We elect corrupt politicians who promise to ease the pain, but only add to our dependency, because the system, whose logic turns us into losers, cannot be touched.  It is sacred.  But sometimes desperate people lose their fear.  That is what happened in Greece when Syriza was elected. That is dangerous to the system and must be crushed. And that's what connects the billionaires to what's happening now in Greece. Syriza will be discredited because, ultimately, Tsipris doesn't believe that Greece can go it alone.  He sounds an uncertain trumpet, and the people are confused.  And that will discredit the electoral anti-austerity movement everywhere.  Then people will only be left with demonstrations, art, and impotent acts of destruction to express their rage.  We need a better game to play. </TEXT>

The Left Platform in Syriza believes that the price of sovereignty is bearable.  Apparently, Tsipris does not.  So if No wins, Tsipris, and Varoufakis, who truly believe that life outside the Eurozone is unthinkable, must cede power to others.  An election must be called, and the Greek people will have to resolve the contradictions between their dignity, and the limits of their endurance to bear suffering on behalf of that dignity. </TEXT>

It only made sense if a majority of Greeks were willing to risk cutting the country off from the European financial system.  Those who plan to vote yes are unwilling to risk economic ostracism.  Tsipris' letter subverts those who would dare to vote no.  It undercuts the belief that independence and sovereignty are possible in this world for a country like Greece.

	<TEXT> Capital flows is like water. It's not possible to dam the whole Amazon.  But it is possible to channel the flow, if you're not simpleminded in approaching the issue.  Greece needs some essentials from abroad, like pharmaceuticals.  But there is a lot of discretionary spending that must be reduced to what Greece can afford (i.e., = to what it earns from exports).  It can't afford to bleed capital.  But people need to be able to spend on international goods.  Who decides on what people can buy from abroad?  "Committee of Transactions Approval/ State General Accounting Office" is one way.  That certainly portends disaster. But there are ways to restrict capital flow that minimize bureaucracy. After allowing foreign exchange for essentials, a market mechanism could be employed to auction the remaining foreign exchange as permits.  The income generated from such auctions could be used to support basic income for all Greeks.  Setting up such a system is not instant, but it should be fast enough to give people confidence that there is a self-determined Greek solution to this problem.  It's the first step towards building a real economy, capable of paying legitimate debts. No one thought that getting beyond the grip of the Troika would be easy. I hope the Greeks tread this dangerous path wisely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps Turkey is realizing that getting close to Greece is as close as it's going to get to entering the EU, and as close as it may want to be.  German domination might not have been built in initially to the European order, but Germany has surely emerged as the hegemon of the Euro system, as poorer, less productive countries have slipped into debt dependency, inevitably losing their sovereignty in the process.  Meanwhle the stronger economies have gained.  As long as the pie was growing, all this seemed like a fair bargain.  But post-2008 the leash of dependency is a tightening noose.  Debts incurred on the assumption of continuous high growth now can't be paid.  The best course for Greece is to find other sources of capital and know-how, while maintaining market access to Europe.  Turkey, and other growing economies, may be better partners to develop Greece's economic potential.  Only a growing Greek economy can pay back what it actually owes -- to its creditors, but, also, to the people of Greece, whose work has built the country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the algorithm of capital expansion, people are a commodity whose cost must be minimized.  Excess people, like any other waste resource in the production process, must be removed and disposed of in a manner which does not burden the production of market value.  An excessed country is an excellent place to deposit excess people.  Out of sight, out of mind. Not in our midst.  The program to achieve this rationalization of production is called austerity.  Grexit is an attempt to escape from this logic.  It may not succeed, but it will succeed in human terms if the Greek people care about each other.

	<TEXT> Mr. Garca Padilla said. I am not kicking the can.

Greece, and now Puerto Rico, show that Business As Usual is no longer possible. The only hope for creditors is a successful Puerto Rican economy, which is not further weakened by debt repayment.  Greece has shown that "bailouts" that only save creditors, while worsening the debt burden are bound to fail.  A new path is needed, based on sound governance -- both in the public sector and private economy -- and an understanding that punitive responses to failed prospects hurt everyone.  Creditors who acted in good faith should get a long term return as revenues from economic growth make that possible.  How Puerto Rico becomes a successful venture for its people is the job of the Puerto Ricans to determine, and for all Americans to support. </TEXT>

But if the Greeks choose to strike out on their own, they deserve support from the 99% who are not yet on the front line.  The fight for humanity and against servitude is a fight imposed by the post-2008 world economic order.

	<TEXT> The defense of slavery is the critical States Rights argument used to justify secession from the United States.  The only specific grievance cited by South Carolina was that other non-slaveholding states were violating the Constitution's provision that "No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due."
So how was the Confederacy's raison-d'etre transformed into the argument used by those who glorify the Southern cause in The War Between the States: that the secession was a defense of Southern Culture -- a Don't-Tread-on-Me defense of liberty?

	<TEXT> The problem in traffic-congested cities like NYC and Paris is that   unlimited Uber expansion is a traffic disaster for everyone.  Uber's usefulness and reliability depends on mobilizing potential supply which is always there to meet fluctuating demand -- like turning on the faucet.  But that requires cars circulating in traffic everywhere.  In less congested environments, that might work.  But since there is no price on the use of the commons -- the street system -- there is no market incentive to limit traffic generation.  The licensing throttle would be unnecessary if there were pricing on vehicle hours in traffic (i.e., taking congestion as well as mileage into account). </TEXT>

This could be the start of reclaiming the Republican Party from its addiction to race-coded white identity politics.  Without race to fuel the base, a sober GOP might be smaller, but it would a lot healthier, and perhaps capable of providing responsible governance of the nation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As Greece is forced into the real economy -- probably through Grexit -- it's time to start looking at the numbers. Greece's trade deficit on goods is about $27 billion a year: Products exported by Greece: $33.8B, Products imported by Greece: $60.5B
https://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/country/grc/

But its export potential is much higher than has been realized. See:http://ec.europa.eu/economy_finance/publications/economic_paper/2014/pdf/ecp518_en.pdf
This EU report identifies the need to rationalize the Greek economy. It notes that the ability to attract investment is not primarily a function of knocking down labor costs:

The competitiveness of a country cannot be summarised exhaustively by labour productivity and wage per employee, i.e. unit labour cost. Instead, competitiveness depends crucially on a more comprehensive notion of the cost of doing business  which in turn depends on the rule of law, property rights, the ability to enforce contracts, flexible labour market arrangements, the available transport infrastructure and many other factors besides the recorded cost of capital and labour. Customs formalities, administrative procedures, and regulatory transparency are directly linked to the trading process. All of these factors can impact trade performance through the cost channel.

But the Troika demands only see "the cost of doing business" and ignore the rest of society as if it is of no value. What rankles is that the Troika program unnecessarily sacrifices the needs of most of the Greek people in order to make production less costly.
A self-governing people can achieve much of the efficiency goal of the Troika at a fraction of the human cost. That is what the Tsipris government has been trying to demonstrate in its counter-offers. And it has been totally rebuffed.
If Greece were free to act in its own best interests, it would cut out crony state-capitalist niches that siphon away the fruits of the peoples labor and ingenuity. Then non-EU capital-rich countries and regions (U.S., China, petrodollar holders) might find Greece a good place to invest in.
A sovereign Greece, free to choose its partners, will be bad news for the present regime in Germany. They will discover that their sphere of influence has shrunk, and that the German dominated EU has cut its Greek nose to spite its Euro face. Extending credit to its weaker members has been the elixir keeping the German economy buoyant. Germany, unable to recognize the dual nature of the debt relationship, has now killed that goose, and there will be no more golden eggs. No one will want to be in Greece's shoes with respect to the German financiers. That ends the false promise -- the mirage of prosperity -- that sustained the Euro. If Germany must go back to the Mark. it will discover that inequality is eventually self-limiting. The Mark will appreciate, and German goods, no matter how superior, will be unaffordable. Switzerland already has that problem, which is only masked by the inflow of loot from all nations, willing to pay for sanctuary in Swiss banks.

	<TEXT>  I come to a figure of a cumulative hit on the level of GDP of 12.6 per cent over four years. The Greek debt-to-GDP ratio would start approaching 200 per cent. My conclusion is that the acceptance of the troika's programme would constitute a dual suicide  for the Greek economy, and for the political career of the Greek prime minister. 
... Grexit, of course, has pitfalls, mostly in the very short term. A sudden introduction of a new currency would be chaotic. The government might have to impose capital controls and close the borders. Those year-one losses would be substantial, but after the chaos subsides the economy would quickly recover. Comparing those two scenarios reminds me of Sir Winston Churchills remark that drunkenness, unlike ugliness, is a quality that wears off.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is confusing,and deliberately so.  The House voted on a three-part bill sent to them from the Senate.  The first part, Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) was supposed to be the sweetener that would allow Democrats to support Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) or Fast Track authority. The third part provides penalties for currency manipulation by trade partners, and easily passed by a vote of 240 to 190.  The surprise in the vote was that TAA lost overwhelmingly, when most Democrats failed to swallow the bait, and, nonetheless, TPA passed by 2 votes, including a vital 28 Democrats.  The failure of TAA meant that the House did not pass the Senate bill, in whole.  Therefore the process must be restarted.  This is where we stand now, with Obama corporate Dems, and Republicans, scrambling to get enough votes changed to get TAA passed, so that Obama can sign a completed bill. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The new investment policy was approved unanimously by Norway's finance committee and will be formally adopted by parliament on 5 June. It requires the fund, founded on Norway's vast oil wealth, to exclude companies earning more than 30% of their revenues from coal or producing more than 30% of their electricity from coal.

While Norway still continues to generate its wealth by extracting oil, this decision is not based on moral purity. It is a business decision based on the-world-will-save-itself scenario.  In that case, the world must constrain carbon emissions, even as it still uses some fossil fuels in the transition to a carbon-free future.  Norway's oil is cheap enough to get used, even if it must pay a carbon tax (set at a rate that assures carbon emissions are limited to a safe level).  The alternative scenario is the-world-is-too-greedy-to-save-itself.  In that case, climate destabilization will make rational economic planning futile.  You can't even be sure that Norway's North Sea oil reserves will be extractable.  Conceptually, a nation has the advantage over a business in making long-run decisions, because it cannot get away from itself.  It is stuck where it is  -- land, people, culture.  Continuity matters, as it does with real people, (unlike profit-maximizing capital decisions). </TEXT>

 we are most useful as allies of the DP insurgency when, from the outside, we urge it to be relentless in its confrontation with entrenched power and emphasize the unbridgeable gulf that exists between the Party they seek to attain and the DP as it actually exists.

 Once an anti-austerity movement coalesces around Sanders, the movement will rapidly assume a half-in, half-out posture towards the DP

 ... if, as we believe, the DP establishment defeats the Sanders' campaign for nomination ... it can bring a wealth of experience in organizing and coordinating a large scale, national electoral operation in service to independent campaigns that are already in full swing, most likely the Green Party.

So the tax break was worth over $1.5 million per apartment.  One national estimate of the cost of building a unit in an apartment house is $64,575 - $86,100 (861 square feet with a footprint of 24'x35')

Of course, NYC construction costs are higher.  There's union labor, and congestion costs getting materials to the site, and higher land cost, even in the outer boroughs.  But, most of all, graft and gross profits can really drive up the cost of affordable housing.
