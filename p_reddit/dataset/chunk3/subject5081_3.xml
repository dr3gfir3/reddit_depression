	<TEXT> Actually, it does. There's much more to do in Elite, and if you do like space combat, then you're in for a treat as you really need to strategize before getting into a fight or it might end bad. You need the right ship, the right weapons, and depending on how the other player is gonna play it, different strategies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I played 25 hours in NMS and that's the only 2D game I've touched since I've owned the Vive! I really like the style and the setting and the vistas- that game would be amazing in VR! But hey 70 hours ain't that bad, it's less than 1 $ per hour of fun, so I'd say it's a good investment :)

Elite - that game is unbelievable in VR. If you've ever dreamt of piloting a Starship, just go for it. I bought a HOTAS and that's the way to play it. I'm 45 hours in and I just started to understand how I want to play it (there's no real story, but you can be anything - bounty hunter, smuggler, pirate, miner, hauler), so now I'm out of bounty hunting and I'm space trucking a bit to afford an exploration ship! :)

If you do start playing Elite, don't be discouraged, the learning curve is very steep, and remember that much of the lore is player-driven, so join a community like here on Reddit or on Discord so you'll have goals! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pre-ordered it and paid 60 bucks, but not for the benefit of an improved ship - just becausae I thought what HelloGames was doing was pretty cool, and honestly, if I can choose who to give my money to, it will be the underdogs instead of the big corporations. 

Sean Murray (the head developer) put his heart and soul into this project. It's completely different from any other space sim - ED, Start Citizen, they're both "realistic", while NMS takes from the SciFi Pop culture - hence, the weird-ass aliens, the fancy colors etc. I was on the fence because I thought there was only one Space Sim in my life and that was Elite - but I know know I'll play NMS (played it on PS4, waiting for 6pm today for PC version :)).

Long story short: maybe it's not a 60 bucks AAA title on release, and if you can wait / don't want to spend that money, wait for a sale. 

But if you like exploration and SciFi Pop culture (Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy for example) then it's a definitely a game for you! :)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dear /r/writing,

I've been part of this community for a long time, albeit I've been less active (just lurking) in the past year.

Together with 2 associates, we're bootstrapping a new Literary Magazine / Review called **Beautiful Losers**.

We want to publish the stories, poems, and non-fiction pieces that no one else wants because they're too daring, too odd, too beautiful to be part of the mainstream.

If you think you're a Beautiful Loser, we are looking for your submissions. 

You are free to submit up to 5 poems OR 2 pieces of fiction (max 5k words) OR 2 pieces of non-fiction (up to 5k words). If your work is outside of those guidelines but you think it deserves our attention, please do write a heads up to us first.

If your piece is gonna be selected for publication, it will probably go online through our Medium page: medium.com/beautiful-losers/

We publish on Medium every Wednesday, and will keep the best-submitted piece for our Quarterly Review (number #0 due before Christmas 2016).

If you want more info, please head on to www.beautifullosersmag.com

And if you want to try and submit, do it here: submissions@beautifullosersmag.com

*(Please check our submission guidelines first)*

We cannot offer compensation at the moment, but we hope to change that soon!

Looking forward to reading you soon!

- get a 'cheap' 970 and buy the Vive: 75 to 80 % of current VR titles will run ok

OR

- get a 980ti and the Vive and 99% of the titles will run mostly fine

OR

- get a 1070/1060 and the Vive, and 99% of the titles will run perfectly fine, plus you'll have a card that'll last you for your next PC.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to be pedantic but that's the definition of sexism:

"prejudice, stereotyping, or discrimination, typically against women, on the basis of sex."

So according to that definition, the image is sexist - it sterotypes the different aspects of sex, highlighting different sexual behaviours according to stereotypes.

	<TEXT> Yup that's why love Geralt, he doesn't deal in absolutes. 

In the book canons, Witchers are reluctant to slay dragons because usually they are not evil creatures - they become evil when men tries to kill them for their hide or treasures. Of course there's the stray Witcher that kills anything and anyone, but Geralt is adamant about himself - as he explains it to Three Jackdaws:

"But you cannot escape the conflict between Order and Chaos. In spite of your comparison, you're not a blacksmith. I saw how you work; you enter an underground tunnel and come out of it with a small, mangled basilisk. There is a difference, my pretty, between shoeing horses and killing basilisks. You've already indicated that you'll journey to the other side of the world to slay a certain monster if the pay is worth it. Let's say a fierce dragon destroys..."
"Bad example," interrupted Geralt.
"You see, the boundary becomes blurred already. I don't kill dragons, in spite of the fact they no doubt represent Chaos."
"Why is that?" Three Jackdaws licked his fingers, "But that's outrageous! Surely of all the monsters, the dragon is the most dangerous, vicious and cruel. Most terrible of all the reptiles. It attacks humans, spits fire and it even steals virgins! Haven't you heard enough stories about that? Is it possible that you, witcher, do not have a few dragon slayings in your list of accomplishments?"
"I do not hunt dragons," Geralt replied dryly, "Giant centipedes, yes. Dracolizards, dermopterans but not real dragons, greens, blacks or reds. Make no mistake about it."

This is not just Geralt's, IIRC it's what Uncle Vesemir taught him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, but I don't trust reviews. Every 12 yo can write one. I do trust the team behind NMS tho. There were really no lies, it's clear they want to build the ability for players to meet each other, but it's hard to do (server sync etc). They didn't expect two players to meet so soon, and that's it.

It was never advertised as a multiplayer game, Sean Murray (the head of the studio) always said it's a solo journey. When pressed about Multiplayer (because now every kid and his mother wants multiplayer so they can redirect their frustration on human beings while being protected by a screen) Sean said that people will be able to meet, but it's very unlikely. 

It's crazy how this game went from child prodigy to shunned crap. It really shows how non-mature is the average gamer. 

Suggestion: I would avoid spoiling what happens at the end of a super-hyped game, or anything for that matter - you might take enjoyment away. </TEXT>

Armed with patience I re-started from a previous savegame, but as soon as I arrive in the big Hall, I sleep, save, and when I load, same thing happens.

I don't recall the name of the hall, I'm in the big cave, day 11, the one with the tall church-like construction in the middle.

Thanks for any help you'd give me!

	<TEXT> I've had my Vive since end of May. 

It's my primary gaming screen - I play Elite:Dangerous, and there's no turning back. I'm also finishing the Solus Project, will finish A Chair in a Room, and play regularly The Thrill of the fight (best cardio ever) and Space Pirate Trainer.

I just started ADR1FT, and that's definitely a great title, very polished visuals, and good enough controls.

So what changed?

Novelty did wear off, meaning that I'm not mind-blown everytime I put the headset on. But I still open my mouth in awe when something really cool happens, and this is only thanks to VR. 

Plus, I'm not buying ALL the games now. I carefully pick the ones I want to experience. You'll see a lot of hate in this sub for short and expensive things like TheBlu or EverestVR, but that's for me what VR is for: to put you in places you would not normally be. So I enjoy those, and am waiting for bigger games.

Also, I haven't played any 2D games since. I had to finish BatmanAK, never got to finish Tomb Raider, and didn't play TW3: Blood and Wine (and the Witcher is my favorite game ever).

I pre-ordered No Man's Sky, and this is  the first 2D game I bought and that I'll play since I got the Vive.

All in all: I LOVE IT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I tried it. 

AND I LOVE IT.

I like the delta for the movement (slower jog, slower movement, bigger jog, quicker movement etc). I hope this is implemented in every open world game/game where you need to travel around. It's amazing really and ZERO nausea. I feel it is a bit better than RIPmotion, although you do need to smooth out the start movement (there is a bit of stuttering).

I could play The Witcher VR, Fallout VR and that would be my favorite movement. One single problem I see: there's no lateral running. Think in a FPS where I want to move laterally (slide) while shooting. 

One way to change this is to have a button activated one. If I squeeze the left grip and jog, instead of running forward, I run sideway left.

If I squeeze the right grip and jog, I slide right.

If I squeeze both grips - well, here's a design choice. Do you decouple the movement i.e. the avatar keeps running in the last direction but I am free to move arms and head so I can, for example, move forward while shooting sideways? 

Or do I run backwards?

I think keeping the forward momentum BUT freeing the Camera view for shooting here and there is the way to go. 

I'd be glad to help you with more testing if needed. I do believe that's the future.

	<TEXT> I know that phone support is horrible. When I moved house I lost UPC and was guaranteed by the landlord that my new house had Eircom Broadband 24MB. I come in, only 1.5 MB. Spoke on the phone with different people, no luck. 

Then I went on boards.ie and asked for help there. One Eircom rep picked up my case, did some tests and discovered that no one actually checked my broadband and just left it standard in the system (hence the 1.5MB, while my neighbour had 24 MB). 

In 2 hours he sorted me out with 24MB.

tl;dr - try writing on boards.ie when you have an issue instead of using the phone. You might get luckier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pre-ordered it, didn't watch any leaked stream, stayed away from the subreddit which is full of toxic comments, and will enjoy my first hours the 12th of April. It's the first 2D game I'm eager to play since my Vive. 

I play E:D and even though I thought there's no space for 2 sims in my life, they're so different that I think I'll play both.

Like you, I feel that the game lends itself to VR in a big way. I hope they'll add it in. I don't have much gaming time, so between NMS, Elite and The Witcher: Blood and wine, I'm set for a while with games. That's to say, if they put VR support in the next 3/6 months, the game would still be a novelty to me.

But also, if VR support comes in 12 months, I'd probably want to go back in just to explore in VR. Let's be honest, the Solus Project is superb in VR, but kinda boring in 2D. So who knows what the future holds.

I'm surely gonna play it tho! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AR / VR are definitely here to stay.

Pokemon Go aside, AR is where I see the biggest day-to-day potential, for Work application (doctors, surgeons, architects, engineers, mechanics... potential is limitless) and also personal use (turn-by-turn directions, entertainment etc).
AR is, indeed, augmenting our reality.

VR is gonna be more about "immersion". It's gonna be used for educational purposes (imagine witnessing the french revolution, the 1969 Rioting in the US etc etc), gaming, and high-def entertainment (you're not gonna just watch the sports / movies; you're gonna be in there).

	<TEXT> While that is true and roomscale doesn't usually add anything to a 'cockpit' game...

...it also depends on the cockpit. I play Elite:Dangerous and while the full game has to be played seated, it had a great presence moment for me the other day. 

I use VoiceAttack to impart some commands to my ship. I just bought a bigger ship and the cockpit is actually for 2 people - it has another seat right next to me. Also, it has space behind me, a glass pane on my left and right, and some other screens. 

It never occurred to me until I was bending my neck to explore my new ship - 'Wait...I can walk around!'

So here I was walking around the bridge of my new ship. And that alone was amazing. But then another thing struck me: I could tell the ship to leave docking and speed up, just with my voice. I felt in a fucking sci-fi movie, with my hands behind my back, watching the star close to me getting smaller, while my ship's AI jumped in hyperspace.

It's been sitting in my VR library since May, but I still have to enjoy it properly because of not-so-well-thought support.

Mind you, I'm not scared of SpaceSims, Newtonian physics etc - I'm an Elite Pilot ;) it's just that all those recentering, seeing your controllers but decoupled from your hands...

I hope they'll fix it - I really really want to play this game and leave a stellar review! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have a scientific mind and like to play with it yes. If not, it's still a great oh-my-god-I'm-floating-in-space first experience, but it loses interest over time quickly.

The desktop version has the ability to stand on moons and watch Saturn from there for example, while the VR version is a bit limited. Good thing is, you buy one and get the two, so you can "plan" your Solar system in 2D and then jump in VR to play with it. 

If you understand orbital velocity, apsis, periapsis, etc etc you'll like it. It's not a game; it's a sandbox for Science. </TEXT>

Regarding the gigantic screen (cinematic mode), this still requires to run the game at a lower resolution than normal (it has to be rendered twice) so I guess a lot of people will just stick to their hi-red monitors! 

Anyway, I'm being spoilt - let me play the game first and then complain about VR later ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree on keeping it simple, but knowing the players (especially the ladies) they'll drop interest if there's nothing "emotional" involved. That's why I was thinking a story.

Depending on which character they'll decide to play, I'd like to have them meet in a non-classic situation - not the classic tavern - but something like "you're all being captured by the royal guards" for whatever petty reason, have them interact with some NPC with kids, 
then have someone scoop in and kill everyone while leaving them alive, so they already know it's not safe out there. 

Panic situations bring people together, and then I can have them help one of the royal guard widows, for example, to do something out of guilt (I know my players) :) 

so from a task perspective, I'll keep it simple. I was just wondering if there's any entry-level pre-made adventure with a good solid background to use! But thanks for the suggestion :) </TEXT>
