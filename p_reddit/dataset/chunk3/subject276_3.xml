	<TEXT> I said in r/MLS that I couldn't wait for Atlanta to play Seattle because it's going to be a telling game. I think Atlanta are good and it's going to be fun to watch. I said that ATL is talented but their wins have come with asterisks. 

An ATL fan chewed me out saying our franchise was a joke, our team is a joke, our owner doesn't give a fuck, and our city doesn't give a fuck. Dude went off over what was me essentially saying "your team is good and will be playing a good team, good luck". 

I know it's not all ATL fans obviously, but there are some seriously fucking entitled and arrogant fans coming out. It's week 3, let's calm down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would post this in r/Quebec but I don't speak French and feel bad posting in English. 

I would like to send flowers to the mosque, but I don't know of florists in the area that deliver or the best way to go about it. Please give me any ideas you might have. 

I haven't seen any GoFundMe campaigns yet, so I figure this might be a nice gesture until something larger can be done. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously one of the coolest museums I've been to. It has an incredibly impressive collection. Even the house it's built in is gorgeous. Admission is pretty reasonable (I think there's also a Groupon) and Tuesday's are free (donations recommend). 

Thanks to whatever redditor recommended it! Definitely want to check out more smaller museums. </TEXT>
