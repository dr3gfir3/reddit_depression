	<TEXT> The reason I would disagree with Rodman over Malone is that Moses was still trying to score on offense, which is where his offensive rebounding was an advantage. Rodman was obsessed with doing the little things, not necessarily putting in points, and was way better at defense. Maybe they could be split as 1O and 1D as the best respectively on each end of the floor at rebounding. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Historical NBA Lineups - Former Players </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-14 18:22:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As many of you know basketball-reference.com is a great resource but lacks a lot of information from early NBA history -- namely starting lineups. I'm starting a project that will hopefully involve me interviewing former players from the league's early years to discern and preserve whatever information/memories/nuggets of wisdom they can provide. I've already sent inquiry emails out to several organizations (e.g. ESPN, SI, BR, NBA). Was wondering if anyone else could help me out or has connections that could get me in touch with some former players? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everything has to be taken in context. At the time he was the best teammate, defender, and winner of all-time, all this going head-to-head with literally Goliath (Wilt) and winning almost every time. His historical legacy is the biggest part of the argument for his ranking. Think of it like older movies like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Modern CGI and capabilities blow it out of the water, but you wouldn't have Star Wars Episodes 1-3/7-9 without it, which is why it still ranks so highly on all-time lists. Russell paved the way for everyone that came after, and that's why we remember him. </TEXT>
