	<TEXT> I just didn't feel sorry for the guy who never made any friends and ended up alone. Also you can always adopt, there's more to being parents than just dna, and lastly the whole fat kid looking for a father figure... again, it was rather cliche and just boring, a very big step down from the previous movie's huge emotional appeal.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno, Up was too cloying to have given much of an emotional impact, especially with the intro sequence in the beginning being too on the nose sad for me to care. Not like say, the opening of finding Nemo which actually provides good reason for why Marlin is so overprotective of Nemo and handled much better. 

I won't even get into Toy Story 3, an unnecessary movie that basically copies a lot of elements of Toy Story 2 (toying with the idea of them no longer being played by andy, a villain pretending to be nice but was the villain this whole time manipulating his underlings, etc etc) and never needed to be made because Toy Story 2 ended the series so perfectly "whatever happens, as long as I've got you buzz we'll face it together, to infinity and beyond"

I dunno. For me, there's a difference between a movie being emotionally strong and a movie that's desperately trying to emotionally manipulate me. Pixar's post 2008 works were entirely the latter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Um... duh? Starting from 1995 with Toy Story, one of the greatest movies of all time, and ending in 2008 with the amazing WallE, where they literally went to space, symbolically showing that they have reached their peak, since once you go to space you've literally reached the top (eg Nintendo with super mario galaxy 1 2, easily one of the best platformers and video games of all time) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Incredibles, easily golden age Pixar's most rewatchable movie, has only 75% audience rottentomatoes score. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This indicates to me that audiences are idiots. I mean, not that I needed any more indication with the immense popularity of transformers, twilight and dc movies. 

But the thing is, this score, which should be at like 98%, is a sad realization of what audiences find good. The Incredibles is such a fun movie from Pixar's golden age.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But... Daisy Skye's transformation from CW-esque teen character to likable character you root for is one of the best arcs of the show. She goes from being a bit like those CW show characters you like so much, having drama with her boyfriend from the rising tide, stuff like that, and the you see her develop as part of a team in season 1. Then in season 2 when "what they become" happens... my god, it's just so good. I get goosebumps just thinking about it.  </TEXT>

The teen girl demo seems profitable if CW's show success is anything to go by, and yet Young Justice, an animated cartoon on the channel Cartoon Network was mainly watched by a female audience and yet the network executives canceled it.

	<TEXT> Look if you like these poor quality shows there's nothing wrong with that, as these shows are aimed at a certain demographic of people. Cw shows are for teenagers and 20somethings still in college. Same with Gotham, they have a very specific target demographic, and there's nothing wrong if you like these low quality shows; I myself used to watch Smallville when I was a teenager, and actually love it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, but I have fond memories of watching this show with friends and family. I assume it's the same with cw's arrow, it's simply for a specific teenage or early 20something audience that's all.
But for quality? You go to agents of shield/carter, or Netflix's amazing daredevil and Jessica jones. Basically anything mcu. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It sucks doesn't it, since ABC or rather mcu shows are easily the best on tv for comic book fare, yet Fox's Gotham or CW's teenagefest nonsense like Arrow and supergirl or whatever are the ones with high ratings, while Agent Carter, a show that has a strong female lead, is not watched at all. And you have all these internet personalities, the kind that whine about a lack of strong female presence in movies and shows, and then they don't even bother watching the amazing Agent Carter. 

It just really pisses me off, the injustice of it all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is, I'm not attracted to blond cheerleader types either, like for example margot robbie and her extremely masculine face with that sharp jaw. In fact it's why I actually liked bobbi when she was undercover in hydra and had extremely dark hair, which made her look so sexy, but then the next episode she goes light blonde and I was so surprised and a little disappointed. 

But the thing is, attractive people are attractive even with a blonde hair color and it's her face that I am attracted to (for women I don't care about the body, it's only ever the face that I look at and care about) and she has a wonderful face with soft round features instead of a manly pronounced jaw like Jessica Chastain. 

But Hunter on the other hand... well he has a bit of a dog face __ . I still like him as a character though don't get me wrong! I like him for his flaws and his heroic moments, all of them.  </TEXT>

But damn, I can't imagine what it must be like to be an American watching a show on the actual tv as it airs. On the one hand, you get the newest episode immediately in your country but on the other hand I personally wouldn't want to watch commercials interspersed within my show. I'm surprised there are still people that sit on the couch and watching TV due to the young generation constantly using their phones and tablets to do everything, from texting to internet browsing to media watching and what have you. The traditional watch a tv in the living room is a staple of pre-internet days... </TEXT>

The video in question. 

Due to minus being defunct and all. But the gif is really good, it's really the highlight of the also good video. In it Kara and another girl are kissing in my favorite position right before she's being creampied, where the girl is sitting behind her and sort of hugging her. Really underrated 3some position.
I have a pic:

	<TEXT> I remember seeing this movie when I was young a very long time ago, and I've been dying to try to find it, but I barely remember anything about it except for a few scenes in a hazy memory. 

From what I call here's how the movie starts out, a guy who already has a girlfriend is driving his car in the rain and sees a woman in the rain and gives her a ride. To thank him she starts indicating that she wants to have sex with him and while he resists at first, he succumbs and stops the car to have sex with her.

This is what leads to him and his girlfriend breaking up because she somehow finds out. So the rest of the movie is him trying to get her back.

That's all I remember from the beginning, the only other scene I remember is fast forwarding later in the movie, where the guy and his two friends, and the girlfriend and her 2 friends happen to be at a club. One of the girl's friends is a shy introvert but after having some alcohol in her she dances for all the guys in the club and strips down to her bra and underwear which are both red, then points to one of the guys from the crowd to take her and he carries her away. 

Then the last female  friend has a fling with one of the guy's male friends in a bathroom stall, and she's like "say something in french" and he says "escargot" and that's pretty much all I remember from the movie. 

It was or seemed very low budget from what I remember, no popular actors or actresses, just really C-tier people. But I just want to remember what it was. Since I saw it on TV there is the possibility that it was just a TV movie and not even a real theater release... so I have my expectations of ever finding the title of this movie to be very low indeed.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> WHY are producers so desperate to get Craig back as Bond? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-08 14:33:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Do they really think the billion dollar success of the past 2 movies was because of Daniel Craig? It's not. The fact of the matter is in the 10 years since the immaculate Casino Royale's release, so much has changed in the market:

New markets like China and India have opened up.

Social media has completely changed everything, increasing the presence of movies like never before. 

A billion more people on the planet than before. 

And more. All these factors are what contribute to the bond movies doubling their gross since before prior to the huge boost of mainstream internet, social media, new markets, etc etc 

Their desperation in wanting Craig back, going so far as to reportedly pay him 100 million for the role, is nothing short of silly. Anyone in the role of bond will garner the same billion dollar gross because of the reasons thus posted. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thoughts on Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet? Some questions. Spoilers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-01 09:15:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've unfortunately never read the tragedy of Hamlet (would have loved to read it in school) but I did just see 1996's Hamlet. I liked it. 

Very powerful performances, but also depressing because everyone dies. I think this is the work of Shakespeare well known for exemplifying his stories where everyone dies at the end right?

I also picked up on so many lines, quotes and scenes that many media have used, which all came from Hamlet. 

I was wondering just how close this is to the actual play. I hear it's totally unabridged and word for word from the play, is this true? Is seeing it pretty much like having read the play?

I wanted to discuss the many themes and motifs of the story. For one thing I was actually wondering whether Hamlet really was crazy and whether his uncle really did kill his father. As such, I was confused by whether some scenes really happened or were a figment of the imagination, like a scene where the uncle is inside a church confession stall and confesses his sin of killing his brother the king, and Hamlet is on the other side ready to kill him with a dagger but stays his hand for some reason (I didn't *quite* understand the reason why)

And poor Ophelia. Shakespeare's women tend to get such the worst brunt of it.  </TEXT>

I was watching More Dirty Debutantes 237 with Ann Harlow who I like because sometimes it's nice to see a really hairy vagina, and the girl licking her vagina is basically licking all hair, I mean there's no way some pubes didn't get stuck on her tongue and in her mouth. I just had to give props to that kinda commitment more than anything else.  </TEXT>

I remember after finishing book 4 I was thinking "finally the curse of the defense against the dark arts teacher position has been lifted" and that now we know in advance who is going to be filling the position, since they found the real madeye in his trunk and he can now complete that favor to dumbledore of teaching the kids for a year. 

But instead book 5 came out and gave us the unequivocally awful umbridge.

But the movie is so damn great and it's amazing just how great the sequel is despite being so tonally different from the first one.

Amazing. 

Then there's the criminally underappreciated Andy serkis who deserved *some*  kinda award nomination and recognition for bringing to life one of the most sympathetic non human characters of all time. 

And of course there's John Lithgow's heartwrenching performance. It's just an amazing movie all around. I feel like the only one who's as hugely into the movies as I am, having been utterly blown away by Rises when I watched it 5 years ago. 

Movie came outta nowhere. I saw no news about the development of the movie prior to its release and box office trailer. And it was amazing. 

It's honestly the least talked about amazing solid franchise in wake of all the comic book movies and scifi stuff. </TEXT>

I've been doing it ever since I was a kid, daydreaming about how if I had done so and so, then I could probably be fit and good looking and have a ton of friends and people who want to be with me. Then as an adult I daydream about that one defining moment in my life and how if I had never say broken my leg and gotten suicidally depressed, I could have had the perfect (if a bit romanticized) life of friends, girls, a career in mind, essentially a life. 

It's the only thing I do, 18 hours a day. Then of course when sleep comes my subconscious delves into just horrible things, either relieving the past or worse painting the "ideal" life I had always built up.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-08-26 21:13:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To be incredibly bitter, towards everyone. To be envious. To be so lonely that you just resent everyone, and filled with so much self-hatred that you just deflect it onto others.

Like saying other people don't deserve or don't get to be depressed like you, because they're good looking, or thin/healthy bodied, or simply living in a society where the people speak the same language as them instead of being a fish out of water (a feeling I'd been intimately familiar with my entire life) where you have no hope of ever even being able to *communicate* with someone. 

And then just end up sighing at all these stupid thoughts you have. Feeling guilty because there are people "worse off" than you, so why should you feel depressed right? It's difficult when you live in a society like the middle east where social acceptance of psychological problems isn't really common compared to the Western world like America. To come from a more Western background but live in a place like this where... sigh

I'm sitting alone in a room right now completely in the dark except for the bright light of this computer  monitor, and I have that realization that I do every so often the past 7 years. I'm alone, I'm truly alone. I have no friends, I have no life. There is truly nothing for me. Worst still, I've lost my youth. The golden years of making friends in your 20s, of having a real college experience, of coming out of your shell and putting behind the bullying and loseriness of school to be someone else, I lost that, hell I never got the chance to truly achieve it. 

What really bothers me most is that very thing, losing your youth. Because your youth, your health, I mean once you lose that... then there truly is nothing left. And it's not a case of feeling suicidal or anything like that, it's more the fact that... there is nothing for me in the foreseeable future. You hear about people having midlife crises and whatnot, but I can't even imagine reflecting on an empty life when I turn 50 or 60 or if I tragically live that long, feeling unhappy as I am. Unfulfilled. Alone. Feeling pathetic. 

All I'd ever wanted is just friends, people to talk to. Like-minded people, otherwise. Talk about anything, from popular culture items like books, movies, video games, television shows, to sciences, language, politics of countries, the human experience, all of it. 

I hate this elongated phase of my depression, this embittered phase, especially as I live in a society of tough love speeches and redundant or even tautological rhetoric such as "if you're unhappy, be happy, problem solved!" and "you don't have any friends? Make friends, what's so hard? The best way to get friends is to make friends." 

I dunno. Just felt like I needed to vent and be heard on a friday night when everyone else is out enjoying the evening, and I'm stuck here constantly obsessing over where and how I "went wrong" in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't how many people here have even seen this cut but I just did. I'd only ever caught this movie on TV and for sure it must have been the worst/shortest version, the 130 minute cut. 

Hell even at 251 minutes, this movie still feels rather... disjointed. Wikipedia stated that Sergio Leone wanted to make 2 movies at 3 hours each, so I wonder what that version would have been like. 

I dunno, the movie feels all over the place and unfocused, especially when they add in digitally restored scenes never seen before, like a scene with a Jewish chauffeur talking to De Niro's character about how there's no need to be a gangster "like the Italians" in his words, so with stuff like that I can't even gauge what the movie wants to be. I kind of prefer Once Upon a Time in the West more as well as For a Few Dollars More out of Leone's work. 

But there's so much history with this movie, all the cuts it went through, what the studio told Leone to do and not do,  I feel it's prudent to see.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just finished this movie and feel oddly depressed. 

I mean yeah most of the characters are portrayed as complete "preppy" (their words) tools of a seemingly dying yuppie culture, and I found the redhaired guy particularly annoying in his egotistical idiocy and beliefs, but at the end of the movie when all the girls have moved on and the 3 guys have a depressing night out by themselves... I dunno that kind of rejection is very familiar to me on a personal level and I felt really depressed even if I didn't necessarily like these characters.  

Also the exiting of the nick character (chris eigeman) earlier in the movie is a shame since he was the best part of the movie, as he plays a more likable abrasive character in comparison to his character in the last days of disco.

I dunno why I feel so depressed at the ending but I just do. 3 of the guys from the "Sally Fowler rat pack" go from each girl's house to the next and are asked to leave as these girls have their own dates to go to and Sally herself even calls these guys "tiresome"

I mean it's true that the philosophical debates they have can seem tiresome but to have the girl outright say it to their face like that... I dunno, for some reason that really stung to me as a viewer.  </TEXT>

I for one enjoy cristin miloti a lot more (even though the movie tries its hardest to make her look ugly by giving her a horrible, horrible hair style) than margot robbie who basically just looks like a young jamie presley, or a combination of presley and denise richards. Attractive women sure, but in  a room full of gorgeous women? Hardly stands out from the crowd. Plus for being only in her 20s she looks mid 30s... not really a compliment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I liked it a lot. 

What makes it so surreal is that I completely wasn't expecting it to be that way, especially with how it opens, and this is completely different from any of the martin scorsese movies I've watched. I was starring bug eyed at the screen a couple of times throughout the protagonist's series of misadventures, but by the end I was just going "what the fuck???"

I was especially terrified when he was stuck inside the paper mache caste of a not too subtle throwback to the scream statue from before. I kept thinking "oh please god don't let the movie end with him trapped there forever until he literally dies like that" but then he broke out and I was sighing in relief to much to even appreciate how hilarious that ending scene was where he just walks into the office all covered in dust and soot from a long long horrible night. 

I mean... the movie is unlike anything I've seen from the director, certainly wasn't expecting it. Great stuff though.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want to mention too many specific examples, and I know beauty is in the eye of the beholder and everyone has their own tastes, but for example I remember watching The Truth About Cats and Dogs and quite frankly, even as a kid I'd watch this movie and feel annoyed that I was supposed to think Uma Thurman was the "more attractive beauty" and Janeane Garofalo wasn't, when Janeane is easily more my type than Uma, who has that Northern European look of blond hair, pointy nose, tall, etc that I'm extremely NOT a fan of. 

That's just one example but I've got several. And I don't know why it bothers me so much but it just does. I dislike a movie trying to convey to me what they think stereotypical attractive elements are in their eyes. 

I mean all people are lovely in their own way, and I wouldn't want to take away another person's loveliness by saying they're not attractive, that's not my aim here. It's just that I'm bothered when movies try to display a particular woman or type as more attractive. And of course, unfair as it may be, when you consider that Hollywood and the west is responsible for a majority of cinema, the beauty that's being idolized is typically Aryan in nature, with the whole blonde, white, tall, pointy nosed, possibly blue eyed thing.  Which not everybody subscribes to.  </TEXT>

Yet the awful, awful spiderman show that replaced it has like, 100+ episodes :/ . It's not even that it's terrible, but rather that it's more of a kids' show than a good show. And Spectacular Spider-Man was that good V__V .
It handled stuff like Venom and Sandman so well. Sandman especially I thought was handled perfectly after the disaster that was Raimi's Spiderman 3. This Sandman was actually sympathetic in that one episode of his (those that watched the show will know the episode I'm talking about)
Josh Keaton is such a perfect spiderman, that's how you do quips right, he was so likable. Heh I remember when Young Justice got him to voice a spiderman ripoff designed villain. That was a nice homage.
I remember the first time I saw the art style I felt it was a little weird looking, but later I got used to it and didn't care because the characters and story were so good.
Later on, it proved to be amazing in terms of doing action scenes, so while the art style is different, that sinister 6 fight scene is probably one of the greatest scenes in animation of all time, which just adds to the shame of so few knowing about this show.
Breaks my heart we never got more episodes, I can only imagine where they'd take the story and characters, although I guess at the same time I'm glad that we never had to deal with Gwen dying because I don't know if I could handle that, she was a real character in this series, a real actual incredibly likable character, having the green goblin kill her would just be...

I remember as a kid I was so confused why Krillin didn't age, since he was the same height he was in dragon ball, and the same height in dragon ball z, frieza saga. I didn't quite understand back then that were midgets and he just happened to be short. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So what's the status on Sergio Leone's 269 minute cut of Once Upon a Time in America? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_in_America

In 2012 Martin Scorsese helped to bring out a 251 minutes version of Sergio's classic movie, that was more in tune with his vision than the short 2-3 hour cut that the movie has had for these past 30 years.  </TEXT>

In the related videos there was a haircutting video with what seemed to be a little girl, and I did a double take, thinking that can't be right. 

How did they even find out about asmr? These are literally preteen girls. The internet is a dangerous place, where in the hell are their parents? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I've always loved this show, having watched it since I was a kid. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I think one of the big reasons why I liked this show so much is because I'd spent my childhood reading books about parent-child relationships, especially mother daughter like in The Joy Luck Club. 

And I think Gilmore Girls is an important show for anyone to watch to see the relationships unfold between so many people, either mother and child (Lorelai's relationship with her mother paralleled my own, while Lorelai's relationship with her daughter was something I always wished for and idealized/wanted) or between friends, rivals, and so forth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think I told you in the other topic to disregard what that person said. 

At any rate, JD and elliot were together before the s8 finale... although yeah, that was one of the great parts of the show. I was so excited for every part with the original cast members, but absolutely loathe the focus on some of the new interns, some that are worse than others. On rewatches I straight up skip their part. 

When you consider the fact that they didn't even use them for the spin off show, it means that they basically forced them into season 8, wasted valuable minutes of an already short 20 minute show, and with no payoff whatsoever. It's more frustrating than the actual existence of that spin off show.  </TEXT>

I too recently got love and friendship which just came out on home media, and am expecting to enjoy it as well. I'd also recommend you watch stillman's movies in release order to truly appreciate them more.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I wholeheartedly recommend 2011's Damsels in Distress, it's such a fantastic and hilarious movie. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Made by the same director behind The Last Days of Disco, it has a similar mumblecore type vibe to it where you really get to know what feels like real characters which at the same time are completely outlandish and hilarious in their, for lack of a better word, arrogance. Greta Gerwig (Mistress America, Frances Ha) is amazing in this, you just crack up at everything she says, and she's one of my favorite "little known" actresses since she mostly does these kind of roles instead of big budget Hollywood stuff.
I don't even want to spoil the movie, I just want to say that it's mostly a look at the relationships and dynamics between people, set in a college campus where newcomer Analeigh Tipton (who is unbelievably cute, almost unbearably so with her soft voice and wide doe eyes) transfers to this school and is immediately spotted by a group of girls that run a suicide (prevention) center. From there on you'll just have to see how the dynamics unfold within the movie.
All the movies I mentioned in this topic are also great, but I chose to single out Damsels in Distress just because it's one of those movies where you rewatch it just to see things you miss the first time, like the expressions and faces that all the actors make at something Greta Gerwig's character says, or the fact that said "damsels" in the movie are so lovely your eyes keep darting from one to the other to take it all in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can just imagine jgl directing the hallway scene. I don't care how professional of an actor you are, if you didn't actually orgasm when scarjo was rubbing against you and telling you to then I have no words. 

Not that jgl isn't already quite gorgeous himself, he and scarjo make a beautiful pairing of attractive and sexy.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Scarlett Johansson's role in Don Jon is a role she was born to play. (Safety Spoilers) </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I really like this movie and its pairing of JGL and scarjo. This was the role she was born to play, an unbelievably gorgeous, out of this world woman, I could totally get don jon's obsession with her in the beginning. 

One of my favorite scenes is the hallway scene where you realize how she is skilled at manipulating a guy to control him since that's what she wants, I thought that was a really well done scene and probably the only time an incredibly arousing scene in a movie actually furthered the story and character development instead of just providing titillation (which as don jon so truthfully stated, could be gotten from pornographic content much more easily)

And the shattered expectations of don jon as he realizes that being super gorgeous isn't exactly the greatest foundation of a relationship on, in addition to learning about why he engages in his own vices, is something I enjoyed as well. 

All in all, these two actors really knocked it out of the park for this movie and I just can't help loving her role in don jon.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can definitely see how that absurdly abrupt ending would just completely turn one off.  And the developers seem to have noted the complaints of Alucard being underused since they went ahead and released DLC with him, which I actually bought and played if you can believe it (heck more so than that, I actually enjoyed, surprisingly enough) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Definitely agree with a lot of the points about the 1st and 2nd game. As for MoF did you play the console or handheld version? I was told the console version I played was slightly more bearable, which is funny because it was still igavania lite. But I thought it proved that there could still be more igavanias if they bothered to make a good one. </TEXT>
