	<TEXT> When I was a freshman in high school in the early 80's I was really into science and excited to start taking biology and physics classes.

Early in the semester the biology teacher stated that ALL LIFE requires sun light to exist.

I questioned that and said given the limited definition of "life" that we have from only what we know on earth today isn't it possible that there are forms of life that don't require sunlight anywhere in their life chain?

Her answer: "Go to the principals office.  You are disrupting my class."

I never took another science class again in my life.  I turned my attention to learning how to program computers and that worked out in life.  :)  

Oh and very belated - Ms Sivets you bitch - I was right! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Linkedin is just like so many other internet sites (you listening Reddit?) that lost their way over the years.

Back in 2006-07 it was a great site.  Wonderful for extending your network and making business connections.

Now it's some grotesque love child of Facebook and Tinder

Edit: Wow.  From the down votes there must be a lot of people around here that like the direction Linkedin has gone.  We'll just have to agree to disagree. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not correct.

Before the Iranian Revolution of 1979, Iran and the US had entered into an agreement to sell weapons to Iran.  Iran put down a deposit of $400m - basically in escrow.

After the revolution the funds were frozen and never returned.  

Iran "sued" (went to an international arbitration) asking for their $400m back plus interest for the past 45 years that the money was held by the US.  That total, if awarded by the arbitrators, would have been A LOT MORE than $1.7b.

The dispute was settled for this lower sum - $400m plus $1.3b in interest. </TEXT>

He said it's a 22 gallon tote and he started ticking of "There's Hulk, Spider-man.  I see Superman, Batman.  There's a bunch."

	<TEXT> So this is a weird story and I'm not sure how it ends yet.

I live in rural georgia.  I have a large stack of roofing tin that I bought 4 years ago and didn't use much of it.  My wife has been bugging me to get rid of it.

So for shits and giggles I put it up on the barter section of craigslist and said I would trade it for old comics from the 60-70s preferably Marvel.  I figured old Georgia farmers probably have comics stuck somewhere in their grandma's attic that they don't need but they do need farm building tin.  I expected no response.

I have had a bunch of other offers so far - from a 2000 car with 40k miles on it to a bunch of new construction materials (doors windows etc.)

I was to the point of starting to think about which offer would be best when I got the call last night.  An old farmer called me and said he had a "big tote" of old comics.  He mentioned a few titles (Sgt Rock for example) that let me know they are most likely silver age.  He mentioned Superman and Batman which I told him were DC then I ticked off some Marvel books and he said "yeah, those are in here too".

So today he is bringing his "tote" for me to look at the books and see if I want to trade him for the tin.

Last night I was like a kid at Christmas waiting to open presents.  I am just dreaming of what cool books might be in there!

But I'm just worried that when I open my presents I'm not going to get the GI Joe with the Kung-Fu Grip but some damn Hot Wheels instead.

I'll keep you guys posted.  Wish me luck.

Edit1: Just heard from the guy and wouldn't you know it his truck broke down on the way so we agreed I will go to his farm tomorrow to look at the books.  He said it's a 22gallon tote full.  Now I have to go another night without sleep. :) </TEXT>

I haven't been there in a while but they used to have a running inventory of every comic they have ever graded and how many copies of each issue have received each grade.

At one point I had the highest graded Spider-Man #18 with a 9.0 but I would imagine there have been higher grades given since then. </TEXT>

You send them your comic and their experts review it for a variety of things such as spin roll, edge trim, page coloration, etc.

They assign a value from 1.0 to 10.0.  There are also several "types" identified by the color strip on the rating, for instance "restored", "original", etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well let's take those questions separately.

"what do they do during the other times?"  Their real jobs.  Being on a board of directors is not a "job".  It involves several times a year (more when the company is having trouble less when things are flying nicely) meeting to provide insight and apply your specific business knowledge and thought processes to the helping a company develop and evolve its business strategy.  

What other responsibilities do they have? A director also is used outside of board meetings as a conduit to meet other people/companies that may be of value to the company for which the person is a director.  The director may also act as a sounding board for the CEO in one-on-one phone calls or lunch meetings when the CEO just needs someone to bounce things off of.  Directors can be paid in a variety of ways - anywhere from receiving an equity grant that vests over their term on the board or a cash stipend for attending each meeting - which can be anywhere from a few thousand to tens of thousands.

How is the board actually chosen?  That depends on if the company is public or private.  In a public company the board is nominated and voted on by the shareholders.  As a general rule the nominees presented by the company are almost always "rubber-stamped" and elected mostly because very few people actually vote their shares on board issues.

In a private company, to board is usually made up of the major shareholders and CEO.  If there is a person that one of the board members feels could join the board and add substantial value the board members discuss it and vote during a board meeting.  If they agree to add the person a resolution is passed and the individual is added as "an outside director". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Half of my executive team are woman.

Honestly having done this for 30+ years now I can tell you - raw skill for skill - women make better executives in general.  

I personally feel the reason that is so is two fold.  First, women just have a better ability to work through a problem *rationally*.  They use their head and heart which is a great place to lead from.  Men generally use their head and their penis (well - testosterone).  They bully their way to where they are going where women tend to navigate their way there.

Secondly, women have a gender chip on their shoulder and feel they have something to prove.  Men on the other hand (particularly white males) have a sense of entitlement and can be extremely territorial and political.

I realize these are broad characterizations but I've gleaned them from many years of interacting with a wide assortment of executives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As /u/DrKobbe states a company controlled and directed by its board of directors.  The board of directors meets on some frequency (usually quarterly but sometimes as rarely as annually).  During this meeting the Chairman of the Board leads the board through its discussion as it sets broad strategy, reviews results, and adjusts trajectory as needed.

The Chairman can be either "Executive" Chairman or "Non-Executive" Chairman - the distinction is whether or not the Chairman has an active role in the day-to-day operations of the business.

The CEO generally always a member of the board of directors.  His/Her job is to execute on the directives of the board.  He/She effectively is the active leader of the company.  A good rule of thumb I use is that the CEO should dedicate 80% of their time "working ON the company" and 20% "working IN the company".  Basically the CEO spends most of their time focused on engaging outside the company to help develop its business model.

Not all company have the President role.  It is sometimes combined with the CEO role and other times it is combined with the COO (Chief Operating Officer) role.  Generally a President is in charge of ensuring the company is operating efficiently on a day-to-day basis implementing the CEO's initiatives (which are granular echoes of the board of director's directives.  A good rule of thumb I use is that the President should dedicate 80% of their time "working IN the company" and 20% "working ON the company".

	<TEXT> Hi there.  So I have finally joined the rest of humanity and succeeded in finally breaking the screen on one of my Apple products and so I've been forced to upgrade to a new iPad Pro.

I have had this iPad2 (32gig) since it was released about 5 years ago and I have been using it for my work the whole time.  It works perfectly. It also has a Zagg2 bluetooth keyboard and case.  Here's a picture of it:  http://imgur.com/a/Tdi2Z

However last weekend I dropped it on a stone floor and..well... Now it has a lovely spiderweb screen.  It hit on the top left corner of the screen so the only part that has a lot of cracks is mostly that quadrant of the screen although some cracks run the whole way across.  It doesn't really affect the use of the tablet.  Of course someone could replace the screen for about $100 bucks if it really bothered them.

So I would like to help someone out that is in need of a tablet.  I want it to go to a child in need that could use this iPad to help better themselves in school and in life.

In the comments please indicate who you would like to gift the iPad to.  Must be a child/student.  The requester must be an adult guardian of the intended recipient.

Rules:

- Requester must have +1000 combined Karma
- Requester must have been a redditor for more than a year
- Recipient must be an Honor Roll Student (provide proof via PM)
- No PMs will be responded to

All requests received by midnight Friday will be considered and a winner will be selected over the weekend.  Winner will be posted here and contacted via PM for shipping information.

If your request seems sincere be aware I will review your post history.  If your post history does not show that you are a generally good person I can tell you now you won't be selected. 

All I ask is that the winner acknowledge that in the future, when circumstances permit, they will do one nice thing for someone else.  Pay It Forward.

Good luck to all.

EDIT1: Awesome news!  /u/Piyrate has generously offered a white iPad2 that they have as well so I'll be selecting two winners and you will each receive a PM from one of us.  Also, /u/Piyrate made a good point I didn't think to mention.  Both iPads have built-in 4g internet access but obviously to use that you would have to sign-up for a data plan vs. just using free wifi at a hotspot.  I was using AT T on mine which has a $30/mo data plan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife, son, and I frequent a local chain that has two words in it's name both ending in "E". :)

The three of us go every Sat/Sun morning for breakfast.  I also go by myself 3 days during the week when I work from home.

My problem is that I used to work in a restaurant when I was younger and know how hard and unappreciated the work can be so I always like to tip servers really well generally between 80-100% (not like I'm a big spender - weekends the tab is usually $20-25).

Anyway, we have been going there for years and as the staff turns and there are new servers we see some really crappy behavior now - servers aggressively trying to get us to sit in their section, bad mouthing other servers, etc.  

It's just really weird.  I'm just trying to enjoy my breakfast and maybe help someone out a little.  I'm not there for the drama.

What do you consider "acceptable" behavior in trying to "snag" a regular?

For the record, the best servers that were always pleasant, on top of table needs, and friendly seem to have gotten drummed out by the infighting and drama so it might be time to break this habit. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has anyone ever worked with Lighter Knot? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-18 19:20:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Earlier this year I found an awesome piece of pine lighter knot and made it into a towel rack (album here: http://imgur.com/a/oIQC2).

So flash forward a few months and I found this killer piece that is 21 feet long: http://i.imgur.com/qIx9gPW.jpg

The towel rack didn't take much cutting except getting it flush for the wall.  I want to use this piece as a full base for a long countertop/bar in a hobbit house that I am building.

I've studied the piece enough now to see the generally orientation.  I will be cutting back a fair portion to get to a flat part on the far end that can be finished out as an exposed center grain top, carving out in the center for a stone sink, and then cutting off flat on the last 8 feet closest in the picture and installing a stone countertop on that part.

My question is has anyone ever worked with lighter knot like this? Because of the hardness and high-resin content just doing the rough cut with a chainsaw is hard enough.  I am wondering how the sanding and finishing is done with so much resin in the wood?  I am guessing the friction from sanding will cause the resin to soften and "ball up".

Anyone with experience or pointers on using this type of wood?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How interested are HR Generalists in moving to the HCM software vendor side? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-07 19:40:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi.  If this is the wrong place to post this mods please just let me know.

I have seen posts here on occasion where HR practitioners have asked about how to make the move to the software vendor side of the market with their skills.  I have personally responded to several of those.

So now I have a reverse question.  The company I work for is a provider an enterprise suite of HCM solutions from recruiting through payroll.

We are currently hiring for a variety of positions - implementation, product management, client service to name a few.

We have a lot of senior employees with vast industry experience.  Now we are looking to bring in some more "entry-level" people.  By "entry-level" I mean new to the software vendor market.  Our preference is to get people with backgrounds in corporate HR, Benefits, or Payroll at mid-market sized companies.

So the question - does anyone have any ideas of the best place that we could/should advertise that will get seen by HR Generalists?  

We advertise on a variety of job boards and do get some quality candidates but they are mostly senior folks with extensive vendor side experience.  

How can we find top-notch HR Generalists that want to make the move from corporate side to vendor side?   Do they exist?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-06-30 16:57:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as I get older and important lesson I have learned is "what is important as a memory to you most likely didn't even register with your parents".

When I was nine I remember my father taking me and my brother to watch scenes being filmed for My Name is Nobody.  I remember it was a Western.  I remember seeing Henry Fonda (although I didn't know who he was really.  I remember them asking if we wanted to dress up and be extras.

So I recently mentioned this to my parents and they looked at me like I was from another planet.  No recall at all!

So I went to IMDB to see what I could find.  We traveled a lot as a family during the summer vacations from school.  New Orleans was one of the filming locations and a place we went to fairly frequently because my parents had family and friends there.  But several other locations are possible - Arizona, Colorado - as we did a summer trip out west.

Does anyone have any additional knowledge about the timeframes these various locations were shooting?  What scenes, etc?

As I recall the scenes we were at were kind of that dusty saloon western main street scene filmed outside.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

The office is about 32x16.  Blow-in foam insulation and new construction so nice and tight.

	<TEXT> Hi.  I waited over at /r/TalesFromYourServer for a table for over half an hour hoping to help someone out but only one person came by and basically told me to "go f* yourself" so I walked over here to see if someone here could use some help.

- Must be a redditor of at least 1 year
- Must be an ACTIVE redditor with at least 1,000 link and comment karma combined
- Must have a paypal account 
- Must have a *small* realistic monetary need
- NO PMs will be read or accepted

If you meet ALL of the criteria above please post your request as a comment here in TL;DR format.

Hope I can help some of you out today and brighten your day.

Edit: BTW - I only will be on for another 30 minutes.

Edit2:  Wow, no one really needed help today.  Two people asked for a little help but failed to send me Paypal info.  Oh well I guess that is a good thing that everyone is doing well today.  I have to run but I'll try another time.  Peace. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-06-06 22:49:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So a bit about my situation that I feel will affect the input people might be able to offer:

I live in rural GA.

I am building a "hobbit house" that will be about 800-1000 sq ft when completed. The house will be underground except for the roof. It sits on the top of a hill with clear view of the sky in all directions. The house is round more or less.

The front will be facing north. 180 degrees of the south face will be available for solar panels. Essentially three large roof sections that are "triangle" shaped that meet at the peak (think of three sides of a pyramid splayed out to only cover 180 degrees.
This will only be a guest house so really just designed for 2 people to live in.

Water is pump driven from a deep well on the propery. This pump will remain on grid.

I am not concerned really about price or ROI.

So - with all this said:
Is there a resource that can pinpoint by GPS the absolute best angle to locate the solar panels?

Are solar panels available in any shape other than square? I was hoping to cover all three "triangle" sections of the roof uniformly instead of in lines of squares/rectangles that don't get full coverage.

How hard is this as a DIY project?

What can I roughly expect to spend?

Are there special considerations required if you are going to have any 220 appliances? (I'm expecting the answer is "yes" and I'll probably try to refrain from having any).

Can a Tesla powerwall be used as a storage device or are there better ways to store and deliver electricity? I want this totally off grid if possible.

Are there resources to estimate the amount of storage needed to operate off grid? A place where you can enter a list of all expected electrical devices and it estimates your usage needs matched against your location and expected solar generation to determine battery needs?

Sorry for the million questions just trying to do a little homework before I embark on this one.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-09 20:49:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I loved Civil War and by far my favorite was the appearance of Giant-man.  The only thing that could have made it better is if the whole Ant-man story line had been with Pym instead of Lang.

But that said, what are the odds we get to the Goliath story-line?  Maybe as an outcome of Infinity War?  They have set it up in line with the comics (somewhat) that growing is strenuous on the body and can make Lang pass out.  And obviously this was the first time (other than in the lab) that he tried this.  In the comics it took a while for the growing/shrinking to take its toll on Pym's body.

If we do get the story do we get the awesome blue/gold Goliath costume?  Can Rudd handle a weighty story like that?  Right now he is positioned as comic relief. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How best to find and hire someone for post-production </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-20 19:09:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure if this is the right sub or not (other suggested subs please if you know them).

My company is trying to have two web commercials produced.  Each will be about 2:00-2:30 minutes.  The second just has a different opening and closing with the same central content and would end up maybe :30 seconds longer.

We have already scripted them out and have recorded all of the video and audio components at a professional studio (with green screen for those shots).  

Now we are trying to locate someone to do the post-production and editing.  We have gotten one quote from a local firm that seemed really high.  We found a website called fiverr that seems to be on the other end of the spectrum in price - so low that it seems like they aren't going to deliver a quality product.

Can someone offer some guidance on where the best place is to find reputable, quality post-production?

Thanks in advance for thoughts or links.

EDIT: Also some of the shots are "product shots" where we had planned to simple record the application being used with screen grab video.  But the local quote said it would be better to "animate" the application which doesn't make sense to me.  Is there a reason to "animate" an application as opposed to using screen grabbed video. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone need a laptop? I have 10 to give away. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-05 19:37:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> FINAL EDIT:  Okay.  The 10 laptops have been awarded.  You can check comments below to see who they went to if you are interested.  I have PM'ed each recipient and asked for mailing addresses so I hope to get them all in the mail over the next couple of days.  If you didn't get one, keep watching.  We upgrade laptops all the time in waves so next time I see a stack sitting around in IT...   Be well all.

Hi.  We recently upgraded some employee laptops at my company and offer the old ones for people to give their kids or donate them.  After all takers there are still 10 left.  They are in good working order and would be good for a student.  Here's a pic: http://imgur.com/g99RrX3

These are all Dells of differing size and models.  IT wiped them back to original Windows 7.  They should have a version of Office (2003, 2007, 2010)on them (OEM), and a version of Adobe standard.

THEY DO NOT HAVE POWER BRICKS.  But you can buy one on Amazon for $15-25 bucks.

So does anyone have a student in need of a clean, solid laptop?  Let me know.

Preference will be given to requests:

- From an adult
- With a reddit account over a year old
- I will review your comment history so if you are a racist or asshole don't bother applying

Thanks for reading.  Hope this could help a few people out.

EDIT:  Must be in the US
           Must have at least 300 Karma
           Post request directly in this thread - Do not PM as initial request
(thanks for the tips /u/rhubey )

EDIT2:  I am glad that this seems to be something that a bunch of people could use.  Make sure you include as much detail as you are comfortable with regarding why you need the laptop and for who.  If you just said "can I have one?" you might want to edit your comment and add some context.  I'll be reviewing the posts in the morning and the 10 I select I will add a reply comment for you and I will PM you for your address.  It will take me a few days to get these mailed out to everyone.

EDIT3: /u/funky_bbq suggested I get some specs so here's what IT had to say: 

All should be windows 7 Professional.  And patched to current as of a month ago.
4GB of memory, 
CPU - 2.53 gigahertz Intel Core2 Duo or 2.53 gigahertz Intel Core i5 M 540
Disk should be 250GB.   300GB

Most of them have a version of Office on the.  A version of Adobe Standard on them.  It depended on when they were bought, what OEM came with it.
These licenses are only for that particular machine and cannot be moved. 

Some of them may have dead batteries.  But they will run if plugged in. 

EDIT4: /u/rhubey to the rescue again.   I have updated EDIT1 to reflect the following:  If you are selected I will post a reply comment so there is transparency on the people that get selected.  I will then PM you for your address information.  NO DIRECT PM's will be responded to. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So we were eating at a Waffle House this weekend.  The booths are supposed to be for 2 or more.  

While we waited for a table to open up there was a table that had 1 guy sitting at it.  He was working on his computer drinking coffee while at least 3 families waited for a table.

My favorite waitress stopped by to say hi (it was her table).  She said the guy had been there over an hour already and had already closed out his tab and gave her a $2 tip. 

We were finally seated, ordered, eat our breakfast, paid, and as we left he was still there there.

It was incredibly rude of this guy.  The waitresses only have a couple tables and obviously live for their tips.

I tipped the waitress just because that guy was being a jerk and suggested I should say something to him - to which she begged me not to.  I asked her if there was something the manager could do.  She said they were not allowed to "speed up" a customer.

I find this so frickin' wrong.  What would happen if you went to get a haircut and after they were done you just said "no, I like this chair - I'm want to sit here and finish my book".  

How do you guys deal with this?  Would it upset you if a customer took it into their own hands to point out to another customer how rude they are being?

Thanks in advance for your thoughts on this issue.

	<TEXT> Hi. We are recent "cord-cutters" and have been enjoying life within the walls of Netflix and AmazonPrime Video.
But can anyone tell me if there is a resource for Netflix that let's you know when new seasons of a series that is currently still in broadcast are going to be added?
Arrow only has 3 seasons and I believe the 4th season is being broadcast right now on CW. Do they add seasons after they are complete?
Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So valuable life lesson.  Never 1-click shop on Amazon on your iPhone at [7].

My wife and I were hanging out enjoying some trees when our trusty old acrylic water bong (12") finally tapped out.  So I whip out my iPhone, Amazon app, water bong, see one that looks about the same and 1-click buy.  Then of course forget about it.

Jump two Prime days forward to yesterday.  My wife walks into my home office with a tiny little box that says "Acrylic" in large letters down the side.  Since I do a lot of home improvement projects my first thought was "oh I wonder what project she wants me to do that needs liquid acrylic applied".

She throws it to me and I open the box to find a 4" water bong.  Seriously.  4" high.  We both started laughing.

So we made lemonade.  Hit it and watched this video. :)

	<TEXT> Hi.  I am interested in getting an oil on canvas painting commissioned.  I'm interested in something in this style: http://www.aliexpress.com/item/Signed-Original-Modern-Palette-Knife-HORSE-Oil-Painting-Impressionist-Art-no-framed/1884297832.html?spm=2114.40010508.4.102.omBMwP

It would be of three horses - one on each panel measuring 5' (vertical) x 18" hung with a 3" gap between the panels.  The color palette would be a little different.

The website in the link above seemed interesting as it looks like they do custom work but I wasn't real comfortable with the company as the website seems pretty funky.

Is this the right place (or other subreddit) to try to talk to artists that might want to look at doing a commissioned work? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I am building a master bedroom / bathroom addition.  I decided I wanted a bidet.  I had used one a few years ago while traveling abroad and liked it (It was the old fashioned type that is separate from the toilet - think Crocodile Dundee's hotel in NYC).

I bought the new type that is integrated into the toilet seat.  Here's a quick one minute video of how it works:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6sj8nCyrZbY

I strongly recommend if you are doing a bathroom remodel you consider putting one of these in.  

As a smart man once said "If someone ran up to you and smeared shit on your arm would you think it sufficient to just wipe it of with a tissue?"  I think not!

If you have any questions I'll try to answer them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, I want to thank everyone that submitted nominations.  I read each and every one of your comments and PMs.

There were a lot of deserving people and I am sorry I can't help all of you.  I do have to pick just one.  

I am selecting the nomination that I thought most fully fit with what inspired me to make the post in the first place.

The winner is /u/darthchubby!  Darthchubby nominated his son Tommy.  Tommy has nearly straight A's (dude - a B in economics?  really? I expect you to fix that now!) and is taking AP classes.  Darthchubby has been a long-term redditor and a review of his post history shows him to be a great and motivational human being.  

A personal message to Tommy:  Tommy, you have clearly been a big help to your parents and very supportive of them as they go through some of life's struggles.  Keep being the great young man that you are.  And remember, live is a series of ups and downs.  Never let the "ups" go to your head and never let the "downs" keep you down.  My children had to go through hard times when life wasn't being very nice to my wife and me (yes, I survived MRSA too).  But now as adults they tell me that seeing those hard times as a child helped them understand the world so much more.  It helped them to learn to take the good with the bad and find a way through.   I hope this laptop helps you as you finish up your high school year and hopefully helps you on your way to college.

Darthchubby - please PM me your personals so that I can get the laptop to you for Tommy.  

Also some bonuses for Tommy from other great redditors!

Please PM /u/FauxBoDo  he/she has offered to send Tommy a new HP printer

Please PM /u/discordkitty he/she has offered to reset the warranty to the day Tommy receives the laptop so it will be covered for 2 full years

Finally, I want to thank /u/iamjustjenna and all of the great redditors that helped her make the holidays special for her son Drew.  If you would be willing to PM me your personals as well I would love to send a little something to Drew.  He seems to be a very special boy!

Remember, life is short.  Be a good person.  Pay it forward when you can! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there.  I just saw this inspiring post by /u/iamjustjenna over on /r/videos:  https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/4204zp/generous_redditors_donate_ps_vita_plus_other/

And I realized how crazy it is to have this thing sitting around my house doing nothing when I am sure there is someone out there who's life it can help brighten.  http://i.imgur.com/TJIy5cO.jpg

I was given this as a "thank you" maybe six months ago for at a speaking engagement that I did.  I brought it home to my son thinking he might want it but he didn't.  Since then it has been sitting on the counter gathering dust.

Time to find it a home.  Here's the ground rules.  I am taking my inspiration from the video link above.  This needs to go to help a great kid who's parents have maybe fallen on hard times.  

1) Must be for a teenager that is in school and getting good grades. (IM redacted report card or other proof)
2) You must have been an active reddit account for at least a year so that I can check your post history to make sure you are on the up-and-up.
3) Must be in the U.S.

Tell me about your child and why your child deserves this laptop.  Requests need to be received by 7:00 ET tomorrow morning (1/22/2016).  I will review all requests tomorrow morning and select a recipient.  I will mail it to you, the parent, and you can make the gift to your child.  No need to tell him/her how or why.  Just make your kid happy.

And finally, once you are back on your feet you must promise to "pay it forward" by doing something nice for a stranger when you are able.  

Deal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am looking to build a murphy bed on one wall of a room I am building.

Most times when you see a murphy bed in the "closed" position on the wall it is built to look like a cabinet or shelves.

I am curious if it would be possible to have a built-in TV so when the bed is closed the TV is on the wall.  When you open the murphy bed and fold it down the TV would basically end up under the bed - screen facing down to the floor.

Obviously there would need to be all types of thought given to insuring the bed is not "vigorously used" or that at least there is a separate suspension for the bed that isolates movement on the mattress and does not transfer it to the TV.

But would the TV electronics be damaged by being in that position?  I would expect the bed to be very seldomly used (guests basically).

Interesting idea or disaster waiting to happen?

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So question here.  I am not very familiar with the process for generating movie CGI other than the general process - reference dots, motion capture, and then... magic.

It seems that when the animators are developing the "skin" for the character couldn't they fairly easily use an entirely different "skin" during development and testing of the footage and then "swap" it out at the very end to a DJJ skin?

If the voice is being done differently (under the theory that JJ's original voice was a disguise) they could have near complete footage with a totally different character design for Snoke that gets switched out late in the game to help maintain the secrecy.

Anyone versed in the CGI process?  Is this viable? </TEXT>
