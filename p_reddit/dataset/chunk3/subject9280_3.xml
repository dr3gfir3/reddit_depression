	<TEXT> Also the hivemind of likely basement-dwelling-virgins tbh.  The only people that really love video game pussy are usually ones who haven't had the real thing.  Truth hurts, but doesn't mean its not truth.

EDIT:  Obviously knew dweller-virgins would downvote me, but sometimes the truth just needs to spoken, even if this sub and reddit in general like to circlejerk till the end of time.  You can downvote me but deep down ask yourself and you know its true.  The same people that like video game pussy get off to anime porn and that's pretty sad shit there </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's possible yeah, I just find it amazing if he really did get these for 50 cents each. Some of these games sell for $50 or more alone.  On a $50 game like Mario Party 2 that means OP got it for .1% of its total value.  That's a 99.9% discount. That's insane.

EDIT: Jesus fuck some people are buying it for $80 on **[eBay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/Nintendo-64-N64-Mario-Party-2-Video-Game-Cartridge-/322158919715?hash=item4b022b0023:g:WkYAAOSwzJ5XaGtG)** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> unfortunately the solution isn't to keep resisting or learn to resist more than you already are. Resisting indefinitely eventually results in the ultimate resistance: resistance of everyday life itself. When this happens you become suicidal and resent every moment you're awake and every morning when you find you're still alive after falling asleep the night before you're filled with dread and terrible feelings.


All of us only have one true real solution unfortunately, as difficult and as fucked up as it is sometimes to find the strength and courage to keep going forward. Resisting ultimately will always lead to the path of the ultimate resistance of life itself, and eventually daily suicidal thoughts and maybe even suicide itself. The only real option any of us have is to keep going forward. Somehow, some way, we have to carry on, or if not suicide will always be the only other answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> anxiety sucks, it makes you feel like you cant breathe and like you cant do anything. depression (severe in particular) is much worse, it is this dark biological/mental darkness which makes you believe in the worst of things and prevents you from feeling anything but utter darkness. 

Trying to combat this utter darkness by just "pushing through until its 'better'" doesn't work when the depression is very severe and or treatment resistant (like mine is). I've pushed through for years and gotten nowhere with ever feeling better, that's why some problems that just don't seem to have answers yet (or maybe not at all) are better to just talk about and share with others so we don't feel like freaks or hate ourselves thinking we are strange fucked up people for having these issues.  

When we talk with other people (like on this subreddit) we see that we aren't freaks or bad people, we just have chemical imbalances, issues with fear, and very bad and dark beliefs about anything and everything, just like many many many others do. Not one person facing any issue is even close to being alone in facing that issue, and in remembering so, we realize that we aren't horrible people. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm currently jailbroken on 9.3.3 on my iPhone 6 and have not been fully following the ongoing things in the jailbreak community the last couple weeks and am extremely out of the loop.


I like my current jailbreak but knowing that it will expire in like march or april (whenever that original certificate was set to expire) and when that time comes I'll have to like rejailbreak or something every 7 days I know that going on the next jailbreak is for the best. So I have not saved any blobs or anything yet and don't know how to do that, and I'm wondering if anyone can please tell me if the new jailbreaks are supposedly going to be stable soon and if whether or not ill have to do something similar like rejailbreaking every week or if those certificates will expire eventually too. Thanks for all your help everyone </TEXT>

	<TEXT> u/rollerex I know the internet makes us seem like strangers and not real people with real abilities for conversation and kindness, but I can provide just those things and truly whenever and always.  I know it seems like life cannot and shouldn't go on anymore, but this dark period will not last, there will be better days ahead I truly believe that.  Don't put any pressure on yourself either, no person is naturally ready for this type of situation, and thankfully there's always therapists and other professionals that can help you.  Not sure if you have steam either or anything, but if you want a friend to game with also im always here.  Life will get better, I'm sorry your wife was suffering so much and im so sorry now you are in so much pain, im here, really </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got my cortisol checked and came back normal. Idk man, if there's isn't something that I can find that will work I will kill myself. I can't live in this much pain every day.

If I don't find something I don't have any other choice but to die because it's been years of this now and I can't take anymore  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey your post related to me so much it's crazy. I'm 23 male, have severe depression and anxiety and ADD. I've tried over 14 medications for depression and anxiety, I've been seeing therapists for years, ive made lifestyle changes and have tried meditation, I've done TMS therapy and just finished a round of ketamine IV infusions two weeks ago, I've tried all sorts of supplements and nootropics, and no one thing has ever helped me. I have severe anhedonia too and when I was younger tried all sorts of ADD meds but couldn't tolerate any as I am extremely sensitive to side effects. At this point I'm not sure what to do and every day am so close to walking outside and killing myself. I've gotten all my levels tested many times too and the only thing that came back recently is that my testosterone level is low. I have an appointment with an endocrinologist tomorrow about that but tbh I really doubt that's the cause of all my depression, anhedonia, ADD, and anxiety. I like you deeply believe I have some sort of dopamine dysfunction or low dopamine issue that's been causing every one of these issues I've experienced my whole life. I just don't know what to do next I'm literally almost out of options and am close to death. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this logic never makes any sense. why is one person's pain more important than another's? Why is my pain that is there every minute of every day unrelenting and that I've tried to fix with everything not worthy of dying for just because another person will encounter pain? Why is their pain more important than mine?

Humans do not try to be selfish as much as we can  but when it comes down to the single most important things in our existence, every human deserves the right to put himself first.  </TEXT>
