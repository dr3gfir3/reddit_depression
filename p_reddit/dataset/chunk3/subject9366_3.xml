	<TEXT>  Why would you advise someone to do what he's already doing?

This isn't the same as trying to relocate within a company. For e.g., if the project you are working on goes into maintenance mode, you stop getting quality work. However, you have more context in your current company to find out other projects or teams that are still going strong. If you move to a different firm, it is difficult to judge the work quality of the team that you are about to join or influence the team selection.

All of this is, of course, if your current company itself isn't shitty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did it once too- it was difficult, but doable. I'd spend 1-2 hours on weekdays, by solving some problems or reading up some relevant stuff, and 3-6 hours on weekends. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is a lot IMO. Are you building some product or working in web services world? Because I guess in the latter, 10% time for design meetings won't be enough. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work for one of the big-4 tech companies. And I get to write code only about 15-20% time of the year. Rest of the time goes into architecture documentation, meetings, operations, mentoring, interviewing etc.

What about you? Also, it'd be great if you could tell us what kind of company do you work for (multi-national, startup etc.), that might help put things in more perspective. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hit a weight loss plateau with 16:8 </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi,
I started 16:8 IF 1.5 to 2 months ago. I went from 77 to 74 kgs in 2-3 weeks, most of which must have been water weight.
But since then, I haven't lost any more weight. I have been maintaining my fast periods religiously and have also cut down alcohol to a pint of beer a week.

Any thoughts from experienced folks on this? Would the weight loss begin again after some time? </TEXT>

Is it OK to leave out carbs from your diet? What does the body convert to energy? </TEXT>
