	<TEXT> For the record, a volume isn't the individual little comic, its a collection of comics into a more traditional book format.

I suggest The Strange Talent of Luther Strode(horror/action), Fell (crime), and Sage (not in any of the genres you listed but my favorite comic ever). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Normally, I'm the same way. However, Die Antwoord comes up in every goddamn discussion about modern music, and the whole thing is so full of shit. People talk about how artistic the group is, and if you don't like it you probably just "don't get it" which is just stupidly pretentious. Just because it doesn't follow the trends of other music doesn't mean its high art. If I covered a canvas with swastikas and the word 'fuck' and then threw up on it, people wouldn't say its a beautiful painting, so I don't see why Die Antwoord is given such high praise.

Not to mention how annoying the whole "fabricated weirdness for the sake of shock value" is. </TEXT>

Also, the Inhumans aren't very heroic, it seems. Most of Seoule's run seems to make it seem like they only care about self preservation and their public image. And that issue where Medusa gets the Inhumans s to basically ruin Stark's life? That was some Penguin-level shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't have the spirit of the first one at all. The main character is just really annoying and never really does anything to redeem himself.

The secondary characters are mostly useless.

The turned John the Mod into a black metal head for some reason, and all of his lines are about "God's not real", which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. They also turned the ladie's man guy (sorry, forgot his name) into a sleazeball and Bob is annoying as shit, as a ghost.

Most of the jokes are stale, there are several subplots that go no where, the music isn't up to snuff, and a lot of the story just didn't make much sense.

Plus there is a really cringey concert montage near the end of the movie that is pointless for the most part, is put together terribly, and seems like they were like "shit, out movie's only 50 minutes long, maybe we can elongate it with concert footage that doesn't matter?", And is clearly taken from multiple shows, rather than just one.

I could go on but I blocked a lot of that movie from my memory and my writing skills are pretty sub par right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Marvel: Dr. Doom, Cyclops, Spider-Man, Reader, and Moon Knight would be a horrible team. Doom and Cyclops would be fighting over the leadership role, with Spider-Man and maybe Reader trying to defuse the situation with humor. Moon Knight is off solving whatever the actual issue is.

DC: Green Arrow, the Joker, Batgirl, Martian Manhunter, and Constantine would be an even bigger mess. The Joker and Batgirl would be at each other's throats the whole time, probably only not fighting when someone is keeping them apart. I feel like Green Arrow and MM wouldn't get along too well if they were constantly working together, and Constantine would probably stir the shit.

I separate by universe because I can't choose just 5 and that makes it seem less silly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...and Deadpool is related to this?

Also, I disagree. There was cannibalism, "blood" splatterings multiple times, dismemberment, disembowelment, I could go on. Sure, it was animated foods (mostly), but does that really matter when those are the main characters of the movie? Still pretty fucked up. </TEXT>

Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie, but there were only a few scenes I thought were funny. It just seemed like most of the movie wasn't even supposed to be comical at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone always says America's rating system is dumb because it prevents kids from watching sexual stuff but violence is okay.

This may be true.

However, Sausage Party was one of the most brutal and graphic fucking movies I've seen in a long time. Even if you're fine with sex and language stuff, you should not be letting a kid watch that. </TEXT>
