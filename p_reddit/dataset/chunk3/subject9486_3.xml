	<TEXT> I am a man. And very grateful for your input. I will definitely get it traced into a vector at some point.
The thing is I'm unsure about how I plan to use it. My mum asked for a logo and this image of an exploded baguette diagram came to mine so I drew it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is all useful discussion for me. I do want to use this image because I quite like it but I will think very seriously about where. We are a one shop independent (and planning to remain that way). I think in places where this logo is not appropriate I would have a simple text logo of just the name of the shop. </TEXT>
