	<TEXT> I've had as many soldered cables as solderless fail on me in 20+ years of touring. I actually have a George L's cable in my touring workbox that I use with my tuner(s) that is 30 years old and has never failed. But, I know a lot of people who will never use solderless and that's OK, to each his own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty easy to DIY if you are a bit handy. Get the tolex and glue from Mojotone build up a pedalboard frame and wrap it. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. All the cords, both DC and the 1/4" audio are designed and made by my company 3 Monkeys Amps. The audio plugs are prototypes of our solderless 1/4" right angle audio connector. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those are prototypes of our solderless 1/4" right angle audio connector. They work great and are really small. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are always coming up with new ideas, so probably at some point. We got these small enough to use in most situations and the cable will bend at 90 degrees so it will work for most people. </TEXT>
