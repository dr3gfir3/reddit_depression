Plus there's the investigation itself, which is still ongoing according to Comey. If it was so clear cut, that part of the investigation would presumably be done.

#####'That money we have is blood money'

In a series of texts reviewed by Business Insider allegedly sent by Andrea to her sister, Jessica, in March 2015, Andrea said that their father "**has no moral or legal compass**."

"**Don't fool yourself**," Andrea Manafort allegedly wrote to her sister. "**That money we have is blood money**."

"**You know he has killed people in Ukraine? Knowingly**," she continued, according to the reviewed messages. "As a tactic to outrage the world and get focus on Ukraine. Remember when there were all those deaths taking place. A while back. About a year ago. Revolts and what not. **Do you know whose strategy that was to cause that**, to send those people out and get them slaughtered." 

...

"**He is a sick f------ tyrant**," Andrea allegedly wrote to Bond about her father. "**And we keep showing up and dancing for him ... We just keep showing up and eating the lobster. Nothing changes.**"

	<TEXT> No I'm not at all. Are you watching him? 

Yeah. Hes got impressive credentials, as well being affable, intelligent, and presenting well. 

I just watched the man speak for 3 hours, while people grilled him on case after case through his career, and I felt he made a lot of good points. Just because I disagree with his ideology, doesn't mean I have to hate him. He believes what I stated in my previous comment, and while I may not agree, I think that's sound logic. 


I dont hate him either. But that doesnt mean I think hes an appropriate choice for the SCOTUS. 

Let the legislative body legislate law. Let the judicial body distribute justice based off said laws.

Except its not that simple. In a common law system with binding precedent, Courts inherently make law whenever they decide a case based on its specific facts or resolve vagueness or ambiguities in the statutory or constitutional text. Its called case law. With SCOTUS, the Court decides what broad constitutional language means when applied to situations the Framers couldnt possibly envision. 

And that if we want things to change, we shouldn't be look to the courts, but to the legislative body to impart new laws. That if you want to overturn something like citizens united, you make news laws and regulations stipulating corperate donations, not ask the supreme Court to rule that the limiting of freedom of speech by a corperate entity is constitutional.

Citizens United was a constitutional ruling. It prohibited many of the laws youre advocating for on First Amendment groundsbecause a conservative majority of the court decided to make new constitutional law on the question of corporate free speech. The only way to overturn the ruling, without the SCOTUS overruling it, would be to enact a constitutional amendment. 
Do I agree with corperate donations to campaigns? Of course not. But do I understand his viewpoint? Definitely. We've got a real communication problem on the left. You can't just send me a Times article and expect me to forget what I just saw with my own eyes.

Im not saying to forget what you saw. Im asking for you to put it in context. [He wants to get on the court and gave answers calculated to maximize the chances of that.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-21/the-real-reason-to-watch-the-gorsuch-hearings)  

Even if he's idiologically right of Scalia, you can't demonize him for that and say this is all just for the optics. And I hesitate to say it, but this is part of the attitude that rejects what we tried to tell them about Trump. You treat people like they're dumb, and then send them an article to refute what they just witnessed. So how's that supposed to inspire trust in experts? Now things like views on things race, religion, and sexuality, aren't things I feel are up for debate. You can't discriminate against someone for things they can't change about themselves. But we're talking about a viewpoint on the constitution and seperation of powers. And thats something that is certainly debatable, and other's viewpoints should be heard. And I felt he made logical, sound arguments for his viewpoint.

Im not demonizing Gorsuch. Im merely presenting quantitative statistics summarizing his judicial record. Given those statistics, he doesnt seem like the right fitespecially in light of the refusal to even consider Garland for 310 days (the previous longest delay between a nomination and final action was 127 days, and the average is well under that). If Republicans get to block Democratic nominations but have their nominees confirmed, you dont have a fair representation of the diversity of judicial opinion on the Court.

	<TEXT> He's honestly made some great points I had never thought of before.

Are you being facetious?

He makes great points about the seperation of powers, and not over stepping the legislative branches duty to write laws. Pointing out that it's the judicial bodies job to enforce the law, and also determine whether or not laws are constitutional, not to write them.

This is what they *always* say. They understand the optics and politics of confirmation. But when they get in power, they engage in highly ideological conservative judicial activism.

	<TEXT> This argument has intuitive appeal and shifts the focus from Gorsuch to Trump. Glad that Schumer went there:

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) spoke on the Senate floor a day after FBI Director James B. Comey confirmed that the bureau was investigating possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia during the presidential race.

As part of his extraordinary admission, coming while he testified before a House committee on Monday, the FBI director also noted that the probe began last July, at the height of the presidential contest.

The presidential campaign also kept open the seat Gorsuch hopes to fill. Within hours of Justice Antonin Scalias death last year, Senate Republicans vowed not to consider anyone nominated by then-President Barack Obama because it was an election year, a promise they held after Obama nominated Judge Merrick Garland.

**Id like to point out that it is the height of irony that Republicans held this Supreme Court seat open for nearly a calendar year while President Obama was in office, but are now rushing to fill the seat for a president whose campaign is under investigation by the FBI,** Schumer said, according to remarks sent out by his office.

Schumer said that, to him, it appeared **unseemly to be moving forward so fast on confirming a Supreme Court Justice with a lifetime appointment due to the looming FBI investigation, which could potentially last for months or years.**

**You can bet that if the shoe was on the other foot  and a Democratic president was under investigation by the FBI  that Republicans would be howling at the moon about filling a Supreme Court seat in such circumstances,** Schumer said. After all, they stopped a president who wasnt under investigation from filling a seat with nearly a year left in his presidency.

This already represents a theft of Garland's seat for nakedly political reasons. And if the Trump campaign did collude with Russia, the appointment--like Trump's election--would be totally illegitimate.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A) Sovereign immunity doesn't apply here. Sovereign Immunity means the US Government can't be sued in Mexican courts, but Mexican citizen can absolutely sue the Government in a US court. If these individuals could prove harm they absolutely do have standing in order to sue.


That's not totally acurate. The reason you can sue the U.S. Government for damages is the limited statutory waiver of immunity embodied in the [Federal Tort Claims Act](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act). The default is that you *wouldn't* be able to because sovereign immunity. The sovereign immunity that you describe *also* exists, but it isn't the limit of the doctrine. 

B) Given the Internets ability to play detective, how long do you think it will take someone to crawl through mug shots and blotter reports to start putting names and pictures to that list? While the individual pieces of data are all public record, the combination of data is absolutely individually identifiable. 

This is possible. And if I were a criminal defense lawyer, I might use it to argue that the government is making it impossible for the accused to have a fair trial. Beyond that, it's promoting generalized anti-immigrant resentment and singling out state officials for non-cooperation when state law may well prohibit affirnative cooperation (recalling that such prohibitions *can* be Constitutional under cases like *Printz v. US* and *NFIB v. Sebelius*).

	<TEXT> White House press secretary Sean Spicer made a point Monday to suggest that a top adviser to Donald Trump's presidential campaign wasn't really a top adviser at all. Paul Manafort, who was the campaign chairman for months, was reduced to having played a very limited role for a very limited period of time.

...

In the same briefing Monday, Spicer seemed to dismiss longtime informal Trump adviser Roger Stone and former foreign policy adviser Carter Page as hangers-on. Some of those names, the greatest amount of interaction that they've had is have cease-and-desist letters sent to them, Spicer said. Former national security adviser Michael T. Flynn, meanwhile, was only a volunteer of the campaign, Spicer said.

The common link between all four men, of course, is that they are now liabilities  under scrutiny for their interactions related to an investigation of Russian meddling in the campaign. But Spicer's efforts to suggest that their roles didn't amount to much truly strain credulity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FBI director James Comey will be in the hot seat Monday facing lawmakers who accuse him of stonewalling Congress, as they demand answers about Donald Trump's potential Russia ties and the president's extraordinary accusation of wiretapping by his predecessor.

 The two explosive issues have preoccupied Republicans and Democrats alike for weeks, robbing Trump's administration of a smoother rollout and raising uncomfortable questions about possible collusion between Trump associates and the Kremlin. The stakes for the tycoon-turned-world-leader could hardly be higher.

...

Several congressional panels have launched investigations into Russia's alleged interference, including House and Senate intelligence committees, which have jurisdiction over the nation's 17 intelligence agencies, and the House and Senate judiciary committees.

The Federal Bureau of Investigation is also probing Russian interference in the election.

The question remains whether the agency has opened a criminal investigation into possible ties between Trump campaign aides and Russian officials.

Monday's hearing promises to be a very public showdown between the FBI and lawmakers, with the national security world certain to watch whether Comey drops a political bombshell on Washington.

Members of Congress have expressed mounting frustration over the lack of cooperation from the FBI about Russia and Trump's incendiary wiretap claim, which Barack Obama and an array of other officials have flatly denied. </TEXT>

In any event, a hell of a lot of people are voting for republicans at all levels, and gerrymandering, which we are using to mean "manipulation of the boundaries of an electoral constituency so as to favor one party or class." before you inserted yourself into the discussion, is not the sole cause. 

I never claimed gerrymandering was the sole cause. I said that state lines are analogous to accidental historical gerrymandering and these lines absolutely affect the outcome.

Again, you cant understand this election without looking at the fact that it would have been the third term with the Democrats in power. Since FDR/Truman, thats only happened oncein 1988. Holding the Presidency tends to decimate a party downballot. Similarly, if youre going to talk about Congress and the Presidency, you have to look at [Comeys](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/hillary_clinton_and_her_team_tried_to_warn_us/dcctqr2/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=user utm_source=reddit utm_name=frontpage) last-minute intervention and the Russian/Wikileaks interference. Even with that, Trump failed to win the popular vote. But this is a tangent. The point is, the EC, which is analogous to a gerrymander, alters the outcome of the election.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lets refocus on the original claim I was responding to:

[Gerrymandering] ... does not affect statewide and nationwide votes. I'd say the disenfranchisement of voters is the biggest issue at those levels, although gerrymandering a huge issue with district-wide voting.

You claimed that:
You're trying to cover for the fact that you tried to tell someone that state lines are like a gerrymander. 

I'm not trying to cover for anything. I've said in every one of the preceding posts that I'm **analogizing** arbitrary geographical boundaries that waste votes to gerrymandering:

1. State lines are ***like*** an **arbitrary historical gerrymander**. 

2. **Conceptually**, Gerrymandering is simply changing the outcome of a vote by **redrawing** the lines of electoral districts. ***You're right that state lines don't generally change.*** That doesn't mean **those specific lines**as opposed to other lines that could've existedaren't **determining the outcome**.  

3. **My argument isn't that it's literal gerrymandering**. It's that you have **arbitrary electoral districts determining the outcome**. That's **conceptually analogous**. The popular voteaggregated nationally, with no sub-containers and vote wastageis resistant to such changes, whether arbitrary or deliberately partisan. 

Id say Ive been consistent. My argument hasnt changed. Ive said explicitly that state lines, in several relevant respects, *are* like gerrymandering.

The electoral college is not gerrymandering. Representative democracy is not gerrymandering. Gerrymandering has a very specific meaning which you don't seem to understand.

I understand gerrymandering perfectly, and have made clear from the outset that I'm not using the most restrictive meaning of that term, but instead analogizing to how arbitrary geographical lines and sub-aggregationrather than popular preferencesare determining the outcome under the EC.

The conceptual part that is important is not sub-containers or vote wastage, it's redrawing boundaries intentionally to affect the results of the election.

That's your opinion. Mine is that sub-aggregationand the resulting vote wastageare incredibly important, regardless of intent. 

Whenever you subdivide the electorate into **single-member districts** (**SMD**), you almost certainly create disproportionality and wasted votes. Because of **clumpiness** (*i.e.*, the smallest increment of legislative representation requires multiple votes and you can't have fractional legislative seats), some disproportionality is inevitable whenever you translate a popular vote share into some smaller number of legislative seats. Lets but this unavoidable disproportionality aside for now. 


There are two types of vote wastage Im concerned with: (1) votes that don't count because another candidate has at least one more vote in the electoral district; and (2) useless excess victory margin in an electoral district that can't offset opponents votes in other districts because of the geographical line separating the districts (*i.e.*, more votes than are necessary to guarantee a win given the number of votes cast). These two effects are the basis for **cracking** (dilution of opponents across multiple districts) and **packing** (concentrating opponents voters in fewer districts), which are the basic tools of gerrymandering. But the key point to recognize here is that even districts drawn using neutral criteria, such as compactness, can lead to a significant mismatch between legislative representation and the electorate's actual preferences.

The Washington Post's Wonkblog [illustrates this perfectly](https://img.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://img.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/files/2015/03/gerry.png w=480). In the second example of the diagram, 60% of the popular vote becomes 100% of the legislative seats. This disproportionality occurs despite that fact that each district is (1) compact and (2) precisely matches the composition of the overall electorate. An election producing such an outcome would not be a good reflection of the support actually enjoyed by the blue party among the hypothetical electorate. 

Recall that, under your definition, gerrymandering is redrawing boundaries **intentionally** to affect the results of the election. So this result wouldnt be gerrymandering if it were brought about by a neutral computer algorithm rather than by partisan operative intending to affect the outcome. Indeed, note that the perfect representation shown in the first illustrated example is actually *less* compact than the second example. This isnt an abstract hypothetical, either. Because of urban-rural sorting, there would still be a significant degree of disproportionality between vote shares and legislative representation *even if* redistricting process werent subject to partisan control and gamesmanship. This disproportionality is problematic even if it isnt intentionally partisan.

So let's look at the 2016 election

There were 136,639,786 total votes for President. According to the [U.S. Elections Project](http://www.electproject.org/2016g) 59.3% of the **voting-eligible population** (**VEP**) cast ballots for President in 2016. There were 128,612,245 votes for House candidates, or 55.7% of the VEP. (The Senate popular vote in 2016 is less useful since only 1/3 of the Senate was up, and CA had an election between two Democrats to replace Barbara Boxer.)

Lets look at this more closely in the Presidential race:

Under existing electoral rules, Trump won. My point was that merely winning an election that geographically subdivides the vote and sub-aggregate does not indicate the Peoples broad preference. 
    
Specifically, 2,868,692 (2.1%) more people voted for Clinton, the plurality PV winner with 65,853,516 votes (48.2%).  In total, candidates *other than Trump* got 73,654,962 votes (53.9%), whereas he only got 62,979,879 votes (46.1%less vote share than Romney, who received 47.2%). Trump emerged the winner only because the EC valued the geographically-contingent judgment of 77,744 people in MI, WI   PA more than that of 2,946,436 second-class citizens nationwide (almost 38 times as many people). Basically a packed football stadium worth of people in these the swing states mattered more than a number of voters roughly equivalent to the entire population of Utah, Mississippi, Kansas, Nevada or Arkansas. 

Another good way to analyze this outcome would be to determine how many votes were needed to guarantee it (*i.e.*, how many votes were *material* rather than *wasted*). In other words: how many votes were absolutely necessary to ensure plurality wins in the various states that Clinton or Trump carried, respectively? 

By this criteria, only 27,786,490 Clinton votes (20.33% of the total) and 36,632,698 Trump votes (26.81% of the total cast) actually mattered. 72,220,598 votes (52.85% of the total cast) were wasted with no effect on the outcome. 

Of these wasted votes, 38,067,026 were Clinton's11,714,900 more wasted votes than Trump. Again, this is because of the arbitrary state lines. This is an *extraordinary* level of vote wastage. But it wasnt brought about through deliberate manipulation. Rather, it follows automatically from sub-aggregation within each electoral district (state), rather than in a single at large national aggregate that allows each vote to count equally and offset votes cast in any state.

So, not gerrymandering? We're just saying it's not gerrymandering leading to governors' elections and you're arguing against us. Now you finally admit that governors elections are not determined by gerrymandering.

Point to where I said that gerrymandering had anything to do with governors elections. With my original post, I was responding to the issue of how state lines operate effectivelythough not literallylike a gerrymander of the Presidential vote. Votes are aggregated separately in 51 sub-containerswith the winner of containers having a majority of the total volume of containers being the winner of the overall election (rather than the person with the most votes). The concrete example I gave showed how you could change the outcome with minor shifts to the boundaries of the containers, which are historical accidents. 

My point about how governorships and other down ballot races appear to work counter-cyclically to the Presidency was simply responding to your reply and suggesting that you shouldnt read too much into Republican dominance of those races. They *do* dominate, but theyd also be expected to dominate after a 2-term Democratic Presidency. 

Also, your evidence doesn't fit your argument. Obama did worse with governors of his party on an absolute and relative basis than anyone since Nixon/Ford. Nixon wasn't in office longer than Reagan, Clinton, Bush, or Obama. Reagan lost 2 governors, HW Bush lost 2, W Bush lost 7. Clinton lost 11 governors. Obama lost 13. No, I don't think it's largely a function of who holds the White House and how long they've been there.

Under Nixon/Ford, Republicans controlled the Presidency for 8 years. Thats whats being compared. Likewise, HW Bush was in office for 4 years and thus isnt included in the original table. Same with Carter. But if you look at 8-year periods of party control theres a pretty regular pattern of the Presidents party always losing governorships and the effect tending to increase with time. This is 30000 foot pattern recognition analysis. Im not positing a specific function here. If I were to want to do that, Id do a regression analysis--which, at minimum, would control for approval rating and would posit an increasing (non-linear) marginal effect over time (ruling party fatigue).

	<TEXT> This is a real shame. The robotic space probes aren't as sexy as human space exploration. But they are where a vast majority of the real science gets done.

Europa is one of the most interesting places we can visit, and we've already had prior cancelations of probes that would have studied it. During the Bush administration, the [Jupiter Icy Moons Orbiter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Icy_Moons_Orbiter) (JIMO) missionan ambitious probe that would have had ion-electric propulsion and a fission reactor with enough power for instruments like ground penetrating radar and a rail gun to vaporize targets for spectrometrywas cancelled to fund human missions. JIMO would have studied Ganymede, Calisto, and Europa (the ion engine would have allowed it to enter orbit around separate Jovian moons rather than depending on inertia). 

Now this Europa lander is cancelled. This really sucks for the scientists who basically now lose a part of their career they'll never get back.

If he joined the Nazi group within 5 years of being naturalized, he could be subject to denaturalization.

But if he deliberately lied or concealed something that would have made him ineligible for naturalization in the first instance, then he could still be denaturalized. There doesn't appear to be a statute of limitations.

	<TEXT> Believed to have been acting on President Trumps direct orders, White House press secretary Sean Spicer repeated it on Thursday night during a bizarre news conference having heard it from a TV pundit on US news network Fox News.

The revelation comes after America apparrently issued a grovelling apology to Downing Street yesterday for spreading the false claim that Trumps predecessor Barack Obama asked GCHQ to snoop on him after his shock election victory In November.

...

**An intelligence source told The Sun: We have identified the site where the claim was first made.**

**The whole incident bears all the hallmarks of the Russians. Its a shame people who should know better fell for it.**

A formal apology for it came overnight via Donald Trumps National Security Advisor H R McMaster to his opposite number in No10, the PMs security chief Sir Mark Lyall Grant.

Mr Spicer also rang Britains Ambassador in Washington DC Sir Kim Darroch yesterday to promise him the allegation would not be repeated.

Branding the claim complete and utter nonsense, a furious GCHQ spokesman said late on Thursday night: Recent allegations made by media commentator Judge Andrew Napolitano about GCHQ being asked to conduct wire tapping against the then President elect are nonsense. They are utterly ridiculous and should be ignored.

However, Trump brushed off questions about the claims at a press conference later, saying he very seldom regrets anything he tweets.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is the most relevant section:

###Accidents of history

**Ultimately, state lines are pretty arbitrary.** Yes, when those lines were determined, there were reasoned considerations like population and access to rivers and resources. **But statehood and state lines, often poorly surveyed in the first place, were hotly disputed in the 19th century.** Many states were created in response to political considerations, especially the balance between free and slave states. In other times, it could have gone very differently.

Consider two of the bigger nonpolitical state boundary questions of the 19th century: the fate of the Florida Panhandle and the Toledo War.

The Toledo War was a long dispute between Michigan and Ohio over a tiny strip of land along their border, which happens to include the city of Toledo. Ohio had the upper hand for one reason: It earned its statehood first, and therefore blocked Michigans petition  which included the strip. In the end, Congress proposed a deal: Michigan would relinquish its claim on the Toledo strip and, in exchange, would get the Upper Peninsula.

The Florida Panhandle and the Florida Peninsula were governed as separate regions  West and East Florida  under Spanish and British rule. They were effectively separated by hundreds of miles of treacherous swamp and forest.

Ultimately, West and East Florida were combined into one state. This was mainly coincidental: Alabama earned statehood before the Florida territory was annexed. West Florida repeatedly tried to join Alabama, starting as soon as the state was annexed and lasting all the way past the Civil War. Many of these efforts  which included referendums, congressional petitions and direct negotiations between Florida and Alabama  nearly succeeded. But they ultimately did not.

**If these minor border issues had gone differently, Mrs. Clinton would probably be president.** The Florida Panhandle is heavily Republican: Without it, the rest of Florida votes Democratic. Both halves of the Toledo War worked out poorly for Mrs. Clinton. Not only would she have won Michigan with Toledo, but she would have also won Michigan without the Upper Peninsula: Only the full trade gives Mr. Trump a narrow win.

**Interestingly, the same changes would have flipped the 2000 election, and perhaps the 1876 election, to the same result as the national popular vote** (though I dont have county-level results for Florida in that election). The pronounced regionalism at play in 1888 would have made it harder to change the outcome by tweaking state lines.

To be clear, you can also make plenty of changes that would benefit Republicans. You could reunify West Virginia and Virginia, to take an easy one.

**The point is that the main bias of the Electoral College isnt against big states or regionalism; its just toward the big battleground states.** If they break overwhelmingly one way, thats who wins. This is not exactly a high-minded Hamiltonian argument. **There arent many justifications for letting a few close states decide a close national election. But thats basically what the system does, and** ***theres nothing about those states that ensures they provide a representative outcome.***

----

My argument isn't that it's *literal* gerrymandering. It's that you have arbitrary electoral districts determining the outcome. That's conceptually analogous. The popular voteaggregated nationally, with no sub-containers and vote wastageis resistant to such changes, whether arbitrary or deliberately partisan. 

As for Governorships, it's largely [a counter-cyclical function of who holds the White House and how long they've been there](http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/content/images/KDK2016111701-table5.png).  

In any event, the wisdom of the crowd rejected Trump. His election doesn't indicate the People's preference for him. It shows only that an electorally-potent minority, empowered by accidents of geography and history, voted for him in the right places.  </TEXT>

That's probably true.

	<TEXT> Conceptually, Gerrymandering is simply changing the outcome of a vote by redrawing the lines of electoral districts. You're right that state lines don't generally change. That doesn't mean those specific linesas opposed to other lines that could've existedaren't the determining the outcome. This is the problem with making some people second-class citizens based on where they live.

	<TEXT> Your apollogies in all honor, he does represent the view of your country. 

He represents the view of an electorally-potent minority of the country. The EC valued the judgment of 77,744 people in MI, WI   PA more than that of 2,946,436 second-class citizens nationwide. 

He ran on that platform and was elected for it. You can enter into technicalities like popular vote...

The vote count was accurate and he was elected. But the popular vote isn't a technicality. It represents the broadest measure of the will of the people who voted. In that aspect, it's a better gauge of voter preference than managing to win bare majorities in electoral districts representing a majority of the electoral vote. Under winner-take-all, if you win a State by one vote, you get all of that state's electorseven if the popular vote was closely split. The winning candidate's excess victory margin and the votes for anyone other than the winner are wasted and not factored into the outcome. This may be the rule that determines who is elected. I'm not disputing the procedural validity of Trump's victory here. But a provedurally-valid electoral victory doesn't necessarily reflect what the people of the country want. 

And all of this is *before* we get into [Comey](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/z/dcctqr2) or Russia's election interference. 

 but on that i agree with him. He might habe campaigned differently and still won if the popular vote counted. So, dont apologize, go out and vote next time

I agree that we don't know 100% for certain how a popular vote election would've turned out. But by applying some fairly reasonable assumptions, [we can estimate what it might have looked like](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ieay6/comment/db8ooa1). Based on this estimate, which factors demographics of the newly-competitive states, it's highly unlikely that Trump would have won. 

And finally, by the way, I did vote. If every eligible voter in California had cast a ballot, it still wouldn't have mattered. We're second class citizens when it comes to electing our national leaders. But no one seems to complain about the disproportionate share of federal taxes that we pay, while getting only a fraction of every dollar back in federal spending.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who was removed from his post by the Trump administration last week, was overseeing an investigation into stock trades made by the presidents health secretary, according to a person familiar with the office.

...

The Georgia lawmaker traded hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of shares in health-related companies, even as he voted on and sponsored legislation affecting the industry.

Price testified at the time that his trades were lawful and transparent. Democrats accused him of potentially using his office to enrich himself. One lawmaker called for an investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission, citing concerns Price could have violated the STOCK Act, a 2012 law signed by President Obama that clarified that members of Congress cannot use nonpublic information for profit and requires them to promptly disclose their trades.

The investigation of Prices trades by the U.S. Attorneys Office for the Southern District of New York, which hasnt been previously disclosed, was underway at the time of Bhararas dismissal, said the person.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think this scenario is far too optimistic as well. 

The civilian casualties from the mass artillery  strike on South Korea can't be underestimated. And then you have the disruption to the global economy of having a major war in one of the most important, productive and densely-populated parts of Asia. 

If nukes are exchanged in conflict for the first time since 1945, it would erode the taboo surrounding their use and have destabilizing effects throughout the worldeven if it didn't escallate into WWIII. The U.S.' reputation would likely suffer as much if not more than with the Iraq War. And like that war, we'd be paying for it over decades. 

This is a can of worms we don't wanna' open.

	<TEXT> Right. And NK's nuclear and missile capabilities aren't that impressive.

If the North Koreans actually *did* try to use nukes against SK or Japan, let alone the U.S., then they will be erased by a U.S. nuclear retaliatory strike, which NK has no hope of disabling with its own nuclear first strike. This is not *mutually assured* destruction (MAD).  Its simply *assured* destruction. For them.

Lets think for a moment about what a NK nuclear attack on the US would look like. The most "plausible"and believe me, that term is very generousway to deliver such an attack would be via a land-based intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 

NK has some ICBMs in the late stages of development, but they arent yet ready for prime time. They'll still have to do many more flight tests to work the kinks out of their ICBM prototypes.

The [KN-08 mod 2, or KN-14](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/kn-14.htm)an upgraded long-range variant of the [KN-08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KN-08) ([technical assessment of KN-08](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs21schilling.pdf)), whose engine has been [successfully fired on the ground](http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/dprk/kn-14-first-stage-main-engine-cluster-static-test-firing-4-9-2016.htm), but [not in an actual test flight](http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/no-way-n-korea-has-operational-mobile-icbm-without-testing-engineer/) as far as I knowcould likely reach Chicago, or possibly as far as New York and Washington D.C. on the uppermost end of the [revised estimates based on an observed engine test](http://38north.org/2016/04/schilling041116/).

Heres a pretty comprehensive [technical assessment](http://38north.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/38-North_ICBM-Report122215.pdf) of the KN-14. The [bottom line](http://38north.org/icbm122215_section7/) is pretty instructive:

The KN-08 Mod 2 will probably be less accurate than we expected for the Mod 1. **The error ellipse will be at least 5 km crossrange and 10 km downrange, and achieving even that level of performance will require multiple calibration tests of the RV** [*i.e.*, re-entry vehicle]. It will also be more **vulnerable to interception,** particularly if the intended recipient can deploy missile systems like **Patriot or THAAD*** in the target areas. ICBM warheads are typically too fast to be shot down by such missiles, but **blunt RVs slow quite a bit as they descend.** [*Note*:the mod 2 version of the KN-08 adopted a [blunt RV](http://38north.org/icbm122215_section2/) in place of a [triconic warhead](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/0f/W87_MIRV.jpg), probably to solve design problems.]

The **biggest advantage of the Mod 2, particularly for the two-stage version we expect, will be increased reliability.** We had previously estimated, based on the performance of other North Korean multistage rockets, that the KN-08 Mod 1 would work only 30-40 percent of the time in early operation. With the more robust design, the **Mod 2 could have a 50-60 percent reliability at its initial operational capability. The North Koreans may have decided to trade a bit of performance to get a missile that is more likely to reach its target than to fall back on North Korean soil.**

After the April 2016 static engine test, which revealed slightly a more advanced Soviet-ripoff rocket design than originally anticipated, its [now projected]( http://38north.org/2016/04/schilling041116/) that:

If the North Koreans can launch an experimental ICBM early next year [*i.e.* 2017], chances are it will not work as planned. (North Korean missiles almost never work the first time.) But the timeline has moved up, and **an initial operational capability for the KN-08 or KN-14 of about 2021 rather than 2023 is entirely possible. There is a small chance that the missile could enter limited service by the end of this decade.** Large-scale deployment would require the ability to manufacture complete 4D10-class engines from scratch when they may still be using ex-Soviet hardware for key components like turbopumps and injector plates. But while this requirement may result in some delay, it is an obstacle that the North Koreans can overcome in time.

So far, weve only talked about the missile. NK also has to successfully weaponize the physics package. 

From the [revised technical assessment of the KN-08](http://scienceandglobalsecurity.org/archive/sgs21schilling.pdf) at p. 19:

North Koreas most powerful nuclear test had a yield of approximately 10 kilotons, sufficient to destroy soft targets within a 1.5 km radius. The U.S. Mark 7 bomb/warhead, a reasonable proxy for **the largest first-generation fission warhead that North Korea could plausibly deliver to CONUS** [*i.e.*, Contiguous U.S.] targets by a KN-08 missile, had a **maximum yield of 60 kilotons, which still corresponds to a soft-target destruction radius of only 2.8 km.** A KN-08 missile **cannot reliably be used to destroy any specific target,** and certainly not a hardened military target. It would **probably be sufficiently accurate to hit large urban areas,** but not to target specific neighborhoods or districts.

Note that this statement was based on an error ellipse of approximately 4 km cross-range and 8 km downrange, [such that] half of all missiles fired would be expected to fall within such an ellipse.  Id. That was back when the missile was anticipated to have a triconic warhead. Recall that the blunt RV, by contrast, has an error ellipse of *at least* 5 km crossrange and 10 km downrange. And even the triconic warhead estimate assumed significant guidance improvements, since if the North Koreans can only match the accuracy demonstrated by their previous Nodong missiles, the error ellipse of the KN-08 would be roughly 10  20 km at intercontinental ranges. Id. 

In other words, were talking about an ICBM that only makes it to its target without malfunctioning about 50-60% of the time, and then places a warheadwhich may not even go off, and has, at most, a 0.9-1.7 mile soft-target destruction radiussomewhere within 4.5-7.5 miles of where it was aimed, 50% of the time. The other 50% of the time, th warhead is delivered outside this radius. And thats not even factoring the likelihood of interception based on the slow re-entry. 

If the North Korean regime were to *even launch* such a weaponregardless of whether it succeededit would face massive retaliation and certain annihilation. Even though I live on the West Coast, Im not exactly quaking in my boots.  I'm more worried about a war with NK and everything that could entailincluding escallation into WWIII.

	<TEXT> Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson ruled out on Friday opening any negotiation with North Korea to freeze its nuclear and missile programs and said for the first time that the Trump administration might be forced to take pre-emptive action if they elevate the threat of their weapons program to an unacceptable level.

The policy of strategic patience has ended, Mr. Tillerson said, a reference to the term used by the Obama administration to describe a policy of waiting out the North Koreans, while gradually ratcheting up sanctions and covert action.

...

Negotiations can only be achieved by denuclearizing, giving up their weapons of mass destruction, he said  a step to which the North committed in 1992, and again in subsequent accords, but has always violated. Only then will we be prepared to engage them in talks.

...

Mr. Tillerson argued that a freeze would essentially enshrine a comprehensive set of capabilities North Korea possesses that already pose too great a threat to the United States and its allies, and he said there would be no negotiation until the North agreed to dismantle its programs. </TEXT>
