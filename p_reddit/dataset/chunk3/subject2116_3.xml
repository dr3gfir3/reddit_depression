	<TEXT> I think about beauty a lot.

I've always been an artistic child, according to my mom, far more willing to sit and color with crayons than run outside, always straying outside the lines of coloring books. My parents put me into art classes and camps starting when I was five. While I played around with a lot of mediums and a lot of styles, by the time of junior year my specialty was oil paint and people.

*Neo-Renaissance*, my art teacher called it. I was obsessed with capturing the human form  all the perfect muscles, sinew, hair, and skin that makes us us. People are beautiful, either gloriously or tragically, and I loved to capture that. Human beauty deserved to live on forever.

While AP Studio Art and the building up of my art school profile was my main focus junior year, I was also starting on my third year of French. France was a culture that seemed to share my love of beautiful things, right down to the aesthetics of its language, and seemed like the right choice. That was the class where I first met Ash.

It was in November when we all piled in, taking off the coats and scarves that signaled the coming of winter, and I noticed that Madame Elis was not here yet. She ended up coming in right as the bell rung, and perfection followed behind her.

He was slender with skin like ivory and perfect ebony curls that fell in front of a face people would die for. His eyes were big and dove gray, framed by charcoal lashes, and he kept them downcast. I had the irrational urge to run up to him and make him laugh and smile with that red, red mouth.

"We have a new student, everyone," Madame Elis said. Everyone was staring at the new boy in wide-eyed wonderment. "Please introduce yourself."

"I'm Achille Bellefleur," he spoke like a singing bell. "But you can call me Ash."

*Bellefleur.* Beautiful flower. A perfect name for a boy with lips like an English rose.

"Now you speak some French already, Ash?" Madame Elis asked. Ash nodded, curls bouncing.

"My grand-pre is from Cannes," Ash said, and from those scant few words I could hear the melodic thrum of his flawless accent. "He taught me. I wasn't formally taught, however."

"We're all here to learn. Please sit next to Isaac, over there."

*I* was Isaac. Ash moved with grace and sat on the little metal chair like a throne.  He looked up at me through the curtain of lashes and smiled, piercing me straight to the core. I think that's the point I fell in love.

Ash became instantly popular with a flutter of his lashes and a giggling laugh, and yet he still hung out with me. I remember dreaming about us in Paris in a little apartment and spending rainy mornings wrapped up together, and shared it with him.

"Paris would love you, Isaac," Ash would tell me. "Paris loves artists."

And I loved Ash with feverous devotion, his closed-mouth smile and cool gray gaze filling up my canvases and risqu anatomical sketches of his back and legs dotting my notebooks. We kept it hidden how he'd chastely kiss me when we were the only ones in the art room and spend weekend afternoons curled up together on my bed.

Ash wore adoration like a crown of laurels, made his high cheeks flush pink and his soft lips stretch wide. No matter how hard we tried, we couldn't hide our young romance, and people are hateful at the best of times, more so when they were jealous.

And Jacob Wilcox was a jealous guy.

Jake, to put it bluntly, was the villain from every teen comedy  star quarterback, captain of the football team, dating the head cheerleader while sleeping with the rest of the team. Unlike in a teen comedy, I didn't give two shits and he didn't notice the art nerd...until Ash spent time with me and not him.

It's stupid to think all homophobes are secretly gay or whatever, but there was no other explanation of why Jake would call me a faggot while mooning over Ash. He never went anywhere with Ash  Ash would just stare at him with that cool gray gaze until Jake got the message. It never seemed to stick, however, and when my house was egged and graffitied, it was certain Jake needed to face serious consequences.

"I know it was him, but the cops can't prove it," I said to Ash over the phone. Ash made a considering noise.

"Come over tonight, at around eleven," Ash said, voice low and flirtatious. "I know how to make it better."

We hadn't gone all the way yet, and the thought of a midnight rendezvous had me coming around early. Ash greeted me at his back door wearing a white shirt so thin I could see the bare skin beneath, and he danced out of the reach of my wandering hands.

"Down, down," he urged me, dragging it into his basement. I questioned why we were going down here since Ash's room was upstairs, but teenage lust quickly overwhelmed rational thought. When we were at the bottom of the steps, Ash turned to me and said, "Close your eyes."

I did, and Ash guided me. He let go of my hand, and I imagined opening my eyes to a lover's nest, Achille naked in front of me, and we would spend the whole night wrapped up in each other.

"Now open them, Isaac."

I did, and took a step back in shock.

Plastic had been laid out on the concrete floor, underneath a metal morgue slab, and bound down on the slab with plastic and rope was Jacob. He was gagged, making muffled noises of distress.

"Told you I'd make you feel better, Isaac," Ash said, spreading his hands across my chest. "He tried to fuck me, Isaac, but I don't want him. I want you."

"What are you" I stumbled over my words. Ash pulled away for a moment to slide off his shirt, revealing beautiful and unblemished skin. "How could you"

"No one can get between us," Ash promised. He hugged me around the neck. "We're meant to be, Isaac, and this *pig* can't change it."

He kissed me, slow and sweet, and slipped a knife into my hand. When he pulled away he murmured, "Don't worry, my papa showed me what to do."

It was me who let out the first blood, splattering across the plastic, but Ash landed the killing blow, a slash across the throat that drenched him in red. It dripped down his white skin and over his English rose mouth, and he had never been more beautiful. We made love together on the plastic, below Jacob's cooling corpse, and I had never known such ecstasy before. When his father found us in the basement, he just shook his head and taught us how to clean up a body.

Achille's line, the aristocratic French blood passed from father unto son, has been doing this sort of thing for a long time.

Tonight, as I sit in the car in front of a little suburban house, that line was going to continue. Ash is inside that house, my hands are white knuckle on the steering wheel. We have three tickets for Paris  for me, for Ash, and for the little boy Ash is carrying in his arms. There is blood on Ash's hands.

I know what I am going to paint next. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Re: monsters.

If it's a supernatural creature such as a demon, "Fuck You That's Why" is a perfectly good explanation for its behavior. Supernatural evil exists to destroy man.

However, if your creature has some kind of biological basis, things don't evolve "just cause." Try to think through why your monster would exhibit these behaviors, how would they make them more fit and survive better in their environment? hinking through a creature's behavior and motives doesn't detract, but adds to its creepiness via realism.  </TEXT>
