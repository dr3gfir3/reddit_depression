	<TEXT> Many have offered to buy us out. Some of them Masonic entrepreneurs who also post here in this very sub. 

I am very much aware of the huge potential of FraternalTies. My mailing list have an Open Rate of 53.3%, the eCommerce industry average Open rate is just 15.9%. Our Click Through Rate is 15.1%, while the industry average is only 2.9%. 

My website have been suspended repeatedly and, in terms of SEO, that is very bad. Our Google ranking have suffered significantly but the interest for my creations have only gone up. The demand continue to increase despite the repeated Google suicide. That tells me something.

Besides those points that I mentioned above, the primary reason I don't want to let go of FT is because I have achieved nothing else in life besides building this brand. I want to pass it on to my kids. I'm currently not capable of performing many of the duties attached to being a business owner but I am doing my best and I continue to look forward to that day when I will be fully capable.

	<TITLE> Original 2012 print out of popular Freemason meme on the auction block - 8hrs left </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-29 20:17:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Edit: Correction. 6 hrs left till end of auction.

Brethren, 

Although submissions such as this is generally frowned upon, I am making this post because I was encouraged by some members who genuinely like my work. If you don't like to read about any offerings or promotions of some sort on reddit, please do not read further. If you like to collect awesome (and potentially historical) Masonic stuff and at the same time help a business survive, then please read on.

I am putting up for auction the Masonic meme that brought FraternalTies to the map. [Please click this link and read description for more info.](http://www.ebay.ca/itm/Masonic-memorabilia-meme-poster-FraternalTies-/281638333694)

I am very proud of what I have achieved with FraternalTies- but I am now at a point in my life where I am seriously considering closing shop in six months or less unless we recover our losses. The thought of this makes me sad because we're at the peak of our popularity. 

As some of you may already know, I am on disability with no benefits, I would have funded my FraternalTies projects myself like I always had with the money that used to flow from my day job. But I am out of work, hence I am relying on our supporters on this one. 

If you like my work but cannot participate in this auction, please consider sharing the link. We only have about 6 hours left till the end of the auction. 

Important: I have been accused of artificially inflating the value of my creations. It's a most unpleasant feeling. Please know that the starting price of this auction is 0.99 cents and that ALL my Masonic themed artworks are available in high resolution for FREE download here at http://fraternalties.imgur.com/

	<TITLE> Toronto UFO around 2:50 am travelling southbound. Seen near Lawrence and DVP </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-25 08:35:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First of all I know exactly how this sounds like. I stepped outside to have a smoke. When I looked up, I saw six to 9 dull red lights (like bokeh) attached to the edges of a dark rectangular craft travelling at the speed of a regular jet southbound. It was huge. I did not hear any rumbling sound except perhaps the steady hum of the DVP. It was almost overhead me when I saw it. I freaked out and called my wife who was in the living room. She hesitated but when she gave in, the craft was already a little far ahead and she had troubles seeing it.

I am not making this up. I also do not wish to make a fuss out of this. But I know what I saw and I am really curious to know if anyone else have seen it.

I'm not sure if this matters but as proof that I am not some hallucinating nut crack, here's a link to my fb page (I got nothing to gain from this) https://www.facebook.com/FraternalTies

edit:

I was advised, for a good reason, to add a footnote. I experienced an awesome sighting but I don't believe nor meant to imply that I don't know therefore aliens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was elected and installed as the Senior Warden for my lodge for this Masonic year. After just about a couple of stated meetings, I had to resign my post as the SW. I'm in a situation where I have to choose between welfare of family, or the prestige, pressure, and many responsibilities of becoming a WM next year. I consulted my WM, and other Brothers that I trust. They expressed their understanding of my situation and I was eventually allowed to resign (I first expressed my desire to drop out when I was elected as JW)

This caused some issues because:
1. I am the only one in my lodge who have all the PM charges memorized.
2. Our lodge also have attendance issues and financial issues on top of that.

Though free from the responsibilities of an officer, I promised to attend when there is degree work so I may help them with the PM charge. To help with the attendance problem, I regularly promote my lodge on my facebook page. I don't have to be there every stated meeting but I feel no guilt because I took it upon myself to have minor roles that I know I can fulfill. This arrangement works for me.

I'd say that you should have an honest talk with your WM and express your heart to him while it's early. You could stick it out for a few more years but if your heart is not there neither the lodge nor you would benefit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can handle criticism fine. What I cannot take are insults from people who like to think that they figured out what motivates other people. I do this primarily as a form of therapy and to express my love of Freemasonry, profit is a nice bonus but what I make is not even enough to secure a guaranteed income every month. If I stop doing this (it's the only thing that I do) will you help feed my kids and keep a roof above their heads? I guess not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AliveShoes allows the designer to customize the shoes in many but limited ways. I said in "many ways" because you can select your preferred color for the sole, the sole stitching, details, lace, tongue. The color combination is many and varied. But I say "limited" because, though you can change the color of the individual parts to your liking, you cannot dictate how the actual shoe will be cut and sewn. As much as I would like to have the skirret or whatever tool woven in the details, it's not gonna happen. In other words, I can modify the colors but cannot change the template. 

This presents a unique challenge for me as an artist. I want a shoe design that will remind me of the checkered floor (emblematic of life itself..) but how? My solution was to alternate white and black starting from the white sole, and then the black sole stitching, and then white and black details, and so on. It's an abstract representation of the checkered floor of life.

The flower of life hidden behind the tongue. What is that for? If the  color theme of the shoe is a reference to the ebb and flow of life, the colorful flower of life which is hidden in plain sight is a representative of that divine spark in you. Today you might be standing on a white tile, but tomorrow who knows trouble may come and you will find yourself standing on a black tile. The colorful flower of life is there to remind you that despite the black and white nature of life, there are colorful slices of joy in between if you know where to look.

I really hope that makes sense. I'm still learning English.

	<TEXT> Find me a graphics artist who can do this http://i.imgur.com/sA8FuKK.jpg from scratch in a few minutes. It's my own rendition of a sacred geometrical pattern called the Flower of Life. This piece is one of the most technically challenging pieces that I have ever made in my decade and half of experience in graphic design. It took me many days (not mere minutes) and many revisions to get it right. If it's such an important piece, why did I placed it behind the tongue where it is hidden from sight? That would have been a good question to ask me. Yet it's easier for you just to just assume and open your mouth. You should be ashamed of yourself for passing judgment without a conscious effort to learn and understand things first. Shame shame shame. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hail from a "classy" family. My late father was a public school teacher, you can say that he used the parents and students community for a living. My mother is a nurse working in a hospice, I guess you can also say that she's using the old and dying to earn a few bucks. I happened to be an artist and web developer whose expertise lies in the production of Masonic arts and crafts. It's the only thing that I do. If I do not promote and further enhance my craft, what will become of me?

You say your many social media hangouts was polluted by these shoes, how difficult is it to just skip it if you don't want it? Not because you do not see the Square and Compasses means it is not Masonic. You climbed the ladder and reached the 32nd step and you proudly display it but you act no better than an eavesdropping cowan whose mouth is faster than his thoughts. You sir are very rough. It is men like you why I bear my current flair. One can climb the ladders and ropes beyond the 3rd but it doesn't guarantee further enlightenment (and maturity if I may add). One word of advice to you, if you do not see Freemasonry in littlest things, look no further- you will never find it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT: Shameless is the word I was looking for (non-native speaker)

I don't enjoy posting promotions like this on reddit because redditors have a special place for people like me who sell stuff online. But I am doing it anyway because I learned that to feed a family one must have a thick skin, and also because of the fact that a few members here asked me in the past if I could also post some of my creations and offerings right here (I do my product promotions almost exclusively in Facebook only and for some reason a lot of you apparently do not have Facebook). 

Anyway, here's the link to see the World's first Masonic sneakers. Inspired by the Checkered Floor and the Flower of Life. :-)

	<TEXT> Life is a series of experiences and lessons which must be lived to be understood. Your reality, the way you see and define things, is different from everyone. We pick up what resonates well with us, we discard the rest. Isn't that human nature? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We all know that to be really really good at something- be it singing, business dealings, or playing particular sport, we have to devout our life to it. We have to eat, live, and breathe it. But of course, the intensity of how we want it is inversely proportional to the amount of work that we want to put in. So we "pray" to give us the courage to go on and be consistent with the repetitive work that must be done. When we pray, we do not necessarily send our prayers to a sentient "higher" being, prayer is just another way to calm and condition the mind where the real higher being resides- the real you.

I'm a Christian Freemason. Not that it matters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I run a somewhat popular facebook page. Bro. Chris whom I have not personally met before asked me if I can pledge and share the link. I visited his page and liked what I saw, however, I can't pledge because I am based in Canada, so I just did what I do best- graphics design. Again, the fan art was unsolicited and was never presented to him first for approval. I hope that makes sense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there. I'm not Chris and I don't think he is a redditor. The reason why the S C (now I feel obliged to mention the absence of the letter G) is attached is because this is an unsolicited FAN ART made by a Brother, yours truly, whose SOLE means of supporting his family is by making art and products with the S C. Everything that I do either have the S C or some other Masonic symbolism in it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what I've been trying to tell you is that things are not as black and white as you see it. 

I will have big problems with lawyers and accountants and contractors using the S C to promote their business- that I would call mercenary motive because by using the S C, they're advertising that they can be trusted by virtue of being a Mason which is very very wrong. But 4 pieces of bacon in the form of the S C (without the G if I may add) for a fellow artist Mason... I don't know... Maybe I got this whole Freemasonry thing wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm quite intimately familiar with all charges, thank you very much. The S C to me means a lot of things and one of that is kaizen and, ultimately, perfection. What we have here is a Brother who asked for my assistance promoting his LIVELIHOOD, I mean his expertise happened to be curing meat. He's been doing this since I was just 9 years old (1990), would it be fair to speculate that this is his passion (aka his craft)? 

As a graphics artist, I have rendered the S C in a lot of different ways as tribute to the working Mason such as [this one for Mason chefs](http://imgur.com/2o2wbq3), [this one for Mason broadcasters](http://imgur.com/geXi8cs), and [this one for the manual labourer](http://imgur.com/JOabd3w) and I heard no complaints at all. Now a Brother who makes bacon and I hear this?!

Mercenary motives? Please enlighten me. </TEXT>
