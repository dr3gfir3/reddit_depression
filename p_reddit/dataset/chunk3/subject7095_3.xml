	<TEXT> As far as im aware the imperial palace is locked most of the year, so aside from the emperors birthday and another date i cant remember, you cant actually get into the grounds. It could be worth seeing anyway, but something to consider. 

If its architecture you're after you should try get to kawagoe, its in saitama, bout an hour by the tobu-tojo line from tokyo, but really beautiful town, a whole section of it is almost exclusively traditional japanese architecture.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Japanese girls are normal girls. Some will like you, some wont. No mystery there, im afraid. 

Ive been here just under a year, i also produce music and am trying to break into the scenes through a few projects with japanese friends. My advice would be to use meet up or conversation exchange to meet people with similar interests, or an interest in speaking english, they are out there. 

Your aversion to mainstream definitely isnt helping, but thatd be the same anywhere really when you think about it. As others before me have said, those scenes are cliquey by nature. Breaking in is difficult, even more so with a language barrier. 

My advice is to try the meetup app, conversationexchange.com, or go to any Hub. You'll be fine, you just need to branch out a bit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exhausted. Its an emotionally draining game. In a good way. 

Emi, i got more invested in her than i ever expected to. I played the game mostly out of curiosity, but it hooked me. She felt like a real person, they all do, the writing is amazing in that regard, and by the end of her route it felt like i had been personally involved. And i guess in a way we all were, but few games ive ever played created that kind of agency or evoked that kind of attachment in me. 

And no shame about the tears. We all know that feel.  </TEXT>
