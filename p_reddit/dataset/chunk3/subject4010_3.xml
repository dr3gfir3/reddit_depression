	<TITLE> Ubisoft should stop shrinking the modern day storyline. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have seen allot of people complaining about the modern day storyline, and few have mentioned the fact that it is *essential* for the series. 

Let me start in the beginning. The games wasn't just successful for showing us a couple of white hooded gentlemen going around killing people for a greater cause. It wasn't just because of the lore that crafted its way throughout the next entries. It was because of it's unique consept that the game brought and showed us. That we (as in Desmond) had to go through the memories of our ancestors to find essential information to save the present day. All of this was growing theoughout the next games and was a reminder that the games wasn't about killing templars in the past, but that what we did in the past had consequenses for the present. We saw how Desmond trained, turned into an assassin, what happened to the ancient ones and the ones that came before. When he died the series just went downhill with the modern day era, with what made the games so special in the first place. Black Flag wasn't as good on that part but it was acceptable and a unique take on the modern day part, the sequels after that just ruined it more and more. Giving us cutscenes that barely mattered and just made us irritated. Unity barely had any modern day story and in the end, everything that happened in unity didn't have **any** importance to anything. It was just so they could have a game set in the french revolution. Syndicate did it slightly better but it was still horribly bad on that front compared to the first games. I can count the number of cutscenes on one hand from that game.

Look also on what the last games have been about, what the goal was. In BF there was the vault, being able to find anyone anywhere with a drop of their blood, never had anymore consequenses in the following games or never mentioned at all. Unity, finding that sage before the templars, which in the end was all a waste of time since the sages body was put in the catacombs.(There's also that 1st civ sword that did 't mean anything.) Syndicate, find the shroud. Now Syndicate did allot of things better than Unity but could still have been much, much better. We see Shaun getting a bit personal about Deamonds death, that Desmond got a 10 year old sage kid, that Juno is planning something and that the templars is going to do something with the shroud. (Revive an ancient civ perhaps, maybe revive Desmond(hopefully) or just make successful clones) Also pitching the idea of the modern protagonist being Desmond's son, in syndicate we learn he's in New York, he's a sage and he's 10. If the rumours are true then he could be 12 by the time the next game comes out. From the last cutscene in Syndicate a templar says they could take him in, keep him in an animus for 50+ years. Let's say they do get him, shaun and co get him out from abstergo, introduced to the character and viola, new protagonist from the 21st century. (Also remember that Desmond's son was [mentioned](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=yGAei3thVhM) waaaay back in brotherhood by subject 16.)

Now since we barely have any modern day era left in the games it wouldn't make sense for them to set up a villain like Juno as they have in the recent entries after Desmonds death. In Black Flag we learned that she transformed into the system, in Unity there was absutley nothing and in Syndicate we learned she was getting stronger, *preparing* herself for an upcoming battle. So let me say this to all of you haters and fans, do you really, *really*, want the games most anticipated villain get a horrible anti climatic ending in a 2 minute cutscene just so the games can be set in an exotic/historically important era? 

This is for Ubisoft directly if any one of them is actually following the subreddit. Don't shrink the part that made the games so great in the first place, don't kill the structure which the first games built up, the part that made it *it*. Go back to the roots and fix the problem the last games have been suffering from, the lack of a modern day stoyline and modern protagonist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One thing I thought S3 did good, setting up the venom character. Just setting him up, not the way they used him. Look at the way Brock is introduced, what happens to him. His storyarch in the movie would've been so much better if they stopped using him after he lost everything. Then continued the film with sandman like Raimi originally wanted. The venom characters story wouldn't have felt so rushed, and they could have used him in a sequel instead so that he could have gotten the screentime/character development he deserved.

Otherwise the movie had it's problems, the Peter/Harry story was awesome but could have been done better when it comes to harry going all #TeamSpidey since his butler says so. Also one of the best scenes in the movie is the creation of sandman, how he basically wills himself into existence again was beautiful. Other than the uncle-Bens-killer-was-actually-this-guy bullshit they pulled, the character was great. Studio interferrence is a bitch... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How about this. Let's say the rumors are true and they won't release a new game before the end of 2017. They would have a lot of time making the game and making it great, soundtrack wise, visually, story and gameplay, and the game will be set in ancient Egypt.

So going out from these facts how would they show the modern world story? Do a similar formula to what the first games did, bring in a new character, a new anchor to the series. AND have characters from before like Rebecca, Shaun and Desmond's dad show up to connect with both old and new players.

They could have a new guy that's been taken by Abstergo and was held in the same facility as Desmond was. The Assassin's need this new guy because his ancestors lived in ancient Egypt, finding some first civ tech that would be important to the modern storyline. They would also need a reason for doing all of this, same as the 2012 apocalypse when it comes to danger. Let's say the Templars side in with Juno or something(Not necessarily but keep her as the big baddy and Templars as the enemy of the assassins.) and the new protagonist and Co. would need his ancestors from ancient Egypt to stop Juno.

Now, since this game is set in Egypt we could see the next games continue with the character from that time go to different locations. Like Ezio did with Rome, Masyaf, Constantinople, etc. I also have to mention that since the pyramids is in Egypt I'm thinking that's probably some 1st civ tech, and that the pyramids around the world is also this. They all fit together on a global scale where we could see our ancient character go too, first Egypt, China, Russia, something new. Perhaps even the Garden of Eden that we see Adam and Eve escape from in that video from AC2. (Perhaps that's the place Juno is since she's the only one we see in the video, we do see some other "humans" but she's the only one of her kind in the video.) The pyramids could be the key to stop Juno from either taking over the world or destroying it. All this would be played out over a new trilogy.

Back to the new character, I think Ubisoft have a great opportunity to be just as good as they used to be. The mysteries about all the subjects they had was incredibly interesting and amazing. The beginning of the game could go like this. We start off in ancient Egypt where the the ancestor of the protagonist either experiences something dramatic or a short glimpse of first civ tech. Similar to the first game, they go to far in the memory cycle that they can't access it properly. The new character is shown being in an Abstergo animus with someone saying 'He can't take it much longer' and another person saying 'We'll stop when I say we stop'. Showing us a new Templar character that doesn't care about our well being, like [Warren Vidic](http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Warren_Vidic). Shortly after, the protagonist is being broken out of Abstergo by let's say Shaun, have William(Desmond's dad) being in the getaway vehicle while Rebecca is in their hideout. The protagonist is halfway awake from being messed with in the animus, so while William drives away Shaun is asking our new character for their name. They say it, then faints. (Let's say they didn't know his name from before but only knew his subject number, subject 18 if you want) The camera then goes further away. Showing the car drive away while the Abstergo building being in the middle of the screen, cue in Assassin's Creed title and we got our new and old characters with an awesome ancient storyline ready to go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hopefully if the rumors are true then the next game will come out in 2017, so more work will be done in making it and have it work better with the music, settings and storyline. I agree with you on the not just having a chase to find the next ancient tech. Perhaps do the same formula they did with the first games. Have a storyline that stretches over multiple games with a modern day story.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Totally agree, the modern day story was a crucial part of the AC games up until they decided to make *one-story-per-game* bullshit. But as you said, Desmond was the anchor and bringing in some new character to be that anchor would be hard if not impossible unless it was done perfectly good.

Personally I would like either Desmond's dad or Desmond himself. There has been a lot of theories that Desmond survived since he had the apple of Eden. Maybe have him be seen as a Jesus character that sacrificed himself for the world and then returns. + We'd get Nolan North back so that's that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's because the modern day story was the reason AC became popular, sure not the entire reason to it but a it had a big part in it. The games wasn't just about some stuff that happened in the past but what happened in the present. From AC 1 to AC 3 we see that the point of even going into the ancestors memories is to stop the apocalypse. But when they removed the modern day (not entirely removed but shrunk it down so it basically didn't even need to be there) the games lost the part that made it *it*. I never understood the hate for the modern day story, the concept was so new and special it made the games popular and successful. 

Now it's just a story about someone centuries ago stabbing someone while occasionally having a 1st civilization tech pop up now and then. The games need a story that goes over several games like they did with Ezio, and that **includes** the modern day story for it to work. Not just *one-story-per-game* bullshit they've been doing lately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Personally I hope they bring back the modern day stories, maybe use a new character and bring in recognizable characters like Shawn and Rebecca. Perhaps mention their time with Desmond. The fact that they don't even have a modern day assassin story anymore kinda takes away half of what the assassin's creed games started with, it just being about assassins in the past is just plain boring.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Logitech Warranty for headset </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-13 18:48:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I bought my G930 on the 17th of March 2014, so it should be inside the 2 year warranty still right? I'm Scandinavian(Norway) if that matters.

My headset started acting up about half a year ago, from then it's only gotten worse. Up until then I had no problems whatsoever and treated it good, so no damage done by me. What it does is that it randomly turns itself off, even if it's been charging for X amount of hours. Even when it's plugged in the wire it turns itself off for no reason, only then it turns itself on again after about a second or two. If it does this about 3-5 times in a row and I take out the recharging wire it turns itself off, so I gotta hold the switch to turn it on again. I could've lived with this before but now it's gotten much more frequent and irritating, not just for me. Every time it turns itself off and on people I talk with in a Skype call hears a loud DING noise each time it goes on and off. (I know this because they have said so and I've heard the same sound coming from a friend of mine with the exact same headset.)
Now there's another problem, the right ear is barely giving any sound. I can sometimes hold it in a special angle to get anything from it. So since I'm still inside the warranty I was hoping to get a replacement since it wasn't my own fault and a technical issue. Since I couldn't find a Live Chat (since I've dealt with the BS of emailing companies like these b4) I was hoping to get help from Reddit/Logitech here.


TL;DR My headset randomly turns on and off and right ear barely got any sound coming off it, hoping to get a replacement and help from Logitech.


EDIT: I bought the headset from the Logitech store, so no other store than their own was involved. :P </TEXT>

Since Valve's main focus atm is Dota2, CS:GO and TF2 I don't think we will see a Team Fortress 3 any time soon either. What I do think though is that their next game will be Left 4 Dead 3, after they have finished/released the Source 2 engine. I still have hopes for a HL3 game, don't get why so few people don't. I mean Source 2 has been in the works for a while now and it doesn't make sense that the next Half Life game would be on the current engine. Just give it time, I'd rather have a quality game rather than a rushed one. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had this on my mind for some time now and I think I've figured out how to make movies that are based of games and such, good.





The movies based of games and anime that have come out the last decade haven't been great(TLAB and that mortal combat movie), bad script, story telling, characters, etc. So I was thinking how could it be made into good movies? Look at what the upcoming Assasin's Creed movie is doing. They aren't basing it off any characters from the games or producing the same storylines, they're making completely new characters and story that is set IN the AC universe. Now I think this movie is going to be a hit and a good movie, tallented actors and is actually made by Ubisoft themself. So what I'm saying is that instead of making movies based of a game/anime, they should make movies set in the games/anime and tell a different story within those universes. Like the Avatar movie, I'm sure that if they made a movie set in the avatar universe and made completely new characters/storyline that is canon towards the series, it could work. 





TL;DR Make movies set in the games/anime universes with entirely new characters/storyline instead of basing the movies of characters we've already seen. </TEXT>
