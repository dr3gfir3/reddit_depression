	<TEXT> Regarding the potato salad....Traditionally its done without mayo.  Its seasoned with vinegar and oil. No mayo, no eggs :-) At least in the bavarian / austrian region.

And the best way to cook it is to use a lot of concentrated butter. It has to swim in it :-) And then just move the pan around a couple of times so the butter is spilling over it. This way you will end up getting a beautiful wavy coating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Recipe Source]( http://www.oneinspirationperday.com/recipes/the-perfect-original-wiener-schnitzel-done-15-minutes/)   Wiener Schnitzel is a traditional austrian and german dish that tastes absolutely wonderful. You should absolutely try it yourself. There are two well known variations. The Original Wiener Schnitzel which is made from veal. And the Schnitzel Wiener Art which is made from pork.

Tip: You can easily replace veal cutlets with boneless pork chops. It is also very tasty and a common dish in Germany and Austria. So try it out!
Try to use dried out french baguette for the bread crumbs. Its taste gets the closest to the german / austrian bread roles called Semmeln or Semmerl.

**In the Basket:**

* 1 1/2 pounds veal cutlets
* 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon minced parsley
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 teaspoon pepper
* 1 pinch ground nutmeg
* 2 tablespoons milk
* 1 cup dry bread crumbs
* 6 tablespoons butter
* 4 slices lemon

**How to make it:**

1. Place the veal cutlets between two pieces of plastic wrap, and pound with the flat side of a meat mallet until about 1/4 inch thick. If you dont have a meat mallet you can also use a heavy pot to flatten it. It is best to do this one cutlet at a time.
1. Dip the cutlet into flour to coat it. Do not press to heavy.
1. In a medium bowl, stir together the eggs, parsley, salt, pepper, nutmeg and milk.
1. Place bread crumbs on a plate. Make it from old baguette if you want. The bread they use in Germany or Austria is very special. Baguette gets closest to it.
1. Dip each cutlet into the egg mixture and slightly press in the bread crumbs to coat. Not to much as we want the coating to be fluffy and not sticking to the meat once its cooked.
1. Melt butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the breaded cutlets until each side is browned, about 3 minutes per side should be enough. While the meat is in the pan take a spoon and spill the hot butter over the it a couple of times.

Enjoy your original Wiener Schnitzel!
