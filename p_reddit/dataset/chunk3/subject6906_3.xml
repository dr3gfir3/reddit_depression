	<TEXT> Let's not be jive turkeys and complain about naming rights. No student is ever going to call the apartments by the new name. It's the "Yard."  A very short name is much easier to remember than a long one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone that I've been around acts like it's competitive. Plus, a lot of them tell me how RBS is kind of annoying because there are so many students with elitist type attitudes. 

Plus, RBS gets all special events and such, most of the students in other schools do not get receive the same opportunities. Right there is a sign that RBS is favored over all of the other schools. IF the classes are that bad, why would they be given special treatment? The reputation is sort of inflated, then. The proximity to NYC gives them a big boost, but if it wasn't for that....go figure. 

I'd say Math, Comp Sci, Bio, Chem, and Engineering...are the real tough ones.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A simple search of google would yield many PDF versions. The administration tells professors to push for the newest versions of all textbooks. I've had professors go against that. They've flat out told us to download last year's edition of the text in pdf. That's the real way to save money. All the information is the same...well, usually. Sometimes, the chapters are switched around or minimal content added. 

TL:DR The result is still the same.....an older version can be obtained for free online via a simple Google search. Webassign, Cengage, Pearson and all the other HW portals suck, too. They can go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't as I am not in the RBS. The way others talk about RBS makes it seem as if it's super difficult, but I guess some have to make themselves feel more important. lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Canning for THON is very dangerous. Someone was hit by a car a few years back. 

EDIT: This is not a trolling post. A friend of mine informed me that canning was eliminated due to someone being hit by a car. To raise 10 mil without canning is impressive (if what my friend said was true). Congrats. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Unfortunately, college campuses are breading grounds for deviants such as Nassar. The fact that this sick fuck was allowed to go undetected for so long is simply ridiculous. I'm sure girls complained to authoritative figures, and yet, nothing was done.

	<TEXT> You could, but when rules are set by people with no sense of reality...I wouldn't follow them. The deans and administrators simply think they are more important than they truly are. Very simple. There is no justifiable or practical reasoning for the rule. It's simply a "rule" because the admins and deans think it will make them look good if the students follow their orders. Trying to present an image and put on a horse and pony show is dishonest. 

Ex. A kid who always tried to be someone he couldn't be...and nobody  liked that kid because he/she was a poser.  </TEXT>
