The Healthy Eating Aerobic and Resistance Training in Youth (HEARTY) study, led by researchers at the University of Calgary and University of Ottawa, involved 304 overweight teens in the Ottawa/Gatineau area between the ages of 14 to 18. All were given the same four weeks of diet counseling to promote healthy eating and weight loss before being randomly placed into four groups. The first group performed resistance training involving weight machines and some free weights; the second performed only aerobic exercise on treadmills, elliptical machines and stationary bikes; the third underwent combined aerobic and resistance training; and the last group did no exercise training.

In the overall study population, each type of exercise reduced body fat significantly and similarly. All three exercise programs caused significantly more fat loss than in the diet-only control group. Among youths who completed at least 70 per cent of the study's exercise sessions, the **percentage of body fat decreased "significantly more in those who did combined aerobic and resistance exercise than in those who only did aerobic exercise,"** says co-principal researcher Dr. Glen Kenny of the University of Ottawa. "Remarkably, among participants who completed at least 70 per cent of the prescribed exercise sessions, waist circumference decreased close to seven centimeters in those randomized to combined aerobic plus resistance exercise, versus about four centimeters in those randomized to do just one type of exercise, with no change in those randomized to diet alone."

Researchers hope that the study will contribute to a national debate about childhood and teenage obesity, potentially leading to a consistent, long-term strategy on how to best deal with the problem. Eighty per cent of overweight youth typically continue to be obese as adults, adversely affecting the quality of their lives and contributing to chronic disease problems. Adult obesity increases risk of diabetes, heart disease, cancer and disability. </TEXT>

To clarify for everyone, this is a bit of an optical illusion. The lake is not that much higher than sea level, and this picture is taken from a high angle looking down at the cliff. The opposite side of the cliff slopes down to the lake. Here's another angle for comparison. http://ppcdn.500px.org/46339490/2b6c10f255a64480610cd0fee2a9281a646a584b/2048.jpg

Single dose of SSRI changes functional architecture of the human brain


This change in intrinsic connectivity occurs within a few hours of SSRI intake


SSRI intake reduces majority of intrinsic connectivity throughout the brain


In contrast, intrinsic connectivity increases in cerebellum and thalamus

	<TEXT> Good point; full access to Cell.com would likely answer all these. Until then, what I gather from other sources is that they used fMRI on patients under escitalopram:

Study participants let their minds wander for about 15 minutes in a brain scanner that measures the **oxygenation of blood flow in the brain**. The researchers characterized three-dimensional images of each individual's brain by measuring the number of connections between small blocks known as voxels (comparable to the pixels in an image) and the change in those connections with a single dose of escitalopram (trade name Lexapro).

Their whole-brain network analysis shows that one dose of the SSRI reduces the level of intrinsic connectivity in most parts of the brain. However, Sacher and her colleagues observed an increase in connectivity within two brain regions, specifically the cerebellum and thalamus.

LA Times goes even further:

They created 3-D maps of connections that matter to gray matter: interdependence, not just anatomical connection. They relied on a discovery in the late 1990s that **low-frequency brain signaling during relative inactivity, such as daydreaming, is a good indicator of functional connectivity**.

When more serotonin was available, this resting state functional connectivity decreased on a broad scale, the study found. This finding was not particularly surprising -- other studies have shown a similar effect in brain regions strongly associated with mood regulation.

But there was a two-fold shock: Some areas of the brain appeared to buck the trend and become more interdependent. And all the changes were evident only three hours after the single dosage.

It was interesting to see two patterns that seemed to go in the opposite direction, Sacher said. What was really surprising was that the entire brain would light up after only three hours. We didnt expect that.

Most people who use antidepressants don't report any discernible change in mood for at least two weeks, said Sacher, who also is a psychiatrist. 

The rapid connectivity shifts noted by the study might therefore be precursors to longer-term changes, perhaps starting with remodeling of synapses, the microscopic gaps where chemical neurotransmitters such as serotonin flood across to an adjacent brain cell, the study suggests. But this type of brain scanning cant pick up changes at such a scale, so the hypothesis will have to be tested other ways, Sacher added.

	<TEXT> to help determine exactly what changes occur during tDCS, and for specialized treatment

You'd need a fMRI for that, taken during the tDCS session; I don't think one can expect meaningful results from an EEG taken during tDCS. 

These days I see there are more and more studies and clinical trials involving tDCS   fMRI, and they may need volunteers, see if you find one in your area, maybe?

Also, keep us updated? Good luck, OP! </TEXT>
