	<TEXT> Yes! It's interesting how people interpret it differently though... I guess the Sacrifice Chloe ending kind of made people associate it with sadness, but to me it's more about moving on and not letting the suffering get to you, because it's only going to be here for a limited time :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would never sell it... it really is priceless D: I don't know why anyone would, but perhaps financial reasons... It think that person is really lucky as well well...

True though, I feel like they really wanted to release it as a merchandise, but I heard it had something to do with the copyrights in music? It's unfortunate though, I think it would've helped the company greatly, since music is one of the selling points to the game ^__^ </TEXT>
