	<TEXT> Jaime had some good lines in ASOS:
"The world was simpler in those days, Jaime thought, and men as well as swords were made of finer steel. Or was it only that he had been fifteen? They were all in their graves now, the Sword of the Morning and the Smiling Knight, the White Bull and Prince Lewyn, Ser Oswell Whent with his black humor, earnest Jon Darry, Simon Toyne and his Kingswood Brotherhood, bluff old Sumner Crakehall. And me, that boy I was  when did he die, I wonder? When I donned the white cloak? When I opened Aeryss throat? That boy had wanted to be Ser Arthur Dayne, but someplace along the way he had become the Smiling Knight instead."

	<TEXT> My favorite book out of the five currently released is ADWD. I agree that some parts were boring. But it contained some interesting stuff (Bran's POV chapters were my favorite parts of the book) AFFC was somewhat dragged out and uninteresting because we only got to see POVs of a limited number of characters. But Martin gave a lot of in detailed insight into the minds of some characters( Jaime and Cersei) I thought that was very well done.
But I'm hyped for TWOW and ADOS nevertheless. I'm sure they'll be interesting due to the fact that we'll get to finally see how the story plays out in Essos with Dany and Euron and then ultimately in Westeros with Ice and Fire. </TEXT>
