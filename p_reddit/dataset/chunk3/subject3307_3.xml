	<TEXT> First of all, you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by having him evaluated by early intervention services. If anything, it will give you peace of mind.

When my son had his 18 month check-up, his Dr. asked if he was saying any words, making sounds, etc. He had NO vocabulary whatsoever, not mama, dada, etc. He did babble occasionally, but it was incoherent and at that age that's not considered normal. His Dr. shrugged it off and sent us on our way. However, a week later she called me and told me she had been thinking about it and she wanted him to be evaluated. He began speech therapy 1 hr/week at 23 months. The first session the therapist worked with him to get him to say "pop" while playing with bubbles.

He will be 7 in March and is still in speech therapy at school. He speaks normally for the most part, but he still has difficulty translating his thoughts into words, i.e. he knows what he wants to say, but can't quite figure out how to get it out.

This may or may not have something to do with his father leaving. I'm pretty sure the assistance you find will be able to provide a more definitive answer for you, although, I think it may be difficult to determine any cause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also a former patient of a mental health care facility, both private and public. The caregivers in the public hospital were definitely not as nice as the private hospital. I was very lucky to be in such a caring place (the private facility), and taken care of so well. It breaks my heart that other mental health patients have to go through such hell. I've considered becoming a mental health nurse or PT, but I'm not sure it's my calling. I do think I would be good at it having been a patient myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I've thought about having cancer and refusing treatment. But at the same time, once death is pretty much on the table, maybe I will feel differently. I think about that, too. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cancer... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I had a second colposcopy almost two weeks ago. They had found level 2 pre-cancerous cervical cells on the first biopsy.

Is it crazy that in a way I wish it would come back as cancer? I've always somewhat fantasized about having cancer because that wouldn't give me a choice as to whether I lived or died. It just seems so much easier since I'm actually a coward and too afraid to end it myself.

I was doing so, so great up until the past week or so. I'm determined to dig myself out of this rut before it turns into a full-blown relapse.

Thanks for listening. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought I was the only mom with a strange fascination for morbid images, gore, etc. For me, the content of this sub and some of the others already mentioned are a source of interest to me. It really doesn't keep me up at night or traumatize me. Although some content is definitely cringe worthy. 

It is also my dirty little secret, and honestly I'm slightly ashamed of it. I tried to show my mother a few things I thought were especially interesting and she was horrified,said it was sick and asked me why I look at this stuff. I guess to each his own...  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love, love, LOVE your hair!! I don't have the courage to bleach my hair then dye it. Plus, my hair is super curly and takes FOREVER to grow so I don't think it'd work out for me so well. But you rock it girl!!

And your eyebrows match PERFECTLY! They look a lot better purple than your natural color. It just brings the whole look together. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been seriously contemplating this. I'm 30 and have yet to finish college. Actuarial science has really interested me since I learned of it. I'm slightly unsure though, since I'm not as good at math as I'd like to be. Although I've always gotten A's in my math classes so it's probably just me being a perfectionist. </TEXT>
