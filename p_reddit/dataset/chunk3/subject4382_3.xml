	<TEXT> On several occasions when I've replied directly from the notification alert box and "flipped" the iMessage card to go to another app, when I return to iMessage, my composed draft has disappeared. Does anyone else have this problem? This has also happened to me on email. I drafted a long response to an email via notification alert window. I switched to another app in the midst of composing and when I returned to the composition, the long draft was gone. 

If this has been addressed already, apologies. Please point me in the right direction.  </TEXT>
