To find out more about the GCCs complicated relationship with foreigners, and whether of these countries involvement in the refugee crisis is warranted, we talked to Michael Humphrey, a Humanities and Sociology professor from the University of Sydney.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When the Assad Regime first deployed chemical weapons (CW) in Damascus on August 21, 2013, President Barack Obama called the international communitys credibility in question if they did not act in defense of the international norm. Despite this and becoming a member of the Chemical Weapons Convention two months after the first attack, the use of chemical weapons in Syria has continued. The latest attack happened on September 6th.

 We spoke to Richard Price, University of British Columbia about the chemical weapons taboo. Price is a leading expert on international norms and has written about the subject in The Chemical Weapons Taboo and for Foreign Affairs. </TEXT>
