	<TEXT> I just bought this game. I am only a short hour in, but so far, this is the *only* "retro" game I have played that actually fully captures the feel and essence of the 16 bit era. 

I hadnt heard of it, and I hadnt even seen this post yet. I just saw it on Steam and took a chance. Was going to come post here about it when I saw this.

Fucking awesome job. I am so impressed.  </TEXT>
