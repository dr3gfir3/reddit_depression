Like all other gym leaders, he foolishly chose to use only one type of Pokemon, which means all you have to do to defeat him is train a single Pokemon that is strong against that type to a decently high level and you can KO all of his Pokemon with 1 shot each. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You created your own copypasta and gave me that instead of bothering to read my comment, that's cute.

The Franken question wasn't even about Sessions specifically - it was about "anyone affiliated with the Trump campaign" and what Sessions would do if it was discovered that any of them had communicated with the Russians *during the course* of the campaign - not *about* the campaign, an important distinction. Sessions chose to make it about himself, (even going so far as to mention that he has been called a Trump surrogate!)when he didn't even have to - and said he did not have any communications with the Russians, full stop.

You can try to spin this however you'd like - and just keep telling yourself, "the leaks might be real, but the news is fake!" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Officials from the Justice Department. Any thoughts on why they choose to remain nameless? Perhaps because it would have catastrophic consequences for them if their identities were revealed. You also realize, I would hope, that these officials are not nameless to the reporter - the reporters keep them nameless in print as a condition on the part of the leaker. 

You'll notice from the reaction to this from congresspeople on both the left and the right sides of the aisle that this report has major traction. I am very curious to see what the fallout is - I expect it will be something similar to Flynn, where it becomes a big enough story that Sessions has to go. But if it makes you feel better over the next few days, just listen to daddy when he tells you "the leaks are real, the news is fake". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I appreciate all the mods do to make this a great community and an excellent resource for motivation and recommendations. I think an automod post for the weekly thread would be completely fine, since it's a routine post that doesn't really change week to week. I understand wanting a personal touch, but don't think the weekly thread needs it - so since it would make life easier for the mods *and* more consistent for community, my vote is on automod for the weekly book thread! For a personal touch, whoever is responsible for monitoring the automod could add in their book ahead of time to customize the post each week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ANYONE who actually THOUGHT about it knew! It's a complicated issue, duh! There is a reason the ACA was a massive bill - because you can't do healthcare legislation in a piecemeal way and expect insurance providers to get on board with it. For insurance providers, the stuff they like (individual mandates, for example) and the stuff they don't like  (required coverage of pre-existing conditions) has to be packaged into the same bill. They will not sign onto piecemeal legislation that has the "bad stuff" only, with the expectation that the "good stuff" will come down the road. Alternately, they will only get on board with legislation that benefits them, if done in a piecemeal way, and will not get on-board with anything that doesn't. It's a complicated issue and there is not a simple solution (other than single-payer of course...). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This film is offered as one of the free films you can watch on United flights, so I gave it a shot while flying last week. Even on a plane, without much else to do, I could only make it 30 minutes in. 10 minutes after the character intros ended I just had to bail. Everything about it was just unpleasant - the tone, the characters, the pacing, the exposition dump, the lighting, all of it. I had the same experience with BvS - got to the "court room piss" scene and just had had enough at that point. 

e: sidenote about that flight, for the first time in my life I witnessed someone purchasing one of those "snack boxes" that they sell for like 8 bucks. Never seen someone actually pull the trigger on those before. And this was like a 2 hour flight, not a long haul. Took me aback to say the least. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would say you have to get to know someone before you can decide if they're a good guy - which is obviously an inherently subjective idea. I have met people who have broken the law who I would describe as good people (I'll bet you have too) - and people who are, as far as I know, law-abiding but are complete assholes. It is not possible to determine whether or not someone's a good person just by whether or not they own a gun. If you know someone has a gun, that is all you know about them. All other characteristics have to be determined from that point onward. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, I will look into it. I would argue that even if crime rates are low in areas where people own guns, it does nothing to further the idea that gun owners are "good guys" rather than just guys. Following the law is pretty much a bare minimum standard - it means you are a normal person operating within the bounds of the law. Your reasons for doing that can be wide and varied - maybe people aren't breaking the law in these areas for fear of getting shot. That doesn't mean those are more likely to be good poeple people than those in areas with low gun-ownership rates - it means the consequences of breaking the law are higher in areas with high gun ownership rates.

Whether or not someone can be called a "good guy" is, again, not related to whether or not they own a gun. Those are two entirely separate things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This week I finished off **Authority** by Jeff Vandermeer. I LOVED the first book, Annihilation. This was a major change of pace, and in my view, a step down. It was very cool that the author was willing to depart so much from what made the first book as compelling as it was - but there just wasn't enough in this book. I feel that it would have worked very well as a short story or novella. But at novel length, there was just too much deliberation and padding. There is one AMAZINGLY creepy scene that made the book worthwhile for me, but I just wish there could have been more of that and less directionless wandering. I don't need all my questions answered - far from it - but too much of this book went nowhere for me to be satisfied coming away from it. The "big event" just sort of... happens, all of a sudden, in a very vague way. Overall I did not enjoy it. I might eventually read the third book but I'm not going to jump into it, that's for sure.

I am now reading **The Handmaid's Tale** for the first time. I'm 20% in an absolutely loving it so far. Really scary stuff.

Sidenote, I'm watching The Handmaiden now, a 2016 film directed by the Korean filmmaker of the original Oldboy. Amazing film so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nope, but he's declared himself "at war" with the media, so it's hard to say how far that's going to go. He *can't* "replace" members of congress so that's a pointless addition to your comment. He claimed with no evidence that 3 million people voted illegally because he lost the popular vote (the scary part of that is that he seems to be refusing to accept the results of an election he WON - how do you think he'll react to an election he loses, if that happens in 2020?).

There are gradients to authoritarianism and tyranny, it's not binary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh, to me that hearkens back the idea that rural voters in the states that swung for Trump have votes that "count" more than those in more populated areas. The percentage each vote counts for in rural districts (which largely went for Trump) is much higher than in more densely populated districts with big cities. Fewer voters means each vote has a higher percentage value in determining the outcome of that state.

i.e.: 5 people vote in district A: each vote is worth 20%

20 people vote in district B: each vote is worth 5%

Cities went for Clinton (and usually go D) - rural districts went Trump (and usually go R). So rural (Trump) voters do in fact have votes that "count" more - i.e. a disproportionate voice. </TEXT>

And while we're talking about comments that misrepresent the situation, you summarized the content of the emails in a disingenuous way, so that's what I responded to. People trying to downplay this are doing active damage to our party's ability to unite, as they are dismissing the entirely valid concerns of a sizable portion of the party who would prefer that its organizing committee *actually* be unbiased instead of lying to us about it. In order to heal you have to diagnose, and anyone refusing to do so is doing a disservice to the cause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whether or not they did this one specific thing is not entirely relevant, because what the emails revealed is that the DNC was very clearly, bluntly biased against Sanders. We have emails revealing that intent - we DON'T have recordings of phone calls they made. We DON'T have transcripts of conversations they had in person. So we have a small footprint of the conversations they had, but what that footprint reveals is an intent to undermine one of the candidates. That is incredibly significant and should not be casually dismissed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a bit disingenuous. They talked about 
*getting someone to ask* about his religious affiliation because they knew it would probably have an impact on how he was received in a couple of states:

 It might make no difference, but for KY (Kentucky) and WVA (West Virginia) can we get someone to ask his belief. Does he believe in a God. He had skated on saying he has a Jewish heritage. I think I read he is an atheist. This could make several points difference with my peeps. My Southern Baptist peeps would draw a big difference between a Jew and an atheist.

They didn't just casually ask what his affiliation was. They wanted him to be asked publicly (on a debate stage) because they thought it would impact his reception in Kentucky and West Virginia. People should not be pretending that the DNC didn't do what it could to undermine support for Bernie Sanders.

	<TEXT> You only have to look to the comments section and see what the audience of Brietbart articles has to say to find why it's an extremist site. The content on that site is written to inflame a very particular group of people. Here were the first two comments from their article on Leslie Jones when I opened it just now (top headline at the moment):

 I rather have harambe than this ugly tranny

and

 That is one fugly n***r woman.

Would you say that Breitbart just "accidentally" has an audience that posts shit like that? Remember that Breitbart is not a content aggregation site like reddit, where users post links to articles - Breitbart has a staff of writers who create this content. And it *just so happens* that the comments section of every article is filled with hateful, horrible shit. It's no accident. This content is created to pander to this audience. 

Reloaded the comments and these are the newest:

 This is why people go to the zoo. Nature is amazing.

and

 We got a gorilla onstage.

It's a never-ending stream of hatred, racism, bigotry, etc from their audience. It's not an accident - this is their platform. The articles don't have to say these things explicitly but they know exactly who they're talking to when they write them. It is an extremist site.


Edit:


Another fresh one:

 Light that afrosheen on fire , and watch run around like Richard Prior...lol
That would be funny...

Just reload and enjoy, it's never-ending. Somehow the NYT, Washington Post, etc manages NOT to have comments sections filled with this... wonder why? Perhaps because they aren't extremist sites.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am somewhat concerned about the constant "he should be impeached, but the cowardly senate will do nothing about it" or "the spineless republicans will never hold hearings on this issue" refrains that I see on every single one of these articles. It conflates all these issues as if they hold the same weight and have the same importance. Some of these things are HUGE deals. Every single one isn't. Some of them may or may not be. But just relying on the idea that "the weak republicans won't dare to investigate this" line makes it impossible for the average observer to discern which of these things actually IS worth investigating and creates parity between all these offenses, some of which are not abnormal - they just went unobserved before. It also creates an incredibly monotonous, oddly normalizing ecosystem for these stories. There is nothing to be gained from comments sections on these articles because they ALL say "wow, if only the republicans had the guys to investigate this. But they don't!" EVERY SINGLE ARTICLE has this same string of comments, most often multiple times. </TEXT>
