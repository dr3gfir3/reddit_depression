That sounds like justification to me. And it was ICE policy under Bush and Obama not to target non-criminal immigrants, because theoretically the agency has more important things to do than go after peaceful people and their own political vendettas. More than half of the people targeted by ICE in Austin were residents with no criminal history. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In a back-and-forth between ICE agent Laron Bryant, Judge Andrew Austin said he and another federal magistrate were briefed by ICE in late January about the upcoming raids. They were told that **the agency would be conducting operations in the Austin area as a result of the sheriffs new policy and because a meeting between ICE and [Sheriff] Hernandez in January didnt go very well,** according to an audio transcript obtained by the Observer. 

ICE didn't carry out these raids because they served any practical purpose. They had a political grudge against a local government and used that to decide how to "enforce" the law.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Is it advisable for one who is not an expert on economic and social issues to express views on the subject of socialism? I believe for a number of reasons that it is.

It might appear that there are no essential methodological differences between astronomy and economics: scientists in both fields attempt to discover laws of general acceptability for a circumscribed group of phenomena in order to make the interconnection of these phenomena as clearly understandable as possible. But in reality such methodological differences do exist. 

 The discovery of general laws in the field of economics is made difficult by the circumstance that observed economic phenomena are often affected by many factors which are very hard to evaluate separately. In addition, the experience which has accumulated since the beginning of the so-called civilized period of human history hasas is well knownbeen largely influenced and limited by causes which are by no means exclusively economic in nature. For example, most of the major states of history owed their existence to conquest. The conquering peoples established themselves, legally and economically, as the privileged class of the conquered country.

 But historic tradition is, so to speak, of yesterday; nowhere have we really overcome what Thorstein Veblen called the predatory phase of human development. The observable economic facts belong to that phase and even such laws as we can derive from them are not applicable to other phases. Since the real purpose of socialism is precisely to overcome and advance beyond the predatory phase of human development, economic science in its present state can throw little light on the socialist society of the future.

 This world in arms is not spending money alone.

 It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children.

 The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities.

 It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population.

 It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals.

 It is some 50 miles of concrete highway.

 We pay for a single fighter with a half million bushels of wheat.

 We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.

 This, I repeat, is the best way of life to be found on the road the world has been taking.

 This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.

I'm pretty sure the reasoning of these statements stand well enough on their own. Speeches can and usually do make several points, as any decent argument would. It's not just one continuous stream of thought to be bought whole or not at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**"The Struggle in the Fields"** (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KIHCdjpFPrw) is an episode from the PBS documentary series *Chicano!* that covers the rise of the United Farm Workers, led by Cesar Chavez.

[**"The Fight in the Fields"** (1996)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgMkX4eE3bs t=8s) is an independently-produced documentary about pretty much the same thing.

The UFW was formed as a merger between Mexican and Filipino workers after Filipino farm workers organzed under the AFL-CIO affiliated Agricultural Workers Organizing Committee (AWOC) went on a wildcat strike against grape growers in Delano, California demanding wages equal to the federal minimum.

They were then joined by Cesar Chavez's predominantly Mexican-American National Farm Workers Association, who issued this statement six weeks into the strike:

 **WE SHALL OVERCOME**

 **September 16th, 1965**



 In a 400 square mile area halfway between Selma and Weedpatch, California, a general strike of farm workers has been going on for six weeks. The Filipinos, under AWOC AFL-CIO began the strike for a $1.40 per hour guarantee and a union contract. They were joined by the independent Farm Workers Association which as a membership of several thousand Mexican-Americans. 

 Filipino, Mexican-American and Puerto Rican workers have been manning picket lines daily for 41 days in a totally non-violent manner. Ranchers in the area, which include DiGiorgio Fruit, Schenley, and many independent growers, did not take the strike seriously at first. By the second or third week, however, they began taking another look  and striking back. Mechanized agriculture began picketing the pickets  spraying them with sulfur, running tractors by them to create dust storms, building barricades of farm machinery so that scabs could not see the pickets. These actions not only increased the determination of the strikers, but convinced some of the scabs that the ranchers were, in fact, less than human. Scabs quit work and the strike grew. 

 The growers hired security guards for $43 a day. They began driving their Thunderbirds, equipped with police dogs and rifles, up and down the roads. The people made more picket signs, drew in their belts, and kept marching. 

 Production was down 30% and the growers began looking for more and more scabs. They went to Fresno and Bakersfield and Los Angeles to find them. They didn't tell the workers that they would be scab crews. The pickets followed them into every town and formed ad hoc strike committees to prevent scabbing. They succeeded in these towns. Within two weeks, only one bus, with half a dozen winos, escorted by a pearl gray Cadillac, drove into the strike zone. A new plan was formed. The ranchers would advertise in South Texas and old Mexico. They bring these workers in buses and the workers are held in debt to the rancher before they even arrive in town. We have a new and more difficult task ahead of us with these scabs. 

 As our strike has grown, workers have matured and now know why and how to fight for their rights. As the strike has grown into a movement for justice by the lowest paid workers in America, friends of farm workers have begun to rally in support of 'LA CAUSA'. Civil rights, church, student and union groups help with food and money. 

 We believe that this is the beginning of a significant drive to achieve equal rights for agricultural workers. In order to enlist your full support and to explain our work to you, I would like to bring some of our pickets and meet with you. 



 *VIVA LA CAUSA Y*

 *VIVA LA HUELGA* 



 Cesar Estrada Chavez

 General Director,

 National Farm Workers Association
