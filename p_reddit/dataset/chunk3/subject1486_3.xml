	<TEXT> My parents never taught me how to ride a bike, so... When I was 18 and in Japan, I borrowed someone's bike and taught myself after months of failure and embarrassment kn the public park. When I was finally able to, I rode out in the countryside and it was so exhilarating. I had no idea that such a simple thing would feel so good!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This thread is like food porn.

I love macaroons, and anything that's vanilla flavoured.

Needless to say that vanilla bean macaroons are pretty fucking orgasmic, I legit got turned on whilst eating my first one. </TEXT>
