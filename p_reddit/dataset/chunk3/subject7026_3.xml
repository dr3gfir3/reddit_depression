	<TEXT> I've only read a few of his short stories so far. The mark of the beast and the phantom rickshaw. I really enjoyed both stories. He is definitely a great storyteller. As for the racism thing another user brought up, if you want to read anything written in the 19th century by a white guy, guess what, it's probably going to be a bit racist.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks! Another random question. Would putting one of my own stories into the anthology be in bad taste? Or is this something that is common?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you probably have a point with the Amazon thing. It shouldn't be too hard to figure out how to pay authors with PayPal.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Self publishing a multiple author anthology question. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-28 01:05:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I want to self publish a multiple author short story anthology in the horror genre. Does anyone have any experience with this? I know where to post a call for submissions and all that, but then what? I plan to pay authors a flat amount upon acceptance maybe with Amazon gift cards. I feel that would probably be the easiest.. Also, I plan to use Amazon and create space to publish. I'm an absolute beginner with this so any suggestions would be great. Can I just make up a name like so and so press or whatever? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Try some Algernon Blackwood. His stories are creepy and many of them are set in nature. Try "the willows"

	<TEXT> Same here! I looked it it up a while back and it's a fairly common thing to dream apparently. But it really freaks me out. Thank goodness it's been a few years since I've had any of those super vivid teeth crumbling dreams but it used to happen all the time.. Not sure why they stopped..  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is half of the store overpriced toys like B N? I really can't see how the Amazon bookstore could be worse than a B N... Looks pretty cool in the pictures. I swear every time I go into my B N they have removed another section of books to fit in some stupid bullshit that isn't books.  </TEXT>

He wrote mostly short stories. Here is every story he wrote for free. Read a story and then listen to the corresponding podcast. They pretty much do an episode for every story. The guys are really funny too! </TEXT>
