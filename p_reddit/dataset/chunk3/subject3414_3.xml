But it wakes us up and makes us realise what is important and what is not, who are your true friend and who isnt. So many things come of the 'real world', that sometimes, you just have to take a step back and let it sink in..  </TEXT>

It seems as if you are ~~an idiot~~ only young, and have none or little experience with a girl. 
Dude, you got to man the fuck up. You need to pull her aside during a lunch time and tell her straight to her face, what the situation is. 
Just explain to her something along the lines of: Hey (whatever her name is), I need to tell you something, whilst I think you are a really nice girl and all, I have to admit, this has gone further than I anticipated. By giving you my number, I just thought we were going to be friends and nothing more. Whilst your feelings for me have developed, mine for you have not. I think you are an amazing girl, who is so nice, and genuine, but I cannot go out with you, as I dont want to lead you on any more than I have" 
I am a girl, and if I was in this situation, i'd want nothing more than honesty. Do that right thing, and she will ~~still hate you~~ understand.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My ex and I did a long distance relationship. 
We would watch youtube videos together and make sure we started them at the same time. 
We would play counterstrike together and go on a team so it felt like we were at a lan kinda thing.
Sometimes we would just do our on thing when we were on skype as if we were at one another house, like he was sitting there playing his xbox whilst I was reading a book, no words were said, but we could see what ever other was doing and whatever, it felt so good.
Unfortunately he found it difficult to handle to having that physical relationship of being able to have ~~sex~~ cuddle, kiss, and just play fight around. 

What I would have loved was to have random surprises, like by sending little things, even if its a piece of paper with "I love you" written on it. Because you live so far apart, she will love it so much because it was the thought and effort you put in it to make her smile.
When you do meet up and spend time together at either house, leave a thousand little notes tucked around her house for her to randomly find once she is gone, it will give her the biggest smile ever!! 

I wish you luck with the long distance, I hope everything works out for you and your girlfriend.  </TEXT>

I live by this quote and read it about 3 times a day (I have stuck it to a wall in my office)
" Your time is limited, dont waste it living someone else's life.
Dont be trapped by dogma, which is living the result of other peoples thinking.
Dont let the noise of others opinion drown your own inner voice.
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition, they somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."

	<TEXT> Ahaha dont be sorry at all.
We've all done stupid reddit posts. 

And i'll be honest, i'd judged you when I was reading it, thinking yeah this guy is a massive snob who has too much money. 
But you dont seem like that at all, so i'm sorry for judging. 

Living in the country is amazing, whilst you can miss out on somethings, I feel its better, when you go on holidays everything seems so amazing compared to where you live. For me going on holidays to Melbourne is like oh my god! SO big, but for others its not.

If you ever need someone to chat to, you can count on a response from me :) </TEXT>
