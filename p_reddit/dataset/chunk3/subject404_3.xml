	<TEXT> See if you can talk to a realtor in the areas you're looking to move to. You don't wanna move anywhere with low job opportunities and only have $45000 with no job. I'd also see if you can have a job set up before you make the transition. If you play your cards right I think you'd have enough. A realtor can also help you figure out cost of moving/living  </TEXT>
