	<TEXT> I think it's important to keep on emphasizing the fact that Trumpism ***is not*** traditional conservatism. Trumpism is a form of ***right populism*** .

I don't think my friends on the right-of-center would disagree when well-meaning leftists make the mistake of calling Trumpsim conservative. 

The above article is yet one more attempt to correct this faulty assumption. 

A phenomena that makes this clearer is something that is happening on the most extreme Left: Many well-meaning friends on the purist Left reflexively conflate "populism" with "progressivism" - and this, while appearing to be an innocent mistake, can be ***very, very dangerous***.

At the end of the day, left populism [shares many](https://ideas.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/liberals-vs-populists-its-a-long-story/) of the [same fundamental assumptions](http://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=30088) behind right populism, and Trumpism represents these [common assumptions](http://www.breitbart.com/2016-presidential-race/2016/06/17/populism-replacing-conservatism-winning/) - namely, ethnicist and other identitarian assumptions couched in paranoia (this is why the alt-right employs traditionally leftist-populist language, and Europe's new socialist politicians employ anti-immigrant messaging). Bernie Sanders [himself gave air to these implicit identitarian assumptions in his critique of  open borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0). So this is a problem for both Conservatives and Republicans ***and*** Liberals and Progressives and Democrats to fix.

We need a transpartisan coalition that stands up ***against*** the breakdown of our traditional liberal order (I don't mean "liberal" in the sense that the GOP uses as boogeymen). The reality is, today's brand of populism is a unique threat to any bipartisan and transpartisan consensus, for the very reason that it is left populism and right populism that ***rejects*** the idea of bipartisanship and transpartisanship, and ***rejects*** what movements like NeverTrump stands for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the record, I wasn't asking for thought control. 

I was just getting frustrated that Turless seemed to ignore that the blog I linked to clearly wasn't meant as an attack on Trump.

What frustrates me is that any critique of *any* right-of-center or conservative position [i.e., Islamophobia] from a left-of-center position is deemed not credible or invalid - even though a very similar critique is held by other conservatives and others on the right. Whether aware of Islamophobia's critics on the conservative right or not, Turless's initial comment seemed to imply that since the link was to a left-of-center perspective (even if it had nothing to do with attacking Trump) and that I myself am left-of-center on many issues, it does not matter that my intention behind posting this article (praise the appointment decision b/c of McMaster's ant-Islamophobia stance) is shared by many conservatives.

That left me to believe that the fact that the critique of Islamophobia came from a left-of-enter perspective invalidated the whole thing in Turless's perspective, which thus means that his main beef with the post is the identity of the poster (me) and the identity of the blogger ('people like me'). 

He himself wrote that this sub is only meant for right-of-center NeverTrumpers in one of his follow-up comments. So regardless of him trying to say that he separates identity from politics, it sure did seem like he didn't like the identity of those positing the political critique, and attacked the critique based on that identity. 

If I remember correctly, that is not the idea behind this sub. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For me, I do attribute many if not most of my political persuasions to a large part of my identity - and I do not believe [or at the very least do not understand] - how anyone else ***does not*** have political persuasions strong enough to form at least part of their identities. 

I know you might not care, but I'll offer this as an example: I am an American Jew with grandparents who survived the Holocaust. Their children - my father and uncle - were bullied, harassed, and assaulted almost every single day walking back and forth from school up through high school. Being recent immigrants from Israel, they were targeted based on their immigrant identities. Some of those beatings would have killed them if police had not intervened. And the guys who did these things were thoughtless idiots who would call what they did as "harmless trolling" - because they were taught by subversive "pop" or "alternative" figures that that was "funny," and that "triggering" them will "toughen them" up.

Being vicitimized by Hitler's political project starting at a very early age, my grandmother was emotionally and psychologically stunted from a very young age, and she remained so until her death a few years ago.

As a consequence of her inability to relate to other humans in an emotionally-mature way, or to relate to the world in a psychologically-healthy way, my father and his brother's lives were infested by the shell of a human being Hitler gave them. Whenever I asked why my grandmother called them 24/7, shouted at them, spoke about fake neo-Nazi conspiracies of her neighbors experimenting on her through the walls, etc., my father did his best to explain to me that she was a broken, damaged woman. I then asked my father and my uncle if they believed that their mother loved them, to which they said no. Being young, I was confused, and they tried to explain to me that when someone is broken like that at a young age, they are unable to grow or develop properly - including emotionally and psychologically. 

My father and his brother were very important, very formative figures in my life, and I unfortunately lost both at a young age. 

I am not trying to tell you a sob story to get you to sympathize with me or whatever. I just want you to know how someone's identity can both ***be*** politicized (by seeing how a mother can mistreat her own sons she could never love, all because she didn't have time to grow into a full human being), and ***political*** (by choosing to turn my own feelings of confusion, frustration, and nostalgia for a family I could never have into a desire to ensure that others can have what I did not).

My personal opposition to President Trump is that he seems to inspire a very similar culture of xenophobia, nativism, and ethno-nationalism that my own family barely survived. And whether he meant to or not, he certainly does not seem to feel the need to temper it. As I [wrote in another comment in this sub before](https://www.reddit.com/r/NeverTrump/comments/5vq4n4/young_white_men_are_being_radicalised_its_time_to/de6bpwy/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=user utm_source=reddit utm_name=frontpage), "trolling" might start out as fun or innocent enough, but my own history and childhood teaches me that what "trolling" unleashes can frequently be ***very*** difficult to put back in the bottle, and have very severe, unintended consequences - consequences that can survive generations. 

Beyond this, I personally believe it is ludicrous for someone to see themselves or their identity as something that is ***beyond*** politics. All of us - being members of communities, neighborhoods, countries, families, etc. - have either been impacted, shaped, or participated [whether willingly or not] in some form of political project not necessarily thought of by themselves. For me, ***the personal is the political***, and I mean no offense by this, but I think it'd be deeply disingenuous of you to suggest none of your political views were previously formed on a level as deeply entwined as your identity or who you choose to be. 

In a sense and possibly to his strategic and/or tactical credit, President Trump has identified this as a way to pull the country further into his camp: he identified "the establishment" as his enemy and the enemy of "the people" (language that personally disturbs me given my family history), which ***does*** have transpartisan appeal (President Trump himself praised Bernie Sanders for 'getting it right' this way, one reason why I refused to support Sanders). 

I don't like the politics that is one premised on having enemies. To me, that is a politics of reaction - a politics of ***resentment***. 

President Trump himself might not have wanted this, but he both inspired and ***inflamed*** a particular type of identity politics that cannot function without demonizing "multiculturalism" or others he deems as un-American. Many of his supporters support him ***because*** they pride their identities over others'. ***That*** is the right's version of ***"identity politics"***. 

On the extreme left - the left that Sanders identified with - the essential premise of that political argument is that all issues of racial equality, gender equality, etc., are solely and exclusively derivative of an economic nationalism. Sanders' - and Sander's himself - might not have realized, but that is where they are more closely aligned with Trump's most extreme supporters. His economic populism and the economic nativism President Trump campaigned on are ***very, very*** similar things. The reason why is that both of these strands of thought ultimately come down to identity: ***Who was here first***, ***What was an acceptable community before***, and etc., etc., which is why self-described progressive Millennials nowadays who don't know history [do not understand Sanders' own opposition to open borders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf-k6qOfXz0), but what their older progressive cohort understood and sometimes even admired. 

As a an American Jew who is very familiar with Jewish-American history, this allows me to understand what my well-meaning friends on the Left could not: moderates and centrists do not place themselves "in the middle" or "in the center" because they are soulless or without ideological fervor. They place themselves there because they know that ***both*** extremes - on the left ***and*** the right, aspire to a politics that is one premised on identity instead of politics that aspire to create or recreate a world that is ***comfortable with*** and ***not fearful*** of ***including others who do not share our particular identity*** in our own political communities. The idea that ***any*** politics that is one based purely on ideas and principles without any reference to identity - while at times admirable - has often never succeeded.

To me, this common - if not subconscious - strand of identity politics reveals itself when people who self-id as all political stripes actually are quite supportive of government-provided social safety-nets and welfare programs [***until they are asked if they support those programs if recipients are of another race or cultural identity***](https://eml.berkeley.edu/~saez/kuziemko-norton-saez-stantchevaAER15.pdf). 

European Jewish emigres post-WWI and post-WWII - many of whom went from being socialist and communist to "neoconservative" or "Cold War liberals" - became disenchanted with the American Anti-War Left ***precisely because*** the American Left refused to see the failures and the totalitarian monstrosity of the USSR or of China, nor did they see the urgency of opposing Hitler, while they continued to vilify diversity issues as mere distractions on the way to a "communist utopia". 

As secular American Jew from a family of Holocaust survivors, I inherited this history, and I inherited - so to speak - the "center" between Left and Right - just because Jews have known persecution from all sides, and so we are particularly weary when a politician becomes a leader of a country based on resentment towards immigrants.

S, whereas I find it a shame that politics cannot seem to fully escape the confines of particular identities, this is exactly why I ***choose*** to allow my American Jewish identity inform my political affiliations: As someone who wants to be able to speak with and hear the concerns of supporters of a man who politicize their ethnic pride and nativism, I cannot confine myself to abstract conversations about ideas, nor do I have time for the political circle-jerks you seem so intent on identifying me with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh yes, I know. I quoted that to you as well. And that's why I'm still here talking with you. 

I just said that this sub is not only for critiques of Trump from the right-of-center or the more traditionally conservative base.

I assume your initial comment meant that since I might be centrist or left-of-center, or a Hillary supporter, my critiques of Trump [***which my post you seem to have not read wasn't***] are invalid and not credible. I see that as an attack - when you posit that some form of my identity by necessity invalidates one of my viewpoints, that at the very least demeans and debases those views. 

And for the record, summing up my political positions by calling me a "Hillary supporter" is ***exceedingly*** reductive. 

/r/NeverTrump is supposed to be a corrective to this kind of reductionism. [RebasKradd](https://www.reddit.com/user/RebasKradd), please correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe this sub is to reorient the entire political conversation ***away*** from such reductive binaries. President Trump won based on a strategy that went ***beyond*** these, and the only way to hold him accountable is to do the same. </TEXT>

 Those of left-wing and centrist persuasion are more than welcome amongst our effort, for Trump affects everyone. Be advised, however, that this sub does have a strong conservative bent and a preference for substantial, policy-based discussion; SJW mentalities will need a thick skin.

You said this:

 /r/NeverTrump should be a place to critique Trump from a Republican/conservative/right viewpoint

You attacked me based on this, and I am saying that attacks based on my left-of-center and centrist views is opposed to the rules of this sub.

	<TEXT> McMastter, who is a Trump appointee, has resisted the undeniable urge of many in our national security community and our military to [counterproductive marginalization](http://www.vox.com/world/2017/1/29/14426892/trump-muslim-immigration-refugee-ban-isis-terrorism) of an entire faith (in this case, Islam).

McMaster realizes that if policies are seen to be discriminatory against the Islamic community, that only helps our enemy (ISIS, al-Qa'ida, etc.) in their propaganda war against us. 

Case in point: Whatever you refer to it as, the relatively recent order President Trump signed barring certain populations from countries which happen to be majority-Muslim has [already been adopted as recruitment and radicalization propaganda](http://www.cnn.com/2017/01/30/politics/trump-ban-boosts-isis-recruitment/) by ISIS and other jihadist groups in their effort to show Muslims that the United States is at war with Islam.

**EDIT**: If anything, this article is ***commending*** President Trump for appointing McMaster, which might be indicative of a policy discipline critics may have previously missed.

PS: I do not appreciate personal attacks (particularly attacks that lack substantive counter-points), and it is against the transpartisan spirit of this sub.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trolling can take on very real, tangible consequences, however. 

Even if we give Trump the benefit of the doubt, and say that Trump unintentionally activated, mobilized [or "radicalized"] a whole bunch of angry, disconnected voters, it does not follow that Trump is not at fault for hateful or even violent behavior done in his name. 

The fact is, he is now President of the entire country, and one subset of the populace [the stereotype of the "angry white male"] is increasingly violent to another subset [or a few others: minorities, immigrants, LGBTQ, "liberal snowflakes", etc.]. It's the President's ***job*** to at least ensure that this "trolling" does not go from being "a blast" to getting in the way of leading the country in a unified direction. In fact, he got that message when he was [made to tell his supporters to "stop it"](http://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13639138/trump-hate-crimes-attacks-racism-xenophobia-islamophobia-schools), which I'd assume helped some but [not by much](https://www.buzzfeed.com/tasneemnashrulla/racist-incidents-after-trumps-victory?utm_term=.uhjv2Ba6a#.mu27XWzGz). So, assuming that Trump is very well-intentioned, "trolling" done in his name is largely his responsibility to stop. As a former businessman, he should be well-aware of how image and brand are essential to leadership. 

As [RebasKradd](https://www.reddit.com/user/RebasKradd) says, these trolls are hurting the credibility of the conservative movement or the "saner" elements of his supporters. Trump won't be able to lead without that credibility, so it's his job to fix it. GOP leaders can't necessarily do this, as this Pew poll [reveals that more of his supporters trust him over them](http://www.people-press.org/2017/02/22/in-trump-era-what-partisans-want-from-their-congressional-leaders/). And it's ludicrous to think that the media, or the Democrats, or teachers, or therapists, should carry that load [or even that they can ***succeed***]. If Trump wants to be an effective leader, he cannot keep passing the buck and shrug off any responsibility. He cannot have large numbers of his supporters believing he's doing and saying one thing, while another part of of his supporters believes he's doing or saying something else. That does not make a good leader. How can he lead a country and while his own supporters don't know or don't agree on what he is asking of them? Leaders - at least those who want to lead a transpartisan or unified country - do not leave that kind of ambiguity out in the open. 

As numerous reports by civil rights groups and nonpartisan think tanks document, such as [this one](http://bridge.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/When-Islamophobia-Turns-Violent.pdf), that violent incidents towards minority communities have been committed, and the perpetrators consistently cite Trump, it at least stands to reason that Trump would decisively and directly say that he disavows any and all of this violent behavior done in his name. As said above, he did do this in one interview, even he would have to acknowledge that did not get to the more denser idiots (he has numerous times suggested that none of his supporters watch or trust the "mainstream media"). I would personally prefer him to use a few press conferences and even mailers, and his rally speeches, to tell the idiots to stop ruining his brand and let him and his saner allies and base lead the country. 

It might arguably be too late, and I don't see why Trump can credibly say that he's completely without fault in any of this - he ***literally*** called many undocumented immigrants ["rapists," portraying a whole swath of undocumented Mexican immigrants as drug-dealing violent criminals](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2015/07/08/donald-trumps-false-comments-connecting-mexican-immigrants-and-crime/?utm_term=.090d828b82cf). 

How can someone ***not*** understand that his supporters support him ***because they like what he says***? This seems to be pretty basic stuff: And I'm sorry, the excuse being thrown around that the unhinged subset of his base ["took him seriously, but not literally"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/people-were-taking-trump-seriously-now-theyre-starting-to-take-him-literally-too/2017/01/25/dc86447e-e31d-11e6-ba11-63c4b4fb5a63_story.html) ***clearly*** [do not pay much attention](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/11/09/peter-thiel-perfectly-summed-up-donald-trump-in-one-paragraph.html) to violent incidents targeting the very same population Trump used to mobilize his base. The business leaders Trump says he wants to make deals with on behalf of the country [don't believe or take literally what he says or tweets](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-21/trump-was-taken-seriously-by-ceos-at-davos-but-not-literally). As left-of-center comedian John Oliver [summarized in one segment of his show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xecEV4dSAXE), it's never a good sign when large pockets of the country don't know what Trump means when "he says words". Trump himself has mocked, ridiculed, and dismissed this confusion, [suggesting that it is ridiculous that the media takes everything that he says so seriously](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2016/08/trump-mocks-media-for-thinking-he-means-anything-he-says.html).

I hope we can all put our previous partisan loyalties aside and agree on the basic idea that a leader should take his own words seriously and treat them with the gravity, clarity, sincerity, and weight his supporters and allies believe them to have. If he doesn't take this responsibility seriously, he is more suitable for private life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Both. Constituents should be just as responsible about holding their Congress members accountable.

Of course not relieving Congressional Republicans of any responsibility, but we as a country tend to somehow believe Congress will care about the concerns of a silent majority. Being a majority is meaningless if we don't act.

Trump will ruin the GOP and trigger an entire realignment if responsible Congressional Republicans and their constituents don't speak out. And the realignment will come faster if the country sees that no one in the GOP is willing to stand up to Trump. </TEXT>

Democracy demands that we, as responsible voters, do not settle for caricature, and that we do our own research. Democracy is a job, and if we let GOP caricatures dissuade us from voting for her, we failed at our job.

	<TEXT> But do you think it's at least a defensible assertion that Hillary's "liberal philosophies" have been a known entity in this country, albeit in conflict with ideological conservatism, but Trump's ideology is ***not*** a known entity?

He in fact demonstrated many times throughout this election he neither respects or appreciates any part of American political philosophy. He considers both liberal and conservative political philosophies as inherently flawed - and in his understanding, the flaw comes in when neither American liberalism or American conservatism abide authoritarianism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just curious: What makes Hillary so unpalatable to you? In my mind, whatever he political ideology, hers falls within the American sociopolitical, cultural consensus, and Trump's does not even register on the American political spectrum.

**Edit**: I essentially look at Hillary as the only American candidate standing. For me, as soon as I heard about Trump and Putin's connection, this election became for me a question of national sovereignty and American exceptionalism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And like it or not, it looks like Trump's campaign was not seen as legitimate either by a credible majority of American voters either, so in actual fact, if the EC were to vote based on both popular will and its intended purpose, we'd still end up with Clinton.

And by the way, until you address any of the argument I used to support the above conclusion, which I honestly don't think you invested much thought in, I agree with you that further conversations is unfortunately pointless. 

You might ***disagree*** with me on the original intent behind the EC, but that doesn't mean I avoided addressing it in any of my previous posts. 

What's a real shame is I see us fracturing over principle and party loyalty. And the trick Trump played on us all is making us think he was something [he is clearly not](http://www.mediaite.com/online/trumps-base-of-supporters-clearly-doesnt-care-that-hes-already-broken-campaign-promises/)- loyal to a party you nonetheless seem willing to pledge fealty to.

NeverTrump was about principle and country, not entertainer and party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My point is that the Founding Fathers did not want, nor would they legitimate, a system the allowed a demagogue into the WH. They did not want us to fight a Revolution only to have us embrace a wannabe king.

Repeat: They did not want a system - and warned against any system - that would allow Trump to happen.

I am not the one reaching here. The Founding Fathers would not settle for short-term expediency over bigger longer-term principles, and I'm surprised that we are letting ourselves be sucked into the same argument on popular [***populist***] expediency that the Founders saw as anathema to a free and well-governed society.

The entire reason why we transitioned from the Articles of Confederation to the Constitution was to prevent unpredictable, instantaneous disruption from spontaneously crashing the American consensus. To the Founders, change and political evolution were necessary. But they would also agree that once we had our initial American Revolution, political change in this country had to take on a less disruptive, more evolutionary character. As a student of American history, I believe that at this time, if the Founders saw Trump, they would see him as a more dangerous disruption than they see Clinton. 

And as to the question of "maturity": The Founders ***debated*** and talked about the maturity or lack thereof of the electorate. That's the very question they were talking about when they were talking about [factions](http://tenthamendmentcenter.com/2015/09/04/federalist-10-the-power-of-factions/). This question of "immaturity" - or how I would exchange that with a more political term - ["populism"](http://thefederalist.com/2016/03/22/donald-trump-displays-the-perils-of-populism/) - was very much on the minds of the Founders. I would agree with that.

But they would say the onus of maturity should be shared by the electorate, and they would certainly see a Presidential campaign won on the insurrectionist manipulations of fear, anger, rage, and a vague, undirected desire for disruption [to be illegitimate and unworthy of office](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2016/03/trump-founding-fathers-electoral-college-213777).

And like it or not, it looks like Trump's campaign was not seen as legitimate either by a credible majority of American voters either, so in actual fact, if the EC were to vote based on both popular will ***and*** its intended purpose, we'd still end up with Clinton. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I guess a lot of us here would implicitly acknowledge three things:

1) Our Founding Fathers rebelled against a foreign empire.

2. Putin, the head of a ***completely different country*** (Russia) helped install Trump through a [deliberate information warfare campaign](http://www.vox.com/world/2016/11/1/13487322/donald-trump-russia-agent-hack).

3. Trump [***cheered*** this on, to the point of ***asking them to do more of what they were doing***](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html).

If we can agree on all of these three things, we can thereby conclude two more things:

1) **Trump didn't care if he won an American election fairly**.

2) He went beyond the pale of American politics ***to a foreign entity*** to win.

Meaning:

3) ***He didn't win our American election by American rules***

So, the question I pose now: Why do we expect or want ***American rules*** set up for the ***American political system*** to protect and legitimate a cheater who won by ripping to shreds American rules [i.e., no foreign influence in our elections]? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And btw, are we forgetting that Trump essentially ***lied*** to the majority of his most fervent supporters among the Republican Party's base?

He definitely is not a Democrat - we all hopefully agree with that fact. The key now is to ***stop*** thinking of him as a ***Republican*** too. He is not a ***normal*** symptom of the two-party system, and certainly was never the type of figure our Founding Fathers would be comfortable with.

NeverTrump didn't start as a philosophically or politically binary movement. We should not end in binary thinking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Clinton likely won the popular vote by [more than 2 million](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/11/opinion/clintons-substantial-popular-vote-win.html?_r=0). And when all is said and done, Clinton is [estimated to have a 2% lead in the popular vote by mid-December.](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/11/clintons-popular-vote-lead-will-grow-and-grow/507455/)

2. The Electoral College [was designed](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/douglas-anthony-cooper/the-electoral-college-was_b_12897066.html) to prevent populist demagogues from being voted in on the backs of mass anti-federalist insurrectionary hysteria.

3. If we can both agree on the popular vote count, petitioning the Electoral College to vote against a populist, insurrectionary demagogue fulfills ***both*** the ***will of the people*** *and* the ***Founder's intent*** in creating the EC.

***EDIT*** This is ***no longer a Republican vs. Democrat election***. Trump has demonstrated ***clear loyalties*** to a fundamentally illiberal political ideology, in both his appointment of Bannon and his [praise of Putin and other dictators](http://www.weeklystandard.com/ad-trump-loves-dictators/article/2001319) makes clear to me that what is at stake is no longer the political platforms or ideological differences between America's two main parties, and it is no longer GOP vs. Democrat, or was it ever just Trump vs. Clinton. It is America vs. Illiberalism. </TEXT>

So, even if you didn't vote for him, and you either voted third party as protest or refused to vote at all, you clearly didn't care if he got into power.

	<TEXT> I think That both reasonable Republicans and reasonable Democrats should now set their differences aside [for the time being], and try to create a coalition to ensure that Trump stays accountable to the Democratic project. 

I think one good place to start in trying to form such a coalition is the [American Solidarity Party](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-different-conservatism/), a party in the mold of Merkel's [Christian Democratic Union](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2016/08/could-the-u-s-finally-get-a-significant-christian-democratic-party/), that is traditional and conservative on social issues and pro-life issues, but embraces some left-of-center proposals on economic issues. 

In my mind, the most ardent NeverTrump supporters will never have a respected place in Trump's Republican Party, and enough Democrats who supported Clinton would feel so betrayed and disgusted by protest voters in their own party, that those two factions will be disgusted enough by their former allies to be open to starting a newly empowered coalition in the political center.  I truly think that this new coalition - if we work towards it together - has a chance to be more powerful under a Trump presidency than either the Republican Party or the Democratic Party.

Just the beginning of a thought process... Let me know if any of you are interested. </TEXT>
