	<TEXT> I remember taking these surveys in Middle and High school. No one trusted the school that it was anonymous after a bunch of kids got in trouble for drawing dicks on their surveys, and they claimed they knew who it was because they "recognized the handwriting". So yeah, most people lied on those. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another fun fact: in that period of time, [King Philip's War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_Philip's_War), the deadliest war per capita in North American history, broke out due to increasing tensions over the colonists continuing to expand. At the start of the war, King Philip said "I am determined not to live until I have no country". By the end of the war, 12 of New England's towns were destroyed, 1/10 of adult male colonists were killed, and the Wampanoags and Narragansetts were almost completely obliterated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIL the Wampanoag chief in the 1660s, Metacom, had such good relations with the New England colonists that he adopted the English name "King Philip" and bought his clothes in Boston.
