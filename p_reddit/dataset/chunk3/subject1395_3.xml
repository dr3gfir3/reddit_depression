	<TEXT> That's always good to hear. My worst show was actually filling in for a friend who I mentored in college. I was doing lights for a musical though. Now the director and stage manager had never used this venue before (I had 3 years of experience there) and they had set their expectations way too high. Basically shit sucked and I endured eight hours straight verbal abuse. 

Afterward the rest of the tech people basically told me they were sorry I had to deal with that and that that were impressed that I didn't walk out. It's nice to have someone pulling for you after shit like that.  </TEXT>

I actually use mine with a set of 280 pros, but I have three other sets of headphones with the little magnets on them, so I can switch around. Only downside is that you have two cables, and the long skinny modmic cable really doesn't tie to the coiled 280 cable.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry, I meant vit. The more you have, the less AR you get. It's 50 max AR at 60 MAX equip load. It goes down 1 AR for each .5 max equip load you have. So if your load is 10/**100** you still get 0 AR. You need to cap your vit at 14 (or 9 if you use third dragon ring) to get the full 50 AR. Ring of blades +2 gives a flat 50 AR but it's hard to get.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flynn's won't help you if you have 30 endurance. Blades +1/+2 is good, but I'd skip the rest of those. Soldiers ring, dragon rings, cloranthy ring, yorgh ring, dispelling ring +1 are all good. Might be good to raise vigor and lower vitality. Royal greatsword is good but not amazing. Try taking a faster weapon and just see how it feels. I know it will take longer, but you won't have so many recovery frames, so you can dance around him more. 

Best of luck, and don't go hollow!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I mean, you basically have to remove and reconnect everything. Power supply connectors, memory, CPU, CPU cooler, io shield, fans, headers, gpu.

	<TEXT> Basically it has a mic gain calibration that plays pink noise through the iPhone speaker. You can use an external TRS mic too, but then you need a second device to calibrate. 

Once I ran it my iPhone worked about as well as a relatively nice Extech (I think) meter we use to test video conference equipment at work.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can I do this with a raspberry pi? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-22 13:27:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have a B+ at home that I've messed around with a fair bit, but I was wondering if I can use it as a standalone download machine. 

Generally my desktop computer is running almost 24/7 doing wget downloads of random directories, and I remote into it from work via Chrome Remote Desktop. If I set up the rpi with SSH (something I never figured out), is it reasonable to connect storage and run the pi 24/7 downloading crap? Would I see a speed drop? Would an rpi zero work? Can I power a sata drive and connect with a usb adapter for storage? Would NAS slow down the process? I have so many questions and not enough tech oriented friends to ask. 

Any help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>
