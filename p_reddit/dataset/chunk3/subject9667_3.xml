	<TEXT> I'm looking for an XDs in 9mm. They're near impossible to find at local gun shops because of the recall, however I want one. Prefer new, in the box with all original accessories. I'm in Mid Missouri and travel to Kansas City and the surrounding areas weekly. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I enjoy hard surface modeling, and am just beginning to delve into zbrush to do some more high res sculpting. I'm also tinkering with animation to feel out which specialty I'd like to pursue as my primary focus. Here's a couple of my models, haven't really gotten around to posting much in this sub yet.

	<TITLE> Wanted: Character Modeler (Organic modeling is my weak point) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-12 02:33:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, character modeling is my weak point, and I have a concept drawing of a high poly female character I'd like modeled for a game I'm putting together. I'd be willing to pay a few bucks if someone with a good portfolio and experience would be interested in helping out. Sorry if it doesn't belong in this thread, but I'm hoping someone here might be interested in helping out with this project and possibly create other characters for the game in the future once my team starts the art production. Feel free to shoot me a PM if you'd like some more details, or to see the concept sketch. Thanks!

EDIT: Bonus points if you texture and rig as well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a suggestion based off of other contests I've seen, but it should be an original model created specifically for this contest. As in not taking an old existing model and posting it. I feel it would prevent people from having an advantage.  </TEXT>
