	<TEXT> Hey, dumb-fuck-- I wasn't writing off the victim. That was huge conclusion for you to jump to. And considering that fact that I'm obviously advocating *for* the victim, your hostility is unwarranted.

When I wrote that post I was thinking of my great aunt who was molested as a 8 year old girl. She was haunted by it her whole life until the day she died. And she had all of the help in the world... Years of therapy, etc. Nobody ever wrote her off. It affected every relationship she ever had including her relationship with her own children. She never trusted anyone, and by all accounts she was the nicest young girl in the family until after her victimization. It's a sad story.

So I'm happy for you. I'm glad you're living (or are on your way to living) a "normal life". But it's unfortunate that you can only see things from your own perspective. Your experience is unique to you. Other people have things better/worse and deal with it differently--regardless of the "help" they receive.

My post wasn't an expression of an attitude, it was an expression of a fact. I know someone who was a lifetime victim of abuse that occurred in their childhood. Period. Your point is nullified.

You singled out the first sentence of my post... If you'd continued to read you would see that 99% of what I said related to punishment for the crime.

With regard to how the Child Predator is punished--to me it doesn't matter how well the victim does after his/her victimization. The fact that a kid now has to seek help in order to live a normal life is enough for me to want the Predator dead. They should not get another chance to victimize another child. Period. So you've actually reaffirmed that point in my eyes. No child should have to be a victim. No child should have to seek help to get over being victimized. The crime continues after the initial transgression. The Predator should die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a crime for life. That kid will be affected forever.

And for me it's simple logic--

Even if you believe in prison rehabilitation (which, in the case of child predators I absolutely do not), anybody with common sense has to acknowledge the reality that a certain % of so-called rehabilitated prisoners will re-offend.

In the case of a non-violent home burglar or car thief I am willing to take that gamble and give them multiple chances to turn their lives around. I'm not willing to give child predators a chance to offend again.

This should be the number one reason we execute prisoners. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all-- is this really a problem? I understand it's sometimes annoying, but is it really that big of a deal?

Second of all-- Are you kidding? The average theater chain could give a fuck about sound. As far as they're concerned, loud = good.

I used to manage a 22 Screen Movie Theater-- A large popcorn starts out as roughly 11 cents worth of raw popcorn seed. Factor in labor and materials (bucket/bag, butter, etc), it cost between 75 cents and $1 to package a large popcorn which is sold for $6-$7. Do that math real quick.

Rest assured... Any snack available for you to purchase at a major theater chain (Regal, Amc, Cinemark, etc) was selected by a corporate number cruncher with a spreadsheet, and that snack is going to be a cost effective product with an outrageous potential for mark-up--that's specifically why Johnny Number-Crunch picked it.

Candy? Look how cheap it is at Target compared to the multiplex.

Straying slightly from topic... Why is snack money so important to a theater? Because they've stopped making any money on the ticket sales (it's based on a sliding scale where a movie has to play for a long time for the theater to start making a % of the door). In order to make up for the lost ticket revenue, they have slowly (over the last 4 decades) increased the profit margin on the food.

In my humble opinion... People need to stop expecting perfection when they go out to the cinema. It's a communal experience where laughter, screams of terror, whispers and candy crunching are all part of the fun. Cell Phones are a much bigger problem than popcorn.

If you like total quiet, invest in a kick ass home theater and stay home eating soft foods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Proposition was good.

Assassination of Jesse James was good.

True Grit and Django were good.

3:10 to Yuma remake was a bit of a disappointment.

Cowboys   Aliens sucked.

But none of them were great. Not like Once Upon a time in the West, or Outlaw Josey Wales. That's why I believe the Western genre has suffered more than Horror.

But you hit the nail on the head... They aren't making very many Westerns anymore, and the ones they make are typically Hollywood affairs--which typically means too much production and too high of a budget.

It might sound crazy, but back when it was a busier genre, many of the Westerns we think of as "the greatest of all time" were actually modestly budgeted features with actors who were NOT the most famous of their era.

Clint Eastwood became a western icon BECAUSE of his work with Sergio Leone. But he became a legend when he followed Leone's example and continued to make gritty, low-to-medium-budgeted features (High Plains Drifter, Josey Wales, etc.).

Westerns used to be so big that the genre itself was divided into multiple sub-genres (Epic, Spaghetti, Revisionist, Comedy, Science Fiction)--and while these sub-genres technically still exist today--we're lucky to just get one solid Western per year.

Even with the small resurgence in the mid-90's and last few years, Western films are few and far between and the great ones are very hard to come by.

The truth is, the audience isn't there anymore. That and the many truths and myths about the era have been exposed with contemporary hindsight. I guess it makes the whole genre less appealing for the majority. And the producers and number-crunchers know the formulas on how to make money with movies. A successful Western nowadays is going to have to be high concept and include 2 or 3 A-List actors, making the cost/benefit ratio suffer.

To go from being one of the biggest genres in the industry to being so heavily marginalized in the era of spreadsheet cinema is sad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **The Western**. Much more so than Horror.

Even with occasional "good" movies like Django Unchained (*which I only liked--I didn't love*)... The Western used to be a staple of Hollywood cinema, and has dramatically faded.

The 70's was the last great era for the Western. Since then, there have only been a handful of truly great Westerns made (Unforgiven, Tombstone and the TV show Deadwood to name a few).

If you look at any TOP 100 list for Westerns, the overwhelming majority (like 95%) were all produced during or before the 1970's. </TEXT>

I had to watch Moulin Rouge almost 20 times (I used to test Blu-ray) and I ended up falling in love with he character of the Duke. He's fucking hilarious.

He also has a good little role as one of Dougray Scott's henchmen in Mission Impossible II.

He is also the bad guy in League of Extraordinary Gentlemen. </TEXT>
