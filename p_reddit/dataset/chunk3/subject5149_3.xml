	<TEXT> This guy in school once lied something about me to a girl we both really liked. She was mad at me and didn't talk to me for two whole years. 

After those two years we got together again I liked her even more now and that other guy was already blocked from all her accounts. I requested her to let me have fun with him pretending to be her and boy I did. 
I made him crazy for me. He used to go up to the roof to show me a view of his city at 5 am. He literally clicked pictures of all his childhood pics because I told him he was cute. I made him agree to things he never did. 
And when he finally said he wants to marry me, I blocked him again.
Good times.

	<TEXT> The 10 10 10 rule.

Answer yourself.

Will it even matter in 10 hours?

Usually stuff like petty relationship fights and sports results.

Will it even matter in 10 weeks? 

Getting fired from a job. Or getting thrown out of your house falls in here.

Will it even matter in 10 years? 

Things like divorce, mental illness on children and enormous amounts of debt. </TEXT>
