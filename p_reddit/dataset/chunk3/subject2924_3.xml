	<TEXT> She has all of the following:


Early 20s, I think she just graduated college before teaching us

Short brown hair

Perfect teeth

Well trimmed eyebrows

Plump, but not too plump lips

Long eyelashes

Brown eyes

VERY short, I think she may be 4'11

Very nice, ahem, assets. Not huge or anything, but given she's very tiny, they look very nice

I'm not sure what her nationality is at all. My guess is she's half-white and half-hispanic. Her skin tone is white. </TEXT>
