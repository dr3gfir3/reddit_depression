Anyway, I manly responded to your post because I found the irony of saying *"Christians live under the laws of the ten commandments, not the laws meant for the chosen people, or those of Jewish decent"* unbearable, since the ten commandments were given to the Jews.  However, now I guess it's most likely you were just talking about the New Covenant and phrased it weirdly. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My first "test" character used a +5 Craftsman Hammer. I like the smaller weapons because they're faster.  Why the Mastodon Greatsword or the like instead of something already infused with dark, like Scythe Of Nahr Alma? *(though, I'm not sure I like the Scythe's move set)* The Mastodon Greatswors wasn't even on my radar; what am I missing about it?

Would the INT be at 60 just for the extra orb for Affinity? I think at that point I would just drop both to 50, but I am thinking about either 60 or 50 for both, depending on how many points I need. Dropping them from 67 to 58 would give me the points I need to get my STR to 40. I like the idea of the Sacred Chime. But, [the wiki I was reading](http://darksouls2.wikidot.com/crypt-blacksword) said a Dark Crypt Blacksword has **S** scaling in Dark. So, that seems like the way to go.


Any suggestions on armor? I keep reading conflicting data on it. Should I be pumping VIT and wearing something heaver? </TEXT>

I'm just worried if I start de-specializing at this point, then higher level guys will start to trounce me. Is this fear unjustified?

**Solis**  *(Lv: 246 Soul Lv: 13555544)*


| Stat   | Value    | Notes
:-----------|:------------|:------------------------------------
VGR | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
EDN | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
VIT | 5 | *(Meh? I'm at 69.4%)*
ATN | 60 | *([Cast Speed Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATSZSEk4dj8))*
STR | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
DEX | 20 | (First Soft Cap)
ADP | 20 | *([This video is compelling](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LrrymfvwDv0))*
INT | 67 | *(69 w/ Helm)*
FTH | 67 | *(69 w/ Helm)*

Right Weapon: Dark Berserker Blade +5 *(should be Washing Pole, working on it)*; Dark Sunset Staff +5; Dark Bow of Want +5

Left Hand: Dark Black Witch's Staff +10; Defender's Shield +5

Armor: Black Hood +5 *(effective +4 levels? Yes, please)*; Black Witch Robe +5; Lion Mage Cuffs +10; Blood-Stained Skirt +10

Rings: Ring of Life Protection;  Clear Bluestone Ring +2 *(Cast Speed goes from 154 to **343**)*; Covetous Gold Serpent Ring +2; Covetous Silver Serpent Ring +2 *(used Bonfire Ascetic to get at NG, never took it off)*

-------

I normally go Berserker Blade Witch's Staff mobile/versatile attacks, rolling to avoid damage. Occasionally, I will go Sunset Staff Defender's Shield and just Dark Orb my way to victory. The bow is a back up poison delivery system if I need to aggro/kill something I can't target. The short range on Berserker Blade is making me want to switch to a Washing Pole, despite the lower damage. But, I need to level one up first.

So, as you can see I've double down on Dark *(Dark BNS: 188)*, but I am wondering if just putting points into INT and FTH is the right plan at this point (I am thinking of getting both to 70 and then getting ATN to 75). I hit the first soft caps in the other stats to get more bang for my buck. But, I am wondering if I shouldn't be redistributing my points a little, since I'm well into the last soft cap in INT and FTH. 

-------

Should I get VGR, EDN, or ADP to the next soft cap? Should I put more into DEX for more damage/Phys DEF? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You did not directly address the logical construction from my last post. Additionally, we've--apparently--gotten to the point in the discussion where we repeat ourselves. Since I'm convinced I already understand what you're saying, I'm just going to reiterate my point one last time and then likely stop responding; assuming you don't bring anything new or of interest in your next post (this current post of yours did not).

That people of race x should be kill is opinion not fact, correct. But, that the hypothetical person THINKS people of race x should be kill IS a fact. If facts can't be racist, then that fact about the person's thoughts isn't racist. However, I disagree with this definition of racism. I feel "racism" means what the word's etymology implies it means. Mainly, **any** delineation based solely on race; facts or otherwise; derogatory or otherwise; good, bad, or ugly; and any and all. (And--yes--this means I think everyone is 'racist' when it comes to certain things.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I did. However, it would true that you think that. It might not be true that all people of race X should be killed. But, if you think they should, then--tautologically--it's true that you think they should.

Thus, if only false things can be racist, then that truth can't be racist.  

However, I would say it is racist. So--from Proof by Contradiction--one of the starting axioms must be incorrect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I would. I--in fact--call my self a "speciest" because I know I make decisions based on the species of a thing. ('Racist' being when someone makes a decision based on the race of the person in question.)  But, if you want to think I'd not, that's fine. I can't prove to you I would since no one has ever brought up similar statistics for white people in my presence in a setting where my response would be recorded.

I would just like to go on to say that I don't know why you feel only non-facts would be "racist." If someone were to say--for example--"I *think* everyone of race X should be killed" would that not be 'racist' if it is true they do really *think* that? Seems like a perversion of the term.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, which is why I could see her doing it for the betterment of her people. 

However, I don't agree 18 is an "arbitrary" age; certainly not if that's the age she has been for hundreds of years. Also, regardless of how quickly other candy people age, they do age. Whatever BP has going on to keep herself the same age for hundreds of years, she is the only one using it. She tried and failed to cure death in her subjects, but whatever she is using on herself, she is keeping it to herself. Why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It doesn't make sense that she has a "sweet spot" which she bounces back to when she takes on candy biomass.

Why not? I don't think it would make sense that absorbing more essence would make her old and decrepit. 

Other candy people age, it's very odd that she does not. I think its safe to assume she mush have some extraordinary way of remaining young, something other candy people wouldn't have access too.

I would assume she can replace aging body parts with fresher parts, much in the same way rich people can get new organs.[[1](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1514702)] Since it's been established that "candy biomass" is essentially interchangeable between candy people, I don't see why she wouldn't be able to get those fresher parts from her subjects. And, she seems egotistical enough to justify and action like that because "her people need her" (and in some sense they do, since they mostly all act more or less like children. Also, she can always clone more.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Makes her older? That's one way of looking at it, I guess. Absorbing candy biomass reset her to **18** again, which in *that case* did make her physically older. However, we don't know for sure if she was *already* physically older than 18 that absorbing more candy biomass would make her even older (which seems silly to me) or if it would reset her back to 18 as it did before (which I find more likely).

This isn't to say I don't find your point value; it's just not how I interpreted that event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Memories are very very Unreliable.[[1](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases#Memory_errors_and_biases)] It is not uncommon for people to "invent" whole stories that never happened to them, and then truly believe they did. If you did what was done to the mouse to a human, I am sure they would likely start to truly believe the shock occurred in room A, not room C. Maybe, if they were presented evidence otherwise, they might start to realize they were misremembering, but otherwise I am sure they would swear under oath it was win room A.[[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eyewitness_memory)]

Of course, this is all just a guess. </TEXT>
