	<TEXT> While it's not as evil as dropping healthcare for 24 million people, this is going to be seriously evil.

He left infrastructure out of the budget specifically for this reason.

My guess is that he's going to attempt to privatize the entire interstate highway and rail system (possibly even air), and then the corporations that get to charge tolls on all of it get insane tax cuts in return for upkeep.

The Freedom Caucus will not oppose this, and the entire thing will reap unheard of riches for the rich.  The entire GOP will back it, and that will be that.

The citizenry are the only ones who can speak up to prevent this, but it isn't as personal as healthcare. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, first we have to investigate Obama.  Why weren't you asking about Hillary then?

Hillary made some kind of uranium deal.  Did she do it with a promise to lift sanctions?  Hell no, she's not that stupid.  Did she cut the deal in exchange for hacking cooperation?  No again, doesn't look like she was in cahoots with the Russians during the election at all.

Sorry Trumps, but the only evidence of collusion comes from your family and your campaign team.  There are now piles of evidence, and you're calling for other people to be investigated?  It sounds to me like "We know we colluded, but look, everyone colluded."

Bullshit.

Their problem was not knowing what exactly has been recorded, what is admissible, and so on.  Literally, I think Donnie is sitting there going "What did I say, and when did I say it?"

Nunes ran over because it was the first time team Trump got an inkling of what they might be accused of.  Donnie's damage control machine can't function unless it knows what damage to control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Camping at a scout reservation, my friend and I decided to set up off by ourselves where no one else was camping.

It's very hard to describe, but coming from a distance through impenetrably thick brush, there was a blood-curdling scream.

It sounded like a woman screaming at the top of her lungs, but it went on for a good ten minutes continuously.  As in, if that were a woman screaming, she'd at least have to stop for a breath.

We fucked off right out of there and camped somewhere else.

Later that summer, a family of bobcats was found to be living there.

I, to this day, do not think we were in imminent danger of being attacked or some such, but you had to be there to hear the sound.

It was unlike anything you ever see on a nature show, and something I'd have attributed to the supernatural if we hadn't found out the cause. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I honestly think that it's what's happening right now.

In American politics and its relation to the media, we are on a precipice where you can either lie without consequence or cannot.

Just because a certain demographic no longer cares about truths or untruths, that does not mean we should collectively resign ourselves to the "post-truth" era and hurl ourselves into the void. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm highly sensitized to "echo chamber" situations.

I try to find holes in what I understand and believe and welcome intelligent opposing commentary.

I'm a liberal.  A fairly strong one at that, but I don't really enjoy sitting in a circle and nodding about whatever.  And sadly, when I hear people go overboard, I get treated like a traitor at times if I call out inaccuracies and hyperbole.

A good friend of mine showed me a documentary about the anti-NATO protests in Chicago (2012?).  It started with "NATO is a machine for war and the US should leave it."

After watching, I said I disagreed with that characterization of NATO as a war machine.  NATO was treaty-bound by Bush to go into Afghanistan.  My understanding of the Balkans intervention of the 90s is that the majority of people there supported it.  And, throughout the Cold War, it was a stabilizing factor that kept the peace.

The response I got was "but war is wrong".  Well, I consider myself anti-war, but there are defensive and offensive aspects of it that make militaries and military alliances a necessary thing.  That doesn't mean all wars are justified, but I see the point of the US being a part of NATO.

"But war is wrong".

I didn't say it, but that's overly simplistic and ignores a deeper understanding of the world.

I didn't see my friend for a year.  The next time I did, he asked "Have I shown you the anti-NATO protest documentary?".

...

He hangs out with people who think exactly the same way.

I'm aware of how I don't want to be impressionable in such a fashion.

"There is nothing in the world weaker than a virtue untested by fire."

	<TEXT> This is slightly off-topic, but I played Skyrim when it came out, didn't finish it and played some more 3 years later.

I was pretty sure there was going to be a time-warp thing (either at the academy or through the dragon battle) and finished everything I could before I did that bit, expecting to go back in time and play a huge new map before returning to the original time and having everything change while I was gone.

Well, that didn't happen.  The only thing left was to go back to my house that I filled with skulls and splash around.

Depressing.

	<TEXT> Not hopeless, but very difficult to do deliberately.

The status quo is fickle and changes when it's ready.  If you try to push an issue, the status quo will resist, all the while some other aspect of the status quo will change seemingly effortlessly.

Fashion is a lite example.  You can't go out one day and try to force a new style upon people.  It won't work.  But if you adopt a new fashion, there's always the chance that others will adopt it as well.  When enough people do, boom, there goes the status quo in a new direction.

On a more important note, this is why you may not want to grab a torch and pitchfork to try and assert your political views.  It may simply be better to speak out when you can, but with a calm voice and a clear message. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump does not "sign approval" of an independent counsel.

Calls for a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 US election[edit]

On December 21, 2016, Democratic Congresswoman Nydia Valzquez wrote a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch asking Lynch to appoint a special counsel to investigate Russian interference in the 2016 United States election. Such an appointment would have been unusual in that the conflict of interest to be addressed was anticipated, following the inauguration of Donald Trump as president, rather than immediate.[19]
On February 24, 2017, Republican Congressman Darrell Issa called for the appointment of a special counsel on the Real Time with Bill Maher show.

On March 2, 2017, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recused himself from the investigation regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election following revelations that he had had meetings with the Russian ambassador while a Trump campaign surrogate, and had falsely testified otherwise in his senate confirmation hearing. The decision over whether to appoint a special counsel thus devolved to his deputy, currently Acting Deputy Attorney General Dana Boente. In senate confirmation hearings for Rod Rosenstein to replace Boente as Deputy Attorney General, ongoing in March 2017, several democratic senators have sought to make the confirmation conditional on Rosensteins agreement to appoint a special counsel. Rosenstein has declined to make such a commitment, and because democrats are in the minority, this is unlikely to prevent his confirmation.[20]

+He's not a congressman -He doesn't reveal anything unless he finds a crime committed

independent commission is a group of congressional reps specifically tasked with investigating something

Tucker Carlson has been on screaming about how we now have proof that Trump was right about wiretapping and the very scary prospect that Obama was monitoring the transition team.  Some sane woman came on and explained to Tucker how this did not contradict Comey's previous statements about wiretapping, and he started hyperventilating.
