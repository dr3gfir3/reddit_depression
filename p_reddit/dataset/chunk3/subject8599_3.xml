	<TEXT> Scalia passed away on February 13, 2016, the same day as a Republican presidential debate. McConnell anticipated that Donald Trump, and possibly Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas or other candidates, would demand that GOP senators block Obama from replacing the conservative icon, a move that would have tilted the high court to the left. </TEXT>

A hot war with the Muslims and economic war with the Asians. He doesn't care how many American soldiers get killed in the process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bannon's removal from the NSC, which includes senior members of Trump's foreign policy team, was seen as a boost to national security adviser H.R. McMaster, who officials said has struggled to work together with Bannon.

A senior White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bannon's presence on the NSC was no longer needed after the departure of Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn.

Flynn was forced to resign in February over his contacts with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Sergei Kisylak, prior to Trump's taking office on Jan. 20. </TEXT>
