	<TEXT> It's common as long as everyone is paying for weed equally, like I always have weed   certain "friends" would always just expect to smoke but they never buy weed. That made me change my smoking method to puff until your done pass whatever is left over. With real friends I tell them to roll their own joint. Just like to smoke 2 joints a day. Then I know how much I'm smoking as well. Always used to take 2 pulls   pass, When smoking anyone else's joint. You have to call the people out who smoke for free. Trust me they not as friendly when you stop giving them free smoke.  </TEXT>

Can get it for 20 1g if you know right people.  Just too expensive for me for daily smoke. I get it on special occasions. Having said that some dealers are known to sell score bags @1.3g. Rip off. When you ain't got any skunk. You'll pay whatever you have to lol.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Skunk is most commonly smoked form of cannabis now but they comparing it to weed. 

Here's a pic of Thai weed. Nowhere near as good as skunk but a lot of people still smoke it. Don't taste as good either. I like to explain it simply as weed is like beer  amp; skunk is like vodka or whisky. Strength wise.

	<TEXT> You only seen skunk or as you guys call it weed,
When you grow "weed" it grows like this. People smoke weed in U.K. By far skunk is much more popular. But just cause you don't get it in PNW. Don't mean people don't smoke it. 
Without sounding racist or stereotypical most of my Jamaican friends smoke weed, not skunk especially older generation. They would never touch skunk joint.   </TEXT>

Will look into it now. I definitely want to find out. 
This was just to clarify what the difference between weed   high strength "skunk" as was mentioned in a recent study. Not saying study is correct but so people understand difference  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taste is very different to any type of skunk   high is much more mellow. Buzz don't last as long as if you had smoked the same amount of skunk. Thai weed or any other type of weed just don't have the same genetics as skunk.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Weed   skunk are different it's like trying to compare beer   vodka! This weed is grown exactly how it should be. Generally Weed smokers won't smoke skunk   skunk smokers won't smoke weed. I smoke both. Your response is typical of a skunk smoker when offered weed. 
I'm just showing you the two types over here in uk because a lot of people have been getting confused with recent studies that have come out where they refer to skunk! 
Here's an example for you, A lot of people think Bob Marley smoked skunk. He didn't he smoked weed. 
There's a big difference in both taste, appearance   chemical effect on your body   brain.  </TEXT>

Then we have skunk which is nearly all the bud you see in r/trees. So when you see reports comparing weed  amp; skunk. You know what they are talking about.

	<TEXT> Made a comment recently regarding weed  amp;amp; skunk! Although people class it the same, they are very different. Here in the uk you can get Thai weed, commercial weed or hi-grade. All forms of weed  amp;amp; have low thc compared with skunk which is much higher in thc. I'd class then as different plants. Most skunk smokers won't Smoke weed  amp;amp; vice versa. I smoke both. Only way to describe it is like the difference between beer  amp;amp; vodka(or strong spirit)!

Ch 4 in uk done a documentary "drugs live" which they compared the two. Skunk  amp;amp; weed are different.   

Here's pic of Thai weed
