	<TEXT>  "Not all feminists have any idea what feminism actually is and prefer to just don the title without spending five minutes even asking what the title means."

I was tempted to cautiously disagree with this (to a reasonable extent, of course), but then recalled [this Fusion.net piece]( http://fusion.net/story/105401/new-feminist-thor-is-selling-way-more-comic-books-than-the-old-thor/?utm_source=twitter utm_medium=social utm_campaign=socialshare utm_content=desktop+top) erroneously declaring the new Thor a feminist simply because she's a woman.

Not all women are feminists, just as some, arguably many, men are. Sadly (or perhaps thankfully) many so-called "feminists" subscribe to radically different definitions of feminism. This is where the MRM must define itself; MRAs have the opportunity to very clearly separate ourselves from PUAs and the Red Pill "community," such that it is. If we maintain this clarity over our use of language, we're half-way toward the important goal of defending ourselves from false accusations against the movement's goals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not actually Thor, that's [Beta Ray Bill](https://www.reddit.com/r/comicbooks/comments/2xa0fu/discussion_my_metatheory_about_hickmans_avengers/), a Korbinite warrior who once wielded Mjolnir with such skill that Odin forged him a war hammer of his own, *Stormbreaker*, securing him as an ally of Asgard ever since.

His cameo appearance in *Guardians of the Galaxy* last year has been widely debated. I don't care what James Gunn says, **[headcanon says he was in the film](http://www.cinemablend.com/new/Was-Beta-Ray-Bill-Guardians-Galaxy-Here-What-James-Gunn-Says-68305.html)!!!** </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Edit: and to be clear, it's a reference to the "Killing Joke", where the Joker shoots her and leaves her paralyzed. The cover is a throwback to that particular aspect of their history.

... A story widely credited with starting Babs on the path to becoming Oracle, arguably one of the greatest assets to the Bat Family as a whole. Barbara's role as Oracle was an unrepentant display of her strength of character; she showed willpower to rival that of Batman himself in "standing up" after being gunned down.

Had the SJWs/RadFemiNazis of today been aware of this story back in 1988 she likely never would've served as Oracle, leaving the readership at large deprived of her inspirational strength and unrivalled determination. It begs the question: What watered-down pseudo-stories are the genuine readers of today going to be fed once these GamerGater Haters have packed up and gone home? </TEXT>

She then became The Oracle, one of Batman's greatest allies in his family's fight against crime, effectively "standing up" having been gunned down.

Her character's history, although it's been watered down, is greatly tied to The Joker. </TEXT>

In other words, if you've some perceived "flaw" that you can't change, that's where your so-called "flaw" begins and ends, whereas a flaw that you can change, but don't, is very telling about the rest of one's personality.

The truth remains, however, that putting someone down over something they can't change is low, and oftentimes inexcusable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is probably a gross oversimplification, but essentially when someone experiences a traumatic incident anything that could potentially remind someone of said incident, or cause them to experience a flashback, is referred to as a ["trauma trigger."](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trauma_trigger)

For example, a child who was rescued from a house fire might be "triggered" by seeing a lit fireplace or stove. A person who suffers a sexual assault might be "triggered" by another person's future sexual advances upon them.

Unfortunately, the term has become something of a parody of itself, with certain self-styled social justice warriors claiming to have been "triggered" by extremely small issues, sometimes non-issues entirely.

You'll often see a notice offering a "Trigger Warning" toward the head of articles dealing with certain issues, but a true trigger can be difficult, if not nigh-on impossible, to predict and warn of in advance.

Hope that's cleared things up for you! :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a massive discrepancy between Good Guy Mr Fantastic and World-Class Villain The Maker, and that leaves newcomers with tremendous difficulty in recognizing, and indeed appreciating, how one became the other, so much so that they might decide further investment in the characters isn't worth the effort.

Honestly though, I've no idea what Marvel's strategy here is. Surely it would benefit them t'have Fox spending their own cash to advertise Marvel's own comics, no? Perhaps Marvel and The House of Mouse are playing the long game... </TEXT>

Maybe I'm not reading you correctly, or else I'm overanalyzing things from a zoological standpoint, but why would a successful sexual strategy include bullying unattractive or low status men into submission? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My inner conspiracy theorist worries that you might be right, which is why thus sub, its members, and the MRM as a whole must maintain a strong commitment to the dual roles of separating radical feminazis from actual feminists whilst simultaneously moving forward in the protection of men's rights.

I've said it before here, but language is a fickle foe in this field; we can educate our detractors by separating the MRM from the PUAs and that Red Pill crowd, but if a radical feminist tries to bait this sub s/he gets the same label as a true feminist who'd do no such thing, and consequently the two are "lumped in," so to speak, together.

Diversifying a cause mightn't seem like progress, especially when we run the risk of watering it down, but sometimes the dead weight needs to be shed. Christina Hoff Sommers' [equity feminism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equity_and_gender_feminism) movement is an excellent example of this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was cautiously checking out a girl in the gym between exercises, and had to supplement my use if the leg press with my own efforts w using free weights, as the former was broken. This brought me t'the same area as the girl I'd checked out earlier, and she apologetically interrupted my routine to correct my technique and explain exactly what I needed to do to avoid damaging my knees.

In my stunned stupor I thanked her gruffly and corrected myself as per her instructions, but I made certain to thank her properly when I saw her leaving. We exchanged pleasantries (names, no numbers) and she even offered t'show me how to use an alternative machine t'the leg press in the weights area, which I'd ordinarily try to avoid. I declined her generous offer, as I was in a slight hurry, but also would've liked to have had something to talk about with her the next time I saw her.

Anyway, that was two months ago, or thereabouts. Hopefully one of these days she'll be in around the same time as my good self. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My uncle interviewed for an interview when he was 21, and out of everyone sitting opposite him one guy became *obsessed* with his relationship status. He more or less opened by asking my uncle if he was married (!), and then whether or not he was engaged, and then whether or not he was seeing a girl, until eventually my uncle asked the guy why any of this was relevant, and the guy's colleagues had him back off.

They might've wanted t'suss out whether or not he planned to stay with the company, or if he was "free," so to speak, to leave when the whim took him, but the guy might've also been betraying some kind of homophobic attitude too.

Anyway, I'd imagine an employer would be terrified to ask such questions these days, at least in such a formal capacity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This might be obvious t'you already, but you'll definitely want to take lighting into account, and bit just for the books themselves; if you're including television shows, colourful ones like *Spider-Man* and the like from the nineties should be fine, but darker shows like the *Batman* series from the same era will be much more visually appealing in a darker room.

Granted, improvements to screen technology, like the move from CRT to LCD, might negate done such concerns, but I'd imagine it's still something worth taking into account. </TEXT>

Given Marvel's treatment of The Fantastic Four of late, I'd imagine Reed Richards of Earth-1610 (Ultimate Universe) will be the de facto Reed following *Secret Wars*, fully embracing his title as The Maker and further moving Marvel away from Fox's upcoming film. </TEXT>
