	<TITLE> My theory on one of the new Hawkmoon ornaments. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So the new ornaments for all the weapons look incredible, but when I saw [this one](http://imgur.com/gallery/aT6y6) for Hawkmoon, I thought it looked amazing. Most people will say that it is a blood stain on the front, but I think that it is the [Eyasluna](http://imgur.com/gallery/YtVf3) transitioning into the Hawkmoon. The in-game description of Eyasluna reads "One day, young hawk, thou shalt sail beneath the silvered moon" and everyone calls Eyasluna "Baby Hawkmoon." The red color on the Hawkmoon with the ornament matches that of the Eyasluna. If this is the case, then it is a really interesting story behind Hawkmoon. 

TL;DR The Hawkmoon with the "blood stain" ornament is actually Eyasluna transitioning into Hawkmoon

Edit: Wow! It seems like a lot of people agree! After looking through the comments, I also agree with the idea that Hawkmoon's paint is chipping away to reveal the old red Eyasluna coat of paint.  </TEXT>
