	<TEXT> Don't sweat it too much for opening day: the first day or two of the season will have a lot more "not-playing" players than the rest of the season, because they try to spread out the opening day games. By Wednesday everything should look normal and your players will have games almost every day.

Good luck!  </TEXT>

$49 a month, and you get free range balls and cheap tee times ($16 after 2:00). The course is always in great shape, with pristine greens and GPS carts. And the cart girls are always out and about. 

The only downside is that a few highschools practice there, so from 2:30-5:00 on weekdays the range is a bit crowded.  </TEXT>

http://i.imgur.com/NHsT9xc.png

C is doable, but there are some big problems. Firstly, there are huge holes at Catcher, 2B, and 3B. Running Chase Utley and Chase Headley out there every day just isn't going to have much success. 

Secondly, the C players aren't spaced out enough. There are 14 C-players in the top 100 picks, especially the pitchers bunched up from average pick 57-80. I did several mock drafts and in each of them I just wasn't able to get a large enough percentage of C-players to field what I would consider a competitive team. M was better all-around. </TEXT>

But you're absolutely right that I'm lacking in speed. Right now my lineup had a combined 24 SB in 2016, and 10 of those are from Semien.

I'm awfully high on Montgomery's chances this year. Leake is sort of a known quantity with a ceiling of being average, so I know he'll sit on the waiver wire and never get picked up by anyone else. So my plan is to give Montgomery the chance to break out, and if he loses his spot in the rotation then I'll switch to Leake.  </TEXT>

I know I haven't been around in a while. Been eight months since we saw each other, right? I just, well, I've been busy. Doing my thang. Giving you your space. You know how it is. But baby, wait! Hold on, don't leave, hear me out. I need to get something off my chest.

*I've changed*. 

I'm a different fantasy baseball manager now. I dropped my old habit cold turkey, cleaned up my act: no more messing around with guys like Jose and Jeanmar. I've deleted Justin Verlander's name out of my phone. Josh Donaldson keeps standing on my lawn with a boombox over his head playing "In Your Eyes" but he means NOTHING to me, because baby, I've got a *new* gimmick. And guuuuurl, this time I'm not going to disappoint you. This time we'll make it through, I promise. Just give me a chance, will ya?

Behold, my new fantasy baseball experiment: 

#M as in Mancy

([the name reference, for those of you who don't watch Archer](https://youtu.be/_K_WmV50e7c))

* [Hitting](http://i.imgur.com/IgRQVqZ.png)
* [Pitching](http://i.imgur.com/8YLsAEI.png)

If you don't remember me from last year, I'm the guy who drafted J. Donaldson, J. Abreu, and J. Martinez in the first three rounds and realized that all their names began with J, so I [created an entire fantasy team around the gimmick](https://www.reddit.com/r/fantasybaseball/comments/4c3fl3/jwalking_a_fantasy_baseball_experiment/). We were in 1st place for most of the year, finished 2nd in the regular season and had a bye week in the playoffs, before narrowly losing in the second round. 

I'll be posting weekly updates (or bi-weekly, or tri-weekly, or whenever I goddamn feel like it get off my back *mom*) on Mondays this year to keep you abreast of the glory (and failures) of **M as in Mancy**. Also, I'll probably be making my posts on my blog to keep everything in one place instead of cross-posting all over the interwebz. So next week it will be a direct link to my blog/website www.DavidKristoph.com, unless mods have a problem with that. I'm cool with whatever. 

Anyways. Read on if you want to hear about my draft strategy and how I ended up with the team I did. Otherwise, cheers to another hopefully-successful-but-probably-disastrous fantasy baseball year!

The draft was last night, and it went as well as could be expected. I had the 5th pick. I missed out on a few players I wanted but hey, them's the breaks. Here's a position-by-position breakdown of my draft strategy, with the player's average draft position in parenthesis. Bolded players are ones I drafted.

**Catcher**

1. **M. Wieters (275)**
2. M. Montero (1069)
3. M. Zunino (1137)

Yeah, my options were a bit limited here. Wieters is the guy, but at least I was able to wait until the 17th round to get him.

**First Base**

1. M. Cabrera (13)
2. **M. Carpenter (77)**
3. M. Holliday (168)
4. **M. Napoli (173)**
5. M. Moreland (300)
6. M. Gonzalez (462)

Although Carpenter has 1B eligibility in Yahoo, he's far more valuable at 2B and 3B so let's ignore him, because he's never going to play 1B for me. I was hoping Miggy would fall to me in the 2nd round, but sadly he did not, and I waited too long to grab Holliday. So Napoli is my first baseman. I'm still not sure how I feel about that. 

**Second Base**

1. **M. Carpenter (77)**
2. M. Gonzalez (462)

Yeah, we're pretty weak on depth here. I reached for Carpenter and took him in the 3rd round. I feel confident with him holding down the position, but I sure hope I don't get stuck running Marwin Gonzalez out there if an injury happens. 

**Third Base**

1. **M. Machado (8)**
2. **M. Carpenter (77)**
3. **M. Franco (123)**
4. **M. Sano (145)**
5. M. Moustakas (205)
6. M. Gonzalez (462)

Third basemen for daaaaaaaaaaaaaays. Machado's gunna be my SS, and Carpenter is my 2B, so in reality this position belongs to Franco and Sano. I think Franco's poised for a big breakout year, and Sano should improve on his 2016 season, so I feel pretty damn good about taking them in the 9th and 10th rounds. 

**Short Stop**

1. **M. Machado (8)**
2. **M. Semien (226)**
3. M. Gonzalez (462)
4. M. Duffy (611)

It's the Machado show all day, every day. Snagged him with my first round pick, and then book-ended the draft by taking Semien with my last pick, just to have a backup. My entire draft strategy revolved around getting Machado, so after that everything was cake. 

**Outfield**

1. M. Trout (1)
2. M. Betts (2)
3. **M. Kemp (72)**
4. **M. Trumbo (88)**
5. M. Ozuna (134)
6. **M. Brantley (137)**
7. **M. Sano (145)**
8. M. Holliday (168)
9. M. Cabrera (217)
10. **M. Conforto (242**
11. M. Kepler (253)
12. M. Margot (301)
13. M. Upton (366)
14. M. Saunders (495)

Trout and Betts were never really on the table for me. After that things opened up pretty wide. Grabbed Kemp in the 4th round, Trumbo in the 6th, then Brantley in the 12th. Conforto I'm really just holding onto in case he has a big breakout year, because he's killin' it in spring training.

**Starting Pitching**

1. M. Scherzer (14)
2. M. Bumgarner (17)
3. **M. Tanaka	(74)**
4. **M. Fulmer	(113)**
5. **M. Harvey	(120)**
6. **M. Stroman (151)**
7. **M. Estrada (194)**
8. **M. Shoemaker (195)**
9. **M. Pineda	(201)**
10. M. Moore (219)
11. M. Leake (292)
12. **M. Foltynewicz (297)**
13. **M. Montgomery	(299)**
14. M. Andriese (317)

In all my mock drafts (six of them. Six!) I was able to grab one of Scherzer/Bumgarner in the 2nd round. So guess what happened on draft day? Both of them got snagged *right* before my 2nd pick. So I was forced to super-reach for Tanaka with my 2nd pick instead. But beyond that, I've got a lot of really solid pitching. This is going to be a quantity vs quality thing: with 9 starting pitchers hopefully I can win the three counting stats (Wins, Strikeouts, and Quality Starts) every week. 

**Relief Pitching**

1. **M. Melancon (142)**
2. **M. Bush (350)**
3. M. Lorenzen (532)
4. M. Cabrera 

Okay, so we've got a problem. Melancon is the only reliever with an M name. This was a problem because A) I needed to reach for him hard, in the 5th round, because I've seen him go much earlier than expected in my mock drafts, and B) it means I'm thin on depth. I drafted Matt Bush with the hope that he gets the closer job in Texas, and have my eyes on setup men Lorenzen and Cabrera in case their able to get promoted too. But otherwise, I'm not going to be winning Saves very much. I might even see if I can move Melancon and punt on Saves entirely. We'll see.

So that's the team. Other players I have my eye on are Martin Prado, Melvin Upton, Miguel Gonzalez, Mike Leake, and Matt Andriese. I'm sure there will be a lot of transactions as the year goes on. 

What'd I miss? Who is due for a breakout season that I should stash away in hopes of a big payoff? It's gunna be a long season, so I'll take all the help I can get from you guys. But it's going to be a fun (or at least entertaining) ride.  </TEXT>
