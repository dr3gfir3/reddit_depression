	<TEXT> I'm blaming both sides for this.

What?  God, not everything has two sides.  Ryan used a charity in a swingstate as a photo op.  He was called out on it and, in his defense, conservative supporters have pulled donations.  That's what happened.  There's nothing about Democrats politicizing this (which they should have; this shows how much of a scumbag he is).  This is all his fault, and honestly, he should offer to donate to them due to the fact that his presence harmed the charity and the city. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The way HD gifs work is they flatten the scenes so they only encode what's different in each scene.  So, if a man was waving but everything else was still, it would only be like 1 frame and 4 "frames" that only encode the hand moving.  This scene is unable to have an HD gif because the camera shifts, every person is moving, and it's unbelievably long.  Well, you could have one, but it would literally be an uncompressed file containing 120 images.  It would be a pain to load. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand where you're coming from, but I think you're misplacing blame. Universities don't force people to do anything; if a student doesn't like their major, they should switch it. Also, you shouldn't ask someone about classes they've taken or school. This is a mistake that many students make; they list class projects or courses on their resume without realizing that every CS student in the world has to take some form of that class to graduate. These sound like ill-prepared students or graduates and it's no wonder you're constantly finding duds.  Also, I'm not trying to tell you how to do your job, I swear, but try looking for personal projects, actual work experience, or contributors to open source projects. Those all imply passion and drive when it comes to CS. Anyone can get a degree, but it takes a certain type of student to actually work outside of class , none-the-less for free. Just my two cents. </TEXT>

I believe swimming works most of the muscles in your body in some even fashion.  Also, there's much to be said about calisthenics versus weights.  Swimming is probably extremely useful here because it strengthens the core more naturally.  Though, I'm sure weightlifting is good as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a substantial difference, though.  While there are different feature sets, All iPhones/iPod Touches (beyond the newest generation) can be one section, all iPads can be another, and then there's the new generation of devices.  Since those devices are "retina" their resources just need to be a quarter of the size for their non-retina counter parts and the app should work with very little redesign.  That's hardly  the same as dealing with MDPI, XHDPI, HDPI, LDPI, different processors ranging from 600 Mhz to 2 Ghz QuadCore, 128 MB RAM to 2 GB RAM, and more.  

Also, the cameras, cell network, and GPS might seem like a lot, but it really isn't.  If there weren't GPS or cell network available, the OS would just automatically use WiFi and AGPS (IIRC) instead.  Also, if a device is lacking a camera, it's not exactly a huge issue for apps revolving around photo taking; those apps just won't support said devices.  The same happens with Android apps in the marketplace.

Though, I don't actually know the process of game design and dealing with different resolutions, so that might be different.

Being effeminate is a large attribute to someone's personality and you're not "shallow" for finding a part of someone's personality a turn off.  Replace "effeminate" with "rude," "cocky," etc. and people will rally behind you.  (That's not to say I'm equating it with a negative descriptor, but I'm using those words to prove that you're allowed to be turned off due to someone's actions). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sigh, this makes me sad.

Beyond the whole "meeting a guy on WoW" thing, you did nothing wrong.  So you barked up the wrong tree, who cares?  How many times do you think guys hit on girls only to find out they're dating someone else?  How many times does a guy talk to a girl only to find out she's a lesbian?  How many times has a girl hit on a gay man thinking he's straight?

The straight guy should take it as a compliment.  If not, then there's something wrong with *him.*  Think about it, all you did was show interest in another human being; if they're mad about that, then they have issues, not you.  Also, never feel bad about making someone uncomfortable.  We learn and grow from discomfort.  Staying comfortable and complacent is boring and reminiscent of death, IMO.  That guy now has a story to tell, an interaction with a gay man, and you have a lesson.  None of that would've happened if you were quiet.  

Seriously, don't feel like a dick, man.  To catch a fish, fishermen have to cast countless lures and wait hours.  To find a guy, you have to put yourself out there and just hope good things come. </TEXT>

Eh, I would feel too vain.  One of my annoyances with this subreddit is the fact that it's filled with posts like, "Hey guys!  There's a Pikachu in the background of this naked photo of me, so shower me with compliments!" hahah.  Maybe if there's a Halloween thread?

	<TEXT> You're now venturing into Android OEM territory here.  Apple doesn't add things to their devices just because.  I know the original Xoom had a barometer (pressure sensor) but it didn't really have a purpose.  Adding these sensors into devices should add a benefit for their costs rather than being another bullet point on a spec sheet.  There aren't many other sensors to add in to the device that everyone would use; would a medical-based sensor be cool?  Sure.  Would it only help 1% of the iOS owners out there?  Yes, so it should be an accessory.  Why should 99% of people pay for hardware they won't use? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you understood the intricacies of processors (not saying you don't), then you would see the difference.  Adding a core is very standard today, especially because ARM processors are basically already designed and it's up to the manufcturer/designer to adopt the design and alter it.  That's what the A5 was; it was a pretty standard design that could be found elsewhere.  The new iPhone's processor is a reworking of the internal layout of a dual-core processor.  This is the first time Apple actually designed their own proc beyond looking at a specification and going from there.  The result is that it's remarkably faster than most quad-core processors because it's exceptionally designed and Apple optimized its software to use it specifically, rather than the scores of Android OEM's buying Tegra 3 from NVIDIA. 

The camera is *not* the same.  It has a much wider field of view meaning it can take more focused images up close (macro) and allow for better far away images.  Sure, it's not a large improvement, but it's an incremental improvement over the 4S, which had one of the best cameras in any smartphone.  

I don't understand how you can pick 3 improvements from the 4S and say it's a much larger improvement over the 4 while neglecting the scores of improvements the iPhone 5 has.

EDIT:  Sorry, you edited to add more.

I understand your point on the software, but the ICS point is moot.  The SII was updated to ICS around the time the SIII came out (hell, xda had it long before).  I know this because I own the SII and use it as my daily driver.  The SIII added many new software features, among them S-Beam, S Voice, Dropbox integration for international, the whole "bring it to your face to call the contact," the "flip to shut up," popup video, and more.  These features are widely believed to be useless for the majority of the population.  Though, if you want to point out the minute additions, we could count improved Siri, Do Not Disturb mode, 3D maps, PassBook, etc. which Apple actually gave to other phones/devices rather than Samsung which made SII owners purchase the SIII to get new software features.  Also, I laugh at your Jellybean point.  Not only do I have an SII that runs JB, I own (and love) the Nexus 7.  JB is the EXACT FUCKING THING iOS 6 IS.  It was used as an incremental update to speed up the software while introducing nice tweaks to make Android seem more cohesive and put together.  Though, it did add Google Now, which is just a response to Siri, which was found in iOS 5.  That's not to speak negatively of Now, though, seeing as it's mind-blowingly fast.  JellyBean did NOT bring a new interface or "a ton of features," it brought a new font, smoother animations due to Project Butter, new wallpapers, a new Phablet UI, a new Shazam-esque widget, and a nicer notification menu, IIRC.  That's hardly "an entirely updated interface and a ton of features."

I ignored the SIII's software features because they're meaningless.  You ignored iOS 6's features because they're now found across the board and are meaningless.  It's funny how we're similar, no?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  And then the 5 comes out and is even more incremental

Except not.  Software-wise, yes, nothing is new.  Hardware-wise, every single part of it is different.  Better WiFi hardware, larger screen,  insanely fast processor, 2x RAM, new port (for better or for worse), much thinner/lighter, exceptional GPU, and more.  The 4S was "incremental" because it improved the camera a bit, added a second core, and Siri.  This phone much more of an improvement.  Sure, there's nothing new that your old phone couldn't do, but the same can be said about every Android phone in the last year.  We've plateaued in terms of what we can do with the power of cellphones.  The SIII has a quad-core processor (internationally), a bigger screen, and new software features which were mostly junk (including their Siri "competitor").  There's nothing spectacular about the update from SII-SIII beyond the large screen. </TEXT>
