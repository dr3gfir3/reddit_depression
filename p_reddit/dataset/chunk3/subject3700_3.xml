	<TEXT> Every single one of my elected officials in my district is a semi-progressive Democrat like Ron Wyden.  I am working against the more centrist ones.  They are the ones causing us to lose, again and again.  

Some of us hit the brick wall of the centrist-led Democratic party 20 years ago.  We told them to swing left and they shit on us, while they lost 100's of elected seats per year.  Don't expect any substantive change from the DNC.  We screamed at them after Gore was anointed as the candidate in 2000, he had a unanimous vote at the DNC because the Democrats forbade anyone from within the party to run.  Expect maybe them trying the same thing with Biden or lord forbid Hillary Clinton in 2020.  

These people always think they are the smartest person in the room.  Their hubris knows no bounds.

The only reason Tom Perez is DNC chair is because he went to law school with Bill and Hillary Clinton.  He is just as much a craven corporate centrist as they are.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course it did, but that was the game being played.  

Clinton spent 1/5th of her budget on ads in California and New York, why?  

Because she wanted a popular vote win and doesn't like staying in hotels overnight in flyover states.

Centrists have fucked priorities.   </TEXT>
