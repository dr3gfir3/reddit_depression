	<TEXT> Yes, I believe the key is the smoldering combustion. Like in the picture you shared. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Still unconvinced. Have you seen that weird shape in the middle? Why would the stream of water run down the tree like that?

I think it's more likely due to [smoldering](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smouldering) like a friend of mine suggested. That combustion is slower than flame combustion, and lower temperature.
I guess it was smoldering without rain, and then rain started and stopped the whole process. </TEXT>

You can see that it's clearly burnt.

Unfortunately my phone battery died while taking those two and I couldn't take any more. </TEXT>
