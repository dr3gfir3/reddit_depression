	<TEXT> Happy Feet is without a doubt, one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. I mean, it's just so bizarre. It's like a mishmash of High School Musical, March of the Penguins, and an episode of the Twilight Zone. It has no idea what it wants to be half of the time, and by the time Mumble goes insane in the mental hospital zoo, it's like something out of a Stephen King narration. The propaganda stuff didn't even bother me that much...at least not in comparison to how weird the movie is. 

It's a great movie to watch when you're stoned. Anyone agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Also, I have a theory that the uncle is responsible for Casey's father's death, and that he (the uncle) killed the father knowing that he would have full custody of Casey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People were probably upset about the scene because she's a woman. I mean, if that had been a male character who died that horrific death, no one would have batted an eye. But because she's female...STOP THE PRESSES EVERYONE! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think people made too big of a fuss about Peter accidentally hitting Mary Jane in Spider-Man 3. He thought Mary Jane was one of the club bouncers. Seriously, some people acted like Peter was an abusive wife beater. It's another example of how women are allowed to hit or strike a man, but the second a man does the same thing, even if it's on accident...STOP THE PRESSES! </TEXT>
