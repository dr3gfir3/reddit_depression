	<TEXT> I agree with you completely and good decision XD.

I could wax insight as well as Kruppe, but even *I* have my limits! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's a matter of perspective. To me, the Nimander plot is really Lovecraftian. Sure, I'm not really sure how it's all going to tie in (but I have the faith!) and sure, I don't really think it's worth them going through all this effort to safe Clip. But the sense of forbidding mystery, as well as their pairing with Kallor, has led to some great scenes of dark tension. It also moves along a bit more briskly than the other parts of the Black Coral chapters which is a nice relief from Endest and Siland brooding. Seerdomin has started to kill people so we will see where that goes, but so far Nimander's plot has offered the most immediate action in those chapters to balance out the heavier philosophy and long-view historic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree with you there. His longevity really plays into this - after such a long life, I really feel he has been whittled down to the core components of what is means to be human. Granted, not all of that is pretty, but hey, what can ya do? You see this "whittling down" with the other long-lived races too. One could safely assume the Andii weren't always mopey and vague, nor the Jaghut always as esoteric and philosophic. But after such long lives, they are stripped of all the ephemeral nuances that they may have had to leave their core exposed.

And this could evolve into a greater discussion of how this is reflected in the various civilizations (both Malazan and irl) but I won't jump headfirst into that rabbit hole! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kallor's pov *almost* makes him sympathetic (at least for as far as I am in the book). I have to hand it to SE - he can make even the most despicable characters worth reading and worth getting excited about. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love the feeling I get with Kruppe's "zoom outs" because I can feel the camera rise up from one scene and pan the city . It's a really cinematic way to open and close the Daru chapters and SE gets more effective with it each chapter. I only wish the Black Coral chapters got some sort of similar treatment because at times it does kind of feel like I'm reading two very different books. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kruppe's narration took a moment for me to warm up to - I'll be honest! I think it really comes down to how one feels about Erikson's philosophy. While I certainly feel he's gotten better with it as the series has progressed (and there are some really great moments of philosophy in TtH), there is a glut of it in this book. As someone who studied lit and philosophy in college, I'm just a dog in a manger. However, I can totally see that not being the case for many. (Looking at you, Black Coral chapters!) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well I knew things were going to get interesting when Kallor hitched a ride (love his pov, btw). And then when they met Gothos - woah man. So many questions, so little answers. They are now in Bastian and Kallor has engaged the kelyk drinkers. Aaaand then chapter change. I love how Nimander's sections are Erikson's chance to just throw in everything plus the kitchen sink.  It's one of those times where I'm cursing out his use of multiple pov's just because I want to know what happens next! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And then there were three. God damn it, Erikson. You hit them fast and you hit them hard. It's really heartbreaking to watch the remaining Bridgeburners slowly dwindle into fewer and fewer numbers. But my god, what a scene. Points to Erikson for the reference to Whiskeyjack (god damn it, I'm not crying!) and the delicate building of tension throughout the whole intro to the assassination scene through excellent use of pov.

I was a little hesitant to start TtH because so many people knock it for its long-windiness. But with scenes like this one (and tbh, I'm really enjoying Nimander's side plot) this is quickly becoming my favorite book in the series. So much intrique, so many disparate threads that I know will be woven together. And Kruppe - I mean, enough said. I could listen to him ramble all day.

Now excuse me while I go cut some more onions... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm a very hairy bottom (especially on my rear end) and despite my best efforts, sometimes things can get a little dirty around my butthole. What are some maintenance tips for keeping that area clean without having to shower before sex just to clean it up?
I'm especially interested if anyone has any hair trimming tip for that area that doesn't lead to chafing. Since I'm so hairy I want any manscaping to look natural and blend with my manly fur coat! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sweet baby Jesus and a thousand hallelujahs! Toc the Younger (or the Unlucky) is back in the playing field! Poor guy is still getting tossed around at battered but I'VE MISSED HIM SO MUCH.

Side note, I made my mom start reading the series and she's on HoC. I know Toc is her favorite character but I wasn't able to confirm for her if he makes it into the later books. Now I may just keep it a secret just to be diabolical.

Also, RG is shaping up to be a fantastic book, despite the HUGE amounts of rape and torture. Seriously, there's a lot of rape and torture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was reading this on my couch with my partner at the other end. There were multiple points during this chapter where I had to let out a deep sigh to vent my grief, stress, etc. I'm pretty sure he thought I was having some sort of mental breakdown - and Truth's sacrifice was definitely one of those moments. Especially when Gesler reflects on it and you realize that Stormy will be getting the classic "Hey Fiddler, by the way Hedge is dead" treatment with regards to Truth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I'm adding another notch on my sword tonight. The siege at Y'Ghatan was brutal. Erikson has outdone himself with this beast of a chapter and battle arc. I don't think I've ever read something so claustrophobic and gut wrenching as these 150 pages. I'm going to bed but I'm not sure I'll get any sleep tonight.

Fuck.

Just fuck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think what I had missed most was the large amount of pov characters. Only going between Kiska (who was okay at best, grating at worst) and Temper (a good character weighed down by being a conduit for an infodump) became a bit repetitious...

...which worries me for when I jump back in to other series with only one pov. God forbid. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Once more into the breach, I guess! (Or, how I overcame whiplash between NoK and BH) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-15 20:21:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let it not be said that The Bonehunters is a small book. I recently decided to fold in ICE's books into my reading of SE's series and just finished NoK after reading MT. While I enjoyed NoK, it is truely ICE's GotM and was a little rough around the edges (despite being an enjoyable romp around Malaz City). This was also where I suffered my first case of whiplash (literary whiplash, that is).

I was simply not prepared for how much information ICE tells you straight out. There was little to read between the lines (which is not a bad thing) but switching from SE to ICE was like switching from a manual car to an automatic car. It was smooth and effortless - jarringly so.

Now I'm diving into BH and have gotten whiplash again. Back to a manual car...and I'm sputtering between stops and starts as I get the feel for this vehicle again.  Is this whiplash effect something that will be as prevalent if I continue to fold in ICE's books? I don't expect him to drive the same as SE, but I may give this approach another thought if I'm going to have to relearn how to drive each time I switch authors.

Also, please no spoilers for BH - I'm only through the prologue! </TEXT>
