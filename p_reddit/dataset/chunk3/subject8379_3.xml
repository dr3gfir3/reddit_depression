	<TEXT> Irrelevant is a good way to describe it. People use GMO as a proxy for things they dislike, but there's not a single thing about GMO that is unique and a valid basis for their complaints. 

When you scratch past the GMO argument, you find people hate pesticides, patents, monoculture, etc--none of which are unique to GMOs.

It's actually self-defeating on their part. None of the things they claim to care about are address while they shout about GMOs. But they are completely resistant to understanding this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your data is not current. Where did you get these "glaringly" claims? 

IARC is a total outlier. One of the participants on the panel is a paid activist (Portier). He started touring with the pals of Seralini after the assessment. He's a stealth crank, I'm afraid. 

http://www.gmwatch.org/news/latest-news/87-news/archive/2015/16232-iarc-scientist-to-speak-on-agency-s-conclusion-of-roundup-link-with-cancer

Mesnage is on all the Seralini papers. Soil Association held a course on homeopathy for emergencies. GMWatch is full bore cranks. 

Besides lying down with dogs and getting up with fleas, the authors of researchers cited in the IARC report were perplexed with the conclusions. This was my favorite: http://www.producer.com/daily/toxicologist-pans-un-glyphosate-report/#.VRcWRvrM3o4.twitter

Even New Zealand--haters of GMOs--recently reported that the cancer claims are bogus. http://www.stuff.co.nz/business/farming/83079593/cancer-allclear-given-to-weedkiller-glyphosate-by-new-zealand-scientific-review

Portier actually was legit at one time. What a pathetic way to wind down one's career. 

We have the information. The jury of people who look at the evidence without agenda (or even in spite of) find no link to cancer.

	<TEXT> Expanding hours next weekend (quote from email):

Hi Everyone,

A big thank you to everyone that ventured outdoors, and came to the pop-up market on Sunday.  Wow, it was quite a scorcher! Hopefully, we won't have to many more heat waves like that this summer.  

The Pop-Up Market is Expanding!

This weekend we will expand the pop-up, and include Friday evening, from 5pm to 8pm. Nothing better than wrapping up a week by drinking a cold brewski at Winter Hill Brewery, and then grabbing fresh produce for the weekend. 

Once again this week, we'll have freshly picked local watermelon, both the red and yellow varieties, from Applefield Farm in Stow, MA. They're super sweet and refreshing, and sold out before noon last Saturday.  We will also have local baby bok choy, local beefsteak tomatoes, kale, mangos, purple bell peppers and much more. 

Where: Winter Hill Brewery - 328 Broadway Somerville, Ma
Friday 8/19 from 5pm to 8pm
Saturday 8/20 from 10am to 3pm
Sunday 8/21 from 10am to 3pm
See you this weekend! </TEXT>

Get off at South Station, and go upstairs. At South Station you look for this Silver Line sign, or ask someone to point you there: http://subwaynut.com/mbta/red_line/south_station/south_station17.jpg

Then you just take the Silver Line to the airport, no more changes. The Silver line looks like busses, it's not on rails. You can see more photos of South Station at that person's site: http://subwaynut.com/mbta/red_line/south_station/

	<TEXT> That's an important realization you are coming to. Don't fight it.

I find the "attraction" stuff particularly toxic when people try to blame cancer patients for their problems. Can you imagine how hard it is to feel shitty from cancer and then feel shitty because people think you caused it yourself?

This isn't the same as setting goals and working towards them with concrete actions. That still works in the right structure (not always if you are raised in poverty and had a terrible education, for example--but imagine how this feels to those folks too). 

Good for you for looking harder at this.  </TEXT>

I thought it covered the potential of gene editing, the excitement, but also the social issues reasonably clearly.

And it noted that we are in the earliest stages of this, but scientists are carefully examining the projects and the outcomes. There have been world-wide discussions about the uses of this tech, and guidelines are in place for safety and the evalutation of human-related modifications.  </TEXT>

I was a voracious reader as a kid and I was cruising through this book and got to a section on Nostradamus. I was intrigued, but I went looking for more. You had to walk to the library then. 

I found out what kind of bunkum it was. But it was a good lesson. It shaped a lot of how I approach things still today.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey solar enthusiasts--

I wanted to create a post here in case any of my neighbors went searching for solar info. Our program has just launched and we hope that more of our neighbors can solarize (and as many as possible before the SRECII program changes). 

Press release with details: http://www.somervillema.gov/news/solarize-campaign-sets-goal-200-somerville-property-owners-commit-install-solar-panels-0

Program website: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/solarize

Video intro: https://youtu.be/rbOSvYLHAWI

If you have any great ideas about novel outreach that has worked in your communities, I'd love to hear about them.

	<DATE> 2016-07-13 21:08:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello neighbors:

We wanted to let you know that very soon we'll be making the big announcements about the program, and the educational outreach activities are about to begin. So be sure to stay tuned for dates and locations where you can hear about the features of the program, it's coming very shortly.

Like other Solarize Mass communities, we will be offering residents a way to obtain solar PV for their homes in various manners. This can be outright purchase of a system, or with Mass Solar Loan assistance, or through a Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). A PPA is an agreement where the system is owned/maintained by a third party financier and then a homeowner purchases the power that's being produced on their roof for a lesser rate than what they are currently paying their utility. These choices can reduce the cost of green power for you. We hope to help you decide what might be right, if you are interested in solar power.

If you have been considering solar, you should think about acting soon. The state's Department of Energy Resources (DOER) is making changes to the SRECII program, which is where "Solar Renewable Energy Credits" are assigned value. SRECII will stop taking new projects, replaced by an SRECIII program. We don't have the details for SRECIII yet. But if you want to obtain solar under the existing incentive structure, you have to act before January 8, 2017. 

So be sure to watch for email notices soon, and our city Solarize web site will begin to reflect the program features as well. 

Thanks for your interest.

[This can be shared with your social media networks if you want to tell your friends and neighbors.]

I'm the solar coach, Mary. You can sign up on our web site to be notified as soon as our real launch goes out publicly, or check back there soon for the press release and other details: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/solarize.html </TEXT>
