	<TEXT> Artemis killed a guy because he accidentally walked in on her naked. Slight overreaction there.

Aphrodite was cheating on her husband a lot with Ares, who was basically the ultimate douchebag redpiller type of guy and a huge pile of failure.

None of the Greek god(desse)s are great feminist icons, methinks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only legendary i DEd so far was the Leeroy i got a few days after Blizzard nerfed him to 5 mana.
Got a Faceless Manipulator out of him. No regrets so far.

However, i too have a Neptulon *and* a Foe Reaper 4000, while i lack Dr. Boom, Alextrasza and Sylvanas. To me, it seems like a pretty good idea to disenchant those 2 in favour of a Dr. Boom. Still on the fence about that one...

Should it do it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I must be missing something... if you play double Mana Spring and then Knife Juggler, how can you play the Brewmaster, requiring you to bounce something back, and get results?

You can't bounce back the Mana Springs for obvious reasons and bouncing back the KJ won't do the damage. The KJ deals damage after the battlecry. So you have to have something else there too, on turn 7 at least.
Though i guess it's not much of a problem with everything costing 2 less.

There's also the question of time. One Knife Juggler hacking away at your life is neat and all, but if you have some board presence and you will, especially on turn 7+, it's got to take a while. Nozdormu confirmed counter? :D </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah yes, the fabled "leftover pizza". Normally, no amount of pizza could survive being in my home for more than 48 minutes. It's truly a hunting ground where cheese and crust fear to tread.

Anyway, it sounds like a description of a great evening more than anything. The dream is real for you, my friend. There's nothing wrong with enjoying yourself. </TEXT>
