	<TEXT> I don't think this requires any selling. It is a well-crafted LA Noir police procedural. If you have Amazon Prime why not watch the first couple of episodes in Season 1 and see what you think.

Here is the Wikipedia description:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosch_(TV_series)

And here is a selection of reviews by critics:

	<TEXT> I think you might be better off buying a new TV. For instance, you can buy a 40" 1080P HDTV that is highly rated by Walmart customers for $189.

https://www.walmart.com/ip/SCEPTRE-X405BV-F-40-LED-Class-1080P-HDTV-with-ultra-slim-metal-brush-bezel-60Hz/27608624

I'm sure similar items are on offer at Best Buy, Amazon   the other usual venues.

You will have much better picture   sound than with an old standard def  CRT TV.

	<TEXT> I have Ooma and like it a lot. 

Came to it after trying several other inexpensive VOIP solutions that did not work all that well. The Ooma, on the other hand, has been great.

I get billed by Ooma about $4/month through my credit card for various taxes and fees (e.g. local 911 support). That's the only continuing cost. I paid $100 (on sale) a couple of years ago for the box.

"Connects to Cable or Antenna"

"The TiVo BOLT isn't just for cable subscribers. It also lets cord-cutters connect their over-the-air antenna so they can maximize their free local channels with TiVo's advanced control and recording features." 

Tivo is making a public presentation in Dallas tomorrow, so there may be more reporting or product brochures to shed light on this.

Put in your zip code and select the "Broadcast Stations" channel lineup. You will see the 88 channels available in Houston and their programming. While there are many specialty channels (religion, shopping, languages other than English) there are a lot of channels with broad appeal.

If what you see appeals to you, install an outside antenna and run antenna cable to your TVs. If you don't like commercials consider adding a Tablo, Channel Master or Tivo DVR so you can time-shift programming and skip commercials. The antenna   DVR will pay for themselves in less than a year.

Remember to check TVFool.com for specifics about signal quality   where to point your antenna.

	<TEXT> Yes   no. The poles are put up under a government license because they use the public right of way. As such they are subject to a lot of regulation. 

Local governments want to encourage competition. Access to poles is part of that. Naturally, the incumbent utility usually is not eager to share poles, so access for a reasonable rent is a requirement imposed by the licensing government. 

Governments also do not want a forest of poles set up by multiple utilities. Getting the competition on existing poles is part of that. 

It is also economically much more efficient to have multiple utilities on one set of poles. The various utilities can share capital costs   maintenance.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly! You want to put the antenna on the roof and run RG6 or better coax down to the basement. In most situations that means the cable goes down the outside of the house and gets into the basement via a small hole drilled through the wall. If this is something you are not comfortable doing, find an antenna installer in your community to do the work.

Of course, if you already have coax cable going to the basement from previous satellite or cable service, you can certainly make use of that.

If that does not appeal to you, you could try contacting a local antenna installer to put up a tower antenna. Getting the antenna 30 feet off the ground significantly improves the signal for your zip code, according to TVFOOL.

	<TEXT> I take your point that comsats are a tangible asset that can be sold to another company. But it should be noted that they are depreciating assets. 

Modern spacecraft have a useful orbital life of about 15 years. This is dictated by the amount of station-keeping fuel on board at launch. Communications satellites in Clarke Belt orbits are above the equator at an altitude of about 22,300 miles. They are subject to microgravitational forces that tend to move the satellite into an inclined orbit that moves it above   below the equitorial plane. The fuel is expended to maintain stability with the equitorial plane so the signal can be easily handled by downlink antennas. The birds are adjusted every few weeks by active control from ground stations. When the onboard fuel is nearly exhausted (in about 15 years) the remaining fuel is used to move the satellite into a higher (graveyard) orbit to clear the slot for a replacement satellite. 

My point is that a comsat has a finite, approximately 15-year useful life. If some way to refuel orbiting satellites is devised, then most satellites could be used longer. </TEXT>

The ATSC 3.0 standard is a work in progress. But it will encompass video in various formats, radio (audio) and other data streams. They are all compressed   multiplexed on a single carrier and processed by your ATSC 3.0 receiver to give you the subchannel or data stream of your choice. No internet is involved. </TEXT>

My work around is a TabloTV DVR with the $150 lifetime guide option. Works great.

	<TEXT> RetroTV is broadcast on KUVM-CD on channel 34.4. Very much UHF. The transmitter is in the Missouri City tower farm, broadcasting with an effective radiated power (ERP) of 11,000 watts. It is a low power signal. By contrast, KPRC on real channel 35 broadcasts from that same tower complex with 1 million watts ERP.

Two suggestions to troubleshoot your problem.

1. Check your TV setup to make sure that you have it configured to receive over-the-air ANTENNA signals (as opposed to CABLE signals). A TV misconfigured for cable will receive some, but not all, broadcast frequencies. I have made this mistake on at least one occasion.

2. If your TV is properly configured for OTA signals and moving the antenna to a few alternate locations does not improve your results, it is time to head to a big box store: Home Depot, Lowes, Best Buy, etc. Buy a different, well reviewed antenna   keep your receipt. Try it out and see what happens. If it doesn't work you can take it back and try another antenna. If nothing does the trick you should call the station to see if they can offer advice.
