	<TEXT> I don't what you mean by fluffy dough, real pizza dough isn't really fluffy. It must be light and crispy though.

Here is the recipe of REAL pizza dough ( not Domino's kind of dough)

500gr flour
10g salt
4Gr fresh yeast
250ml lukewarm water

There is no oil/sugar in pizza dough.

Mix water and yeast.

Mix flour and salt.

Put flour mix in water mix.

Work it until it's all incorporated.

Let rest 10 min with something to cover the bowl so it doesn't dry.

Work it by hand for 10 sec (8 pushes)

Let rest 10min. cover it!

Repeat those 2 steps 2 more times.

Now that your worked the dough 3 times it should be looking nice.

Let rest 24h at room temperature.

Now you can spread it and make a pizza. You can make up to 5 pizzas with that recipe.

Don't forget to let the pizza rest with the ingredients on top for 10min before you bake it. Oven must be as warm as possible. Real pizza oven are at 350 degres Celsius.

Good luck and enjoy ! 

EDIT: you can spread olive oil on the baking paper before you cook it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maaan you have a golden job! I wish I could work in this kind of business LEGALLY. 

USA started the drug war first, EU followed, USA is starting to legalize weed, what is the EU doing ? Nothing. And they still can find some people to go on TV to brainwash people on how 'weed is evil" , how it makes you step to harder drugs, how it makes people crazy...  Unbelievable in 2017, especially in France where the laws are the toughest in the whole EU, yet France is the country that smokes the most. 

I wish I was born on the west coast sometimes.

EDIT: Or Colorado,  I would've be goin' down to South Park, to have myself a time.

	<TEXT> It makes sense, I was just expecting to find wild planets not discovered at all, here it seems like some guys went on ALL the planets to put their useless buildings ( but never a city or village), IMO it breaks the immersion of being an explorer. 


 You re talking about the discovering of the Americas, it makes me wonder why is there not much games about that period of history, I would love to play a Spanish conqueror, a Native American or even a Maya. A Red Dead Redemption kind of game would be awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cannot let you say that this is a French cheesecake.

Charlotte is the nickname of the basic cake. The one OP made could be called a "entremet facon charlotte" since its not a basic one but much more upgraded!

And it doesn't contain cheese. And not crispy cookies, those ones are soggy, dipped into a syrup, usually with Rum.

We do not have cheesecake in France at all.We have so much better. I ve never seen a real one until I went to Australia and the Netherlands.

EDIT: It remembers me while working in a Aussie restaurant, I made a "Fraisier", classic French summer cake, so good, so pretty, so complex in taste.It takes 2 days to make a good one. 
My Aussie boss saw it and was like "Oh mate nice strawberry cheesecake"

	<TEXT> Yeah I know, personally I have to scale everyday dozens of ingredients. To measure in ml I need a measured cup that as to be big enough so I dont have to do it in several times and have to add up numbers. Lost of time otherwise.

Also it's a lost of time to wash the measured cup every time you have to measure something different. Scaling is just the fastest and the easiest way, therefore its the way to go for professionals.

There is this great recipe book from Thomas Keller (Bouchon Bakery). He's American but with French training, he explained why cups are unreliable, especially with big quantities, imagine when one as to measure 3kilos of something with cups xD

	<TEXT> Real Pastry does not work with cups. Way too inaccurate.
Most liquids used in pastry are just measured in grams. 1 gram=1ml for water and most other hydro liquids.  Only oil weigh a little different. But for most recipe you make at home, the quantities are too small to really matter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No need to be harsh anyway, it never helped to communicate between Humans, especially concerning politics.

    I really encourage you to do your own research

Im trying. That's why I come to /r/The_Donald, I'm trying to understand your point of view without filters. I know about propaganda, it's scary to think that propaganda was already elaborated back then, it means that today, with all the technological advancement acquired throughout the century, propaganda is probably more elaborated that we can even think of.

I get info from a private French channel (TMC) owned by TF1 which is owned by Bouygues, therefore owned by the 1%. I can't trust them entirely.

I get info from Le Canard Enchaine too, newspaper owned by the journalists writing it and above all, ad free. I trust them 99% as they have been around for 100years and always managed to get the info that will stir up the political shit so hard that it gets often to court, they always win. Because they can actually prove that what they write is true facts only. I think they are leftist (BC extreme right/right/center hate them so much) but its hard to say since they attack every political party.

I read the English BBC, but yeah that s just the narrative as you call it.

To finish I get the rest myself from whatever comes. I love reddit for that, I can go to other subreddits with different opinion to and to /r/The_Donald in a few clicks to see how different opinions react to the same fact (true or fake).

With all of that plus documentaries I try to understand. It's not easy but very interesting. America has such a huge influence on the EU that even though Trump isnt my president, I can't just ignore it like most do over here "because tired of bad news".

I answer them "Put your head in a hole, go ahead, you will get fucked without knowing anything. It's called a rape. Personally I prefer to know so I can GTFO before"

    Stop sensationalizing shit.

I didn't want to, that is just the first thing coming to my mind when I see a Muslim supporting Trump. It just doesn't make sense, or OP is ultra moderate Muslim patriot like he eats bacon and drink beers, or he is blind. How many Muslim in Trump administration ?

In France we have a huge cultural problem with Muslim and its natural if they don't change their habits we surely won't change ours. I wish I had a Muslim friend, I mean I had good relationship with some of them but a real friend, nope.

Impossible as he would be bored as hell with us, alcohol, drugs and girls don't really match with the Coran. Same goes with wine, our famous butter and ham sandwich and so many other traditional french dishes. So we live apart, in the same country. If I go to some Muslim dominant country, I will have to respect their rules and tradition, even if I do that, I will never be completely integrated if I keep spreading my foreign culture everywhere I go.

That's why Le Pen-the-bitch is so high in the polls, because they are still not integrated even though its been like what, third generation now! Although many of them are, because they gave up on their religion like I did.

All of that to say, I don't understand OP, a French Muslim supporting Le Pen would mean he is not a Muslim anymore, but Atheist. OP proudly wrote he is Muslim.

EDIT: had to post again coz I linked subreddits that where not from the Trumpire... so I ve made a mistake, this isnt a place to debate, screaming I LOVE TRUMP is allowed. OK.

EDIT2: Sorry, just learned about "Brigading", reddit can be a nasty place. </TEXT>

Makes me think about those Jews that were supporting Hitler weeks before he started his purge.

Aaaand before you call me libtard I wanna say I wasn't supporting crooked Hillary. I'm not even American. I just love history and I don't want to see it repeating itself again. Very curious of what will happen to the US in the next 8 years.

Good luck mates I wish you the best anyway!

	<TEXT> You re so right. Moreover Hitler went through WW1 as a soldier. Who knows what he saw and lived in the trenches. Not looking for excuses as what he did is inexcusable but that probably didn't help him do to "the right thing" 

I believe we are all born neutral. Education and life experiences  are the factors that make us different. 


 Knowing that millions of human beings are born and live in unstable or undeveloped countries still today doesn't make me believe in a brighter future... </TEXT>
