	<TEXT> Researchers end up paying twice for many publications: once for publishing them and again for reading them. DEALs goal, he says, is to move away from subscription fees and toward a model in which the institutes pay a flat fee for article processing charges, so that all publications become fully open access.
The publisher rejects more transparent business models that are based on the publication service and would make publications more openly accessible. Its offer does not comply with the principles of Open Access. Despite its current **profit margin of 40 percent**, the publisher is still intent on pursuing even higher price increases. 

Fuck these publishers. They exploit researchers and leek of taxpayers money, while not providing any service of value and keeping the science that taxpayers payed twice behind paywalls.
The only thing they have is brand recognition of their journals which the individual researchers need for career progression, but does nothing for science in general.
All the while they generate a profit of 40%(!!), which basically no other industry has (maybe the cartells). Because they have exploit researcher they have almost no costs. 
In the interest of science these publishers have to change or to die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like their study, but I feel like they oversell their conclusions a bit. 

Jumping from this main result of their study:

And then, something happened which the team had not been expecting: right after the rules were changed, there was a second serotonin spike. According to the authors, this increase in the neurons' activity is exclusively due to the "surprise effect" brought about by the sudden reversal of the environmental conditions with which the mice are familiar - and not to any prediction of the outcome. "This spike only appears when the outcome is unexpected", says Sara Matias, "independently of the outcome being for better or for worse"

to this conclusion is quite a leap I believe:
"We think serotonin is not the happiness molecule", says Sara Matias. "It is the neural and behavioral flexibility molecule. It gives us the opportunity to change, but we still have to do something for that change to go in a positive direction. Maybe that's why SSRIs work much better when combined with behavioral psychotherapies than when used alone." 

Cognitive flexibility and its absence is normally associated with Dopamine and there is quite a lot of research about that, so I remain a bit more skeptical than the others, but nevertheless a very interesting study.

	<TEXT> A small point concerning the use of evidence. The article does mostly line out that there is no research either way. So it is not evidence that micro aggression do not exist, but just says there is an absence of research supporting the concept. 
Basically a call for more research before we engage in stuff like microaggression training programs. 

To quote the summary:
There is scant dispute that some individuals engage in subtle slights, insults, and snubs against minorities. Nevertheless, the boundaries of the microaggression concept require substantial clarification. At present, they appear to be sufficiently fluid and porous to allow a vast number of potential behaviors, many of which hinge on highly subjective retrospective judgments, to be classified as microaggressions. In addition, the decision about which behaviors to include under the vast microaggression umbrella has in some cases been influenced substantially by embedded political values that have not been adequately explicated. The MRP presumption that certain microaggressions are invariably or usually associated with widely shared implicit messages has yet to be investigated empirically; moreover, this presumption is at variance with large bodies of research and theorizing in social cognition and cognitive-behavioral therapy. The concept of unintentional microaggressions is oxymoronic, as it runs counter to traditional definitions of aggression. Furthermore, there is no evidence that microaggressions are statistically associated with aggression or prejudice in deliverers. Finally, the inclusion of microassaults within the expansive microaggression construct is conceptually dubious and requires further justification. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hab mal google scholar angeschmissen und bin hierdrber gestoen in JAMA:

Methoden:
After randomization, half of
the participants were informed that the drug had a regular price
of $2.50 per pill and half that the price had been discounted to
$0.10 per pill (no reason for the discount was mentioned). All
participants received identical placebo pills and were paid $30.

The protocol followed an established approach for studying
pain. Electrical shocks to the wrist were calibrated to each participants
pain tolerance. After calibration, participants received
the test shocks, rating the pain on a computerized visual analog
scale anchored by the labels no pain at all and the worst
pain imaginable. Participants received all possible shocks in
2.5-V increments between 0 V and their calibrated tolerance.
Stimulation at each intensity level was carried out twice foreach
participant (before and after taking the pill), and the change
in reaction to the stimulation was assessed.Visual analog scale
ratings were converted to a 100-point scale, the postpill score
for each voltage was subtracted fromthe prepill score, and the
mean of these differences was calculated for each participant.

Ergebnisse:
 In the regular-price group, 85.4%(95%confidence interval [CI],
74.6%-96.2%) of the participants experienced a mean pain reduction after taking the pill, vs 61.0% (95% CI, 46.1%-75.9%)
in the low-price (discounted) group (P=.02). Considering all voltages tested, pain reduction was greater for the regular-price pill (P.001). In addition, for 26 of 29 intensities (from 10 to 80 V), mean pain reduction was greater for the regular-price pill.

Diskussion:
These results are consistent with described phenomena of commercial variables affecting quality expectations
and expectations influencing therapeutic efficacy


Der Preis scheint also wirklich eine bedeutsame Rolle fr die Wirksamkeit von Placebos zu spielen. Kann die visuelle Analogskala als abhngige Variable nicht gut einschtzen, aber ein Unterschied von ber 20 % zwischen den Versuchsgruppen erscheint mir doch ziemlich massiv. 

Man beurteile die Studie selbst. Ist in einer der renommiertesten rzte Zeitschrift erschienen (laut wikipedia die weltweit am verbreiteste medizinische Fachzeitschrift) und nicht allzu kompliziert zu lesen (auch nur 2 Seiten):

	<TEXT> Smallholder farmers are key to local food security, but their productivity, or lack thereof, is buried when agricultural statistics are discussed at the scale of regions and nations. Household surveys are hampered by errors in self-reporting, and on-the-ground field surveys are constrained by limited personnel. Burke and Lobell combined high-resolution satellite imagery (at the scale of 1 m) with ground-truthed data to estimate yields from maize agriculture in western Kenya, where many of the fields are less than half an acre in size and irregularly shaped. Measurements of canopy greenness captured evidence of nutrient deficiencies. Productivity differed by as much as threefold even between neighboring plots, suggesting opportunities for yield improvement through changes in field management.

	<TEXT> But as the Dutch campaign ramped up, Wilders grew much more cautious about invoking the U.S. president. This was no coincidence: By mid-February, when the race in the Netherlands began, Trump had been in office for several weeks, and Dutch voters had gotten a chance to observe him as president. They didnt like what they saw. Its a hard start for Wildershes losing momentum, and this is partly because of Trump, pollster Gijs Rademaker told The Wall Street Journal. Among poll respondents who had backed the PVV in December but no longer did by February, 60 percent thought Trump was doing a bad job.

Wilderss caginess about Trump doesnt seem to have saved him; although PVV gained seats on Wednesday, it fell short of expectations, as well as his own prediction of a surprisingly strong result. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ###Submission Statement
Don't let the headline fool you. It is an insightful article. The GOP ran on conflicting attacks against the ACA. On the one hand the conservative idea that wealth redistribution is bad. And on the other hand that the ACA is bad because not enough people are covered, the deductibles are too high and it is just generally bad health insurance quality wise. It is logically impossible to reconcile those. This leads to the current half-baked compromise with which basically everyone is unhappy. But as the article shows, there is almost no other possible outcome, because of the conflicting platforms they ran on. 

A quote that exemplifies that:

If the idea behind Obamacare was to get everyone covered, said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on the January 8 episode of Face the Nation, thats one of the many failures. In addition to premiums going up, copayments going up, deductibles going up.

In other words, the Affordable Care Act had two big problems: Not enough people were covered by exchange plans, and the coverage they had was too skimpy.

Many Americans who actually did get insurance when they did not have it before have really bad insurance, McConnell continued, sounding like one of ACAs left-wing critics, and the deductibles are so high that its really not worth much to them.

-

The GOP has long had a variety of replacement plans floating around, which differ from one another in important ways. But they all cut taxes and reduce spending. They all end up covering fewer people, and they all end up delivering skimpier coverage to most of the people they do cover. In most cases, they do manage to jigger the costs and benefits around so that there is at least a subset of the population  young, healthy, non-poor people  who end up better off.  </TEXT>
