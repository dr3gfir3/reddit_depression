	<TEXT> (Thank you for the amazing comments so far. Tomorrow, my grandmother argues with dead Cousin Dave, but today I wanted to warn you against wandering spirits.)




**Theres a woman in the barn. She isnt alive.**

There was another lady of no relation to me that had secrets of her own. (To be fair, Ive seldom met a woman who isnt magic in some form, but thats just the way of it.) This one lived next door in an old style ranch home with a wraparound porch. She tended chickens, had a large barn, and her acreage connected to ours in the woods. Her name was Shirley, a light worker with the most legendary pound cake recipe Ive ever tasted. There was power in her lemon glaze.

Her husband died many years before I met her, but it didnt stop him from visiting on occasion. He liked the smell of her cooking. It always brought him back, sometimes to the rocker just outside the kitchen window, and sometimes to the dining table, the chair settling under his invisible weight.

Shirley taught me how to help anyone that asked, dead or alive, and how to bake the best pecan pie youve ever tasted. Despite the work Id done with Shirley, and whatever help Id given the dead, it still unnerved me a bit to actually see a spirit whole. I was not ready to help them on my own.

Each person capable sees spirits differently. Usually they float in the corner of my vision, unclear. I speak to them, and they reply in emotions, images, and sometimes smells. I rarely get to choose how they appear. Now that Im older, I have requests, which most will follow, such as: No frightening me, or my houseguests, no messing with the dogs, and no hiding in the corners. It works out most of the time.

But I explain this, to prove that its not normal for a spirit to appear whole to me. I have never by choice opened my third eye to see them. Even young as I was, at fourteen, this barn lady should not have been able to get through my shields to be seen.

But she did.

Heres the one rule with spirits. If you cant or wont help, dont acknowledge them. If you arent trained to recognize good or bad beings, and you give one attention, youre going to deal with the consequences, like it or not.

I screw up a lot.

My bedroom window faced Miss Shirleys barn. And the hay door to the second floor loft where the ghostly woman stood perfectly framed was in sight while I lie in bed. Confused, sleepy, and not thinking, I peered out the window that night, through the open blinds, and from across the distance our gazes met. 

She flashed to my window, peering in. Long red hair, washed out in the moonlight, paper pale skin, and a gown out of style for decades, didnt help hide the fact that she was dead. Of course, twin black caves where her eyes should have sat didnt help either. It looked like someone had scooped out the muscle, jelly, and everything else in the eye socket and left it empty. I looked straight into her skull.

That only confirmed that I saw her. She entered my room and pressed herself against my bed edge, peering down. I did not move, only continued staring out the window. From my peripheral, I watched her jaw move, but heard no words.

Her presence explained my non-working nightlight from earlier that evening. The trend of the bulb blowing out on nights I would have visits became an early warning system for me. (Fourteen and still sleeping with a nightlight? I know, but if you had visitors like I did)

I found sleep eventually by turning my back to her, and facing the wall. In the morning, I rolled over and found her still in position. As I prepared for the day, she followed me through the house.

Have you ever showered with a ghost? Its awkward.

Mom wouldnt let me run to Miss Shirleys until late morning, and as I couldnt explain to her why I needed to go visit immediately without giving the spirit more attention, I reluctantly sat at the kitchen table, eating breakfast while pointedly ignoring the woman staring at my face from three inches away, if anything with eyeless sockets can stare.

Eventually through our kitchen windows, Shirley made an appearance, throwing grain and gravel bits about in her chicken coop, and Mom let me dart over.

I didnt need to explain to Miss Shirley. She saw the lady trailing behind me, and welcomed me into her own kitchen. No one gets past Shirleys defenses, maintained by her late husband, so the woman remained outside on the porch, pressing her face to the window.

Shirley placed a pan on the stove top, dropped some butter in, and counted to three. With a small groan, the dining table chair shifted, and her husbands cologne floated through the kitchen.

Whats she want, Harold? she asked the air. The answer came in a series of images, a donkey in the woods, laid up in a thorn thicket, sides heaving. Shirley removed the butter from the heat.

So thats where Josie got to, she muttered. Whats the lady want in return? she asked Harold. New images, the barn, a sleeping donkey. Shirley shrugged, and asked Harold if hed mind a new farm ghost. Apparently, he didnt.

Ill save the words, and tell you that we found the donkey a half mile out in the woods. She gone to drop her foal, after escaping the barn. Shirley cursed as she cut Josie free of the bramble, and led mother and child back to a dry bed of hay. Shirley gained a new barn ghost that day, and the lady became a normal part of my visits. I still cant explain the eyes, though. She never talked about it.

The point is, sometimes ghosts want nothing more than to help.

My house ghost, Quincy, helps by reminding me when Ive left the iron plugged in or forgotten a bill. He keeps out curious sprites, and teases the dog. Hes harmless. Easily pissed off, but harmless.

But not all are, and as we drift closer to Halloween, as the veil thins, theres a great chance youll come across something not so benevolent. Carry white sage, or clover, or even dried beans in your pockets. Dont invite anything in. And dont answer a door more than once, if nothing was there the first time.

Ive made enough mistakes in my dealings for everyone. While the story above ended well enough, it doesnt nail home the warning that the other realm isnt something to mess with. So lets fix that.

The same woods we found Josie in, connects with my dads five acres of trees. Shirley had another three or so, making it one giant playground for a child.

I had that land memorized, spending a grand majority of my free days walking it with Pebbles, the cat. That great purring, drooling beast usually joined me for the first twenty minutes or so, before shed find something more interesting to do than trudging through underbrush and dart off.

This day though, after a long night of rain storms, she stayed by my side much longer than I expected, given the wet leaves and mud.

Wed just reached the first in a series of gentle slopes down to a usually dry creek bed, when I saw something strange: A little girl playing among the trees.

I called out, but she didnt turn. Slowly, Pebbles and I made our way forward, the grey cat darting back and forth between my path. I looked down to watch my step, and made it about twenty more feet before glancing up. The girl had moved to the far side of the creek, still playing with something in the muck. I called out again, but she didnt look up.
Something felt off, but so far Id lived through all my adventures, and thought myself invincible.

I continued down the slope to the creek bed. The rainfall from the night before had filled it slightly, and the water rushed past, maybe a couple of feet high. The girl remained just across the water. I called out again, and this time she responded.

She stood from her crouch, looking down with her hair over her face. Her dress seemed too clean for playing in the mud, her shoes and socks too dry. That she was alone and so young didnt phase me as Id been running amok in these woods for many years on my own. But the cleanliness and her reluctance to answer raised the hairs on my arms.

I took a step back, prepared to run when Pebbles yowled. She jumped in my arms unexpectedly, and I nearly didnt catch her. She latched onto me through my flannel jacket, and yowled again.

I backed up farther, not turning my back on whatever stood before me, and tripped over a tree root. Pebbles didnt appreciate falling. She kicked free, landed lightly, and dashed into the underbrush.

I knocked the air from my lungs as my back hit the ground, and lay there dazed. The girl appeared above me.

Except it wasnt a girl anymore. Her mouth stretched the length of her face and needle-thin fangs slid from behind her lips.

I screamed.

Her smile widened, and the forest grew dark. My vision held only her, and I wondered what being eaten felt like.

A grey fluffy blur launched itself over me and into the monster. Together the two flew backwards and into the creek bed. A splash from out of sight, and then a very angry Pebbles reappeared crawling up the bank and onto mostly dry ground. The poor cat was soaked.

I offered to carry her, but she huffed water, shook what she could from her coat and stalked off towards the house. I thought it best to follow.

Running water cleanses anything. Simple, and proven effective, though Pebbles didnt appreciate learning it firsthand.

Take what you will from this, but be safe this October. If youre going to traverse the woods, take an animal friend; Theyre smarter than you. Stay to the path, and dont chase strangers. Dont acknowledge anything you cant help. 

[And for the love of life, dont make eye contact.](http://fb.com/subject3600writing)

**Things My Grandmother Taught Me**

My grandmother always said if theyre polite enough to knock, then they deserve your answer. She changed her mind after Death came to dinner.

What Ive seen from taking her advice has shaped my life and my own workings. It also explains why I answered the damn door.

Around my eleventh birthday, after many years of cooking subtle magics and sweeping ghosts out of the corners of my grandmothers home, someone knocked.

My family was gathered for Sunday Supper once more, a tradition we kept long past its welcome. The house felt a little more crowded than normal, with the addition of my new Aunt Brenda, and her daughter. My grandmother had also been taking care of her sickly sister for a year or two at this point, but Grand Aunt Esther tended to spend a large portion of her time in the hospital-style bed in the living room, where she could watch her soaps, fragile fingers cranking up the volume of Days of our Lives, when the noise in the house became too loud.

I handed Esther her supper plate, stretching my arms over the side bars of her bed. She clicked off the tv before looking at me. You know how some women age so gracefully that you can see the beauty from decades before? That wasnt Grand Aunt Esther. The woman was terrifying. Her eyes drooped, milky and cataract-filled. Her lips were constantly chapped, and her nails were yellow. Her white hair had grown so thin I could see her veiny scalp. Coming up on her in the dark was worse than a horror movie. She looked like a Cattawail, the Southern version of a Banshee. She screeched like one, too.

As Aunt Esther took her plate, she peered at me, and said, Get the door. Shes here to talk to me.

I retreated quickly, ignoring her nonsense. I was about to remove my apron and carry the mashed potatoes to the dining table when I heard it. Three quiet taps on the side door, just off the kitchen. Figuring it was a family member running late, I answered it. No one was there.

Did you get that door? Esther shrieked from the living room. My grandmother bustled into sight, curious what was taking me so long to bring the potatoes to the table. 

Door? she called back to her sister. I didnt hear anyone knocking.

Yeah, Mamaw, but theres no one there. I said, looking over my shoulder at my grandmother, as I shut the door.

There came another knocking, three quick taps. 

Let that woman in! Esther hollered from the living room.

I moved to open the door again, but my grandmother stopped me. 
How many knocks the first time? she asked.

Uh, three. I think.

My grandmother stood straighter. Dont open it.

She come in? Shes here to talk to me! Esther yelled out again. 
Before we could respond, Esther continued. Her wings aint gon fit through that door, though. Shouldve left them at home.

Wings? I asked. My grandmother shushed me.

Another knock on the door, three thumps. I flinched.

The knocking grew louder, persistent. They happened in threes, but the knocking became thudding, and then banging. The door shook.

What the hell is going on? my dad asked, walking out of the dining room. Is someone there?

My grandmother shook her head, shushing him, too. Esther continued yelling about her guest from the living room. The front door fell silent.

From the back door, someone else knocked, three taps. Brenda stood from the table and moved towards it.

Stop! my grandmother ordered.

Brenda paused. Why? Who is it?

The devil, came the whispered answer.

Brenda laughed, but at the serious look she received from my father, she stopped quickly. You think the devil is on your porch?

Devil knocks three times. So does Death. Open that door and theyll claim one of us.

The front door knocking started up again. The back door grew louder. Both started to shake. Angry at being ignored, tapping started at the windows, and then banging. The glass shook in the frame. I glanced around, and swore I saw giant eyes peering in at us.

My grandmother hurried into the kitchen, returning quickly with a bottle of white vinegar and a scoop of salt. As good as holy water, she promised, pouring the salt into the bottle, and swirling it around to mix.

Get under the table, she told me. I followed the command, pulling Brendas daughter with me, too. Children have no business with Death.

My grandmother pushed the curtain next to the door aside. Through the glass, she watched a shape form on the porch. Wings of black feathers unfurled from a body of shadow. A womans face became clear, red lips and black eyes, crying dark tears. She beckoned.

Death it is, my grandmother muttered.

Let her in, Esther yelled once more. Or Ill do it myself.

My dad went to stand guard, in case Esther followed through with her threat.

The banging grew louder against every entrance the house had, barely any pause between the three jolts. The doors bent under the force, the jambs groaning. The woman appeared then, in every glass surface, her face filling the windows. My grandmother dropped the curtain, backing up with a jump. A hurricane kicked up outside, and I watched as the window womans mouth dropped open. She howled with the wind. Her tears fell heavy.
The mirror above the fireplace cracked first, and then shattered, the shards flying over the dinner table, ruining our meal.

I crawled between the legs of a chair to better see, and sliced my hand on the glittering floor. My grandmother saw and cursed at the same time the kitchen door exploded inwards, and every lightbulb in the house burned out with a snap.

Death stood in the entrance, wings bleeding shadow off their pinions. Her lipstick nearly glowed in the sudden dark. The wet pools of ink where her eyes should have been searched the room. She smelled the blood. But as she tried to step forward there was a ripple in the doorway. With a hiss, she jerked back.

The bundle of herbs above the threshold caught fire, and fell from the nail holding it in place. Long pale fingers wrapped around the door jamb, the claws digging into the sheetrock and wood, which withered under her touch. Death entered, stepping over the ash of the herb bundle.

My grandmother stood firm. Get out of my house.

Death laughing is not a sound youll ever hear happily. Its a cacophony somewhere between bones crunching into dust from time passing and the snuffed out cries of a baby born still. But laugh she did, the winged creature with black tears and long claws.

When the mirth dried up, she aimed her dark gaze around the room, and spoke with a voice of gravel against sand. Wheres Esther? Death cocked her head to the side and smiled, white teeth bright against the darkened room.

My grandmother is no preacher, no devout lady of the lord. She attended church on Sunday when the roads were dry, prayed for rain or sun, and knew her folklore. Somewhere in her studies, she took to heart that salt and vinegar can banish near about anything you dont want around.

As Death leaned in for her, my grandmother splashed her holy mix right into that demons black eyes. But as she pulled her hands back, Death grabbed at my grandmother, and I knew enough to be afraid.

Remember how I said I didnt think much before acting, getting myself into all kinds of shit because of it? I think this tops all.

I scrambled out from my hiding place, my hand bleeding into the cracks of the pine floor. Stop! Dont take her! I screamed.

The demon grinned, and I realized this was its plan all along. Dont make deals with anything you dont understand, my grandmother had taught me, no matter what wall your back is against. In the next moment, I disregarded all advice shed ever given.

What will you give? the winged woman asked me.

A year, I vowed.

Five, it bargained.

Three, I promised. It considered, and nodded, letting my grandmother go.

The creature swooped towards me, snatching my wrist and licking the blood from my sliced hand. I met its eyes in that quick moment, and it was a glimpse into eternity. Ill never be able to explain exactly what I saw. An eleven year old mind protects itself. A magically inclined one even more so. But in those depths, hell peered out.

With a smile, she flew into the living room, a heavy wind knocking us all back. Esther screeched one last time, and then Death was gone, with two bounties, instead of the one it came for.

I had screwed up.

It took a long evening to clean up the glass and ruined food, to replace every bulb in the house, and then to wrap Esther in a sheet and make a call to have her body picked up. In death, her mouth and eyes gaped, jaw falling off-kilter. If I thought a glimpse of hell was scary, it was nothing compared to dead Aunt Esther.

My grandmother plucked mirror bits out of my hand, and wrapped the cut in soft bandages. It wouldnt need stitches. 

Whatd I do? I asked her.

You know right well what you did, she replied. 

Whats it mean? I rephrased.

She gets three years. Maybe at the end of your life, maybe whenever shes damned well pleased to take it. Not much we can do now. She leveled her eyes with mine, as she tucked the bandage end into place. Girl, dont you ever try to save me again. Death is gentle and quiet until it wants something. It only came knocking because it knew itd get something extra out of us. Next time it knocks, dont you dare answer.

I nodded.

Brenda, her daughter, and my uncle didnt hang around. It was a long time before they came back for a Sunday meal.

We never spoke much of that night again, other than my grandmother doling out advice for demon dealings and making sure I knew not to make an oath by blood. Blood work binding is dangerous stuff, and Ill never recommend it, no matter how strong the resulting bond is.

I tell this story now, in whole for the first time, because lately my windows have grown dark, and someone is looking in. Her eyes are black, her lips red, and she beckons.

Three years. She gets three years.
