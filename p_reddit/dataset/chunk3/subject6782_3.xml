	<TITLE> Keyboard lag after 5.0 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-26 23:55:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm experiencing absolutely awful keyboard lag after the recent update. I find it difficult to type anything and the actual typed text takes what seems like an eternity to actually show up on screen. The vibration while typing is also delayed, and the auto correct seems to be almost non existent too. Getting a word wrong is like death and means that half the message will get deleted even though I would just tap the backspace. The phone is otherwise ok, and I'm not experiencing any other issues, such as battery problems that appear to be common. The phone was also fine before the update, it's just the keyboard that is awful. Is there any way to fix this without reverting to factory?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're right, the site shouldn't stray far from it's core purpose as that's why it is (relatively) popular. I'm still assuming that the more 'casual' users populate the majority. 

What about a default 'lite' UI with the current features (or maybe even less?) and an 'advanced' UI option with a more complicated set of features (that is assuming that you do actually intend on adding 'more' instead of enhancing what is there currently). I'm not really sure of the implications of this but just some food for thought I suppose. Just depends on your vision for the site.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not sure of the feasibility of implementing these features into the site, but they might be good for some inspiration at least. 

1. An ability to lock the window onto any part of the song. It is rather annoying when working on the very end of a very long piece and having the window attempt to scroll back to the start. Having the window auto-scroll with the play bar also takes a toll on the playback speed. 

2. Ability to select only certain instruments. The current selection tool is simple and easy to use and I think should remain, but it would be nice if it allowed you to select only instruments of your choice. In conjunction with this, a way to replace these selected instruments with others. 

3. In addition to the copy/paste function, a clipboard to store maybe the last few things you copied. The current copy/paste method relies on dragging and dropping, and does not work correctly when moving large sections of a piece. It could be placed in the free space in the side bar [here with the same layout as the links above.](http://i.gyazo.com/7d8652f7c9f04753964c2e62cacd124f.png)

4. Viewable statistics of a sequence. Eg. amount of notes, time length. Not really necessary but would be neat.
