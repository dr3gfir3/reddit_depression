	<TEXT> Better than 2015 but still seems like every phone has some kind of flaw that is preventing me from being interested in it.  
Moto Z doesn't have a headphone jack.  
LG seems to be problematic and the V20 seems too tall.  
Pixel just seems very boring.  
Samsung still has Touchwiz lag on Snapdragon models.  
I'm on Verizon so the $400 phones are out.  
Moto Z Play has low screen res, terrible design, and probably isn't going to get much support.  
Honestly the Note 7 seemed like it would've been the perfect phone, very upset over what happened with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My battery used to be great on my Note 4, as in I would end every day around 50%. For about the past six months, however, I was barely making it through most days with the same amount of usage. The other day I decided to delete the Facebook app after hearing it was a battery hog and now I'm ending the day around 50% again and am losing 10% battery with 40 min of SoT, very good decision! </TEXT>

How can I get 3rd party music players to recognize these songs? I have a lot of them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only way I found to turn it off is to disable multi-windows all together. There's a settings section for Multi-Window, and then just turn it off from there. Also Good Lock probably is never going to have that bug fixed being that the Note 4 technically doesn't support Good Lock. I've heard downgrading to 24.10 fixes the bug without losing too many of the other Good Lock features. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can You Change the Notification Shade Without Rooting? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm really not a fan of the default notification shade (particularly the colors). I've been using Good Lock for a while now but I would like to explore some more options. A lot of custom notification shades are available for rooted devices, but the fact that Good Lock works while unrooted is giving me the idea that the device does not have to be rooted to modify the notification shade. If this is possible, are there any apps or apks you guys would recommend? </TEXT>
