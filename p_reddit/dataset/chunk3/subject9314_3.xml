	<TEXT> I am 40-something English guy in London. I have just been at my local pub. There is a pokestop about 30 meters away. I am a new player, only level 3.  I am not at all serious about it, and am entertained by new discoveries. I found an egg at the pokestop, and was able to use some incense to attract a clefairy which I captured. 

In summary, I think its important to have a quick look at a game which is obviously so significant globally. To not play it at all just seems to be missing out on essential education to me.

Anyway, one of my drinking buddies said at the end of the evening that he had found my comments about the game to be very boring and antisocial. and he said I act the same way about football. (that I object to others taking about football - I am pretty sure I don't, though I don't find football interesting on the whole)

I feel quite taken aback. It all seems like harmless fun to me but obviously this guy was heavily against it. In the same evening another guy was teased for having a book, that he was reading. That seems relevant somehow.

How are you finding it guys? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am wondering which to try out. Sainsbury's, Tesco, Ocado etc?

I used Tesco a few years ago, but was annoyed by the massive number of carrier-bags they would use. They used one bag per aisle, or something. Frequently a bag would contain only one item.

Anyway, enough moaning. I imagine they must have stopped that since the 5p law?

What I would really like would be to have an intelligent weekly shopping-list, and a regular weekly delivery time that I could get used to. It I build up a stockpile of something, I'd suppress that item that week. Other, non-perishable things which last longer than a week (eg cleaning products) would occur in the list less frequently, but based on my historical usage. 

Of course I'd be able to order extra items any week, on my phone, on the run. It would be good if they could offer some variety-items too, such as ready-meals of random types, taking account of my likes and dislikes, and allergies or other requirements.

Do any of them do this type of thing, or are they still all incorrigibly shit? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am thinking of something to replicate a random coin-toss, so the coin should flip over several times before landing. It could operate in a vacuum chamber, or in a controlled atmosphere, as that could reduce unpredictable variables. The device should simply throw the coin in a suitably consistent manner to get the same result every time.

Is this simply too exacting in engineering tolerances to be possible? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can you help? What's the earliest documented use of the word atheism to mean lack of belief in, rather than denial of gods? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-15 22:10:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have recently had a few conversations with theists who have claimed that there is no justification in using atheism in that way, despite it appearing in many dictionary definitions. 
One felt that there is a deliberate plan by 'internet atheists' to change the definition of atheism, to include the agnostic people, and thus to artificially inflate the number of atheists. 

I find that the earliest uses of the word in English (16th century) do seem to imply denial of gods. The oldest sources in the OED do, though the very early origins of the word in Greek seem to start with lack of belief but pick up an implication of denial later. However I am interested in the English usage.  

Anyway, what are the earliest written examples in English of the lack-of-belief definition?

I found George H Smith's [*The Case Against God*](http://www.amazon.com/Atheism-Case-Against-Skeptics-Bookshelf/dp/087975124X/ref=la_B000APQXRY_1_1?s=books ie=UTF8 qid=1460748534 sr=1-1) published in 1979 takes that stance, according to [this irritated reviewer.](http://tektonics.org/qt/smithg01.php)

Any earlier? TH Huxley in 1889 seemed so sure of the denial definition only, that he coined the word ['agnostic'](http://atheism.about.com/od/aboutagnosticism/a/huxley.htm) as an alternative. He was a highly educated man, and I think if the lack-of-belief definition was current then, he would have mentioned it.

Lets see if we can have this thread without anyone posting about how atheism is about belief and agnosticism about knowledge...

So, any advance on 1979?

Edit: lots of comments about the value of the matter, not so many early examples of the usage. I have Bertie Russell and Robert Green Ingersoll to check. Any more?

	<DATE> 2016-04-10 00:10:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in London, where the average road speed is 11mph. The speed limit in some areas is 20mph, and is 30mph as standard (some multi-lane roads are faster).

I wonder why they don't just paint a line down the middle of the lane that autonomous cars can follow? Or something detectable by the car could be buried in the road. Traffic lights could use short-range radio to signal when to stop. Cars could proceed at 20mph on the designated lanes and have radar or ultrasound scanners to detect obstacles, and just stop when any are detected. It would use GPS to navigate, perhaps with RFID devices at forks in the guidance line, to identify the location. The map of lines would be constantly updated by the government when work is required on roads etc. (don't laugh the [TFL website](https://tfl.gov.uk/) and API is really good).

These types of vehicles would need to have the driver there as backup. The driver would go around obstacles, would join the automated line and hand over to the autonomous system . The human driver would start the journey, and park at the end. Perhaps they could doze while moving, and the vehicle sound an alarm to alert them when needed.

I wonder why none of this type of thing seems on Google's mind? They are making it hard for themselves by trying to build a totally autonomous system from the beginning. The type of system I am thinking of would be a relatively cheap add-on to cars. </TEXT>
