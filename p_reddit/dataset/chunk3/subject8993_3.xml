	<TEXT> Um I would ignore the other post in this thread. 

Your deposit got reduced to $125 BECAUSE you brought your device. As you stated, you were ineligible for device payment based on credit so for postpaid that means you would have a "$400" deposit and then have to pay full retail. When you pay full retail (or BYOD as you did) the deposit is reduced to $125.


After 6 months that will be reevaluated. Pay your bill on time/early every month and you will have a decent chance to finance in 6 months.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah just go to a store so they can explain it. 

Basically, you're not on a contract plan. The plan you are on is the amount of data, minutes, texts etc that you have. 

How you pay for your device is separate. There are no more 2 year contracts. The only way to upgrade is via device installments. Depending on your service plan your line fee may or may not change (it probably will go down assuming you're on a modern plan)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you called asurion and asked...? 

I'd be surprised if they don't have a Droid Maxx 2 it's not even 2 years old they just aren't making new ones. 

Otherwise, they will offer you different devices and you can decide if you want one or not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I very rarely downvote anything you post since it usually is accurate. It's just frustrating to read threads when the conversation bounces around 4 or 5 sub threads and I read the same post from you in each one. 

I have no problem with you referring people to other retail locations when there are good deals there. I don't because I'm not going to scour the deals at those locations on a daily basis so I only speak to what I know which is corporate Verizon.  </TEXT>
