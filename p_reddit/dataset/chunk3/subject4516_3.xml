	<TEXT> I had the same experience going to see "Sisters" with my sister. That movie was full of great jokes and drug use, sexual connotations and really foul language. There were two mothers who brought their kids to see it. At some points the youngest kid was crying. Parents need to take some responsibility and understand their kids brains aren't fully developed and that they haven't had the life experience to actually get this type of film.

In comparison when I saw Deadpool there was an elderly couple siting in front of us and they laughed and laughed. The woman was particularly tickled by the face sitting joke. 

It's an adult movie. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time I was at a pub playing pool with my BF at the time and a friend I had recently met, a gay guy who worked as a prison guard. Now this guy was just a real salt of the earth, great guy. Like if I was in prison I would want him to be watching me, he had morals and scruples. He was also built like a brick shit house.

So these two suits show up, and proceed to get drunk and play us at doubles pool. After a few games and they still weren't winning they decided to give up and move on. I was like, "Seeya guys, better luck next time" to which one of them replied, "Nice tits, shame about your fat arse" 

My mate, grabbed him by the collar and held him off the floor against the wall and told him to "Never, ever speak to a woman in such a disgraceful way" and that women are not prices of meat strewn about for their consumption. They hightailed it out of there. It was glorious to watch. When I told him he didn't need to do that, he said yes, he did have to do that, because he had sisters and a mother he loved and respected. He was a great guy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! The delightful sensation of fully letting go and orgasming while holding on is exquisite torture, then going afterwards is another great experience. I also squirt, but I can hold my bladder while I cum, if that makes sense? But to answer your question, I think I discovered it very early on, when I was still a virgin. I've told my husband and a couple of close GFs, one or two of them said they also do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All those down votes because people think they are doctors and diagnosed you with a yeast infection or UTI?? Silly people. 

It's desire. That beautiful itchy, sexy feeling. It is only desire. There is a definite difference between having thrush or a UTI and desiring penetration. Although one could be described as an itch or burning, the other would be an ache, yearning, itchy feeling. You know your own body, you decide. Good luck and enjoy your sexuality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It'll get even better, I promise. I'm in my 30s now so I've had tons of practice. Everyone is different, but I find that fantasising is an essential part of lovemaking both solo and with a partner. I write down my little stories and I think that's what gets me there. I still mainly use a vibe to masturbate, but I feel like the imagination stuff makes everything more intense. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, if anything, each time I try it I perfect it. My orgasms have always been quite intense, when I lost my virginity I couldn't even move for a couple of minutes, but they are definitely improving with age.

I definitely fantasise a lot, and that helps up the intensity and excitement that leads to those mind blowing orgasms. I still find it a lot more difficult to come from rubbing myself as opposed to using a vibe, having my husband help out or PIV, but the more I do it the better I'm getting at it. It's still pretty intense every time. I thought that OMGyes was a really good resource.

Edit: I just thought I'd add, I masturbate a lot compared to my female friends. I feel like I have a much higher libido than most women. I'm not sure if that would affect orgasm intensity? </TEXT>

After watching the OMGyes videos I set out to teach myself and shortly afterwards had my first orgasm solo from just clit stimulation. It was intense man. I think I hyperventilated because I saw stars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I want to comment again, just to say how beautiful an orgasm is when only from nipple/breast play! Particularly when your counterpart is obsessed with the boobs. Just be so in love with the breast, and use your gorgeous big hands and mouth to caress and love the boobies. It's the most intense pleasure for a person who has sensitive breasts. Get in there! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The seam underneath the breast, where your breast meets your chest is an incredibly sensitive place, but is so often forgotten in breast play. Run your fingers so lightly and tenderly along this place while sucking deeply and gently on the nipple.

And also being held from behind and both breast in his hands, stimulating both nipples at the same time whilst being held tightly and him grinding against me.

The best is those tender touches, often first thing in the morning. To see a huge man's hand cupping and tickling your breast so gently, and to feel it, it's heaven and I can cum that way easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess the first time you screwed up was lying about watching porn, why should you have to lie about that?
It seems to me like she is overreacting to the porn, I'm a woman and I watch porn, I don't have a problem with a lot of it as long as it isn't degrading to the people performing.

But I think this is the tip of the iceberg, if she feels that you don't make her feel beautiful or desired then catching you watching porn would be a bit of a slap in the face to her. As if you would prefer to fantasise about other women than live out your fantasies with her and make her fantasies come true. Not to mention you pretty much lied to her (although I get why you would have its a pretty personal thing) I guess you may have a bit of work to do there, but she might need to as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like what you're asking here is how to get used to the idea of the act, and the way you brought up escorts, makes me think that your views of sex are really impersonal. As if penetration is the be all and end all of sex and the o my thing that's worth doing. But the thing is that it's not at all about the act itself, when you are in love or incredibly attracted to someone, you don't need to "get used to the idea" of penetrative sex with them, you desire them, you desire their company, their voice, their conversation and intelligence, the way they walk and carry themselves, the funny way they laugh or awkwardly snort. You desire them so much that everything else falls away until there is nothing but the desire to be with them, to hold them and feel their skin on yours, to touch the places that they let nobody else touch, to make them sigh and giggle and moan and then finally to be penetrated or engulfed by them. We are so much more than just walking genitals. If you overthink things, it will be terrible and awkward and unenjoyable, but if you live in the moment and allow yourself to let go, relax and enjoy the intimacy of another person's company it will all just happen, naturally, the way it is supposed to with your lover.

I get why you feel that you would just talk with an escort if you paid for one, because that is the more important part of sexuality, the talking, the connecting and the fantasising. My advice would be to stop focussing on the act itself and thinking of women as vaginas with bodies attached and just get to know some great people, eventually you will
meet a person that you click with on an intellectual level, and everything else will follow. </TEXT>

I'm on the sensitive side, I love to be caressed gently, then firmly, pinch the nipples and then soothe them. Kiss her neck and chest, nibble her ears and then kiss down the breast to take her nipple in your mouth and suck, deeply, but not hard, don't give her a nipple hickey. Bite her nipple gently. Take both breasts in your hands and push your face between them and just breathe. Alternate with kissing her neck or fingering her at the same time. You might just make her cum. </TEXT>

Cause my orgasms are definitely not like sneezes, if they were I'd have to go lay down for five minutes every time I sneezed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep, you're right, I was being a bit simplistic due to being drunk. But what I meant was that the potential to be either sex is there until the gonadal tissue descends and forms testes or stays and forms ovaries then all the rest follows. I guess that as this is the case, perhaps the skenes gland and prostate started off the same way as well?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah sorry, my comment above was a little simplistic due to being drunk, but yes as the foetus starts off with the potential to be both genders, the gonadal tissue turns into ovaries in a female and testes in a male, so it may also be that the skenes gland and prostate are similar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm just going to say that recognising behavioural changes in animals that are indicative of ill health is really difficult most of the time. Even in animals like dogs and cats. Chances are that even if you were not busy with looking after other humans you may not have recognised that your dragon was ill until the time when you did anyway. 

Many reptiles owners may not have even noticed at all, you did good, don't punish yourself. </TEXT>

Also I'm one of those ladies whose clit isn't painfully sensitive yet I'm still multi orgasmic. Cue some fun times. Very fun times. For both of us. Mmmm. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're being down voted, but it's actually not terrible advice. I was in the UK recently and my friend told me how she went to a tanning salon to survive the winter. I baulked at it too but she then told me that tanning salons now have maximum times you can spend on a sunbed per day, like 10mins-15mins was the max. I live underneath a big hole in the ozone layer so I totally limit the time I'm out of doors, and it's recommended to not spend more than 10-15mins in the full sun, but even by default and in winter I always get a big dose of vitamin d per day, thus I absorb calcium better, my mood is great etc. I think if you have no other way to get it and you're safe about it, a sunbed could be a good alternative. There are of course supplements. But they aren't quite as effective as the real thing.

Edit: just to say that of course you should probably take all the regular precautions i.e. Wear a high SPF sunscreen when using tanning beds </TEXT>
