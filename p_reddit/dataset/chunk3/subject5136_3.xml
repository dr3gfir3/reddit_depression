	<TEXT> Well that's good at least.

If the markets are rational, they should have priced in the supply announcement tomorrow.  Which means that even if it's a huge injection, if it didn't beat the analysts expectations, it likely won't drop.  

I personally don't think the fundamentals have changed enough for a sustained rally, but also haven't traded oil in a while because it's unforgiving.  Good luck.

[Energy is heavy on the short side right now, check out the reports.](http://www.cftc.gov/MARKETREPORTS/COMMITMENTSOFTRADERS/INDEX.HTM) Another short squeeze and margin maintenance could certainly cause another spike.

I agree that the fundamentals haven't changed that much since last week.  All the announcements of Capex decreases and rig droppings won't have substantial effect for a little bit, but the markets are about anticipation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  This is what I'm asking how you measure that?

I think entrepreneurship is a pretty solid measure, and South Korea typically ranks pretty low by global measures [like here,](http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2007/06/01/100049637/index.htm?postversion=2007060109) or [28th in GEDI](http://thegedi.org/countries), or [total early state entrepreneurs](http://www.gemconsortium.org/visualizations).

I also think that the top 30 Chaebols accounting for 80% of total S Korean GDP and have a huge amount of the population working for them is a pretty good measurement.  How would you?  Standardized tests as OP suggests?

And again, this all stemmed because OP called Korea's compulsory, publicly funded education system "free market," of which I asked for clarity.

I think extortion is a more accurate term.

You can think of it however the fuck you want, but when direct ballot initiatives for tax increases pass, there are a ton of people who don't agree.  When you spout that garbage you scare away people who might be swayed toward libertarian thought.  So if you aim is to circlejerk with a bunch of philosophizing fedoras, please continue.  But this kind of rhetoric will keep the libertarian movement a joke.

And I read your article, is it a parody?  You are saying in a privatized education system, the ones who can afford it would get filet mignon education, while the poor would get big macs.  I hope you are joking. And comparing retail to education, with complete different cost structures and end goals, is a terrible analogy.  Seriously, you should take that down, or at least don't ever show it to anyone who wants real ideas about how a privatized system would work.

Again, I'm not arguing for public education.  I'm simply saying that the arguments in this thread are written in the manner of a high schooler who just took his or her first introductory econ class. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  How do you quantify that? By "our" do you mean the US or someplace else? Even giving you that the difference you claim exists, can that difference be necessarily attributed to the difference in schools or might culture play a equal/larger role?

I'm not arguing for public education, I'm saying that OP is arguing that the compulsory, publicly funded education system in Korea which produces highly rigid but not free thinking students is "free market" and better than our system because standardized math and science testing says so.

You've got the burden on the wrong side.

I was responding to this:

If the free market can successfully sell society refrigerators or washing machines, couldn't they do the same with education? This is why arguments that say 'free market education would be too expensive' fail.

There are plenty of arguments out there against privatizing education, of which, again, I am not arguing.  I'm simply saying OP is responding to exactly zero of those arguments out there.  People come here looking for free market solutions to our bloated government and failing systems, and they see this, written like a junior in high school who just read his first Ron Paul article.

So sick of this garbage rhetoric, it causes so much damage to the libertarian movement.  So funny when I see the *it's finally happening* threads filled with the taxation is literally armed robbery bullshit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because they haven't looked into the free market education of South Korea

Um.....  Please explain this "free market" education a little more.

You mention: 

The key to free market education is entrepreneurship.

Like the Korean education system is notorious for?  Working for a Chaebol is entrepreneurial right?  I know you are using entrepreneurial in a different manner here, but the "free market" education in Korea produces incredibly rigid students with little entrepreneurial spirit, while our terrible public system produces an incredible amount of entrepreneurs.

If the free market can successfully sell society refrigerators or washing machines, couldn't they do the same with education?

Not even sure what to do with this terrible argument.

This is why arguments that say 'free market education would be too expensive' fail.

You didn't address one single argument against getting rid of/privatizing the public education system, and 'free market education would be too expensive' is certainly not one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  it is not profitable to go after new shale oil plays when oil is below at least $85/barrel.

There are plenty of shale plays that are profitable way below that level.

Therefore, in two or three years, we should expect to see US shale oil production evaporate.

Certainly smaller, over-leveraged players will go under and their bankruptcies will have some ripple effects through Wall Street and other financiers, but their assets will be bought up for cheap by the better financed. The technology is to the point where the lead times for many of the wells to be drilled is a few months, which is a huge difference from traditional production.

Shale oil companies couldn't turn a profit when oil was $110/barrel

Tons were turning profits on wells, they were cash flow flat or negative because they were investing in new production.

I expect to see oil climb much higher than where it's been.

Sorry, not with you there. Demand is flat, alternatives becoming bigger, production might dip some but lead times are much quicker to respond to increases. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Denver Rescue Mission is right downtown and recently expanded operations.  My sister-in-law lives down the street and bikes by it to work.  Since they expanded, the homeless population in the area exploded, and there's typically a few hundred yard line of homeless people to use their services. When they are done, they roam the streets, harass people, sleep and shit in her backyard, all sorts of fun stuff.  She has to take a much longer bike route to and from work if she doesn't want to be harassed.

The stories of places banning feeding the homeless come from stories like this.  It's easy to sit back and say the terrible government is arresting poor little 90-year-olds, but when you have homeless people shitting in your backyard you understand the sentiment.

And what is the libertarian solution?  If land is all privatized, they will be welcome nowhere, correct? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'll likely only get responses from conservative folks either denying AGW, saying it's not that big a deal and climate change is natural, or saying that it should stem from the consumers, i.e. if enough people "believe" in it, they will buy priuses, the latter two being deniers as well but trying to mask it.  I'm guessing you are not in those camps because you are asking the question.

My answer:  it won't.  This is a question that is brought up a lot here, and I've yet to see a solid answer to how it will work in a libertarian society of any sort.  I truly believe the only way to actually combat AGW is to price it into the market, and let the free market solve the problem.  But this of course requires some sort of force to achieve this.  

That being said, there are ways to price carbon into the market that will be a net benefit for the poor, with a larger share (really not much) falling on the upper classes who tend to be those who are so concerned about AGW (the "hollywood elite"), all while preserving freedom .

So, good luck getting an answer, I've been looking for a while and yet to find anything.  Have had some fun arguments though. </TEXT>

 I would put money on one of them being dead in 2.

So wouldn't this be a great time to loosen the embargo?  Open them up to outside thought so that when the regime change does come, the people will have more insight into the outside would and the wonders of trade and capitalism, and be less willing to put up with a horrible dictatorship?

 Even in the 90's Havana was set up as a show town for European tourists, with a lively and vibrant area for them to see and talk about to their friends, surrounded by slums that tourists never saw. I imagine its the same now.

And now this will be more transparent to the outside world, especially Americans.  Foreign NGOs and companies will be able to design plans to help the people in slums while potentially profiting.  Likely USAID will be banned, but CGI, Gates foundation love taking on these problems.

If you just object to an embargo for its own sake

I think most people here are against embargoes for their its sake *because they don't work.*  They simply do not hurt those in charge and bring the people out of poverty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Statist ignorance? Zomia was a term coined by a small anthropologist discussing arbitrary borders, and used by an anarchist to "prove" his position.  Zomia is not a commonly used term outside of anarchist philosophy and anthropology. That's like a socialist asking you *you don't know of (tiny, socialist coined term)? Such ignorance.*  I've been all around these regions and never heard it used.

These may be examples of stateless areas, but primarily because they were fleeing persecution and death, not taxes.  The whole area of China is now integrated into the Chinese system because of prosperity.  Parents are trying to send their kids to schools in the cities for their future.  I knew a Naxi girl from a tiny village who moved to Lijiang to go to school and became a kindergarten teacher.  She said she would never move back.  I have tons of stories from many of these small villages and minorities.

In addition, these areas that are still stateless are possibly one step above sustenance farming.  I would laugh at you if you followed up the "Somalia nonsense" with *I'll move to Zomia.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) So you argue that the NM lottery gives money to scholarships, but then accept my 'fungible' argument that equivalent money can be easily pulled out of education budgets.

I'll look up Jon Oliver's argument when not at work.  But I don't think in all cases the funds being diverted argument holds true, but haven't studied the empirical data much. 

 2) Well, if the lotteries are privatized, they won't be able to lie to consumers (as State ones can)

The lying you are talking about is saying that the funding isn't going education?  I'm not sure if I consider that lying, as they are audited and 100% of the net funds go to a scholarship fund. 

creating a net improvement

Explain this a little more.  

All I'm saying is that you are arguing that exploiting of poor people should be privatized so that profits can go to private companies instead of scholarships because, according to you, the government is lying - many would argue against this.  And this is the poster child of why government is bad.  That's not a great argument to get non-libertarians to switch over. </TEXT>

I have no idea where you get this notion from.  Seriously, where do you get this from?  There is mountains of evidence.  That's what all the science is about.  The science builds and builds on each topic.  One counterpoint is brought up, and counter research proves/disproves it.  All this builds to an equation, vastly simplified of:

Total warming increase = Warming from human caused CO2 emissions + warming from non-human CO2 + warming from solar activity + warming from all other significant factors

They then run massive analysis, controlling for these other factors and come to the scientific conclusion that: Abnormal warming increase = Warming from human caused CO2 emissions.

Sticking your fingers in your ears and saying lalalalala does not mean there's no evidence.

let alone that it should be cause for concern.

The doomsday talk takes it too far, but the cost benefit analysis of current action for future returns sways towards action now.

And before you start with the liberal and AGW bias of academia, do you know the ungodly amounts of money available for someone who can legitimately disprove AGW?  Scientists say they aren't in it for the money, but I find it hard to imagine at least one scientist who wouldn't love to be filthy rich.

In choosing between models and evidence, I choose evidence.

The research and models are based off of evidence, and real evidence, not your, "Well this one time in Earth's history it was hotter therefor AGW is wrong."  All the items listed above are factors in the research, and the evidence shows that none of them are responsible for the recent warming.

[Do the Earths volcanoes emit more CO2 than human activities? Research findings indicate that the answer to this frequently asked question is a clear and unequivocal, No.](http://volcanoes.usgs.gov/hazards/gas/climate.php)

[Solar Flares](http://iopscience.iop.org/1748-9326/8/4/045022/article)

Easy to find the others (scientific, not blogspam).

Models will never be sufficient.

What do you suggest then? We should follow your incredibly well-reasoned "evidence"?

Questioning authority is a libertarian principle.  Reading paid and misleading neo-con blogspam to "verfiy" your predetermined beliefs is not.

There are certainly free market ways to approach the issue, but emissions must be priced in for the free market to work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oil futures are the most leveraged instrument retail investors can use (correct me if you know of more).  1 contract of front month WTI has a margin requirement of around $3,000 for a delivery of 1,000 barrels of oil. That means your $3,000 controls $75,000 worth of underlying at current prices, a 4% leverage ratio.  Longer dated contracts have closer to $1,000 margin requirements.

If you were long from $100 to the current $75, you would have lost $25,000 per contract.  Plus margin calls.  This guy has no idea what he's talking about throughout this thread, but he's right that futures are fucking rough.

The ETFs are more for investors looking to diversify their assets classes, taking out a huge amount of the leverage and risk while still keeping the correlation to physical oil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Selling illegal weed requires you to find customers through black market channels.  If you don't already have a pretty solid network, you will have little chance of making more than some pocket change.  There are tons of black market dealers.  On the other hand, you start a dispensary and do small amounts of marketing and can get pretty good foot traffic (although I don't think many more licenses are being granted).

I have friends here that sell illegal wholesale, and are constantly worried about getting robbed.  All dispensaries and grow operations are hooked up to CC cameras and the police station. While carrying large amounts of cash is certainly risk, there is much less risk in running a legal dispensary.

Taxes are a part of the reason, but really more of a scapegoat.  The main reason, in Colorado at least, is requiring dispensaries to to grow 70% of what they sell, which is no longer the case as of October this year.  Companies will now be able to focus on one aspect of the supply chain, and prices are projected to drop next year.  

Finally, Colorado dispensaries are incredibly profitable, even with the tax rate this high.  They will likely keep similar margins as prices drop, bringing more people from the black market. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At this point, it almost exclusively depends on how cold the winter is, with some other minor power generation demand effects with low coal stocks. (I'm speaking to NG futures, but I believe the UNG buys futures, correct me if I'm wrong I know some commodity ETFs do weird things)

The move yesterday was due to the polar vortex forecast, overcoming the huge injection of 91bcf, beating analysts average of 87bcf.  [Stocks are still 6.8% below the 5-year average](http://ir.eia.gov/ngs/ngs.html), but same year injections last year were around 40bcf. The supply increase in definitely not slowing, but injections are projected to turn to withdrawals third week of November.

So bottom line, if it's a really cold winter, yes, it will continue to rise.  If it's a really warm winter, it will not rise as much and could fall.  I'm fairly certain it will be in between those 2, and I personally am trading with a long bias. </TEXT>

IMHO Venezuela will collapse with the lower prices sending a supply shock and rebounding prices before the aggregate US production collapses. There will certainly be some smaller producers and some more expensive plays put on hold or going under, but they will just get scooped up by better capitalized firms.

Are you saying USD/basket of currencies?

If USD doubles (strengthens?) tomorrow, the USD oil price would go down 50% and stay the same in non-USD terms

This would mean a perfectly negative correlation with every other currency in the world, which is mathematically impossible unless they are all perfectly positively correlated.

My equation above is a simplified version of the exact effect that happens when:

Sinopec is buying Arab Extra Light from the Saudis, Sinopec converts RMB to USD, the Saudis do the same, and then transact in USD. Could you explain in that equation where your effect takes place? </TEXT>

Also note foreign oil is priced against Brent or another benchmark rather than against the WTI contract. 

The strengthening dollar was really larger culprit for decreased demand when WTI was still around 90, brent around 95.  The main reasons for prices this low and the continued drop are the US shale boom and the Saudis dumping oil to try to put the US producers out of business on the supply side, and no where for it to go with decreased demand in the US and the slowdown in China and eurozone.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's the exact opposite actually.  Oil is traded on the world market in dollars, which means that countries have to convert local currency to dollars to buy in the global markets.  When the dollar is strengthening it makes oil more expensive, thus decreasing demand.

For example, for simple purposes let's say the exchange rate for a country is 100 currencies to $1. The means the can buy one barrel of WTI for $80 * 100/$1 = 8000 currencies.

Tomorrow, the dollar strengthens to to 101 to $1.  You now buy one barrel of WTI for $80 * 101/$1 = 8080 currencies.

Hope that wasn't too simple and I am being a dick. </TEXT>

The Saudis aren't doing this to break Iran, they are doing it to break the US shale boom. That's why they discounted prices to US buyers and increased to Asia. The geopolitical issues are smoke and mirrors, the Saudis don't want to lose market share to the US boom.

	<TEXT> Specifically here, we/he are referring to deflation - negative inflation, not "deflating" as in reducing a positive, high inflation rate to another positive inflation rate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Perhaps you could share where the disconnect in logic is?

"This doesnt happen in a vacuum, though."

Followed by his conclusions based on assumptions in a vacuum, specifically:

"This effect is exacerbated by the fact that the excess supply of money incentivizes producers to restrict production causing a leftward shift in the supply curve"


 I don't think the point was that deflation is always positive, only that it does not always lead to depression or even an economic downturn. Deflationary spirals can certainly occur, but that does not mean that we ought to shy away from all deflation to the point of trying to ensure inflation, in the same way that the possibility of hyperinflation does not mean we should intentionally cause deflation.

But his point is certainly *not all deflation is bad* citing the beginning of US  industrialization in the 1880s - deflation caused through productivity increases - as an example, which is a terribly misleading comparison which absolutely has no relevance to current deflation fears. And then he doesn't give any other examples of positive deflation, well, because.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is, therefore, no general benefit to inflationary policies.

"I used these vague economic terms and a basic supply and demand charts, combined with disconnected logic to prove my economic theory true!"

To many people, deflation is synonymous with economic downturn and depression, but history contradicts this fear: from 1880-1886 prices fell by an average of 1.75% while real income rose 5% in the same period. 

He's really using the 1880's as an example of positive effects of deflation?  That period has close to zero effective comparisons to our modern economic situation and deflation.  

Do you really believe deflationary spirals won't happen and have serious economic detriment? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Shell accepts the science as well](http://www.shell.com/global/future-energy/scenarios/2050.html), and has two global projection scenarios.  

1) "Scramble" with flight into coal and rapidly growing CO2 emissions. The video they give is incredibly gloomy.

2) "Blueprints" is one with worldwide emission trading and evolving post-Kyoto with emerging coalitions and strong green energy growth. The video they created is a future with nature and happy people enjoying their lives.

It's funny, the only people denying the science are.... Fox News and WSJ opinion/comment section?

It's funny, because your garbage rhetoric of taxation is like a gun to your head actually supports a larger state by marginalizing libertarians.  </TEXT>

My guess is that the ones he was referring to were buying on the black market. </TEXT>
