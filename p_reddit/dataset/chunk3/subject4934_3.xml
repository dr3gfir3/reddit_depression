	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I went from having a weird amount of fun creating my character, which as always took 40 minutes or so, only to change him when leaving the vault. And the pre-war stuff was nice, I won't go into story details but it all happens, then you're in the wasteland. 

Within like 30 minutes of kicking off, I now have a power suit to upgrade. A dog to keep track of. And a small village to raise. Yes, of course I don't have to do them, but I assume there are benefits, and I enjoy it at times, but damn is it a lot to take in. (I've also looted every corner I've found since the start of the game and I'm yet to meet a vendor.

So the dog.. I've only really noticed it being useful when fighting in the freedom building, because after I bring her to the sanctuary and head out for combat, he never seems to be around. Do I lose him or what? If I lose him, do I just need to track back all the way or is there a way of calling him/ dismissing him? 

The weapon customization and armor seems fun, I'm getting used to it, but it's a bit of a struggle still just due to how much it all varies, and the fact I have like 20 weapons in my inventory with nowhere to sell them. (I don't have enough caps for a trader stand). 

Building the town.. I can see the idea, and I've destroyed a few buildings for the gear, and I've planted the water hoses but I don't have enough food, and I'm unsure how to put someone on the job of farming it, or does it automatically give someone the job? 

That seems to be it really. The game is fucking incredible, but as I head to bed at 4am, my mind is frying both due to tiredness, and the insane amount of stuff I have to do.

So any help on this matter would be really appreciated. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as I wait for Fallout 4, I've been watching footage of the perk system and how it works (nothing major, but videos made to help new players).

Then I watched a video on class guides, in which he'd show what stats I should take for a melee setup, a sniper setup, a pacifist setup, and a generalist.

So having never really played a class in the previous games (I have maybe a day play time, across however many years it's been out, across NV and 3), I have a few questions. 

How exactly does a melee class work? Like would that not be the hardset class to play due to range and certain situations, maybe a large group of super mutants, a room full of security robots, etc. 

Are there any other classes out there or are the ones I mentioned the main ones? If so, which is the easiest for new comes?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as a guy currently in school, the next two weeks are straight up torture for me. I've grinded it out to have enough spare cash for at least one game.. The only question is which one. 

At one point it was Battlefront just on the basis it was Star Wars.

Then for the last 2 weeks or so it was Black Ops 3 because I found Nadeshot and the whole Optic 'scene' again. I was hyped enough to buy AW, then prestige in and sell it again, just so I could get the loyalty camo. 

And today I saw screenshots of Fallout 4.. And I'm really torn right now, because I was all set for BO3, but Fallout 4.. It's Fallout. 

Anyone else here struggling to choose, or willing to help a guy make a choice?  </TEXT>

Is there a way to get rid of this, or will I just have to try find the soundtrack on Spotify? 

EDIT: I'm going to add this in with the hopes I get some help. Can someone help with the MyCareer Player Settings? I'm looking up rules now, but does the scoring style matter? The height to weight ratio? The Wingspan, bodylength (?), and shoulder width? 

Any help would be great because I'd love to get into this game but damn am I confused right now.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Basically, I'm looking to buy a sports game. I'm not going for fifa, that's just a big no-no. 

But apart from that, and not being in the US, I'm not quite which one to go for. I've had madden and nba before, and enjoyed both but got tired of them due to other games. But now I look to get one for when I don't need to give hours of my day to a game, and just play it for a bit each day. 

So Madden.. I'm not really sure what to say as the last I played was maybe 14. I enjoy it, but when going to be a pro, I'd only really know how to play qb so that narrows down the variety. 

NBA.. The soundtrack is usually fucking awesome, and I enjoy the be a pro version of that, although I was really bad at it (kept going for 3's as a beginning player).

NHL.. I've never really played an NHL game that much, aside from the demos, and it seems fun, but I never go much further into it, although I'm willing to. What is that like in terms of be a pro, manager mode etc. 

MLB.. I went through a baseball phase at the beginning of the summer but it died down due to, well.. I'm in Ireland, baseball isn't exactly the number one sport here, and without a console to get a game on, I slowly fell away from that. And being completely honest, I have no idea what that game is like, but any insight to it would be great. 

All of these games of course, come with some kind of pack opening, dream-team type gamemode, right? Which is the most fun? 

Honestly, you don't need to have mastered all these games, but if you've played one well enough to give a strong opinion on it, I'd appreciate it. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I chose Triss. I knew going in that Triss and Yen were to be a love triangle, but having never played 1 or 2, I had no idea how important Yen was to Geralt. I only knew of Yen from the meeting in Vizima, and from that I found her a bit.. Bitchy for lack of words. Then Triss, this down to earth, loving, compassionate girl comes along. So of course I chose her, having no knowledge of previous story or lore. 

Now I'm in Skellige and damn Yen is getting a lot of screen time. It's also showing how important they are to eachother. But I've also heard if I romance Yen too, I'll end up with neither of them, so I've sworn not to touch Yen. (I also romanced Keira earlier so I'm not sure how that will tie in..) 

So back to my point, those of you that chose Triss, was it worth it? I've heard Yen gets more screen time. Yen is more important to Geralt. Yen is a motherly figure to Ciri (Who I'm still trying to find.. Damnit). All I hear of Triss is that she's more compassionate than Yen, and she openly 'feels' more, if you get me.

Any thoughts on the matter, without spoiling anything major from this game I'd appreciate it. Thanks!

EDIT: Oh, and I've also read that people are hoping for more Triss screentime in one of the dlc's. Could this be a thing? Are the dlc's continuing from where I end the game, and in so it's up to me if she appears? I don't know. This whole thing is confusing me a bit with consequences and dlcs, etc.  </TEXT>

Also, if anyone knows where the key is for that ship, I'd appreciate it, I'm not dying to find it, because I've gotten pretty nice loot so far from around it, but it'd be nice to know what's inside.

	<TITLE> Can someone help me with the topic of endings in this game [Major Spoilers] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-26 21:27:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just got to meet Radovid in the chess club (at least I think it was Radovid, as a speech option was something about meeting a king) and I realized I know very little about this war and who is the 'good' guy here. So a bit of researching I came across something that spoiled an ending for me. 

It was that if I support Radovid it ultimately leads to the death of Geralt. And from what I've read, Redanian's (?) are somewhat the victims of this war because Nilfgaard are charging in here for 'one united realm' or whatever right? So I planned on supporting them..

But is the final end for supporting Radovid, the death of Geralt, or is there an ending in which I support Rad and still live? 

If the answer is yes, just say yes, please, I don't want to know about any more endings. I'd also like to know if Geralt is going to die because I supported the wrong guy, after putting all these hours in.  </TEXT>

I also haven't played cod at a real level since Blops 2, and I remember Astros being the big deal headset. Are they still the top headset or have Turtle Beach/Triton come in with something to compete? Because honestly Astros are expensive as hell. Although I did find [these] (http://www.argos.ie/static/Product/partNumber/3625877/Trail/searchtext%3EASTRO.htm) but I'm not sure if it's compatible with the ps4 or if they're even any good.

I know it's not exactly PKA related or a topic they could discuss, but seeing that the guys are most likely going to pick it up, it could be something if they were in the group too.

Even just getting a frying pan from the hut, it was hilarious to see her come closer and closer to him as he backs off. 

So does the quality of content stay the same the later you get into the game? Because right now I am fucking *swamped* in quests, and some are 20-30 levels too high for me, so I'll have them for later.

	<TEXT> So I'll be honest. I'm not a big Fallout player. I've played both 3 and New Vegas multiple times, but never to the end. 

The furthest I got in 3 was just after meeting the dad and he gives you a job, and in New Vegas.. I really can't remember.

But when I hear Fallout I think of fun, of adventure, of a game I love to play, even though I don't play it that much. (I just found it to be too clunky or robotic)

But when I saw the countdown for the Fallout 4 trailer, I knew the minute I heard the announcement, that I'd being buying this game. 

But as it comes close to Christmas money is getting tight and other games are being released. 

So in the hopes that I get tipped over the edge here, what convinced you to buy this game?

Is this the same for all games in terms for taking up this much space, if so, I'll only be able to play about 8 games or so won't I? 

Or am I doing something wrong completely when it comes to installing or....? 

Oh, and I'll just leave an example. I'm installing the patches right now for GTAV, which take up 7gb, but checking my storage space it says the game takes up 50 or something mad. Which is somewhat understandable because it's in the console. But why is AC Unity taking up 40gbs even though I stopped playing it and the install patch was only 6gb? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this is not a hate on audiobook listeners out there, simply because I'm one of them quite often. 

Basically, I've been wondering, I consider myself a reader right? But when it comes to 'ingesting' a book so to speak, I find myself willing to listen to it more than I would sit down and read it. 

So if you had someone who read 100 books, you would consider them a reader right? Would you still consider them a reader if they listened to all 100 instead of physically reading?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've always loved space and science. But only now, at 19, with one school year left before college (the age to school year ratio is a long story), I've finally decided to step up and teach myself what I need to know about space, physics, that general kind of field you understand (forgive me if there's a word for it, and if there is I'd appreciate you leaving it below). 

So I bought Hawking's A Briefer History of Time a while back and am only now reading it, and I'm enjoying it. I went out with the idea of getting A Brief History of Time but it was out of stock, and after reading this for 3 chapters I'll admit I'm glad I got this instead of the more in depth version. 

So in the next few weeks, depending on how busy I am, I'll be finished with this. Where should I go next? Is The Grand Design something I should look for? 

Any suggestions on single books or collections would be great, as I have to buy and read them all myself because my school doesn't teach science. 

Thanks.

EDIT: I'd also like to add in I'd be willing to listen to podcasts, watch shows, documentaries, movies etc. I'm willing to try all sides of media to learn. </TEXT>

But this time around, I fucking love the non-raid content. Running dailies in year one felt like a job without the fun of printing spreadsheets. Now I'm glad I have dailies, because these missions are fucking awesome in terms of content and variation. Even the strikes are all incredibly different. From fighting a boss ass shank in a battle arena to fighting an Oryx wanna be in a pit of darkness.

Where can I buy the Taken King. And that alone? I'm guessing it'll be around 40-50 euro instead of 60-75 right?

Any help on the matter would be great, thanks.

I keep making it up to the gate and getting caught by the guards to the right, left or ahead of me. Which then ends with me sprinting away, the watch being tightened and me restarting for a no kill run. 

I've done missions before ignoring the no kill just because I'm not hunting for S but I don't want to end up blowing everything up on my way to save him because at this is a stealth game.

Anyone else feel the same or have an easy fix for my problems?

UPDATE: So I found this 

"Literally no idea, I have today and tomorrow to start the editing. Maybe I finish editing on the plane and can start rendering. Will upload when I am at home (fast upload speed there). I get home on monday, so after that."

If we assume Patrick has PKA in among the footage it's looking Monday. If Woody brought his own storage for it, we're in the dark right now.

Either way I'm feeling let down for some reason. I get what they just went through but I highly doubt either Chiz or Woody have ignored this sub up until whatever time it is there.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-09-05 01:14:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I installed the game earlier this evening. I have about 2 and a half hours logged, just going off the fact that the prologue said total play time was 2 hours. Which I don't actually understand, does that take in the time of sitting at pause menus and the home screen?

Okay, on to the actual question. So I got to the first little checkpoint,found a lonesome guard, marked him, crawled my way up to him, equipped my arm because.. just because really. then I took his gun. I panicked. Didn't want to kill him in case it effected my score. Equipped another weapon so I could drop his. Figured out I could just knock him out by hitting RT. Hid him behind a rock. Moved on around the little camp. Then a minute or two later after getting another guard I was spotted by someone who was back where I got the first guy. Did he wake up already or is there a chance I missed someone? It would have only been 50 seconds to a minute and 1/2. Are knock out timers that short?

Is the tranq gun the way to go instead of making sure I go hand to hand for every knockout?

Does killing a guard matter to my score? In terms of a takedown being 100 and a gun kill being 50 etc. 

What's the deal with the online part of this game and the need for servers? I've been told to update to use the online features but can't seem to track it down. Does it matter?

Any other tips in that pop into your head would be great. Thanks. 

Oh, and I threw the spoiler tag in just because I'm not sure how serious it is. Whether it be a plot point or any talk of the content in game.  </TEXT>

But how does this run? I really want to give in and buy it but it may awfully. Anyone that has experience with the matter, I'd really, really appreciate some help. Thanks.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So before we start, I have only really been reading Batman and some Nightwing as part of Death of the Family. I tried Batman and Robin but I kind of half read it while at bus stop or something. So I just finished Death of the Family, which.. Well, if you've read it you know, it was incredible to me. But I also was expecting the Joker to kill Damian. I thought the entire thing would lead up to that, becuase I understand issue 18 of B R is incredible sad and whatnot, so I expected that to be his death. I have read Batman 1-17 and B R 15-17, just to get a feel for the work without going all the way back to the start, I'm just not that big into it. But, Damian is already dead? Yet I haven't seen it. 

So I googled it, found out he dies in Batman, Inc in issue 8. How.. How exactly does this go? Was Batman Inc a later release than the other 2 series and therefore issue 8 dropped just before 18? Batman, Batman and Robin are both titled Requiem so I know they're connected, but having never read Incorporated, what's going on there?

Any help would be great, in regards to if I should read 1-8 of Inc to get a better feel for Damian or if I should read 18 then continue on with Batman. (I just don't see myself going further with B R yet because I have a lot to read. I just had to live this moment, if you understand me.)

	<DATE> 2015-08-30 03:27:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been reading Death of the Family for a good few weeks now. It's partially due to the fact that I bought it digital instead of physical so that puts a toll on it, but it's also the fact that I'm new to a lot of the series' I'm reading. 

Like I'm just not a fan of Catwoman in general, I don't know why, I just never got behind her. I also have no idea what makes Detective Comics different to Batman. I don't really know Red Hood and the Outlaws or Teen Titans (although I may get into that one day because I'm a fan of Arsenal thanks to the Arrow show).

But that's basically it. I'm really struggling to get through this arc because I'm making sure I read every issue involved. I understand I can straight up just read Batman but I also feel like I'd be missing a lot of details if I avoid an issue or two. I also know the end of this arc so I need to get a grasp on the situation in my mind but to get a real connection I've heard I should read Batman Inc before getting to the end, which I doubt I'll do because I just don't have the time. 

So I can't be alone in this thinking right? I want to give up my mindset and only read Batman right now, then later come back for Nightwing, Batgirl, and maybe Teen Titans. Or should I keep going with this and eventually my mind will get adjusted to it?

Any help on the matter would be great. Thanks folks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is the review section of a game on Steam now pointless? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-30 01:34:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this is kind of a spur of the moment post and I'm not sure how readers will react but I'd like to hear your thoughts.

So for the longest time now I've used the review section for buying games on Steam. Of course there are actual reviews, with pros and cons lists, rating systems, solid reviews in general.

But lately, it's just all bad what I'm seeing. Some people have 2k hours played with a negative review and the only words are "eh.. Played it". "Did this, with this, this happened. 50/10." Like. With the 2k hours you can assume it's worth a try in some cases but all these sarcastic comments and stuff everywhere now just don't help. 

It's coming off as very ranty but I'll make my last point and leave. So Black Ops 3. Not many people care for CoD anymore and some may even ignore my opinion as a "cod fanboy" or whatever but I actually haven't played one in 3 years now so I was curious. I checked out Black Ops 3 and from the people I know, follow, they really like it. They enjoy this beta more than the entire previous cod and whatnot. "The return of Cod" although said about each new cod, it still stands. 

So looking through the review section I see stuff like "Advanced titanfall: destiny ops 3" then something like "WHOA RUN ON WALLS! WHOA DOUBLE JUMP!" that goes on for a bit. If you see the reviews you get it.

So I'm just wondering. Am I taking this way too seriously or should there be an actual review system? Because I for one rely quite a bit on the thoughts of someone who has played the game because I: 1) Dont have a lot of cash to be buying games I later regret. 2) Don't have faith in many review videos at this point. 

Any thoughts, like I said, would be appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

So I panicked knowing I couldn't get the day off for this. Then I heard the actual activation for it doesn't start until a certain time and it'll most likely be the evening GMT when it starts.

	<TEXT> So I'm not the best writer when it comes to reviewing a movie and I understand how often this story is praised and how many love it but I thought I'd share a few notes I wrote down while watching.

So the first thing I picked up on was the night he returns. The cop in the car with the rookie, even before he said it, I knew what it was because of Nolan. The "You're in for a treat tonight" line, right? Now that I know it comes from this story I'm really impressed with Nolan.

The reported that misread Gordon's death.. I went from my jaw hanging to giggling a bit. Well played writers. 

So.. The entire part from when Robin leaps in to when he walks away to the cave. I cried for 90% of that 'scene'. It may have been the soundtrack at the time, I'm not sure. Or it may have been how often Jason is referenced. Or that I'm currently on my first read of Death of the Family and I know how that ends.. It was just a surge of emotion and I couldn't hold it. I'm also now really curious on this version of Robin and why I've never heard of her. 

So to the batcave. What was the deal with him going to the bat? Was it just a symbol of how he'll never truly be done with the Batman? I'm guessing so, so I'll stop there. 

The soundtrack.. If you've heard it I have nothing more to say because you know it. Phenomenal is the word I'm going with. 

Then the last note I took was the line "
This is not a mudhole. This is an operating table. And I'm the surgeon.".. Like.. What a perfect line for the moment. It just shows how even with his age, he is still Batman in mind and in body. At least partially, for me anyway, but I do know very little so I may be wrong.

And there are my thoughts. I'd honestly love to hear your guys' thoughts on the movie because I just need to speak right now. BUT. I'll be a while on the replies, about to start Part 2.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm not sure how to ask this but can someone help with understanding Superman comics a bit? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-26 17:24:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So before we start this question may be jumbled or show an ignorance beyond compare. Okay, here goes. 

So Superman is my favorite hero. The idea that he just shines perfection and hope is amazing to me. But when I picked up my first single hero comic it was  Batman (I read up to Trinity War in JL before it, but that was a team thing). And in that we see Batman get in some real shit (The Court of Owls arc is what I read).

So now I'm wondering about Superman. His main comic is Action Comics right? Or at least that's what people say you should read. But about the normal Superman comic? 

So what makes a Superman comic give you the same feeling of dread and fear as a batman comic does? Or is it's goal to be funny and light? Because when I think of how a Superman plot goes, I can only really think of a few villains. Lex, Braniac, Doomsday, Darkseid (although he's a main JL villain right?).

So what makes a normal issue or arc without the mainstream villains great? 

Any help on the matter or pointing me to what version of him I should read would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I don't really mean motivation in the way of Good Will Hunting exactly. 

I'm planning on going fitness heaving come next Monday so I want to hype myself up for it instead of letting it slide and not be into it. I understand that's a lot more on my willpower than a movie choice but that's my own little demon. 

So I watched the trailer for Creed. Like that trailer, to me at least, was fucking awesome. I have no idea how the film is going to be but that trailer had me hyped for boxing. As did the Southpaw trailer, which also ruins a major part of the movie but back to my point.

If you want both of those trailers you'd get the feeling I'm looking for. Not specifically a boxing movie, but a movie in general with a character overcoming something and at the same time having that feeling to it( that we get in Southpaw and Creed).

I don't know. I may be talking out of my ass but some suggestions would be great. Thanks! </TEXT>

I can snap my fingers and she notices the noise, but she doesn't respond to her name. 

Is this something I should be dealing with more or is it nothing to worry about? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I got a puppy a week ago, a husky to be exact. Before hand however I had a jack russell-terrier mix I believe (it's not my dog). Ever since they met, they got on well, the 'play' fight a lot but Im really starting to notice how often the terrier stands over the husky. Of course it's simply because she's bigger but in 6 months to a year or so the husky is going to tower over this terrier. So seeing as the husky won't give in to the terrier standing over her, should I just expect this to go a year until the husky is in pure physical control and stands over the terrier?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So back a few weeks ago when I asked what comics I should start off with I listed Injustice as an option just because I played the game and knew it was a comic series. I then left it behind because I read a comment saying it wasn't that good and I can leave it. 

Now I see a few posts around showing slides of Injustice. I specifically remember year 4 though. So that leads to another question. Is there a release system? Like has it been going for four years now and they just change the title by year? That sounds awfully dumb but that's what I am in this field.

So yeah.. Should I pick it up? I'm a fan of the artstyle and curious about it in general. Especially after letting one guys opinion sway me from an entire series. Although that series could be 21 issues long or 200. I really have no idea.

	<TEXT> So this is an odd one. I've never thought about buying the game until scrolling through a list and for some reason it stood out this time.

On release though, I heard it was the most underwhelming thing ever. Something about the graphics being overplayed at E3 or something (typical Ubisoft stuff)..

So. What was the game actually like? Was the story good? The whole hacking the world thing, how was it? Was it open world? How did it feel.

That all being for 360 though, because I've now come to realize how massive the gap is between 360 and One. 

So if you could answer those questions I'd really appreciate it. In the end, 22 euro for it? Should I? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been thinking about BvS again and.. Well it's obvious with the title that they're pushing Batman fighting Superman. But lets be real, they're most likely going to team up about 3/4's in and fight a bigger villain simply because Justice League. Then we also have Wonder Woman fighting someone and somehow they get Aquaman into the movie right? So I believe they're hiding the true villain. Could the villain be Lex? Or are they setting up another stand alone superman movie with all of Lex's kryptonite knowledge. 

Then we have people like Doomsday, Darkseid, Braniac.. I don't know any more really and I'm sorry but yeah.

Who can we expect to see? I read a comment once saying Doomsday brings together Batman, Superman, WW, Aquaman and they go for him. But the comment after was how giving Doomsday this early would be blowing the load too early. But having only read up to Trinity War, Darkseid seems like the ultimate JL villain. So where would someone like Doomsday fit? If at all. 

I feel in over my head here but I'm interested to see what fans are thinking.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A reason to why I'm late to the movie.

Okay. So the day of release, I was talking with a friend about this movie. He said I should go see it, and was convincing me why. Then friend B comes across, hey, oh, Gone Girl? Yeah, don't see it, she's never even dead.


Knowing that.. I never bothered watching because I thought her being alive would be a final act type moment. So knowing she was behind it, I really couldn't get into the movie because, although I could see how amazingly he was set up to take the hit, even the way he moves, sneaks around etc. It was incredible to watch even though I hated knowing the outcome.


Then she shows up way too early and from that point on I was in love. I am stupid late to the Pike train but.. Oh my god. It was just true perfection in my eyes.


I now understand why people hate the ending. Why would it end like that? was there a reason? Did the movie go over time? I'm so confused. </TEXT>

So this may be rare of course because a lot of people watch at a monitor but I decided to listen to 241 on a run this week and well.. I spent 8 minutes jogging listening to guys talk about a video, in which the only thing I took from it at the time was a lot of 'ghetto shouting' and of course the pka commentary which did help a bit.

But yeah, it may be a lesser problem for a lot of people but from jogging with it on in my pocket. Listening to it on my laptop while I'm in a fullscreen game. People driving in their car. 

I just thought I'd share my mind on this matter, not sure how you guys feel, I'd like to know, but to avoid this being a full 'negative' post if you wanna call it that, I'm honestly just trying to be constructive, I have to say it was a fun episode and I can't wait for the PKA trip. </TEXT>

But he's also transitioning to his dps stance and throws out a few attacks and jumps back to Serpent.

So is this just a choice of playstyle or something I should learn how to do because I really enjoy just sitting back, throwing the heals out and occasional dps spell I can use in Serpent.

But, I've often heard just go with your favorite looking class because traits are obsolete within 20-30 levels. 

So should I go with what I like to look at more and go Worgen or should I go for traits and play with a really ugly race? (In my opinion of course, I understand a lot of you may like it. Just not what I enjoy)

	<TEXT> So right now I'm leveling my first healer and it happens to be a Mistweaver. I'm level 21 right now and so far I've done 3 dungeons. After going from solo to being the only healer I realized I needed to switch stances right? 

After that all I've had to do is cast soothing mist on the tank followed with a few surging mists when needed. 

That is basically it so far. I have things for debuffs, poisons, then a revive of course. So far no need for that.

But looking around I've found people say late game Mistweaver is a higher skill level for some reason. I honestly have no idea so this could be complete bs and if so, sorry for saying it.

But yeah.. As someone who is not too great at this game. Should I level another healer before jumping into monk or am I fine running along here? I'm not going to be overwhelmed later and be pushed away from healing am I?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm just wrapping up the Court of Owls read (a few pages into #12 I believe) and I'm preparing for another really awkward to read crossover. Awkward is the only word I could come up with but I hope you get what I mean. 

Having read the Court of Owls in order of a guide I found online I struggled a bit. Looking back, apart from Catwoman having to fight a Talon her part in it was unnecessary and I really didn't enjoy it. I also wasn't a fan of Red Hood although I'm still giving him a chance. Everything Batman was just a pure joy to read though.

Okay.. Back on topic here holy shit. So Death of the Family, according to the DC app, is 24 issues consisting of the same few characters except they throw in Suicide Squad for Catwoman so yay to that. I can't link it because the dc web page doesn't have the same setup. 

But I noticed it doesn't have Batman and Robin #17 listed in it. It ends at Batman 17. Although it does have B R 15+16 so that's why I'm here. 

Another guide had a few oddball issues added in that don't quite catch my attention, a Detective Comics 16 I believe that isn't listed. Or 17, not sure. Then this guide also throws in B R 17 with Batgirl 17 too. 

So just wondering, is this a one off thing with it leaving out what I believe to be a pretty important issue (although I've never read it, I have only heard whispers which I've browsed vaguely to not spoil it for myself) or are the story arcs on the app fan submitted type deals? 

Really just looking to not miss out on anything right now but by god is hard and brain melting.

Coming back in I want to start a new character but I have no idea where to start. 

Honestly, I want to play a tank or a healer. But at the same time I don't know what class fits. Before I left I heard the monk healing class was pretty weak and disc priests were a thing or not a thing..? 

I don't really know much about tanks other than I don't want to be a warrior one. 

So, as vague as it all is, I'd really appreciate some help finding a new class to come back with. Also, not the most difficult classes if you get me? Like I'd be stretching across my keyboard since I don't own a naga or anything fancy.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay, so before we start. I'm just guessing this but I've heard a lot about issue 17 or 18 of Batman and Robin, how it's incredibly sad. I'm pretty sure I've seen the cover and because of it I'm assuming Robin dies right? Or Jason Todd dies? 

This is where I get confused. If he died 17 issues in B R and is now in Red Hood and the outlaws talking about his death, is this the first example of separate comics not staying on the same continuity or along the lines of it?

So we have Nightwing who is Dick Grayson. I just read 1-7 so I know his story.

Then we have Red Hood, who I'm guessing was the old Robin, aka Jason Todd.

Then Robin, who upon looking at Batman #1 is the kid right, Damien? Or is he the one to die in the future B R. I'd find that much sadder to be honest, even though I don't know Damien.

But that ties back around to, if Damien dies, what's up with Todd? Do I need to read something before New 52? Is it from a separate series?  

Then Tim Drake is Red Robin right? I only know from issue 1 too.

So if you stick with me here for a minute, I just started the Nightwing issue. Now who the f*ck is he? I haven't heard of him so far.

The I have an idea about Batgirl from Nightwing but not too much about her other than she's Jim Gordon's daughter right? 

Catwoman is Catwoman.

I'm not sure if that's everyone or not but yeah.. I'm pretty stuck right now so any help would be great. 

Thanks guys!

Oh, and during the time Nightwing was with Batgirl in 5-6 I believe, he said he didn't think she was ready to get back out there so soon after the Joker or something? Does that mean The Killing Joke story carried over through New 52? I'm not sure how everything works in regards to that but I'm just guessing because it's the only instance of Batgirl-Joker I know about so far. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I went to pick up Vol 3: Death of the Family today but to my usual luck, they didn't have it in stock and are struggling to even get it in.

So instead I picked up Batman Eternal simply because it is issues 1-21 and I really like the artstyle.

But how does it connect to the Batman in the Court of Owls and everything after it? Any help figuring this out would be great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I went out today and picked up my first Batman comic. The Court of Owls. I also picked up City of Owls too because well.. 1 and 2 are clearly where to start right?

Not from what I've heard. I may be wrong but you can of course read 1-12 without adding in anything right? But I've heard Night of Owls takes place between Court and City. Court being the intro, Night being the action, City being the outro. After that we move on to the Joker or something right in Death of the Family? Never mind, I'm getting ahead of myself.
So yeah, just wondering, I'm towards the end of Court and need to know. Do I pick up Night of Owls before starting City?

Thanks!

EDIT: I posted this to Batman because I'm pretty sure I asked something similar to this yesterday and I feel like I'm spamming this page too much since I've found it so yeah, if you're tired of seeing my name or dumb posts sorry :)

	<TEXT> So I just had my first moment of sadness reading a comic. It is just over half of the way through the Trinity War trade.

Batman, Katana, Deadman and the Stranger are in heaven. During this entire little segment I felt like letting a tear loose but I never did. Everything from seeing Katana's piece to Batman not live out his memory, just witness it (which is probably the saddest thing I've read so far). 

Then the Stranger got wiped from existence. I didn't expect it. He accepted it and that's that. Because it's a comic he may return at a later point, I doubt it though. ( I also don't want to know so don't tell me, thanks).

But yeah. I found it weird how 3 weeks ago I knew nothing of the comic world apart from mainstream tv and movies and now here I am wiping away a tear for Batman's created memory. 

So what are some of your memories? I heard about a certain moment in All Star Superman that may be for a lot of people although I haven't read it yet I can't wait. 

Any thoughts would be nice.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get character creation is a thing in MMOs of course but I legit just spent 15-20 minutes choosing a pose for my identity. 

I went from the normal default looking at the camera to the powerful and majestic looking away to the sky then to a really sad face staring into your soul. A really awkward smile looking towards his feet. A smirk to the side as if he's got an ego like Kanye.

After all of it I went with powerful.... Only to find out there are now more options for me.

I already want to buy it. No gameplay. No idea what I do other than I heard it becomes a job late game... But I can't wait for Monday because I'm pretty certain I'm gonna buy, sub, whatever it is you do with this game.

Shoutout to that redditor who's name is escaping me. You told me to install, you helped me through, I shall add you in a few hours when I'm done here! 

All in all, glad to have found another community I can hopefully be a part of.

EDIT: Someone told me to throw my name in here for free cash. I joked about it but being honest, I just want people on my friends list. If you're willing to sit through spam questions or wanna help me figure this universe out add "Kyran Pandel"

New day: I woke up to a wallet of 190million ISK and a bounty totale of 9million. Loving this game right now. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I don't really mean like the one time this character goes here. 

I'm thinking more like Trinity War. I'm reading it right now and it's amazing to me because I've only really read Justice League so far so seeing all these new characters is amazing right now. 

But what else is there? Like Flashpoint right? That's a crossover? Could I jump into that without prior knowledge or where should I start?

I'm trying to ask a question that I don't know how to ask because I'm not sure what I'm looking for (being new to this world) so any help at all would be great.

Oh, and PS: I'm looking at trying All Star Superman just because I heard about how it ends and was wondering if the lead up to it is good enough to justice 30 euro for the full story?

EDIT: To be honest. Anything at all that you consider must read. Just a simple one issue or series or even arc. Like during Comic Con I heard the Dark Knight Returns is one of the best batman comics of all time? So I should read that right? Then the new Batman started off with Court of Owls which was also supposedly great right?

Just help me ;-; </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I bought Justice League: Origins about 3 weeks ago and I had that shit read in 3 days after buying it. Since then I haven't been able to get to the store so I've been buying issues off the DC mobile app. 

But I'm really not a fan. Maybe it's because of the screen size or how holding a phone/tablet is never the same. But it took my like a week to read issue 7 so..

Is there a way to help this? I really want to give reading on mobile a go because of travel and price it's between 17-20 euro for a trade compared to 11 on the dc app.

Any advice in the matter would be great. Thanks </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [S2E4] That was a damn well done gun fight. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-13 13:17:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was a pretty weird episode IMO. We learned more about Paul and how he hates himself for what he likes and it looks more like he's using Em (Emily?) as a scapegoat for it with this marriage. Which would also explain the need for Viagra right?

Then we have Frank. He, IMO, had a really, really poor script this episode.

But the gun fight which I made the title for. It was fucking amazing. The start to it was a bit cliche in the fact even thought main characters are at the front the two guys just behind them get shot but after that it did a pretty good job at showing how a real gunfight would go down right? I've never been in one but if there were to be one, I'd imagine the pace, intensity, chaos and death would be just like it was here.

+Rachel McAdams stole the show this episode in my mind. Everything from the internal affairs arc to how she reacted after running out of rounds and then reacting to the deaths (although Farrell really showed the regret and guilt in that snippet) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How well does AC3 replay/ hold up? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-09 21:36:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So recently I bought Revelations. I bought it off the simple remembrance of the ending and how much I enjoyed it. Also how incredible the trailer for it is.

That being said, I also forgot how old it was. How we've now had 4 AC games since this so mechanics and whatnot are pretty rusty. Then again, so am I so..

But yeah. AC3 is by far my favorite in the series. I don't remember much of the story and I remember a lot of criticism for Konor/Conor/Connor (however it was spelled) about how he had no real depth apart from going on a revenge case. I don't really mind that though. I just fucking love the setting. The hunting. The tree running. The Summer. The Winter. The forests. The towns. I loved the setting. But I also thought I'd love playing with bombs again in AC Rev which I've been struggling with.

So someone who has played it recently, how well does it hold up?

EDIT: I really don't get this flair system so I went with misleading just because I'm not spoiling anything nor making assumptions about future games. So.. Yeah.  Odd system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So Convergence put an end to the "new 52" right? But there are still comics running through on the same issue count while others are starting over right? 

So what's happening? Because of how late to the world I arrived my mind is being fucked. Can I read the Forever Heroes/Evil arc then go on to Convergence and from there shift over to the new releases?

 Are there a load of other arc's I should read before Convergence? 

Does convergence stand well on it's own? 

What are some "must reads" arcs before leaving New 52?

Am I just wrong entirely in my thinking about this? 

I'd really appreciate some help here guys xD Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this is just out of sheer curiosity but... Could Jeyne have been pregnant? 

I'm only a chapter or two past the red wedding so if there is further mention of this later in the books please tag em up. Thanks :)

So in the book. Robb leaves Jeyne as he goes to the Freys. She runs after, they kiss and hug a bit more, he leaves her behind. He dies. No mention of her apart from she's the reason for his betrayal right?

In the show though. She is there with him and they both die. While she's pregnant. The Robb Stark line never happens.

But what if George has it in store for us. A Stark son has been born far away and it's yet to be revealed because of the chaos the realm is in.

How would the show pull that shit off after killing his wife?

I really don't know much of Jeyne so this could be way off and she's dead or something already just later in the books or she did sneak away.

Just a thought that popped into my head as I got into bed. Love to hear your thoughts on the idea. Thanks </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just thought I'd raise this topic although I'm not sure how often it gets asked, if at all.

So who's your favorite character in the DC universe?

I'm super new to the actual comics but the Flash is it for me right now. Simply because of the show. Everything from how he is all about doing good, stepping up, not taking that extra step that the arrow does (although it's an interesting conflict)... I might just binge season 1 again. Or pick up some Flash comics (no idea where to start though).

So yeah. It doesn't have to be a super well known character either. I just chose him because I know him the most I guess because of my little experience in the universe.

So Taylor's character is the highway patrol right? So since he found the body he's on the team.
What makes the Colin's character and Rachel's character part of the team? Colin's character is like the local PD right? Or is that Rachel's character?
Also, if someone could give me the names here I'd much appreciate it :)

PS: this is a copy/paste from my post on /r/television but I've found out Colin's character is Ray. </TEXT>
