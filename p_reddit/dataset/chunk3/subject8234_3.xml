	<TEXT> It was completely unexpected for mine. He was in a lot of back pain, and nothing helped. His kids wanted nothing to do with him, as he had had them in a previous marriage. I understand why, I suppose.. But when he did it, it was with no warning. A week before he had told us he was pretty down and we wanted him to talk to a therapist, but he wouldn't. He died a week after his birthday. I don't think I'll ever understand why, completely.. Just an hour before I had brought him lunch. If I had stayed, I could've made a difference. Or at least tried.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My grandfather committed suicide a few years ago. I didn't show any emotion for months. It hit me eventually- really hard. I'm still trying to get over it. The pain is as real as it was the day he did it. 

All I can tell you is to be happy he's still here. Everyone has their own way of coping and grieving. You will too, eventually. Suicide is one of the worst emotional traumas someone can go through IMO. 

The most important thing is to treat him like he's your brother- let him know how much you love and appreciate him. It'll be a long road from here, but if he knows that he has support it'll make his life a lot better and give him some hope. 

Trust me. I've been there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a link in this sub to another article, much like this. It may be the same one. 

The problem here is that you're trying to prove that these games reduce pro social behaviors in regular players. Is 20 minutes, and one session, really reliable? 

To do this better, you really need to do multiple sessions for extended amounts of time. In my mind, all they've proven with this is that violent media doesn't have an immediate effect on prosocial behavior.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how you feel. I'm straight, though. I'm 20 years old and I've never been on a date or even kissed a girl. Every single crush I've ever had has turned me down. I'm so sick of seeing all of my friends in happy relationships. It sucks when you can't even get someone to go to a movie with you- there's something about sitting in a theater alone that makes you realize how much you just want someone there. People tell me the single life is better, and, I'm sure it is in some respects, but they've got something I don't- someone to talk to, someone to hold, and someone to love. That's all I want, really. Just someone to love.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No kidding. A guy I know was on a country road going home and slid his bike so badly they had to amputate his leg. 

Look, if you want a bike, no one is going to stop you. You just have to be prepared to get hurt, break bones, get bruises, and put your life in the hands of other drivers. You can be the best motorcycle driver on the planet, but all it takes is someone running a red light or not seeing you to hurt or kill you. You just have to ask yourself if you're willing to take that risk. A lot of people drive them for years and never have anything happen. But a lot of people aren't that lucky.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was around Christmas last year. It was around midnight. A buddy and I were in the city doing a night photoshoot when a homeless man came up. I usually ignore people like that because they reek of alcohol and I'm not going to give money to someone so they can get wasted. Anyway, he started talking to us and, with tears in his eyes, explained that he had just lost his job and had been living on the streets, and hadn't eaten for days. He had a McDonald's buy-one -get-one coupon and asked if we could help him out. I took him to a restaurant nearby and intended on buying him a hot drink and a meal, only to have the staff there give him one for free. We talked, and come to find out, he was from Louisiana, and had moved up north after Katrina to find a better life, since he had lost everything there. When we were done, I wished him a Merry Christmas, and left.  I often think about him, and how he's doing. He was one of the most genuine people I've ever met. People like that deserve better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wrote a paper on this song. 

Here's my opinion:

On one side, they're taking liberties by essentially saying they are representative of each side of the argument and "forgiving" each other for their actions and by representing their ancestors.  

On the other, it starts an important conversation between the two sides of the argument. Most southerners(I fall into this category) use terms like redneck and rebel(evidenced by country music songs) and rally behind the rebel flag without intending to portray the original meaning. These things have taken a new meaning- they don't represent racism to the people who use them, they represent pride in their upbringing and their heritage. 

Even though the song, musically and lyrically, sucks ass, I think Paisley and LL Cool J did what they intended by starting conversation about the topic.  </TEXT>

Suicide is a terrible ordeal to have to live through- my grandfather committed suicide two years ago and still hurts as much today as it did then. I have a passion to help people like this, just because I have been through it before with others. 

What people contemplating suicide can't imagine is the sheer force it has on the surviving family members. It's a terrible mental process- something I would never wish on anyone else. 

Sorry to hear about your friend. Were you two close OP? </TEXT>
