	<TEXT> Insulin is what makes people fat.  There are other hormones to like cortisol, but for 90% of overweight people, hyperinsulinemia is the problem.  The book "Obesity Code" by Dr. Jason Fung goes into details about why people get fat.  If you read the ingredients on a jar of bulking powder, there is a lot of sugar and whey protein.  Whey protein is insulinemic and so is sugar.  This is measurable.  A person with a blood glucose monitor can see there blood sugar raise after eating this.  The rise in blood sugar will spike insulin.  If they have access to a lab, they can test their insulin level.  Now if a person wants to spend money to get fat, get fat, and then lose it again, knock yourself out.  I just stay lean.  It is easier and not much work.

Eating fat doesn't spike blood sugar.  Protein from meats spikes blood sugar some, but not as much as carbs, or sugar.  This is testable with a blood glucose monitor.  It is good to find out for yourself what exactly the body is doing instead of relying on an authority.  Authorities can sometimes be wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FoxNews and Breitbart are in the "Business of Anger". There's an entire business...a huge industry, actually...that bases all that it does on getting you p!$$ed off! Rush Limbaugh. Bill O'Reilly. Glenn Beck. All variations of the same thing: people in an industry who want you to believe their function is to "move the public dialogue forward" or to "make an opinion count on your behalf"...blah blah blah. But NO!

Their sole function is to make you angry. That's right. Get your dander up. Get you riled up and feeling as though you're right and all those other asses are wrong - and stupid! In turn, they hope that you'll pay more and more attention to them - while they reinforce your growing anger and disillusionment - and give them big ratings and more money from their advertisers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FoxNews is in the "Business of Anger". There's an entire business...a huge industry, actually...that bases all that it does on getting you p!$$ed off! Rush Limbaugh. Bill O'Reilly. Glenn Beck. All variations of the same thing: people in an industry who want you to believe their function is to "move the public dialogue forward" or to "make an opinion count on your behalf"...blah blah blah. But NO!

Their sole function is to make you angry. That's right. Get your dander up. Get you riled up and feeling as though you're right and all those other asses are wrong - and stupid! In turn, they hope that you'll pay more and more attention to them - while they reinforce your growing anger and disillusionment - and give them big ratings and more money from their advertisers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Protein intake during fasting will turn off autophagy.  Even just a little bit.

"What turns off autophagy? Eating. Glucose, insulin (or decreased glucagon) and proteins all turn off this self-cleaning process. And it doesnt take much. Even a small amount of amino acid (leucine) could stop autophagy cold. So this process of autophagy is unique to fasting  something not found in simple caloric restriction or dieting." https://intensivedietarymanagement.com/fasting-and-autophagy-fasting-25/ </TEXT>
