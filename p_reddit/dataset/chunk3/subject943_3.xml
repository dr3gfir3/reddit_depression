	<TEXT> Margery and Lionel Fitzwilly were the two most intriguing people that lived in my neighbourhood. Well, I thought them to be intriguing. 

Everyone else just thought they were weird.

 Its not like I saw them that often beyond Margerys weekly flower tending and Lionels monthly lawn-mowing. Theirs was the only house that showed any kind of distinction from the otherwise identical block. They had a meticulously well-kept front lawn, green grass. They were pretty quiet, seemed friendly enough in a detached sort of way and always smiled at us kids whenever we played outside. 

Model neighbours. 

I particularly found this characteristic of their nature to be interesting, seeing as nearly the entire population of my small, sleepy town consisted almost solely of the nosy, prying type of older person you secretly want to shove off a bridge. But of course, because that kind of thinking tends to be frowned upon in polite society, you settle for an awkward deflection of the topic they are prying into, a fake ass smile and a clumsy retreat into your own home. Thats my hometown, a bunch of people who have no natural inclination regarding social cues. One of the many reasons I left as soon as I could, to any big city far away enough for me to forget about my time there. 

I shouldnt be badmouthing small towns. Its a clich, I suppose. But behind every tired and worn clich there exists a kernel of truth, a source of the exhaustion, and I can attest to the fact. Its another clich that small towns tend to host the hardest horrors. Another vestige of truth, another thing that I can, unfortunately, attest to. 

What I am about to tell you is real. I hail from the days of blanket forts and Saturday morning cartoons when they were still good and when privileges meant being able to play outside with my friends until the first street light turned on, then booking it back home before my mom beat my ass. To amuse ourselves, my friends and I fancied ourselves pranksters. We thought we were the shit back in the day, eight or nine years old, going through the regular motions of ding-dong-ditch and leaving dog shit on the neighbour s porches and helping the mailman reconfigure the neighbourhood mail-distribution system. Like I said before, clich small town. That was our entertainment, and at the time, we thought it was pretty funny.

 I had two best friends growing up. Zander Hayes, Dylan Parks and I went all the way back to shitting-in-a-diaper days. I may have been the token girl of the group but I could handle myself pretty well with those two dipshits and Id like to think adulthood hasnt mellowed my toughness. We lived pretty close to each other, about a block away from one another. We went to school together, we did homework together, we played together, and we got in and out of trouble together. The three musketeers, my mom used to call us. 

It was our fault, I guess. 

We started it. 

We didnt mean to we just . . . we got bored. And once you get bored, you get stupid. Reckless. Thats what we were. Our pranks were pretty innocent. Annoying and disrespectful, maybe, but harmless. Wed exhausted our little repertoire of tricks and had christened just about every neighbourhood home except the Fitzwillys. We stayed away because my parents told me to. Zander and Dylans parents werent too fussed about them. To most of the neighbourhood, the Fitzwillys were a strange couple, existing in a self-isolation that rendered them of no interest to the rest of the community. But my father always said there was something that bugged him about the two of them . . . something that seemed to elicit a warning to me and my siblings to stay the hell away. I abided by that rule, managing to keep my two friends and the other kids we hung out with away from that house. 

But one day, one day the vaguely pressing warning seemed to fade out of memory as sheer childish boredom-induced idiocy took over. So we pranked them. 

And god, Ive regretted it every day in the ten years since then. 

We were very thorough in our planning strategies. We needed a prank that would fit the profile of the victim well. So we decided to cut the heads off the flowers in Margerys rose garden. It was foolish. It was stupid. We knew just how much that woman seemed to care for her rose garden. There were so many of them, a near four dozen roses, all beautiful and well-kept, and we cut them all down in the late evening just before we were due to be home. We thought we were clever about it, too. As though the dying sun could somehow conceal our foolishness. We took advantage of the Fitzwillys recluse-like lifestyle, thinking theyd never notice us. Dylan and I did the actual snipping. We turned to leave, giggling like idiots, blissfully unaware of what wed just done. I turned to stare at our handiwork one last time as the others all mounted their bikes, and that was when I noticed that Margery was standing in the window of her home, hand drawing back the thick curtain as she stared after us. 

My blood ran cold. 

I expected her to come flying out of the house, to start screaming at us, to cry. Something. I wouldve preferred any one of those reactions; Id even begun mentally preparing the excuse-laden speech I would give my parents once she busted us. But then she did something that was so unexpected and peculiar and inapt that I suddenly felt the coldness of fear spider-walk down my spine. She smiled. 

Slowly, widely. Amusedly. 

Then she raised her hand and waved at an equally sluggish rate. I turned and sped off on my bike, wholeheartedly creeped out. Dylan disappeared the next day. 

Big deal, newspaper interviews with friends, first interesting thing to happen to small town clich, shistorm for about a month before everyone forgot clich, lackadaisical police effort, blah blah blah. 

His parents were devastated and eventually moved out of town, after two years of fruitless searching and a cold case. Zander and I were shaken. Things were never quite the same, after that. I never told either of the guys about what I saw that day, and maybe if I had, things wouldve turned out much differently. The guilt still gnaws at me sometimes. But I was young, and I was confused and I was scared. I became determined to leave that small town.  I grew increasingly introverted, choosing to spend more time in doors reading than with my friends. That was my coping mechanism. Zander dealt with the loss differently than I did. He became a dick. That was his coping mechanism. We broke all contact round about the time we started high school. 

We were like strangers whenever we passed each other. I think now, looking back, that the reason for our drifting apart was because neither one of us had really ever gotten over Dylans disappearance. We were trying so hard to bury the memory and if that meant burying everything that reminded ourselves about our lost friend, including our friendship, then so be it. The Fitzwillys had moved and passed out of the towns mind. I remember going over to their house once, after theyd left. I dont know why, drawn by the last fond memory I had with Dylan, maybe. The rose garden had been overgrown, untidy without Margerys clever fingers to tame it. Somehow, the sight saddened me. College came, and I was relieved to get away. Sometimes fate can be a sardonic bastard because Zander and I ended up at the same college. Things were unnecessarily awkward between us, though after some stilted conversation, we exchanged numbers. We both knew it was never going to progress beyond that. 

Those two happy, inseparable nine-year olds were long gone. 


When I left home I had tried to make a clean break. That meant not relying on mommy and daddy to pay my way through school. I took out a crushing student loan that required me to find a job. I had very little experience with most forms of labour, I suppose, but I did have several younger siblings and cousins. So I advertised my services as a nanny on the internet. I received one interested phone call and before I knew it, I was the Shepards new part-time nanny. 

 I didnt think about it as critically as I should have. The pay was great. They said they were an older couple with a young child that was the definition of docile and that I could even housesit for them when I was on break, which was a huge perk because they lived in a mansion. I arrived for work the first weekend with greedy pockets and an unassuming smile. The taxi dropped me off and I trekked the long pebbled walkway to the ornate door. 


They answered on the first ring. The woman answered first. 

The moment I saw her, my stomach clenched. It couldnt be. But it was. 

It was Mrs. Fitzwilly. 

Same, strangely eerie smile, same greying hair that was beginning to thin at the top, same frail body and spindly fingers. She raised them in a gesture reminiscent of another memory from a decade before. 

Hello, dear! Her voice was chirpy, bright. 

I swallowed. This made no sense. 

Uh . . . Mrs. Fitzwilly? 

Her smile widened, stretching from ear to ear. It looked so painful I actually flinched.

 Oh, my lovely, no, I am Gerda Shepard. This is my husband, Arnold. She turned, arm extending to a familiar-looking elderly gentleman a few feet behind her. He wasnt smiling. It looked as though he were looking through me, grinding his jaw. 

I bit my lip. Sorry, this was a mistake  

No, no, my dear. Please, come in! Well need your services immediately, and we can even pay you in cash, if that is your concern. 

I was about to tell her **FUCK THAT** and run back down the walkway when something heavy hit me on the back of the head and the world went black. 

When I came to, I was seated on an expensive-looking couch. That was the first thing I noticed, the first sensation that returned to me. The feeling of the material. I opened my eyes, groaning at the dull throb pulsing through my skull. My eyes focused on the elderly couple seated in front of me on an opposite-facing matching couch. Margery still wore that shit-eating grin, constantly smoothing down the creases in her long, floral dress. Her husband sat beside her, still grinding his jaw, still staring at me with that odd, vacant expression of his. 

Now, ladies and gentlemen, now I must confess that I was about to leap across the tiny coffee table separating me from them and beat the hell out of Mr. and Mrs Fitzwilly, then try to get out somehow. Im not ashamed to admit that I was not above hitting old people. Not in this situation. But I knew that there must have been a third person, the one whod knocked me on the back of the head, so I kept still, tried to passively analyse my surroundings, subtly checked for my phone in my pocket. Of course it was gone. I resisted the urge to scream.

 The entire room was decked out in the style of a Victorian house. All of the furniture was ancient, bearing glimpses of their former grandeur, a large chandelier bedecking the high ceiling. There was a large bookshelf against one of the walls, lined end to end with books that probably weighed as much as a small person, and a shelf with expensive-looking porcelain dolls sitting portentously and staring with disdain at everything. 

For a few moments, no one spoke. Then Margery raised her voice, and the sudden high-pitched chirrup had my skin crawling. 

Tea! We need tea! Bosworth!

 A third figure limped into the living room, carrying a tray with three cups of tea in elegant china. I swallowed hard. That must have been the person who hit me. Bosworth was a huge, hulking mountain of a man whose severe-looking face was crossed with scars. Despite the muscles and the harshness of his features, there was something so vulnerable in his eyes. He looked like a little kid trapped in the body of a very grown man. This was further emphasised when he skittered about like a nervous puppy after dropping one of the china cups. Margery tittered on about how it didnt matter, in that pseudo-saccharine voice of hers while Lionel kept on staring at me, but from the look of pure terror etched across Bosworths face, youd have sworn he had just been sentenced to death. 

No mind, no matter, Bosworth. Just bring your baby brother, will you? 

I couldve sworn the man looked as if he were about to be hung by the balls, but he merely nodded vigorously, once, twice, then shot off to wherever his *baby brother* was. I had kept my calm so far, internalising my hysteria fairly well. 

When Margery gestured to me to take a sip of tea, I shook my head. 

I want to leave now. I said simply. 

At that, the old woman laughed a delicate cackle that was not unlike broken glass. 

But, my dear, you have agreed to look after our child. You cannot simply walk out now. Not until youre part of the family.


Listen, lady, I have a family and friends and they know where I am and theyre going to find me here eventually, so you better let me outta here. I lifted a hand to my aching head and it came away bloody. I eyed the butterknife lying on the table, pleasantly chilling next to a loaf of bread and pots of jam and butter. I didnt want to kill or even hurt anyone. But I would do whatever I had to to get out of here. They seemed crazy, but I was sure a threat with a knife might sober up any madness. 


Margery just continued to smile at me, though it crinkled a little.

 Just meet our little Jaime. You might yet just change your mind. He is so . . . precious. I turned at the sound of Bosworth returning, steeling myself to face whatever little devil a woman this demented would dub precious.

 When I saw him, my heart seemed to stop beating.

 Dark brown hair, soft brown eyes . . . Dylan Parks.

 I couldnt string together a single coherent thought. It was Dylan, and while the last ten years had lengthened his frame and added a ghost of stubble, I would recognise his face anywhere. He was dressed in little boy clothes, his body so gaunt that they barely stuck tight around his body, he had a pacifier in his mouth and an adult diaper peeking through his tiny shorts. 

He seemed to recognise me too, because even though he remained silent  I saw his eyes flash for an instant, then cloud with tears. 

For several long moments that seemed to stretch into an eternity, I remained silent, looking at him look at me and a quiet understanding seemed to be forged between the two of us. I had no idea what was going on, I had no idea who these people were or what the fuck theyd been doing to him, but I did know one thing. I was not going to leave my friend here. 

I was going to get him out. 

Well, I told you he is just darling! Margery stood up, twirled in a circle, and then sat back down. What do you say? Do you take the job? 

I looked at Dylan one more time before turning to face the couple. I schooled my features into neutrality and with a voice that was clear of any of the horror I felt roiling inside of me, I said the words. Somehow, I said the words. 

I accept.

	<TEXT> What would you do for family? For those who share your blood? 

Its true that we cant pick and choose our family, but if we could, the only relative I would keep would be Cole. Cole was my twin brother. 

Being an identical twin is something that is very difficult to describe. I dont know what its like to live in a world where someone doesnt share my face. Its being a half and a whole at the same time. 

Kind of like being part of an inside joke that you share with only one other person on this planet.

 Like living twice. 

Cole was my better half, I always tell people. Despite being only eight minutes and three seconds older than me, he always acted like my big brother. He protected me from bullies growing up, he threatened any guy who so much as winked at me. Maybe he could go overboard at times, trying to keep me safe, but his heart was always in the right place. Sometimes all we had was each other. 

Our father existed in two states: the drunken verbal abuser, and asleep. Our mother was cold, distant. She was a woman born with the icy heart of the imperial, but the circumstances of the middleclass and she hated us for it. Her only concerns were what the community thought of us, clawing onto any faade of bourgeois that she could peoples thoughts on our occasional bruises and sad faces were more of a concern than the physical or even internal damage we suffered. She never intervened when our dad shoved us around, shouted at us about how inadequate we were, how embarrassing we were, what disappointments we were. 

Cole always got it worse, though.

 I cant tell you how many times he stepped between our father and me and took whatever punishment was meant for me upon himself. He never once complained about it, never once blamed me. 

We have to stick together, Lane. Was all hed tell me afterwards, when Id weep in our room after the latest tirade. We were eleven the day our father finally hit one of us. It was me. I had spoken back to him and received a hell of a backhand that sent me careening into the nearest shelf and bloody my nose and mouth. Cole jumped in immediately and hit him back, so hard that he staggered several feet. Then our fathers eyes clouded over with a rage that burned through the drunken stupor and made the hair on the back of my neck stand up. He charged at Cole with a fist that seemed made of iron and made Cole seem as though he were made of glass and I had to help Cole get out bed for the next week until he could finally see out of both eyes again. 

After that day it was like . . .some barrier that stopped our father from physically hitting us had been breached and there was no going back. It became a regular occurrence until one day, Cole hit him back. 

With a knife. 

In the throat. 

Of course it was a big shitstorm. No one believed that it was self-defence because our mother had done a pretty good fucking job of maintaining the illusion that we were a perfect family with no secrets and no problems. She was terrified that this little incident would fracture the veneer shed worked so hard to sculpt, and so she did the worst thing she could ever have done: she had Cole declared criminally insane and sent him to Angel Peaks Psychiatric Hospital. Apparently, having a son who was mentally disturbed was better than having one who was in prison. Being thirteen, there wasnt much we could do about it. It was the worst day of my life, watching them come for Cole. I stayed up with him the night before he was due to be collected. It was the first time Id seen my big brother cry. He made me promise to write to him, to not forget about him.

 I swore I wouldnt. 

I would visit. 

I would write. 

I would remember. 

More importantly, I wouldnt forget, ever.

 I promised. 

Several years passed and my mother refused to let me send letters to Angel Peaks, to even let me visit my brother. She wouldnt divulge the address so I couldnt visit. I still wrote them, 364 letters, one for every week until our twentieth year. I kept him updated on everything. I told him about how our maths teacher was sacked for faking his degree, about how our elderly neighbour Mrs. Parks finally got taken in for growing marijuana in her backyard, about how I had met a guy I really liked, and could even begin to love. 

Sam was always so supportive about me finding my brother. He never laughed when he caught me writing the letters which might never be sent. He tried his damnest to help me locate the place, but it was like it never existed no one had heard of it, it wasnt registered anywhere it was just . . . memory and rumour.

 I could kick myself for not trying harder. 

 I never received a letter from Cole. I worried that my mother might be destroying them before I could read them. She tried to erase my brothers existence from memory itself but I never forgot him. I couldnt. Not anymore than I could forget the searing incompleteness of a missing limb. Part of me was missing. In time, though, I began to heal and move on. I made more friends, got a job to earn money and started getting serious with Sam. We began dating when we were fifteen, and when we turned twenty, I finally decided to move out of the house and in with him.

 The day I moved out I confronted my mother about everything. It came pouring out of me, my hatred for how she allowed her children to be verbally and physically abused for years, for her coldness and cruelty, for sending my brother away when all he did was try to protect us. She took it all with a vacant, blank stare. I continued to yell at her, despite her stillness. Years of pent-up aggression and hurt had finally been allowed a release and I took it. I demanded she tell me where Angel Peaks was but she wouldnt speak. She just sat there, like a statue. Eventually, I scoured the attic myself until I found it, boxed up with Coles things the business card belonging to Spence Fraser, head doctor of Angel Peaks Psychiatric Hospital. I thundered out of the house without so much as another glance at my mother. I even slammed the door hard enough to shatter a window.

 It felt really good. 

When I got to Sams apartment that night, I began the doleful, wretched practise of putting pen to paper to mark the 365th letter. What began as a standard, almost formal piece of writing soon devolved into a piteous apology, my emotions working their way into every letter and punctuation mark, every space until my eyes began to sting and the ink and white began to blur. That painful hollowness that Id suffered since that awful day seven years ago began to ache and I had to force myself to carry on writing. I told him everything, apologised for not writing sooner, explained how our mother had deliberately prevented me from staying in contact with him but that I never forgot, no, I didnt, I always, always remembered. 

I got my first response a couple of days later. Sam thought something was wrong because I screamed out loud when I saw the address. He came bolting in from the bedroom. 

Laney? What the fuck is going on? Are you okay? Whats the 

He replied. Id said with tears in my eyes, looking up from the envelope I held with shaking hands.

 Sams broad shoulders slumped slightly as he let out a breath. He ran a hand through his messy hair. Thats . . . thats good, right? Its what you wanted?

 I nodded my head, unable to speak. He came to sit next to me. 

Open it when youre ready.

 I was ready. I practically tore the envelope to shreds to get to the letter. I waited for that sweet, eluding feeling of the familiar to hit me as my eyes scanned the letter. I wanted to recognise my brothers handwriting, wanted to immediately identify the voice of his writing, in the way that one can always recognise the markings of loved ones. But nothing. I couldnt remember his handwriting, couldnt place the tone of his letter. It bothered me for a split second, but I shoved it away and continued reading anyway.

*Hey sis*


*Long time no see, huh? Long time no chat. Long, long, long time. Ive missed you. Very much. Life here is dull and boring and I often think about how life wouldve been had I not been sent here. What would I be doing right now? What would my life have become, were it not for these walls and fences and angels? I dont know.*

*Ive had years to think and clarify my mind, Laney. Years that served me well to redefine who I am. But I need my sister to help me piece things back together.*

 *I need you.*

 *Please, if its not too much to ask, please come and see me? I would very much like it if you visited me. What would you do for family?*


*Much love,*


*Your Loving Brother*

I held the letter to my chest, still crying. Beside me, Sam scratched his head. 

Laney, was your brother always this, um . . . He scrambled for the right word. Sam was the kind of guy who thought very carefully about everything he said. He never just blurted things out. 

I shot him a glare. This what, Sam?

 He swallowed and shrugged his shoulders. This . . . I dont mean to offend you or him, you know that, but this . . . strange-sounding. I guess. 


Well how about you spend a near-decade in an asylum for the sole reason of preserving your fucked-up familys reputation, then get back to me so I can see how normal you sound.

 He bristled. Look, babe, Im not trying to be a dick about it, Im just saying that 


I didnt think I would ever get a chance to see him again. I didnt think he would ever want to see me again. This is . . . more than I could ever have hoped for and I just want to enjoy it, please, just let me have this. You have no idea the hell weve been through together. 

Sam was quiet for a long time, then, finally, he put a hand on my shoulder. Alright. Okay. Just, be careful, will you? 

Cole and I corresponded for several weeks before I finally decided to go and see him and he was very excited. Sam offered to take me, but I wanted, needed to do this on my own. I told him that maybe one of these days, he could come and visit Cole so the two could get a chance to meet. I decided to take my own car. I had taken all of the letters and the business card so I have the directions on hand. It took about three hours to get there from our little place in the city.

 My apprehension began to skyrocket the moment I crossed from city terrain to woodlands. 

The number of cars on the road began to drop until it was just me, driving along a long, winding road uphill with thick foliage on either side and mist beginning to creep along the way. I kept on checking the business card to make sure I had the right address. The place seemed extremely isolated. I still had my phone on me, so I wasnt too worried. Finally, I reached the gates of the institution. The mist had congealed, wrapping around the foundation of the building like thick, ghastly tendrils. 


It was late afternoon, but the sun was eclipsed by heavy clouds. The gates were derelict, run-down, the definition of unkempt. And the statues . . . there were about five statues resting on the property large, marble figures with giant wings, weeping in stony eternal silence, freezing the blood in my veins. The gate was open. I walked in and followed the path until I reached the building. 

The door was also unlocked.

 I entered cautiously, suddenly terrified. The foyer was empty; the box where a secretary would ordinarily sit and conduct the administration looked pitifully vacant. There was a vague unpleasant smell permeating the air, something that made my insides recoil. The place obviously hadnt been cleaned in eons but why the fuck was it empty?

 Id never been to a mental institution before so I had no idea about how things were meant to be but I was sure thered have to be people milling about, doctors and assistants and . . . and . . .

. . . something was so very, very wrong. 

For some or other reason, I didnt whip out my phone and call my boyfriend. Or the police. I continued down the dark corridor, slowly as I could, trepidation dictating every halting step. The hallways were filled with the kind of silent darkness that seeps into your soul and makes you want to squirm out of your skin. I prayed for any kind of noise, any voice because in the few minutes Id spent in that abandoned asylum, I felt the most alone I ever had in my entire life. You dont realise how comforting a human presence can be until youre deprived of it.

  I could hear soft music come from the mess hall. Hope began to bloom within some stupid, stupid part of me and I followed the magical sounds as though the notes could pull me with invisible strings. The tune was catchy, a gentle lilt that, on a day not marred by nightmares, might have me taping my foot or humming along to the cheery guitar and colourful piano and rhythmic bongo drums reminiscent of happier memories, smiling times.


*Sweet, sweet, darling wont you be mine*


*Youre a-breakin my heart, little baby*


*Oh wont you be mine*


*The things I could show you*


 I walked toward the room and stopped just outside of the threshold. I took a deep breath, my nose turning up because the smell was stronger here. 


*I swear to you my honey*


*This is the start of something a-new*


*Wont you be mine b-b-baby*


*Sweet, sweet darling wont you be mine*


I opened the door. The lighting was poorer in here the overhead lamps had begun to flicker, casting the room in greys of alternating brightness. There was a table in the centre of the room, laden with pots and pans and plates and cutlery and chunks of meat and rotten fruit. The room itself was barren-looking, stark white except for the splashes of crimson decorating the tiles and walls, as though someone had tried to liven up the dcor a little bit. 

Blood. 

Blood on the walls, on the tiles, on the table.

 And in the chairs each supported a lifeless body, a patient or doctor, faces engraved in an eternal grimace that looked half pained and half shocked. A terrifying expression. Flies had begun to feast on their flesh. 

I fell to my knees and vomited. 


*Oh, honey*


*Wont you set me free*


*Oh little darlin Im begging please*


*Be mine, mine, mine*



There was movement in one of the dark corners untouched by the meagre light. A voice was singing along to the tune, fingers snapped in appreciation of the melody. After I puked up my guts, I wiped my mouth, shaking. Then I saw him, or at the very least, an outline of him, a darker shadow against shadow. He slowly began to move away from the corner, still singing along, still snapping his fingers.


*Oooh when you look at me with those pretty, pretty eyes*


*Honey I cant breathe yeah you got me hypnotized*


*With those playful hips and those devilish lips*


*Ooh baby come a little closer*

He stepped into the light. The scream Id been keeping inside came out as a whimper. 

His face. 

He was small, even smaller than I am, and seemed to be permanently hunched over, his gait halted. He looked painfully skinny, bones protruding through thin flesh that seemed washed of any colour, pale as one of the corpses seated around the table. He kept on tilting his head from side to side, dipping his chin ever so slightly, as though his neck couldnt support the weight of his head. His eyes seemed bulbous in comparison to his emaciated shell of a body, his gaze intense and glazed with insanity. And his smile. His teeth were bloody. I didnt want to know whose blood was in his mouth. His grin was almost inhumanly wide, barely moving as he continued singing that damned song. 


*Come with me my honey*


*Ill take you far away*


*Baby cant ya see that when youre with me*


*You wont ever have to change nuh-no*


Tears sprang from my eyes. Where . . .where was Cole? I couldnt see him anywhere. He definitely was not the monster standing in front of me. He wasnt . . . one of the corpses around the table. Where the fuck was my brother?! 


*Almost free baby baby*


*Almost free*


*Youll be free when youre with me*


*Be mine*


The music ended abruptly. We stood there, staring at each other, him still bearing that demonic-looking grin. What was he? There was no way . . .no way he could be a human being. Right? Surely, surely this was not possible. He took a step toward me and I stumbled back, still on my hands and knees. His smile tilted downwards a fraction. 

Laney, what kind of greeting is that for your brother?


You are not my brother! I shouted, surprised at the force in my voice despite the tears rolling down my cheeks. He cocked his head to the side in a sharp, feral movement.

 I am, Laney, I am. Weve been talking for weeks now. This is who Id been talking to? I was vaguely aware of the heaving of my chest as I began to sob violently. 

No, no, no, no , no, no, no, no, no, no . . . 

His smile perked up again. 

Ah, you mean other brother. Come with me. 

He performed his stilted walk out of the door behind him, still humming that tune. I didnt know what else to do. Everything was so surreal it was like witnessing the very glass of your reality begin to fracture, then shatter before your eyes. Real? Nightmare? So confused, so, so confused. I eventually followed him down the corridor, keeping a safe distance, or as relatively safe a distance as I could in this situation. He led me to another room and cheerfully opened the door. 

Quiet. Other brother is sleeping. He giggled conspiratorially. I walked in and stopped short. I fell to my knees for the second time that day, taking in the tag dubbing the wearer as Cole Dreyton. It was Cole, familiar dark hair wild and tousled, familiar green eyes staring out at me, familiar mouth set in a grim line. My features. My twin. My brother, hanging from the roof of his cell with a rope tied around his neck, skin taking on the pallor of the newly deceased.

 I found 364 letters stuffed in his pillow, all addressed to me, unsent, never going to be sent. Each ending with that same line about how *we have to stick together, Lane*. I couldnt feel anything, I wish I did. I would give anything to feel, to feel the sting of heartache, the bite of anger, the shunt of rage. 

But all I could summon was an aching, quiet numbness. 

The worst pain is the kind you cant feel. 

Dead. 

Dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead, dead.

 Dead. 

Dead. 

I must have sat in that cell for hours. Eventually, that strange little creature pulled me out and led me back to the table where he said hed prepared tea, just for me. I sat there, not really taking anything in, not registering anything beyond the coldness of my seat and the smell of stale blood and the same song being played  on repeat over and over again.

 And again. 

***

Its been a few days. The battery on my phone is about to die. Ive been ignoring everyones messages and phone calls. 

I just wanted to post this. 

I dont know what to call this person so he just made me call him Brother. Things dont really make sense anymore: the stale, dead air is just air to me, the decomposing bodies have formed part of the furniture and that song, well, its growing on me. 


Brother tells me we have to stick together. We have to and although I hated him at first, Im starting to come around, I think. Im getting better. I dont know how he managed to take control of the entire asylum. 

Hes very persuasive. 

I cried when I realised Id forgotten about him because I promised. I promised to always remember, but more importantly, to never forget. Brother forgives me though, says it wasnt my fault. 

I was sick. But Im getting better. Im finally starting to look like him, too, so its nice.

 Im not used to not having someone in the world share my face.

 I missed having a twin, but now I feel more complete, I guess. Half of a whole. 

Like being dead twice. 

Brother says he is getting lonely again, although he assures me he loves having me around. 

Thats why Im posting. 

We miss you. 

You probably forgot about us, but we have never forgotten about you. Come and visit us, wont you? We can have tea, catch up, remind you about us, about your family.  Silly, naughty you for forgetting! Haha!


*Sweet, sweet, darling wont you be mine*


*Youre a-breakin my heart, little baby*


*Oh wont you be mine*


*The things I could show you*


Sorry, I love that song. Anyhoo, my phone is about to die but were waiting. Waiting for you, like he waited for me. Missing you. Its been a long time. Long, long, long time. Life is getting dull. We need some excitement again. 


*Almost free baby baby*


*Almost free*


*Youll be free when youre with me*


*Be mine*


We cant wait to see you. Its been such a long time. I know visiting can be a chore but . . . what would you do for family?

Much love,

Your loving Brother and Sister </TEXT>
