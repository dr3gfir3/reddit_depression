	<TITLE> Odd Bone pooling </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-03 07:03:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the event is over.  And we only have 1 week to made our /modreq's for spawning skelly/zombie horses.  After the odd bones I gave krapps, I'm left with 14. So I can spawn 2 more horses, and then I'll have 4 left.  I'm guessing a lot of people will have similar odd numbers of odd bones leftover.  

I want to keep 1 more to put in an item frame, which means I have 3 more to donate to a pool, to try to get as many spawned as possible.  

Also if you might be wondering why - we're starting to develop the Rose catacombs (spooky underground areas) and I thought these horses would make a nice addition to those areas as decorations.  

Since I imagine most people want to keep one of each horse for personal decoration, any excess horses to add to catacombs decoration would be appreciated!

TL;DR - I write a lot, wow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So as we've recently discovered, a few of us are musicians/in bands/etc...

And a few of us have tracks recorded and whatnot.

Well, let's make a soundcloud compilation "album" of songs we've made, whythefucknot? 

There are a few people I know who make music in some way off the top of my head -

Weed_Pancakes, saskuel, DuckThatGoesMoo, me...I could swear we have more than that though.  I know for instance Flump loves music production, though I haven't heard anything of his yet...

Anyway, just thought it would be a neat side project kinda thing.

Would a B/W episode work?  Or would it clash too much with the rest of the series?  

If it could be done well, I think a B/W-only episode would be amazing.  But, that's only if it could be done well. If it's just a typical episode but shot in grayscale it probably wouldn't work. 

Let's say a Sin City b/w version of an episode came up.  Would it just be too weird?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Below is a list of projects. If you think of something that isn't here, just add it below! And if you're claiming a project just say the number below in comments.

1) Nether Portal area redesign. Main goals - making it spawn-proof. So, lots of slabs/glass/leaves/ice/etc. Mostly enclosed with doors/gates/(I don't know?) leading to the rest of the nether.

2) PVE arena help. I've started doing some stuff with this on the planning server but frankly I'm kinda starting to run out of ideas. Right now we really just want a basic design done, primarily walls, so we can build those up in PVE and get the area protected.

3) Pretty-up the ceiling in the carts station, and/or possibly the drop wall. The ceiling in the station is just stone mostly now, would be nice to have something else there. And our return rail is so pretty, the drop wall (just stone/dirt/etc) is pretty ugly compared to it.

4) Enchanting rooms! One by the Town Hall (probably kinda small) for convenience. One by the animal farms (bigger), since that's an area to get XP.  
5) Speaking of Town Hall, removing the pumpkins/cactus/netherwart that's in front of it now, and making that area pretty. Most of that ring area is just acacia trees, but particularly in front of the Town Hall, it would be nice to have nicer gardens. Water, flowers, etc.

6) A better sheep farm, in the area with the barn/etc. Where the differently colored sheep are in their own pens, and the area is safe from mobs coming in and exploding the sheep.

7) Carbon - 2 things here actually.  7a - making it mob proof (lots of slabs/glass/leaves/etc) and 7b - making it pretty (up to your discretion.)

8) Roads! Within the city we need the 400 (diamond shaped) road finished, it's about 1/4 done so far.  We'd also like to extend the South road all the way to Itamashi, using the Spawn road design.  Same goes for making the East road to the world's edge.

9) Iron grinder pod-widening.  You know those random holes in the North side of town, where the iron golems drop?  Their holes are only 2x2.  We'd like them 4x4, with signs placed inside the edges to prevent water flow.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Am I the only one who thinks the "6 days to air" format is kinda hurting the series? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-26 06:23:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From someone who loves South Park, and also loves the NFL (while also thinking there are a lot of problems with the NFL), this episode just seemed....really really forced to me.  I didn't even slightly chuckle, though the Jerry Jones eyes made me smile at least.

This whole "6 days to air" thing in order for episodes to be relevant...yeah it can work some times.  But I'd rather see them go back to making Casa Bonita styled episodes that have nothing to do with anything, personally.  

This episode just seemed to be trying **so hard** to make a point, that the jokes were predictable and stale.  I mean, if you're a fan of the NFL, and spent any time at all on /r/NFL, a lot of the jokes from this episode have basically already been told there.  In fact, I'd say there have been a few jokes on /r/NFL that were actually better than anything in this episode.  ("You're a fucking Redskin!" "Wow I...didn't think Redskin was offensive until now...")  I mean even the very start, where the kids keep saying random offensive things, and having seen the ad/preview for the new episode, I thought, "Oh I get it! They're trying to come up with a name that's more offensive than 'Redskins' and failing!"  But no.  

I mean there were lots of great little touches in this episode that were amusing; the woman in the elevator screaming, the Redskin player "killing" a server by ramming it with his head, and then showing obvious symptoms of a concussion after...

I guess I'm just saying, this episode seemed to be more about making a point than making a funny episode.  And while a big part of why I love South Park is because they can usually do both at once, in the past few seasons it seems they lean more heavily on one side or the other.  "This episode we're making a statement about a current event.  Next episode we're just gonna be silly.  Then after that, we need to make another statement."  

**TL;DR** - I think with a little more time working on/polishing scripts, they'd end up with a better end result.  Episodes in recent seasons definitely show that they're being "rushed".  (IMO, of course.)

	<TITLE> [General Question re:Proxy Services] Would using one of these services "hide" whether I'm streaming or not on various network analysis tools? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-15 04:55:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll try to keep this short.

Friends with people who own/run my ISP.  They've installed...some sort of "service"...I have an "unlimited" download/bandwidth account, but for video streaming services in particular, there's a 2.5 MBps limit.  (I live in a rural area, it's free for me so I can't complain.)

**This part semi-technical but also TL;DR'ed as much as possible, can skip?** 

I use a variety of streaming video websites because it is football season, and sometimes it takes a few tries from a few different websites until I find a suitable stream.  I also have many roommates.  So, say I'm home alone, I can watch a ~2MBps stream no problems.  But if someone watches a youtube video, or netflix, or whatever...then my connection is basically halved by each additional connection.  It's a network-wide implementation so there's no particularly easy way to exempt me from the rules.  

**Continued..**

Does using a proxy service hide what type of format (streaming video) my computer is using?  Thus, letting me use the maximum download speed for streams, as opposed to a 2.5 MBps shared connection for anything marked as a video stream/format? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The unofficial "official" modpack of Rose City </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-04 18:26:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thanks to pez for setting this up for everyone.  

First you need to use Technic Launcher to run minecraft instead of whatever you're currently using (Magic Launcher, Forge, etc.)  [Download Technic Launcher here](http://www.technicpack.net/download)

Once that's installed, and running, on the left side you'll see a "Add Mod Pack" button.  Click that, and it will ask for a URL, and you paste in there -  

http://api.technicpack.net/modpack/rosepack

This modpack includes -  
Zyins HUD, which includes the horse info stuff.  
Journey Map, which adds a minimap and lets you set waypoints and other features.  
Optifine.  
Schematica, plus Forge and Lunitarius Core which are both required to run Schematica.  

One note about using the Zyins HUD - if you go to the options page for Zyins, on the second page of options you *must* disable any of the "aid" options - Ender Pearl Aid, Torch Aid, Eating Aid, Potion Aid.  Those are not allowed by the server, and you may possibly be kicked/banned if caught using them.  

Edit: Oh one other thing, Technic will create a new minecraft installation, so you'll have to change settings again once it's up and running.  It won't delete your old minecraft.   </TEXT>

Part of me thinks that, let's say best case scenario - Bradford gets signed to a good team next season as backup, the starter goes down...does his history of injuries "cause" him to just not play well as the starter?  (too timid/afraid/etc?)

Have there been players in the past that had their first 3-5 years marred by injuries, but they've been able to bounce back and play at a high level after that?  And, how many instances have there been of players with similar high-draftpick/injury-histories that just sunk into the shadows?   </TEXT>

Personally, I'm finishing up a few minor projects here and there, but for the rest of the week I don't have much else to do but play tourist.  

Thought it might be fun to make an "event" out of it, where a bunch of us all travel from one spot to the next for awhile.  Might be hard to hit all the tourist spots in one go, so maybe Wed/Thurs/Fri, earlyish US times (say noon EST-2pm EST each day?) we form a big group and travel from spot to spot?

	<TITLE> Next rev ideas 3 - Transportation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-15 12:12:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let's say we get a portal - that doesn't mean that will be our only source of transportation.

1) Roads - our colored roads this rev worked fantastically.  I'm hoping that our road-builders will be back again to help out next rev; but that doesn't mean they won't need help.  Which doesn't just mean help building roads but also, for instance, setting up a quick ice farm/shearing a ton of sheep/collecting resources in general.  

2) Rails - Boring, but you get lots of diamonds and find unexplored caves!

3) A "standard" height for roads (3 blocks), for instance when digging through mountains or whatever, so that they're horse-friendly. 

4) Are we going to bother with canals again? It seemed like this mode of transport required some of the largest amount of time with the least amount of actual use. While I think the canals are pretty, they also seem mostly useless.

5) Overland rail - this ended up becoming my second-favorite method of transportation (after horses) by the end of the rev.  Is it worth selecting a few nearby neighbors (wherever we end up) to connect an overland rail to, even if we have a CARTS/CARBON connection?  Or should that be a later priority?

6) I had another point here but I forget. Edit: I remember now!  Stables!  Smaller/temporary stables near attractions (iron grinder etc), but also smaller stables for the town itself in general.  Rather than one huge stable at town center, have 4 small/medium sized ones in each quadrant of Rose, so people are never too far from their horse no matter where they live.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Next rev ideas 2 - City-wide "standard" build, along the lines of acacia roofs this rev. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-15 11:42:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1) How did y'all feel about that this rev?  

2) There have been a few ideas tossed around about this for next rev, but nothing at all concrete yet.  So any ideas you have are appreciated!

3) For instance, coco recently submitted links of Russian architecture such as [this](http://i.imgur.com/XrZ32.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/Vc5Ht.jpg) and [this](http://i.imgur.com/tNJ9v.jpg).  Obviously, saying the whole town could only build in red and white would be waaaaaaay overbearing. *If* this idea is implemented, it would only be for the main buildings (town hall, farms, so on).  

3b) But, we could say to use cobble/stonebrick for roofs, similiar to acacia this rev.  The advantages being that cobble/stonebrick can be made into stairs (popular as a roof material) and it's more easily obtained.  Gray also works well with a number of color combos (red/white as pictured, or red/green, or white/green, and others).  

4) If we're going for a "standard roof" idea again next rev, it seems it should be something that can be made into stairs/slabs, which unfortunately rules out a number of materials/colors.  

5) Is the standard roof played out?  I still think it looks awesome on the livemap but who knows, maybe that's just me?  Maybe there's some other way to make an impression on the livemap without requiring a standard roof?  (For instance, one idea that's been floated out is make a dome encompassing the entire city built out of snow, like those snow globes, in which case, a standard roof is completely unnecessary.) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-08-15 11:31:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1) To Portal or not to Portal?  That is the question.

2) If Portal - We'll need to work out search parties. I suggest that everyone who thinks they'll be around at the start of the rev focus purely on one quadrant of the map (say, South East).  We then (in this post) work out search team groups.  So, say, 3 people loosely spread out and head primarily east.  3 primarily south.  Another 6 primarily SE.  With others "filling in the gaps" so to speak.  That way we could "cover" a quadrant of the map with searchers, rather than everyone running randomly and hoping for the best.

2b) This would require some mumble coordination most likely.  I know a lot of us are averse to mumble, but we'd probably need a bit better coordination than clanchat for this. (Edit: I do have access to a private teamspeak server which I'm sure we could use for this initial search.)

3) If Not to Portal - then we're likely going to 0,1000 again?  Yes, it's a *minor* inconvenience having to go to Spawn to get to a portal, but it's not that bad really. But hop on a horse, take CARTS or CARBON or Overland rail for 1 minute...it really ain't so bad.  

3b) Do we have a team set up an initial build at 0,1000 just in case we don't find a portal, so we have a backup?  

3c) If we choose to go to 0,1000, or end up there cause we don't find a portal, we would need some dedicated rail builders.  It's not the most glamorous position, but I for one could do that since I'm not exactly the most talented builder.  

Also as a disclaimer yaddayadda - if an idea here ends up the most upvoted, it doesn't necessarily mean it will be implemented, just that the mayors will take it heavily into consideration and all that jazz.   </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-08-15 11:11:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1) basic idea - say there's a link on your town's subreddit that you would like everyone in the town to read, /mail send c:rosecity http://reddit.com/r/mcrosecity/plstoread

2) I can easily see how this idea could overwhelm server resources, so it could A) only ~~mayors~~ clanchat owners could use this feature to send mails, and/or B) the mail doesn't *have* to be sent instantaneously, but say one user gets mailed per minute...so a large town (150 users), it takes 150 minutes to send each user the mail.

3) I dunno...maybe even, if user(x) hasn't been active in (y) number of days, the mail doesn't bother sending to them.  

You mods and admins do a ton for us already, so if this idea is just silly hard to implement no worries! I just thought it might be a nice feature to have in order to aide city/town/group coordination.  (/mail send c:spleef reminder guys, spleef tomorrow!)

	<TEXT> Other than the genre and timeframe, the only other clues I can really give are (I *think*) the album was like one long song, almost.  Where like, one song would kinda blend into the next song.  *Maybe* it was a mix that they turned into an album, can't recall exactly.

I also think the group name had two words in it, with Electronic (or some variation) being one of the words.  Like Electronic Cannibals, or Electronica Thieves, or Electronic Ninjas...or something like that.  

Sorry for being so vague, but it was 10 years ago that I got this CD from a friend and at some point the CD disappeared from my collection.  Lately things just keep reminding me about them and I want to give it a listen again.

Since electronica can be fairly vague, it was most in the style of, say, Prefuse73 or Caribou/Manitoba style, but a little more danceable?  [Listening to this mix by Jon Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQiWz80RqRI) was the latest thing that made me think of that group again, though I don't think they were quite as polished as that mix.

Also there were no vocals, purely instrumental, if that helps.  (Maybe some voice samples, but not many if so.) </TEXT>

Sorry for being so vague, but it was 10 years ago that I got this CD from a friend and at some point the CD disappeared from my collection.  Lately things just keep reminding me about them and I want to give it a listen again.

Oh and edit for a little more clarity: since electronica can be fairly vague, it was most in the style of, say, Prefuse73 or Caribou/Manitoba style, but a little more danceable?  [Listening to this mix by Jon Hopkins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQiWz80RqRI) was the latest thing that made me think of that group again, though I don't think they were quite as polished as that mix.

Edit2: Thanks for all the help so far, even if strikeouts!  Also there were no vocals, purely instrumental, if that helps.  

Hey at least I'm getting a lot of good music recommendations from this! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'd like to see a "new PVE rev" meeting held here, instead of mumble. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-11 02:36:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a list of reasons, the TL;DR of which is - more feedback from a wider audience, less timezone bias, less of a "circlejerk" bias (just hearing feedback from the same/only people who ever use mumble).  

From clanchats and general chats, it seems a lot of people would participate in a thread on this sub, rather than an arbitrary/timezone-exclusive/specific-program-exclusive thread.

Anyone can reply to this thread, that has a web browser and reddit account (which, as the "official/unofficial server of reddit" and how most people find their way here) means a majority of people can reply.  Whereas forums/mumble require separate accounts/apps, plus being able to logon at the right time...

Basically, if we want the largest amount of feedback from the widest range of users, we should talk about it here.  If we just want to hear from the "elite"/"power-users" then mumble/forum. What's the balance we're looking for, here?  

Edit: "sorry" for asking for a better method of community feedback? ~~4~~ 6 downvotes already without a single response?  I thought mcpublic was better than that...

Edit 2 : Seriously, if you disagree with me, at least say why? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Two things - First (and primarily) it's likely a new rev (possibly a short one) is coming soon, so let's start planning in earnest. Second, let's host the next spleef tourney? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-04 04:52:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 1) I posed awhile back about plans for next rev, but I was probably a bit premature with that post.  However, with the recent mumble meetings, it seems a new rev is probably coming soon. Also from the mumble meetings, it seems there might likely be a (short) rev next, while waiting for 1.8 plugins to update, and then another new rev.  

So...

A) There were some good ideas from diffi and pez (and others) regarding next rev, but now it seems like the next rev might be so short (3 months possibly?) that some of those ideas would be better saved for the next rev that would presumably last longer.

B) Rose planning server!  Let's not let this valuable resource go to waste, courtesy of twil. 

C) This post is just to generate ideas and discussion.  It seems the "central dome" idea has fallen to the wayside, but a nice central meeting place is still a good idea.  Moving certain farms (hopper-intensive ones) away from the dome, and moving others closer (like the veggie farms) would be good.  I'm sure others have ideas for semi-basic tweaks that could improve performance in Rose.  

D) Let's just get some ideas flowing people! Even if they're blue-sky/silly ideas, let's hear them and maybe we can make the silly ideas realistic.  

2) Spleef - Ghrey and I won the last tourney in Orbit.  I now have a spare beacon which I plan on donating to a future cause.  I'm happy to donate it to the winners of a Rose spleef tourney.  

A) If we're hosting, what other gifts can we round up?  We can't donate ONE beacon, because winnings have to be able to be divided equally.  (I could donate my second beacon if y'all felt like helping me replace one of them...)  Diamond blocks, emerald blocks, etc... would be nice.  

B) People stacker!  We got it pretty tall last time, but I think we could get it even taller!  If we agree to host the next spleef tourney then I'd like to see more of y'al turn up for the next event!

**TL;DR** - Time to seriously consider the next rev, and possibly the one after that.  And let's gather some prizes for winners of the next time we host spleef, whether next time (this Saturday) or next! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I propose a slight(?) variation to the Uber project. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-28 08:25:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Make it in the Over World, but have it spreading from "the nether" (bedrock) up.

1) Dig to bedrock, spread nether rack/brick up from there.  Then build the uber project in the over world from there.

2) It's already, as the name implies, a super project/ordeal.  Add into that equation the location (fairly hard to get to) and the location (hard to transport materials to) and the location (ghasts while climbing ladders and potentially angry pigmen) makes it a good bit more difficult.

3) Uber seems to basically be dead in the water at this point. I haven't seen an /c #uber message in quite some time, and the construction site is the exact same as I last saw it 2ish weeks ago?  

So, take the same basic Uber idea, except have it be like the nether is "leaking" into the over world.  Easier for people to reach + easier to transport materials = easier to get people to join in generally? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First - I was very opposed to the Uber project since it took place in the nether, and that would hurt skull hunting.  But since most of my beacon projects are over, I'm mostly over that objection. 

Second - The Uber project seems basically dead at this point.  Really it looks like almost everyone has given up on it.

Third - so...how about we take over the project?  Not necessarily "officially" make it a rose project, but it seems a number of us are at loose ends lately (what with the town being built up) so a community effort may provide good results.  I mean, we recently decided to build a PVP arena and a handful of us were able to combine resources and finish it in a pretty short amount of time.

So how about we pitch in and give a good ole community effort to finish the Uber project?

	<TITLE> So...about those villager traders? Just trying to find out what's possible, not trying to whine. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-22 05:26:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Block grief?  It can be rolled back easily (I'm assuming?) enough.  Animal grief? They can be replaced or easily bred again. 

But villagers. That shit takes hours.  And a ton of resources.  I was sitting on 3 stacks of emerald blocks, and it took all that (and more) just to get 2 new paper traders, which were both broken within a week.

Now, it's true, we could all just lock down all our villagers, make them all trusted users only, have to break a block which requires region perms, other security measures like that.  But many of those kinda seem contrary to the nature of the server, which is let (practically) anything and everything be open to anyone?  

It's just that, as opposed to other forms of grief, 5 seconds of negligence/intent can cause 4+ hours of work to restore.  

Some thoughts just off the top of my head - 

1a) change the "planned restart" message to a different color than all of the other messages from the alert list.  Bottom line is, there are so many alerts I just sorta tune them out.  30 alerts, all the same color...it's kinda easy to gloss over them. 

1b) Specifically mention in the "planned restart" message to close your inventory and STOP TRADING.  I know if you open your inventory there's an anvil noise/warning.  Again though, the "planned restart" message is the same color as every other server message (29 of which can be ignored) it seems any extra attention to the fact would help.  Change the planned restart message to include things like close inventory/stop trading?  

2) Is it even possible to have a server plugin just ignore villager trading 60 seconds before restart?  I'm ignorant of this sorta stuff.

3) Any non-server-side suggestions for how to help this problem?  Solace has gone through 7 Bob's.  Aypop/Seneca has had a similar number of issues. Within 1 week of discovering both of Rose's paper traders were broken, and then replaced, both of the new ones were broken.

It's just reaching the point, and pardon my french, but how many damn freakin hours are we going to spend on this problem before we can find a workable solution?  

Surely we can come up with something that doesn't involve "permanently lock down all villagers and only allow them under intense supervision."  I hope?

	<TITLE> Rose City needs heads! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-21 05:50:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Soooo... the Rose City Head Museum has finished construction! (Note to self : never build an erdtZAC design again.)  One problem, however, is the design accounts for 117 heads, and we have around...36.  

First - any noteworthy past players/mayors that may have been missed during the head-hunting? (For instance, noticing I don't have a FrankLloydCrank head.)

Second - was going to do a "friends of Rose" section.  People who aren't a part of Rose but are good friends (already have Flumper and Aypop and the admins, could add ghrey303 and more people along those lines.)

Submit some names, and let's have a dopple killing day soon.  

Edit: I guess a list of whom we have so far would be handy.  Thought I'd break it down into four sections (since there are 4 areas to place heads).  1) current/prominent members.  2) members who may not have been around all that much. 3) Past members (previous to this rev).  4) Friends of Rose.

In section 1 we have -  sisigwithrice, assasymphoni, krapps, zomise, y0urwhitefriend, kevo, erdtzac,  difficult and dickicult, twilexis, starlight, tic   ice, super__coconut, sneakypablos, pez   merp, sylkre, skiflea, rivae, dannie williams, quzzarboy, (adding SourPickleEater, can't believe I forgot D: )

2) aghe87, temporarilyalone, santibanez, admanta, scarybilbo

3) claff319(?), axisarchon, soon to add  tyran, lloyd, duck, cream, clefe

4) have buzzie, kitcat, totemo, would like to add the rest of the mods/admins, flumper, aypop, soon to add ghrey303 and open to other suggestions.  

Also in the trusted chests there is a book and quill to add any names there, or comment here. </TEXT>

Arjen Robben - 2 / 3  
Karim Benzema - 1 / 2

________

**Netherlands 3 - 2 Australia**

Goals in - 20th Minute (NED) - 21st Minute - (AUS) - 54th Minute (AUS) - 58th Minute (NED) - 68th Minute (NED)

Notes : 

Australia officially eliminated following Chile's victory over Spain.  

Tim Cahill has scored 50% of Australia's World Cup goals.  He also may have played his last match in the World Cup as his second Yellow Card means he'll miss Australia's final match against Spain.

______

**Chile 2 - 0 Spain**

Goals in - 20th Minute - 43rd Minute

Notes : 

Spain eliminated following their loss.  This is the fastest the former Champion has been eliminated in World Cup history.  (Not including Italy in 1950, who played in only a three team group.  1966 Brazil, 2002 France and 2010 Italy all had a chance to move on coming into their third match, while Spain was eliminated after two.)

Depending on the Spain - Australia match's outcome, Spain may also have the worst goal differential of former Champtions in World Cup History.  (They will need to win by 5 goals to tie the worst goal differntial; they will need to score 3 to tie the most GF.)

________

**Croatia 4 - 0 Cameroon**

Goals in - 11th Minute - 48th Minute - 61st Minute - 73rd Minute

Notes : 

Alexandre Song served a straight red card in the 40th Minute with an ugly punch to the back of Croatian player Modric.

Cameroon could have faced a second Red Card near the end of the match with some team in-fighting.

Switzerland equalizer at 48th minute - 1-1  
Switzerland go-ahead goal at 93rd minute - 2-1

Other notes : Switzerland's go-ahead became the latest game-winning goal in World Cup history!

**France 3 - 0 Honduras**  
France scores in 45th minute - 1-0  
France scores in 48th minute - 2-0  
France scores in 72nd minute - 3-0  

Other notes : Honduras's Wilson Palacios receives the ~~first~~ second Red Card of the tournament so far.

**Argentina 2 - 1 Bosnia and Herzegovina**  
Argentina scores in 3rd minute - 1-0 (Own Goal by BIH)  
Argentina scores in 65th minute - 2-0  
Bosnia and Herzegovina scores in 85th minute - 2-1

Other Notes : Watching the replay of Argentina's second goal, there was a slight deflection off a Bosnian player so, in a way, both of Argentina's goals were Own Goals by BIH.  (Though the second was likely to go in regardless of the slight deflection.)  

Also - Bosnia and Herzegovina's first appearance in the World Cup finals, and also their first goal!  While some other nations have visited the World Cup multiple times and failed to score a goal yet.

Also - On the other end of the spectrum, BIH has scored the fastest Own Goal in World Cup history.  

**Golden Boot leaders as of today**

Robin Van Persie - 2 goals  
Neymar - 2 goals  
Karim Benzema - 2 goals  
Arjen Robben - 2 goals

	<DATE> 2014-06-09 11:12:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Here is a small album of shots explaining the numbers of the forces from previous/current episode.](http://imgur.com/a/HvAJo)

Image 1 - From the previous episode, it's stated quite clearly there are 102 Crows left.

Image 2   3 - Screenshots (from the current episode) of the (South of the Wall) Wildling encampment (Ygritte, Tormund, the Thenns, etc).  It's hard to get a precise count, but it looks to be around 24 of them. (Note: After counting deaths later, it was likely closer to 30-35.)

Image 4 - Ygritte estimates 20 Crows are guarding the castle, while the rest are on top of the wall.  Note: It's not like she has x-ray vision so she doesn't know how many are inside buildings/etc.

After that point, it'd be a shitton of screencaps to show every single death.  But here are my notes while rewatching - 

Crows - 102 - 101 charging the gate - 100 23:07 - 99 - 23:31 - 98 23:40 - 97 - 96 - 95 (tormund knocks 3 out but doesn't necessarily kill them) - 94 (giant arrow) - 93 (i think? 27:47) - 92 - 91 - 90 (possibly) - 89 - 88/87/86 (ygritte) - 85 (storming the kitchen) - 84 beheading - 83 pyp - 82 allister dies - 81 thenn kill - 77 (oil explosion) - 76 (fail piggyback) - 74 (long shot) - 73 - 70 (tormund/thenn kill spree following ghost) - 64 (defending the inner gate).

Wildling Sneak Attack - ~24? - 21 charging the gate  - 20 allister's first kill - 19 - 18 - 16 - 15 - 14 (i think?) - 13 - 12 boiling water - 11 cleaver - 10 pyp - 9/8 (allister again) - 7 sam kill - 4 (jon in on the action) - 2 (ghost in on the action) - 1 jon before thenn fight - 0 bigbad thenn dies - -1 ygritte - Tormund captured.

So it looks like the Crows still have somewhere around ~70 people to defend following the attack.  I ended up at a -1 count on the Wildlings when Ygritte died so my initial estimate was off, but probably not off by much I guess?  The first time I watched the episode I thought Crows were dropping like flies but after watching again it looks like the deaths were pretty 50/50 between the two camps. 

Some disclaimers/notes :

1) I'm assuming there was a fair bit of artistic license in terms of killings, and the Crows will probably end up with more than 64 people still alive when all is said and done.  But who knows?

2) I only counted what looked like an actual kill.  A lot of people were punched/kicked/knocked down/knifed in the leg or what have you, so they may still be alive.  And maybe even some of the "confirmed" kills weren't necessarily mortally wounded.  

3) Again, it was dark and a lot of them were wearing similar outfits, so a kill credited to the Wildlings might easily have been a Crow kill instead, and vice versa.  

Anyway, as I said a lot of people seemed to think the Crows were getting wiped out and I thought I'd try to put into numbers what the "total" kills were.  And as with a bunch of people fighting with swords it seems it was basically a 1:1 ratio, as you may expect.

Edit: **TL;DR** There were around 25-30 Wildlings attacking the castle south of the wall, they killed around 25-30 Crows, if the show was literal in terms of deaths.  So ~70 Crows left, assuming not too many artistic liberties.   </TEXT>

This show has been so inventive and creative, is it asking so bloody fucking much to ask for a few new fucking songs?

	<TITLE> Next Rev goals/planning. Just a place to post thoughts/ideas, nothing definitive. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-31 18:33:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From general chat and elsewhere - 

1) Going to 0,1000 again.  This has some great pros, a few cons.  It's nice that it's basically halfway between a portal and spawn, so it's not really that inconvenient.  The one thing I would say about trying to get a portal tho, is that it's kinda disheartening how many portal towns are basically empty this rev.  Vinhaven, Argoth, Woodbury, kinda Oasis...all portal towns that are mostly ghost-towns at this point.  So part of me thinks it would be nice to have a portal just so it gets "properly used/developed".  

1b) But, being a (possibly) portal town also generally means more popularity, thus more noobs/griefers/storage-emptiers...so yeah being a portal town would probably mean more work from the higher-ups keeping on top of all of that.

2) Diffi posted some really nice ideas about next rev's planning in terms of town layouts, but I think a few tweaks could be made.  

a) Central Dome - Diffi's new dome is definitely an improvement but...domes are just kinda so easy what with dome-generating algorithms out there and all.  I think we could pull off a nice central/main building that was different.  

b) Moving a lot of farms/grinders outside town central.  I think we all know the obvious benefits from this re:lag.  But one of the things I love about this town is how active the town center is.  It seems I can rarely go downtown without seeing 2+ people in the process, as opposed to (no offense just first thing off the top of my head) Seneca, where all the main farms/grinders seem so spread out that you never bump into anyone else.  I think we could find a good compromise of non-hopper-intensive farms/grinders near the center, and just moving the hoppery things towards the periphery.  

Anyway those were just my recent thoughts on the matter, and of course any and all feedback is encouraged! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure most of you are familiar with the (many) reasons I'd suggest this...

Just seems like a minority of folk provide a majority of supplies, and a minority of others take a majority of supplies.  

I'm not suggesting this purely as a punitive sort of measure, but thinking it might also encourage "some" people to help contribute; i.e. the "general" meat chest is empty so they decide to go breed/kill a lot to resupply, which may help them earn a "trusted" supply room status.  

Just a thought. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Experiencing a weird lighting glitch in nether fortresses, where floors are lit up even with no light source nearby. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Some images for examples](http://imgur.com/a/cP5bH)

We've been trying to make a more efficient wither hunting area, so you don't have to run up and down stairs and through small corridors etc.  There is a lava lake under all of that, but about 40-50 blocks below. I've completely removed all the nether bricks in those areas and there is no hidden lava or glowstone or anything.

Also weird is that a few of these areas, if you just stand still in the middle of the light for between 5-30 seconds, sometimes (but not always) the lit up floor will go dark.  But if you leave that spot, about 30 seconds later it lights up again.  

Oh and some of these lit up areas are directly above pillars, so even if it's the lava ~40 blocks below, how is it transmitting through the pillars that far? And why isn't the whole floor lit up?

And I have seen this happen in other non-modified fortresses as well.

The minecraft wiki/trivia/issues hasn't been much help either, which is why I thought I'd turn to you folks. </TEXT>

We live in an age of DVR's, downloadable matches, hell I wouldn't be surprised if World Cup matches are put up on their website to re-watch after a match.  

I don't want one match's scoreline ruined while watching the other.  If someone feels the opposite and they want to know, they can whip out their phone or hop on their computer or whatever.  

I can't remember which match it was during Champion's League, but I did a really great job of not looking at any popups of the score from the other match...until the 90th minute when I accidentally saw the score and thought, "Well I guess I won't watch that other match I recorded after all..."

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let's try to solve some of to experiment on some of the great unknowns regarding nether spawn rates.  It seems there's lots of speculation and not much fact.

These experiments would have to take time around, say, 3-5 AM PST, as those seem to be the least populated times, so we'd have less interference from people who don't know about this/don't pay attention in chat.  

And if someone has better ideas for experiments just pass it on, I'm not all that knowledgeable about this stuff to begin with.  

The experiment would be varying the # and locations of players in the nether for, say, a 30 min interval each.  

1) 1 person at one fortress, trying to track # of withers in a 30 min interval.

2) 2 people at one fortress, etc.

3) 2 people at two fortresses, on opposite sides of maps, etc.

4) 2 people at two fortresses near one another, etc.

5) 2 people, one at fortress one at random location, etc.

And so on.  

It seems like maybe in this manner we could get a better idea of, say, if a few people are off quartz mining while another is trying to hunt withers, what the likelihood would be.  And...other things.  

Dunno, just a thought. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A big part of why I love DotA2 has nearly nothing to do with the gameplay itself. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-23 02:51:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Don't get me wrong, the gameplay is awesome.  But it's the extra settings that I love so much.

1) Flawlessly handles (in my experience) multiple monitors.  I typically run a dual monitor setup, and sometimes I use my roommates projector to "watch" movies while playing.  D2 + VLC playing IASIP?  No problem.  

In February I got into the Arma2/DayZ mod pretty heavily but...awful dual monitor support.  Other games, they're typically allright at it but every time I install a new game it's a toss-up whether it will work easily or not.

2) Multiple **audio** output support.  This one is much rarer in games.  But, as stated above, I usually have one monitor acting as a "TV" while playing on the main screen.  So I want the audio from the videos I'm watching playing over my speakers.  But Dota2 needs a mic, and I have a headset and what do you know, Dota2 easily works at having video over main speakers and game through the headset.  

This is so much, much, much more rare in games.  DayZ? Either everything through speakers or everything in headphones, no way to split.  Same with Elder Scrolls Online.  Same with Minecraft.  Same with Diablo 3.  Why is this even a problem?  

3) The alt-tab friendliness.  I mean, does this game understand its users or what?  When I solo queue, I play exclusively AR.  Which means usually a 3-5 minute wait.  So...I alt tab to browse reddit.  And, even though as stated above I have D2 playing through headphones, when a game is finally joined guess what happens?!  It plays a noise over my main speakers, so I don't have to wear headphones the whole time, and the icon even flashes on the taskbar!  

Anyway, that's all.   </TEXT>

Also thought it would be useful for current TV shows, but for the non-EST folk.  The Walking Dead, Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad...would have loved to participate in discussion threads for these shows, but I live in PST so I have to stay away from fear of spoilers.  

I only just created the sub and haven't put too much time into it yet, like how to set up threads and stuff like that...but I'm not sure how much interest there is in this thread so I'm not getting into that just yet.  

Just throwing the idea out there.

	<TEXT> My roommate had 3 books on his bookshelf and he highly recommended them.  I was looking for some new reading material so I started the series.

Finished book 1, didn't love it but I did enjoy it.  Finished book 2, eh there seemed to be a good bit of filler material, but I was still enjoying the world/plot.  I finished both of these in one week.

As I picked up book 3 to start, my roommate mentioned, "Oh yeah, there are actually 5 books in the series."  At which point my enthusiasm took a sharp downward turn.  It's been a week since then and I've only made it about 1/4 of the way through book 3 because while I've enjoyed the series, I don't think I like it enough for 5 books worth of reading.  

I look up where I can get the final two books online, and then I discover there are actually **eight** books in the series?!  And now my enthusiasm is totally crushed.  

I've always stayed away from any book series that lasts longer than 3 books.

	<TEXT> I was reading about how the NFL tried to create a "super helmet" to reduce concussions but, ultimately, they found it was impossible to do such a thing because the brain sloshes around inside the skull and there's no real way to stop that.  

I jokingly (at the time) thought - oh so you could just inject some foam inside their skull so the brain doesn't get jostled!

Obviously a silly notion but it did make me wonder is that space between brain/skull necessary?  Aside from injuries are there other instances of the brain swelling from just normal, hum drum reasons?  Even though my "idea" would never be used, theoretically could you inject a foam (or gel or you know what I'm getting at) in that space with no ill effect? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-02-11 02:45:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So first off - I'm not trying to run the game itself on two monitors.  I want my second monitor to play videos while playing.  I do this with almost every game I play, and none of the others has an issue.  

Second - my second monitor is kinda old and doesn't run the same resolution as my primary monitor (1920x1080).  

What happens is - I have a video playing on VLC, I launch DayZ, and the video keeps playing in a way, the audio is still going and if I alt tab the frame catches up to the playback.  But while in DayZ the video itself is frozen on a single frame.  

Anyone have any success getting videos to play while the game is playing?   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Because offseason - How I made my "rest of reddit" experience much greater. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-08 23:31:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Most of us really dislike the rest of reddit for reasons that are pretty understandable.  Well I managed to create a front page that still keeps a lot of the random interesting stuff while ignoring the crap.  

1) First and most obvious is install RES (Reddit Enhancement Suite) and block most of the default subs in the settings/filters area.  There I have, you know, /r/funny /r/adviceanimals etc all filtered so they don't show up. 

Now there are a few different ways to do the next part, I'll start with what I used and then the other ways.

2) I went to "All" and clicked Next until I was several hundred links deep...like links 600-625.  Around this time you'll start finding the highest rated links from fairly obscure subreddits.  Whenever you find a post/sub you like, subscribe to it.  Keep going through these deep /r/all/ links and keep subbing to anything interesting/odd/whatever.  Now when you visit your front page you'll have a diverse/interesting set of links while not having to deal with the crap on regular reddit.

3) Similar idea but different - go to r/all/new/ and do the same thing.  I don't like this as much because all/new can often include a ton of really awful/boring links.

4) Another variation is - go to /r/all and go maybe 100-200 links deep.  Keep this tab open for several days.  Then click "next" after a few days.  You'll start getting links similar to #2, the top links from obscure subs, and they'll again be pretty random while also being the highest rated links from those subs so it helps filter the random crap.  

Happy redditing!   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've (thus far) stumped two subs (/r/gameofthrones and r/woodworking) with this, and google isn't helping much.  

GOT because in one of the episodes, one of the "chores" was spreading a sandy substance on a table and then using a brush to spread it out.  

Was this how primitive societies "sanded" wooden furniture? I always assumed only hand-planes were used, but I guess for touching up day-to-day wear, this makes sense?  

And I'm also totally interested in any other "primitive" woodworking history.  (For instance one of my other theroies was they were using crushed walnuts and the brushing released the oils, re-varnishing the surface...?) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should the NFL ban teams from interviewing position coaches until after the Super Bowl? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-13 02:28:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Chargers fan.  Not blaming this loss on the refs, don't think there's a "conspiracy" to get Manning/Brady.  This pretty much squarely falls on the shoulders of our horrible offensive game plan for the first 3 quarters.  

Which brings me to the point of this post - In the time between beating the Bengals last week and facing the Broncos today, Ken Whissenhunt, our OC, interviewed with **three** teams.  And I can't help but think that (at least partially) explains how sluggish and uninspired our offense looked for most of the game.  

If the Chargers decline requests to interview him, they look like assholes and it makes it less likely people will come to work for us in the future.  

I get it, the new front office wants to get their people in and start building their program right away.  But the offseason is long.  Is 6.5 months instead of 8 such a huge difference?  

Edit: since this keeps coming up; "teams need as much time to prepare..." pretend the Chargers reached the Super Bowl, in that case they'd need to wait those weeks anyway.  And if it was a blanket rule, "NFL teams cannot interview period until after the Super Bowl" all teams would be on equal footing. 

Also coaches frequently talk about how their players should "give 110%" or whatever.  If they're interviewing during playoffs, how can that be taken seriously? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm watching Troy, you know, the Brad Pitt movie.  I know it's probably highly inaccurate but it made me wonder a few things.  Some instances - 

1)They repeatedly show shields blocking direct blows from swords.  These were, by the looks of it, thin wooden shields, and it seems like when more advanced technology like steel would rip those shields apart after just a single blow.  

2) It seems like most "armor" was leather - would this protect against most glancing blows and only really be susceptible to a piercing strike (point of the blade)?  Again it looked like most deaths (in the film) were from piercing attacks, or blows that landed on exposed flesh.

3) There's the phalanx-style of attacking, where the front line has their tall (4 feet or so) shields, and the line behind them have spears and they're stabbing over the tops of the shields...so it seems like those shields would be very strong against the spears/swords they'd go against.

And if you could explain how/why swords/spears/etc may or may not have been effective against armor/shields that would be great.  I mean...I'm guessing it's because they only had iron, so the swords would dull at a much faster rate than steel, hence why a piercing-attack was the only effective way?  (If that's true.) </TEXT>

While looking that up, I noticed that there were many games played on Thursday nights around 1981.  And 1980.  And a few other seasons.  

They were much more sporadic than they are now, and I was too young at the time to remember any of them.  It was just kinda shocking to see, "Oh, hey, there were Thursday night games before but everyone acts like it's this new problem." </TEXT>

Whereas in /r/nfl threads it seems like I almost never see reddit gold given.  

At least those other subs help support reddit servers, while probably demanding far fewer resources.  Whereas we routinely cause reddit to crash during big games, while simultaneously providing very little gold to pay for the servers we're crashing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been basically not doing much with this sub for awhile now as some of you may or may not have noticed.  Thought I'd take a moment to let you know what's up and whatever, and a chance to hear from all a y'all.

To begin - I've been mostly hands off because I don't really know what to do with this sub.  I started it as a joke, someone in /r/shittyaskscience asked if there was a shittyseduction, there wasn't, so I made it.  

That being said, I don't really know what to do with this place.  If you asked me, "What makes a great shittyseduction thread?" My answer would be, "I have no idea really, I just know a good one when I see it."  

I mean, this sub has grown from about 1,000 people a year ago to 3,500 now with little/no involvement on my part, so I guess things are going smoothly?  But I don't check in all that often, so I don't know if I've missed posts talking about the state of the sub or anything like that.  

Anyway, just checking in.  If you think I'm doing a shitty (pun intended) job here, let me know, I won't ban you for speaking your mind.  Any other suggestions or whatnot, again, just let me know.  And if you want to be a mod here and think you'd do a good job/be more active/help css/whatever...let me know and I'll think about it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Over at my usual stomping grounds of /r/nfl someone pointed out a certain thread had 94 comments and only 5 upvotes.  I pointed out that it's a pretty common occurrence, not just there, but throughout reddit.  When he asked why, we'll I'll copypasta my answer here - 

_________

[I wrote about this problem on /r/nfl awhile back](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/xabry/dear_rnflers_this_started_as_a_joke_on/) but looking at some of my submissions in other places - in /r/movies I have a 218 self.post with 738 comments, in /r/startrek another self.post that's 173/363, another /r/nfl post is 99/340, a /r/gameofthrones post is 92/630...those are all self.posts.  Whereas say in /r/gameofthrones I also have a 1394/184 link post, at /r/childfree a 352/72 link post...

It almost feels like reddit should implement some bit of code that says if a user gives more than 2 upvotes to comments in a thread, the thread should automatically receive one more upvote, or something, to help promote discussions.

___________

There are obvious exceptions - just because something is a link post it doesn't mean good discussions won't happen; and just because something is a self post doesn't mean the number of comments will always be greater than the number of upvotes.

It just seems like this would help "level the playing field" for self posts to reach their respective front pages more frequently than the "easily digestible" link post where all you have to do is read the title or look at a picture.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Inspired by a comment, I thought I'd write down the definitions of the various types of fandom. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-01 21:38:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I dunno, someone mentioned the difference between a bandwagon and fair weather fan somewhere, and it got me thinking.  So here are my thoughts on the different levels of being a fan.  Thoughts? Changes? (Note: originally written for r/nfl but thought it might be better here, to explain the football-bias in descriptions.)

**Die-Hard** - They own more than one jersey.  Often owning one of even their "bust" players jerseys.  Sundays, Mondays, Thursdays (and some Saturdays) are off limits 17+ weeks of the season.  Even if their team isn't playing, they're watching.  They have season tickets no matter how bad their team is, or they would if they could.

**Loyal** - They love their team and follow them for life.  But they only own a few pieces of paraphernalia.  They watch their team's games, probably any games involving their Divisions/Conference. They stick around through thick and thin, but wouldn't even consider painting their faces in a million years.

**Fair-Weather** - Again they'll follow their team for life.  But if it's a down year, well...maybe they'll watch the games but maybe not.  Or maybe they were born in that town so they're a fan, but don't know more than a few players' names.  

**Bandwagon (A)** - The first type of Bandwagon fan - they know almost nothing about the team they're cheering for, but they live in the city or have a lot of friends who are fans of a certain team, and suddenly that team is looking awesome and wow aren't they a big fan!  Sure they'll watch the game with you this weekend!...while saying things like "man they should onside kick every time!"

**Bandwagon (B)** - They have a favorite team already.  But for this season, maybe even the next few...know what?  That other team looks pretty cool, or I just love how their season played out, or I really respect that player...so fuck it I'll cheer for them too! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Sorry for the specificity of this post - But I recall when the NFL/Ref Union reached their agreement, part of the deal was phasing in newer/less-experienced refs. Anyone have better details on this? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-30 06:07:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First) I'm having trouble googling the "details" that I think I'm talking about.  Something like part of the deal was that the NFL got the power to start adding less-experienced refs to the crews, theoretically as an attempt to "train" them?

2) If true, anyone have any details about who some of these newer refs might have been, what games they might have officiated?

c) Could this maybe just be a short term issue, as these newer refs are being phased in, and things will be better in the coming seasons?  

Edit: This is the best I could find and it's nothing definitive - 

Additional crews[edit]
The NFL currently employs 17 officiating "crews"one for each of the 16 games played, plus one extra. The league wanted to hire three additional crews, bringing the total to 20 crews. The league claimed this would improve the quality of officiating, since they would have a larger pool of qualified officials to choose from, rewarding the best performing crews, and giving them more flexibility to "sideline" or "bench" poor performing ones. The union indicated that they believed the NFL was using the issue to distract from the core issues in the negotiations, due to the fact that the proposition was introduced so late in the negotiating process,[22] and because a provision for adding officials already existed in the previous CBA.[23] However, referees felt that making it easier to "bench" them undermined their job security, and since officials are paid based on the number of games worked, increasing the number of officials would invariably reduce the number of games worked per official, thereby reducing each official's average pay for a full season

It doesn't say what the official (pun wasn't intended) decision was in the end. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My roommates completely and utterly refuse to "punish" their dogs for being shitheads, and I'm left feeling like an asshole for being the only one to do so. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-15 06:28:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, note: by "punish" I even mean just raising their voices or something like that.  There's one dog in particular that barks like a shithead almost every time someone enters the house (or even if it just *thinks* someone is entering the house).  His owner just laughs it off, "aww he's being protective" or at *most* will say, in a pretty calm voice, "Fox knock it off."  So I'm listening to this tiny dog yap his fucking brains out, and I'm the only one who actually loudly and sternly says, "Fox! Quiet!"  

And I'm feeling like a huge dick because I'm "punishing" someone else's dog.  Like they're thinking, "Hey, that's my dog, it's not your place to do that."  (Throw in that his owner is only around for a few hours once every few days...)

Another dog in the house constantly tries to bite people's feet when he's in a certain mood.  Now this I mostly shrug off, I think it's even kinda cute some times...but we had a house party last night and he was doing it to *everyone* and the owner was just occasionally like, "Hey hey, not cool" to the dog instead of, again, raising his voice, pointing a finger, making him sit outside for awhile or something...

There was a point awhile back where I thought I didn't like children, and I realized it wasn't really children that I disliked, but their parents.  I love dogs, but I'm starting to reach a similar point where dogs are getting on my nerves because of their shitty fucking owners.  And oh, hey, now apparently the onus is mine to teach your shitty untrained dog how to not be shitty.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was really upset with Verizon, with their removal of unlimited plans and basically paying +$20 more per month for just a 2gig contract.  I thought I'd "vote with my wallet" and switch providers.  

And wow Sprint just totally sucks so much fucking ass.  It's weird because for the first week the service seemed to work great...during that one week where I can get a refund.  (I kept my old Verizon number because I wasn't sure how it would work, but that first week with Sprint seemed good enough so I decided to cancel my Verizon account after that week.)  

And now, holy shit.  My text messages fail all the fucking time. Opening imgur links when not on wifi fail all the fucking time, regardless of the number of bars I have. 

Just...wow this service is really terrible and I don't get (well I kinda do) why it was so great for the week where I could still get a refund, and now that that week has passed, my service is just fucking terrible in every way.  

I can't help but think that they give some sort of "premium" service to new subscribers to make them think it's good at first, then drop their coverage once they're locked into a contract.  

Edit: Like, seriously how do text messages fail all the FUCKING TIME?!  TEXT MESSAGES?! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As much as I hate to say it, I really feel like Brady should win it this season.  I mean how on earth are the Patriot's not competing with Buffalo for worst team in the AFCE if Brady isn't at the helm this season?  

Maybe the same is true for Denver.  Their stellar D isn't looking so stellar after all.  But Welker, Holliday, Moreno, the Thomases...I think they'd probably be second or third in the Division with just a "pretty good" QB.  ~~Not to mention the Patriots walloping the Broncos.~~ (sorry was maybe a little drunk)

Basically it seems like, take Rogers (pre-injury) or Manning and make them the starting QB in New England, and the Pats would probably have a worse record than they do now.  Whereas put Rogers or Brady on the Broncos, and the Broncos would be more or less the same record.  

I get that Manning has gaudy stats this season and is likely to break Brady's single season TD record.  I guess I'm just saying I don't think those stats are *just* because of Manning, and really the stats should be second to record, and when you put the Patriots and Broncos records side by side and consider the personnel...

Well.  Fuck.  I'll say it.  Brady should be MVP.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After watching [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mgvOHnujspg feature=youtu.be) of a bad snowy-roads accident in Wisconsin, plus having a shitty experience or two in the past few days of my own, thought I'd send this out.  Sorry if some of this seems demeaning or whatever, but again these past few days have made me think it's necessary.  Some of y'all might be from areas that didn't have much snow or whatever, so this is moreso for you.  

1a) Because I just remembered this after writing almost everything else - *allow more time to get where you're going.*  Normally it takes you 10-15 minutes to get to whatever place?  Plan for 30-40.  This relates to almost every other point. 

1) Drive *slower.*  So you bought studded tires, or snow tires, or you drive a Subaru or a 4x4?  It doesn't matter.  Drive. Slower.

2) Give a much larger cushion between you and the next car.  Normally it's 2-3 car lengths.  Aim for more like 5-6.  

3) *Sudden* direction changes are your enemy.  Try to make everything as gradual as possible.  Not just stops/starts, but turns/roundabouts, etc.  

4) Please, do not be an asshole.  If someone in front of you is driving really slowly ("too slowly" for your tastes)...don't ride their ass or flash your lights or whatever.  Some people haven't gotten their snow tires installed yet or they're just being *careful*...you're basically pressuring someone else into being irresponsible and possibly getting into an accident.  If the person in front of you isn't comfortable driving at a higher speed, it's very likely you shouldn't be comfortable driving at a higher speed either.  

Be safe out there first and utmost.  Being late to something in these conditions is secondary, and if it's really *so* important for you to get there ASAP, it's your fault for not leaving earlier, not the person in front of you's fault for not driving fast enough.  

Edit: Wow the troll downvoters.  I'm saying be safe and it's like I'm saying kill babies. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-11-26 04:29:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Fumblerooski is an actual play, not just a nickname for a fumble.  The Chargers were the last pro team to successfully perform it (and one of only a few to ever try it.)

It was in the game listed in the title.  For those who don't know what an actual Fumblerooski is - the center snaps to the QB who immediately puts the ball on the ground behind the center, then starts running in some direction.  While the D is chasing after the QB, the FB or RB picks up the ball off the ground and runs elsewhere.  

It was an amazing play to watch, partially because of the tremendously huge balls required to call that play, and then it actually worked.

Unfortunately, if you go to NFL.com and find the highlight of that play, the one highlight they have, the cameraman is so fooled by it you can't actually see what happens.  I remember at the time there were other highlights that showed other angles where you could see how crazy it was.  But those highlights don't exist on NFL.com.

So maybe someone here is crazy about recording every single Chargers game and has this on a dusty VHS tape or something?  I'd love to see this play again.  

Edit: [Here's a link to the nfl.com video](http://www.nfl.com/videos/san-diego-chargers/09000d5d801d32a0/Lorenzo-Neal-Highlight-WK-14-vs-Broncos-2006) but again the cameraman is so fooled you can't really see what happens.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> TWE - wow.  I watched it twice in two days.  The first time I left feeling that, while utterly entertained, it didn't have the big laughs of the previous incarnations of the trilogy.  I was trying to think of how to describe this movie to a friend to get them to watch it when I realized how awesome this movie was, which made me go back the second time.

The best part about TWE is that it's almost completely unable to be defined as a genre.  My initial thoughts, because of what I thought the movie would be like, "Well it's a comedy, but..." Well, it's also an action film, with nods to both American and "Eastern" (kung-fu/whatever) styles of action flicks.  But it's also scifi....kinda, but almost in the basest of ways, particularly since the "scifi" part of the plot basically revolve around one of the oldest/most common scifi ideas, "Invasion of the Body Snatchers".  It reaches the point where there's no way to describe it other than "It's just a very entertaining movie".  

Ender's Game - I enjoyed it...while also doubting I'll ever watch it at least a third time.  (Gotta give it one more go just to make sure...)  The running time is listed at 2 hours, but I know for a fact I was 12 minutes late to the "start" of the movie, old people buying tickets in front of me, still caught two more trailers before it started...and it was precisely an hour and 45 minutes later that I walked out at the start of the credits.  

The reason I bring this up is because I really think the movie would have been much better off at around a 2 hour 30 minute mark.  ~30-45 minutes longer than it was.  

The movie hit all of the basic plot points...but that seemed like all it was.  Just a "okay next major formative scene" followed by another "okay next major formative scene" until the credits roll.  I can get why what really happened with Bonzo was changed because Hollywood/PG-13, but I'm not just talking about that.  I just couldn't help but feel like the movie was mostly "Okay let's get this over with".    

Book spoilers now - [](#s "His time at Battle School and the lack of the whole "loose international alliance waiting to turn on one another once the war is won" stuff, really seemed like it could/should have been included, even if you don't include the Locke/Demosthenes subplots.") </TEXT>

Obviously this topic is opening itself to a bunch of jokes, but really; couldn't the lot of us come up with better descriptions of when things are/aren't a foul?

The way I see it, and I'm a bit tipsy so I'm likely to forget at least one glaringly obvious thing, but we can break the "on the field" rules down a good bit, can't we?  All those off the field rules we can set aside for the moment.  

Have some ideas but curious about how this could all be made simpler?  Where a call doesn't invoking 4 sub-clauses from 3 different rules in order to be interpreted?

	<TITLE> Thinking back, and I don't know if this a problem with my memory or if it's true. Have the Chargers ever had a dominant defense for a significant amount of time? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First, there was a season or two during the Schotty years.  Maybe I'm just remembering wrong, but it seemed more like our O was able get a comfortable lead in many games and so the D was playing to more predictable opposing-team-offenses.  

Second, yeah Seau was great.  But was the D as a whole really considered in the top tier?

Finally, I also remember the year we were technically #1 on D (and on O) and missed the playoffs, but again were we really a "dominant D" at that time?

I guess what I'm getting at is - lots of teams can look to a certain, say, 3-5 year span of saying "Oh man our D was so great when we had players X, Y and Z, among others."  Whereas with the Chargers it seems like we maybe had 1 or 2 guys who played really well, but not necessarily the entire unit, for an extended amount of time.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) The "best of r/nfl thread" - so this week, the top four images (I stopped looking into it at this point, but I'm sure the rest follow a similar pattern) - Image 1 = 13th comment from the top, Image 2 = 4th, Image 3 = 1st, Image 4 = 4th...basically, if you actually spend any sorta time around here, you've seen all these comments.  Previously, this thread was run independently and actually highlighted a lot of the lesser-seen comments. Now it's run in the same sorta circlejerky/mod-suck-up/"let's celebrate the people already celebrated" kinda way that makes me call it a circlejerk.

2) The complete and utter loss of identity(identities) from this thread because of mods taking over so much.  Anyone else remember that game thread last year, 1st Quarter, 2nd Quarter, 3rd Quarter, (nominally 4th Quarter but instead) Eli Time?  It was those sorts of quirks and insertions of individuality that made this sub so great.  But this year?  No, all the  game threads have to be created by /u/nfl_mod because **it's so important that every thread remain consistent.**  Really?  Is it really that important that every thread be consistent?  To me, those little insertions of humanity ("Eli Time") far outweigh the supposed benefits of consistency.  

3)  Completely ...how to phrase this properly... totalitarian dictatorship responses towards threads?  the "NFL Insomnia" thread. It was allowed once, before week 1, then removed every subsequent week that someone tried to post it.  It wasn't deemed "relevant enough".  Almost every recurring thread here is posted at an EST-friendly time, and basically fuck everyone who lives elsewhere.  NFL Insomnia thread, West Coasters, Europeans, various other international folk, could actually contribute in a way where they'd end up near the top of the comments, because the timing of the post let them. But the "insomnia" post was no longer allowed because it wasn't deemed relevant (while the "haiku" thread was, among numerous others), and...well I guess that's it really.  If late-night/international people want to talk about football, they can just be the 2000th comment in a thread or shut the fuck up and say nothing.  

r/nfl, you're turning into ESPN.  That's not a compliment.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Spoilers All] I'll be purposely kinda vague about this title, but anyone kinda feel that the way the books go, the tv show might drop off from viewers because of it? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Spoilers all following, basically -

The way the novels follow from this point out are basically pretty interesting and involving.

But I've watched a lot of this show with my parents who haven't read a single book thus far.

So I'm just wondering; how well will they adapt to the basically gigantic changes from here on out in the TV series?  Yeah there are big changes in the books/show up to this point, but from here on out things mostly take place on different continents, and in a way "restart" lots of storylines from where they were before.

**Okay I'm seriously getting into spoilers here for real, I know I only hinted before but it gets serious now so back out if you don't want more**

I mean...Arya moves to a different continent and basically "starts over" for a good portion of what would be the next two seasons...Jon goes through similar (though not as geographic) changes...Dany is basically caught in politics on a far off continent for a long time...and many more similar examples. 

I just wonder how, say, halfway through the next season, I could conceivably tell my (non-book-reading) parents "nah it's good just stick with it" when basically things from here on out more-or-less "start over" in terms of tearing down old heroes, building up new ones, blah blah blah.  

(I will absolutely grant that this whole post may be out of spite, that it seems I read a lot of stuff just to get it all thrown up in the air again, and I'm basically just...afloat in this universe and no longer caring about who ends up where and/or why.)

Edit: **TL;DR** - The *huge* changes that occur in books 4-5...I just wonder if TV followers can really follow along with that, because (to me) these sorts of changes are the type that those with short memories/attention spans won't really care for/pay attention to. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Novel Series] Came up in a different thread, thought it was worthy of it's own post. The Agent Kormac series by Neal Asher. Fast-paced, military-oriented, lots of neat tech. Criminally little-known. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I was waiting in an airport, thought I'd see if there were any good books, picked up one called "Line of Polity" by Neal Asher.  It was amazing.  This was at a time when google was still getting off the ground and all that, and it was a UK writer (bought the book in an Australian airport), so I couldn't find much about him at the time (2003).

I re-read the book a few times over the next few years and when the interwebz finally started really taking off, found out this was the second book in a five-book series.  

The thing is, it's a really good stand-alone novel.  I lent it to a friend last Summer and told him it was book 2 out of 5, but he should still read it, and he loved it too.  The rest of the series is similarly awesome, though this one in particular will always hold a special place for me.  

It's very much in the style of Richard K. Morgan and James A. Corey; really interesting characters, either in the military or maybe ex-military and "shady".  Really interesting tech/foreign planets/etc.  Gripping, "it's 1 AM but I want to see what the next chapter brings" kinda stuff.  

It seems he still hasn't broken out of the UK market that much.  Which is a shame, because he's awesome.  

Also awesome - he has two other series (between 3-5 books each) in the same universe.  There's also a fourth series, though it doesn't take place in that particular universe and I haven't read them yet, though I'm about to.   </TEXT>
