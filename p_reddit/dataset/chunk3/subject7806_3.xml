	<TEXT> Eh, it's more about a behaviour thing I noticed than "personal experience" thing. Honestly, I answered the personal details here because you asked.

By the way, I mistook the case of the rape victim there; the one I mentioned was 12 people. The "over 20" was another, but both were on Rio (state). The over 20 case: http://m.oglobo.globo.com/rio/adolescente-luta-para-superar-trauma-de-estupro-coletivo-na-praca-seca-19383700

(Couldn't find a link of an EN one, so sorry in advance. Ah, and there are some personal opinions of the journalist thrown on the text, too, so the new'll probably be a bit long because of that if you try to translate it.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, he did cheat on my mother. Twice. In fact, they didn't talk to each other for two entire months whe she found out. We *knew* the entire thing but he still tried to pose off as innocent. As my mother herself said, it'd be less trouble if he simply said the truth instead of doing an entire mind gymnastics around it, LOL

And about the mental issues, I do agree, but he thinks these things aren't real. And well, about the financial thing... he's the least concerned. As I said there, he spends money on whatever if he feels like doing. Kind of compussive, in a way; I can say that from everyone on this house, my mom is the only who doesn't buy things in a "non rational" way. Can't truly speak for myself here 'cause everyone says about themselves that "they don't do that", but everyone says I'm a "closed fist" about money when it comes to myself.

Oh, and he tried to beat my mom before. Just doesn't do that anymore because my brother is a good 20 cm taller than him and stronger, and the few times my father tried to do that he came into the scene and didn't let him. My brother never got to the point of hitting him, he just immobilized and told him to back off *or else* he'd do something. My father once tried to strangle my mother, too. Her neck became tense and he didn't get to do it because it got so tense he couldn't stop her breath from coming and going.

Ah, and he tried raising his voice before but it didn't give any results. Is why I didn't mention anything of that regard there: the moment he noticed it would just make things worse for him, he stopped. I can say for once that, on a good side, he tried to be more patient and stop being so short tempered about these things, but eh, he gave up soon and there we are again: still short tempered as fuck.

Ah, about the rape: it happened on Rio, if I remember correctly. The girl was underaged; I don't remember her name, though, but I do remember that the police that took care of the case put the guys mostly as not guilty. Two or three went to jail only; on this case, can't really "point out" guilty ones other than these two because she was passed out when the other cases happened. They just knew because some people passed by and filmed/took pictures of her. Some even posted on social media (which, in fact, was were most of the proofs came from as she wasn't awake). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, my brother, my mom and I are really close. In a way, we help each other out when we need, so 's all good in that sense :P the only "standoff" from the family is my father, but that relies on the points I showed on the post + the fact that he doesn't really try to get close to us. And yeah, we did try getting close to him to see if it was a "shy for interactions" thing, but it isn't; by the amount of friends he has and by what they themselves say, he's pretty extroverted when he's not with his family. Either way, other than him, we're all pretty chill :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He doesn't work.

We're all unemployed.

Also, he *truly* seems himself as handsome. Not a joke. He does that with people outside the family, not with the family.

And no, no assumptions. He actually talked to my mother about these things.

Also, he's not "neglected". He doesn't even try to spend time with his family. We tried lots of times to be with him, but he shuts down all possibilities.

Anyway, my mom doesn't spend money on "worthless stuff". She's with the same clothes for over 10 years already, they look that age and he doesn't let her buy anything for herself. But when it comes to anyone else, he can spend up to 300 and not bat an eye. He doesn't really know how to spend money correctly; she does. She's stressed out and he's not giving a shit. He spends money worthlessly and then asks where it went and blames it on her even though she bought nothing but the basic. But you know, it's not like you'll believe it anyway.

And uh, I'm not from the US. Also, the girl I mentioned there: she wasn't walking naked, she was with two other guys. It started out as consensual but then she asked them to stop because it was hurting her and she got to the point of bleeding, but they didn't attend to her call and carried on. She passed out, they kept their thing going and, when done, they left her on the street. They were on a party if I remember correctly; the region they were was famous for being unsafe at night, and they left her with just her shirt on the street.

And uh, you know, I'm not a feminist... but whatever. Honestly, I don't even know why I'm trying to explain considering that you'll probably dismiss it.

EDIT: forgot to add: when he talked to my mom about the fact that he finds it odd that I'm not very emotive, he was trying to convince her to do something.

She simply stated that's what I am, I'm not a kid anymore. Am aware of that because she did mention it to me later on and tried to tell me to be less "neutral" around him, but honestly, even if I tried I can't. Especially because I have this "can't put my 'barriers' down" with him.

EDIT2: forgot to say: he has no dad humour. I think his share of dad humour went to my mom, 'cause holy shit if she doesn't make bad jokes everyday just to see her kids' reactions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a way, I think he's paying for what he thinks for his entire life.

His mother was a feminist.

I was/am a "manly woman" on the androgynous sense (*Bowie intensifies*).

His niece also is a feminist...

... and his son was considered gay during his entire teens by his colleagues. So, yeah... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Study on a TRPer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-04-10 01:54:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I actually wrote this title and started to laugh my ass off for some reason, but anyway, some similarities I noticed on my father and TRPers behaviour and a bit of an explanation.

A few conclusions I had from a long time living with him:

- Whenever he has to do a home-related service, he'll procrastinate it the most he can and find a petty reason to argue and, in a temper tantrum, not do what he had to and be angry at everyone else on the house and pose as the victim. He can do that for up to an entire month.

- Run away from home when he feels "not respected". Respect, to him, includes not arguing with dumb as fuck ideas he has, not asking where he shoved the money he got in a small job (once again, we're all unemployed here... and guess what, I was the first to land a job on the house), not asking him to do any home service, leave EVERY FUCKIN' THING THAT IS RELATED TO THE KITCHEN DONE, let him eat as much as he wants (even though there are other people to eat, too), put him as priority... and also not ask with whom he was on the cellphone. He goes away to talk with other people on the cellphone.

- Humiliating his son and wife in front of his friends to pose off as manly alpha man of the house. Recently, he did that and everyone argued with him; tried to pose off as "stoic" during the discussion but was the most affected one... I mean, I blatantly showed him I was not giving a fuck anymore. Probably that's why he doesn't try doing that with me since I show to not give a fuck and end up answering back and making him look like the odd one. Really, he also does that with his friends from times to times and when I did that, most thanked me when he was away. *lol*

- He tries to push everyone to not be able to work so he'll be the sole breadwinner of the house. Once again, I was the first to land a job here; he felt... weird, to say the least. Tried to neg me out of it, but heh, back to the other point: I stopped giving a fuck.

- He sees himself as the most handsome human of the place *all the time*. He doesn't know some people actually snicker at that and just don't blatantly say at his face to not be rude. I firmly believe Twerps are in a similar regard.

- Thinks he's the "captain" of the house and, once again, tries to pose off this way in front of other people. People don't tell him, but they know he doesn't; it's my mother. He's a terrible leader and terrible admin. Also, when things got really bad here, he ran away and nothing really changed on the money front... apart from less money being spent because you know, he costs a lot.

- Expects his daughter (aka me) to be a sheepish expressive woman and close to him. He stays in front of the television almost 24/7 since I was 4, so I never had much contact with him. My brother was much more of a father than him and helped me to understand that I hadn't to be a "girly girl", just like he also didn't need to be a "manly man" like my father would often try to make us believe we should. Anyway: he finds it extremely odd that I am quite stoic emotionally. I just am not when I'm on a joking mood, but he never gets to experience them because I don't feel close to him and he knows it.

- Bases everyone's taste on their gender and generalizes people into "dualistic boxes": a man cannot be anything else but what he thinks a man is (in fact, a coworker of his former job was called a "pussy" by him because he didn't fight back when a guy stole the meat of his food but was pretty chill about it) and nor a woman.

- Negs his wife and thinks everything she tries to spend on herself is expensive. That includes 10 bucks. My mom felt like she was the ugliest creature because of this behaviour of his, but after some time she noticed it wasn't true and whenever he tries to put her down, she answers back. Still can't get to spend money on herself, but eh, that's actually also an old habit of hers back from when she still lived with her mother and they were the money that entered the house; also, she's the youngest child of a bunch of 3, so she never got to experience what the other two had and was pretty neglected on that side.

- He ran away when my mom had a deadly disease. *300 km away*. When he was sick, he expected all of us to be there, though. He sees the position of my mom of "being there for him" as an obligation, but he has none to hers.

- Blatantly blamed a rape victim of being the one that caused it because she was in "scatty clothing" and started off as something with consent. More on detail: she asked her rapists to stop when it started to hurt, they didn't, they made her pass out... and over 20 people raped her as they left her on the street without her underwear, skirt and with her "ass high on the air". It was nighttime.





And... that's all I can remember for now. I just know that it feels odd to live with someone like this. Especially when you're a woman and *his daughter*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really all of them. I think some, if not most (which would be unfortunate, though) are just easily manipulated. From one side they just believe the words of a certain side (their male peers) and on the other think the world is "falling down to pieces", so, believing RP gets easy with these two aspects.

I once mentioned that my second partner had a smaller mental issue, right? It was nothing major; what influenced him was the thought that "the world was falling down" and believing the world would be better if we got back to a "caste" system... and the second one was the one that took him to believe women were inferior. Also, we had a decent age gap, so whenever I argued with him about these things he'd just say I was "being manipulated" or that I am "too young to understand". Nothing conected to his mental issue, *he* was the problem by letting himself be led by the mind of other "alphas".

Unfortunately, I can't even say this is unique to TRPers/MGTOW/Incels; it happens everywhere. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Money

My two partners were way more broke than me and I didn't give a shit. I'd share the restaurant bills with the second and didn't let him buy "emotional stuff" to me (read that as bouquets) because I'd forget to take care of them and it'd be money badly spent taking that into consideration. In fact, if there was one thing I told him, that thing was to spend his money on himself and I'd be happy if he was happy with his purchases.



Status

Once again, *more broke than me*. And the second was diagnosed with a small mental disorder when he was younger, so, yeah, I'd say that would "take his status off" according to TRP. Also, I just made sure he wasn't into an illegal scheme of sorts and we were fine. Two broke people hanging around.



Looks

LOL, you know, I never really had a "pattern" for what I like, right? One was short and chubby with a fluffy black hair and a beta calming aura and the other was slender (with some amazing hips, must say) and tall as heck. Also, I cared more about their personality, so the fact that they were extraordinary human beings before turning to a terpy-like side made them seem like the most beautiful human beings on Earth to me.

That is, after Ewan McGregor. Nobody beats Ewan McGregor when he had that magnific beard.



Resources and properties

Two. Broke. People. I live with my parents (common around here because the economy is fucked up). The second lived in a small apartment that took him years to buy. The first also lived with his parents.



Fame

lol OH LOL. Why the fuck would I want to date a famous fella, monsieur Terpois? Me no likes pictures taken of me.



Attention

Well, yeah. They also wanted my attention, so, fair trade innit?



Protection

Uhhhhh no. We lived far from each other and if there's one thing I learned to be since a kid, that'd be a fembloke ready to bust a jaw with my fists at any second if someone tried to force me into a bad situation. I'll die but not without fighting.

	<TEXT> Yeah, I am aware of these things. But the kind of pressure they put on me was quite different. My family itself not so much (except my father) but those around me, yeah. I can say for once that I feel uneasy about myself partially because of this problem -- because I wasn't "girly like my schoolmates were", I was poked fun at lots of times. And adults put pressure on me, too. Now that I'm older I don't care, but when you're a kid, things are completely different...

EDIT: putting more detail into this:

When I was around 9, every other girl of my class already started wearing makeup. I mean, *really*. And I never were into that, so the guys of the class would get into a big group to mock me around because I was a "boy"; not only because of that, I admit, but also because on the time everyone tried to go to school wearing skirts and you're the only one who isn't, of course they'll always find something to say about.

I liked Math way more than everyone else. There was a guy who legit told me to stop liking it because it wasn't a "girl's thing".

My schoolmates never allowed me to help them because "it wasn't womanly to carry weight", even if the bunch of guys they called weren't being able to carry it alone and would need help.

Adults often tried to force me the idea that I needed to be a "delicate little flower" (read that as "emotional kid who plays with dolls". Literally, not even faking it here) even if I showed right from the start that I wasn't into that and being "emotive" wasn't really part of my nature. I always had trouble expressing myself, it's nobody's fault in this case.

People tried to force me to wear things I wasn't comfortable with because otherwise I "looked like a man", even if it was obvious on pictures that it made no difference.

People tried to teach me to not talk my sincere thoughts even if they ask for it. Funny enough, the same people said it was "normal" of their male children to do that because "it's in their nature".

As for my friend...

His mother wants him to be your typical "pumper and dumper" of women. Like, she's literally trying to teach him that this is right, and he can't help but feel uneasy. He doesn't get why she'd like to teach him that.

He wants to take care of his skin problem and would like to remove some of his body hair because, as he says, it makes him smell and it bothers him even outside that. His mom doesn't let him do that because "it's gay".

His colleagues try to push him to women but he *can't* fall in love with anyone. I'd say he's asexual considering the overall, and because of that, they always poke fun at him saying that he's a little bitch, homosexual and all that stuff we're tired of. They try to make him get angry and fight them (yeah, "FITE ME IRL" but not so meme-y) for no reason because "it's not manly to be so calm and not want to punch stuff", apparently. Also, whenever he shows a "not macho" behaviour (macho culture is at its peak here, and you can be poked fun at for *simply going to the market with your mother*) they'll make entire hoaxes of him and avoid him like he's some degenerate with a plague or something.

Oh, and we both also suffered with the "this is not a job for men/women, choose something else" and the "being (insert trait here) is not manly/womanly" a lot. I for once was called "lesbian" on school for 4 entire years because 1. I wasn't the stereotypical girly and 2. I rejected the "most desired guy" of the school.

There are even more things I can't think of, so yeah, we had problems. I am glad you don't have to deal with them, and I congratulate you for that, but I've seen lots of people who did and they felt sad and desperate because they "weren't following a role they're supposed to", and it saddens me. I don't have this "plurigender" thought, but I honestly can't see why should *individuals* fit into a pre defined role that doesn't catch all the possibilities inside the variety of human beings. I don't blame people who'd like to follow that; hell, if they feel like they fit it, go for it, I'm happy that it works for them. But don't think it works everywhere because it truly doesn't. Just teach kids to be responsible *and* humane, not "manly" or "womanly". If they have these traits, they tend to show them from an early age; I know it's odd, but really, most people I met already had lots of traits defined from an early age, including myself (this one I just had proof from events my mom remembered, like when I was 5 and people tried to push me to do something and argued a ton of reasons why it was "good" but I simply refused and didn't back off), my brother, this friend... I just think good things, like being caring and educate from one side and being assertive enough to not let him/herself be left behind should be teached everywhere.

Annnnd sorry for the long post. I got carried away here... </TEXT>

Generally, it was by their own mothers just like with you :I I honestly don't get it, but eh, my parents were young when they had my brother anyway (my father was my mom's first boyfriend and he got her pregnant at 17), so I guess that plays a big role on my views as well. </TEXT>
