	<TEXT> If it is a new 470 I suggest getting a RMA. 
What are your current drivers. 
Check first if the cables are really plugged in correctly. 
If you are overclocking go back to the current settings. 
Good luck  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How often does this happen? 
What you can do is set windows to full performance in power  settings.  
If you are using windows 10 disable directx 12.
Sadly there is no fix since AMD and Nvidia are getting this problem. 

For me putting full performance on windows settings helpt. 
Good luck  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> make sure that you connect the cooler to the cpu pin power connector or else your comptuer wont turn on. or at least some motherbords do. 

hmmm to bad you dont have a power button on your motherbord or a led fail numbers. 

what you can do is just try another powersupply. 
 good luck

	<TEXT> No. Just wait for actual benchmarks. 

Wait for the price announcement. 

Wait for actual quality motherboards

I am happy for AMD. Ryzen is a good competition against Intel. Kybe Lake was not a big improvement. 

The only thing I want from AMD is Vega.  </TEXT>
