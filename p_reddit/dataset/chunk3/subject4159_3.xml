	<TEXT> is it possible that you dc'd during champ loading? One time that happened to me, i reconnected, and i couldn't see any of my teammates on the field or on the map. Then i reconnected, i was able to see them and on the map, but the enemy minion health bars glitched so i couldn't tell if i was last hitting or not. This happened like a week ago. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've gotten it at least ten times and riot won't do shit about it i promise you that. Before each game go to a custom game and i mean it, before each game. If you crash in a custom you'll have to wait till it's all gone away. Go back into the custom if it crashed and check if it crashed again. When it doesn't crash in the custom you are safe to start playing normal games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've sent 5 separate emails to riots technical support department and they're about as useful as a poopy flavored lolly pop. It honestly inspires me to get a job as a IT guy because you don't do anything except for googling something and then give that unrelated useless information to the person relying on you. I can't find a solution. The information i've found though is on a post I created that I have speculated but no one seems to give a shit.

There you go man, hopefully that works for you. I had the same problem but i'm on a mac. Flushing my DNS really helped from what i can tell so far. Haven't gotten dc'd again... yet.

**Edit:** Nope nvm i just got raped again. :p </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Found a way to prevent the reconnect bug! :D </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-14 09:33:35 </DATE>

	<TEXT> **The Fix**




Alright guys, so if the community hasn't found out by now there is a bug that's going around that's making it so people are going through a disconnection loop. I have found a solution so that it doesn't happen in ranked if you take precautionary measures. All you have to do is go into a custom game EVERY TIME BEFORE YOU QUEUE UP.





If it gives you the bug when you go into the custom then you'll just have to just keep trying until it goes away. I just played Diablo 3 when I thought all hope was lost. But just wait a while take a break and then try it again in custom to see if it disconnects you.




**Curious about the bug details?**

So what I have theorized about what this bug is is that when you get into a game it thinks that you are connected but in reality you're not. Thus you can't reconnect kind of like being the 6th man trying to join a 5 man group that's all filled up. This makes a giant loop of reconnect issues that ends when the game is over or 20+ minutes into the game when you can finally escape the reconnect page.

**Riot Tickets Submitted**

I was pretty upset when it first started to happen and the game kept disconnecting me randomly and I would get Leaver Buster penalties. I sent 3 tickets to riot explaining what was happening. The first one I gave them all of the information they asked for. They emailed me back telling me to do some troubleshooting. The second one I was furious telling them that it was still happening and nothing came of it. This third one i've shared what I know now about the bug and how to reproduce it along with all the information they asked for along with a video of what was happening during the process of the bug. I sent another reply a few hours ago so I should hear back tomorrow maybe.





**Troubleshooting**

When I received my first email they suggested that I input some code in my Terminal and it would restart some processes going on in league. However that didn't work and neither did the follow: repairing the client, reinstalling the client, restarting the router, restarting the computer and restarting the client.





**Variations of Reconnect**

So i've tried different ways to reconnect to the game all of which failed: option+command+esc (windows;ctrl+alt+delete) and clicking reconnect, waiting for the pop up and clicking the retry button, clicking the cancel button, alt tabbing and closing the client from the dashboard, force quitting in task manager, restarting computer.





**Last Hypothesis**

I theorize though that if you wait while you're inside the reconnect screen you shouldn't press the button right away and panic to try to get into the game asap. Instead you should wait about 2 minutes before trying again, and then if it fails wait another 2 minutes before trying again. During a custom game that it was stuck in reconnect i did this and it returned me to the main menu after waiting a while. Even in a custom game it will keep you in reconnect even if you exit the client being the only person in the game. 

If this helps anyone that's experiencing this issue like I am than this post will be wurf :3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been saying this for weeks now and made a thread about the connection issues! Thank you for posting this at least people will listen to you OP. I sent Rito 3 tickets and they didn't do anything to help me and i sent them a final one with a video just yesterday when it happened again to show them wtf was going on. When they sent me the emails back the other times i sent in tickets they were pretty much denying it was their fault and that it was something on my end. Welp i repaired the client, reinstalled the game, tried every method of trying to reconnect short of actually unplugging my computer and it still won't stop doing it. It happens the 2nd game after my leaver buster is completed. It's happened 6 times to me so far now. 20 minute queues qq :'(. </TEXT>

**Type of Bug:** Crash Loop

**Description:** Game keeps crashing and can't reconnect.

Also i really like samurai lore and their style so that also entices me. His high damage and outplay potential is great along with his dashing animation an smooth flow. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It crashes after champ select during the loading screen. It doesn't show the pictures and the screen is just black. After like 1 minute of trying to reconnect it asks me if i want to try to connect again because i can't connect to the server. So i do but it does the same thing so i comand option esc, it exits the black screen and goes back to the main client and tells me that the game crashed and i have to click the orange reconnect button. I tried this for 18 minutes until the game was over and my team told me to die. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you keep getting the message that's like, application open close the open one, just close it unless the client is updating. You can see the patcher on the bottom with a loading bar barely visible. Just wait for it to be done. If not, just restart your computer.  Make sure to close all start up applications in the system preferences. I forget how to do that but googling it should do the trick. This should eliminate a bit of clutter and hopefully you can open it again. I find that my game won't open for a long time if i force quit diablo 3 and blizzard launcher. Just trying to open it over and over for a while might work. </TEXT>
