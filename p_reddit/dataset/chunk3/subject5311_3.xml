And the other guy in town is a grumpy old man that's only been in business for 40 years because there was nobody else around. And he doesn't like us because we stole his customers by treating them like human beings </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comments from r/talesfromretail told me I should post it here, so here you go

So I was in the shop one day, a customer was in getting some keys copied, nice and simple job. Suddenly while I've got the machine running, some shirtless guy comes in looking really frantic. I tell him I'll be just a minute longer, then I finish the keys, and send the first customer on his way.

 Frantic dude: "jeez, took you long enough, I need you to come unlock my car"

I'm already a little annoyed since its almost closing time, but I just figure he's got a kid/dog/groceries in the car and give him the benefit of the doubt. 

 Me: "No problem, where is it?"
 FD: "A couple miles that way, my girlfriend drove me over here. You can follow us to it."

I get some info from him, the kind of car it is, his name/number/address in case we get separated, etc. 

 FD: "My phone's in the car so if you call it I won't answer"
 Me: "Then how about your girlfriend's number?"
 FD: "Hers is in there too"

Well ok then

Since it's pretty much closing time, I just go ahead and set the alarm and lock the doors as I leave, he doesn't like this and starts saying how I'm taking forever. Yeah yeah, take a chill pill, 5 extra seconds won't kill you.

I get in my truck and follow him out there, when we get there I grab my tools and head to the car. Surprisingly, there's nothing in there except for the keys on the seat. No kids or dogs, so now I'm just hoping it's actually their car. 

 FD: "You'd better not mess up my doors, this is a classic"

Yeah, a classic Ford POS

I open it up in about 10 seconds and check the insurance card, and yup it's their car. I pick up the keys and go over to him, tell him it's $40, and he just looks at me dumbfounded.

 FD: "Wait you mean I have to pay for this?"

Ummm, yeah?

 Me: "Yes sir, we charge a service call when we have to go out to the location."
 FD: "Well I'm not paying for that, you did it in 10 seconds, I could've done that myself if I'd have known"
 Me: "Well I'm sorry, but I can't do this for free."

I could've, but there was no real urgency like a life endangered, plus he was rude about the whole thing. We normally would just bill someone in the situation, but we've been burned too many times, so we'll only do that for companies.

 FD: "I'm not paying for that, I don't have any money"
 Me: "Then if you think you can do it yourself, go for it."

I throw his keys in the car, lock the doors, shut it behind me, and leave. 
I get home about ten minutes later, then after probably an hour he calls back.

 FD: "I can't get it open, come back and open my car again"
 Me: "I can go out again, but I'll have to charge you for two service calls."
 FD: "F- you A-hole, I'm not paying you 80 bucks"
 Me: "Then you can call out *other locksmith nearby*, I'm sure he'll be happy to help y-" *click*

I didn't tell him, but they charge $100 to unlock cars. 

Never heard back from him </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Locksmith Adventures: Ep. 3, or, "Pardon the stain on the floor" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-06 17:08:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm back for another story there kiddos, buckle your seatbelts. Hopefully the automods won't take this down

Alright so this was a fun little adventure that happened a few months ago, thought you guys might like it. It starts at the shop, as usual, when a lady comes in with a grocery bag full of locks that I'm guessing she needs rekeyed. The first thing I noticed though was the smell.

The best way I can describe it is if someone died, sat for a week, and then doused themself in your standard old lady perfume, then shoved a dozen mothballs in every open orifice. And then sat for another week.

And then walked into my shop.

So after the initial recoil of the wall of smell hitting me with the force of Thor's hammer, I ask in my retail voice, "Hi, what can I do for you today?"

 Her: "I pulled these locks off my dad's house, I need them changed so the other family members will stop coming in and taking his things"

This sounds a little weird but honestly it happens more than you'd think. Either someone dies and the family starts taking their inheritance, or what I thought happened here by the way she worded it, he's senile and they're taking advantage of him. Either way, she's paying for it and she went through the trouble of taking them off for me, which for the record, locksmiths appreciate it greatly when you bring the locks to them instead of calling them out. Saves loads of time and money for everyone.

So anyways, she had I think 6 locks, 3 knobs/3 deadbolts. All keyed the same, nice and simple, 15 minutes max, getting her out and my nose back in working order as soon as possible.

 Me: "Alright, well give me a few minutes and I'll get it done for you with no problem."

I get them done in 10 minutes, make her some spares, ring her up for $30, and she's ready to be on her way.

 H: "Well that was fast and cheap, thank you very much!" 
 M: "It's no problem, just let us know if you need anything else at all" 
 H: "I definitely will, thank you again"

Surprisingly, one of the most polite customers I've had over the years.

So she leaves, and as soon as she closes the front door I make a beeline for the back room, stick my head in, and take a deep breath. As soon as my sinuses clear, I head for the front window to see if she's driven away yet.

Our shop has widows, but they don't open, so when we need to circulate air we just prop the front door open. I didn't want to do this while she was sitting right there because I'm socially awkward and I assumed in my head that if I propped the door open she'd know that I thought she smelled like a zombie clown.

So I wait there for a few seconds, then I see her get out of the car and I think "oh crap, she saw me watching her and now she's gonna make me smell her again"

I run back behind the counter faster than I've run since the time I ran from 3 loose pitbulls after breaking into a house(but that's a story for another day), and pretend I was there the whole time.

She walks in, I give the usual "Well howdy, back for more so soon?"

 H: "Well I was going to go back and put these on, but I'm not sure if I'll be able to. It took me some trouble to figure out how to get them off in the first place. Do you think you could follow me to the house to put them on for me?"

I explain to get that it's no problem, but it'll be an extra charge depending on how far away it was, and she said she would be happy to pay. 

So against the better judgement of my nose, I go to meet her there.

The second red flag(the first being the smell of her) is the fact that this house, which was more of a shack, looks almost completely abandoned, and it's a good 30 minute drive into the middle of nowhere.

The third red flag is the actual red flags I see stuck in the grass around the property, along with torn shreds of yellow caution tape.

So against the better judgement of literally every sense and feeling in my body, I follow her up to the door. All I can think about at this point is the stench of standing right next to her and I'm wondering if I'll ever be able to smell my mom's fresh apple pie again. And I get the feeling it's about to get worse.

Yup, it was.

She pushed the front door open, and it hit me.

Before, I said it was like being hit with Mjlnir, but nope, this was worse. I'm not sure how to word it in a way that the automods will approve, but it was worse.

When she opens the door, I hear her say the first words I hear her say since we left the shop:  

 "Pardon the stain on the floor, that's where we found him"

I'msorrybutwhat

I look down and there's a 5 foot wide Rorschach test on the carpet, surrounded by little tufts of hair.

By this point I'm horrified, and I'm about to just completely leave and tell her I can't do it for whatever reason

Luckily(I think?) She's a talker, and I quickly learned the story of what happened, but not before I grab the power drill out of my truck so I can get these screws in as fast as humanly possible.

Apparently her dad is in his late 80s, and he lives alone, except for his 2 Pomeranians. One day he falls down walking to his front door, and he can't get back up, or get to a phone, so he lays there, where the stain was. Luckily his living family came to visit him and found him.

Unfortunately it wasn't until about 2 months after he fell. 

From what I can gather from trying to work instead of gag, after he died, his dogs got hungry, and eventually turned on each other. That explains the tufts of hair all over the floor. I guess one of the dogs made it out alive though so hey silver lining

So I finished up and hightailed it out if there as fast as I could, then went home and took 3 or 4 dozen showers.

But hey at least she gave me a $5 tip so that's pretty cool </TEXT>

We charge because it's a service we have to pay for to be able to decrypt the codes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He charged $175x4 for taking apart the push bars 
$150x4 for the re-key, $225 for 1.75 hours of labor and $375 for the new thing he said I needed and 60$ for the 6 keys.... after tax it came to just over $2100

I'm late, but yeah, major rip off.

Do what the top comment said, call news stations and tell everybody about it, force him out.

For reference though, we're pretty rural and low priced, but we charge $10 for a rekey, and usually nothing for taking apart panic bars. If it's part of a building and we do a bunch of them, we might charge an extra 10 for each.

$1.50 for copies of keys, but for only 6, we'd include them for nothing. 

A service charge depending on how far away you are($40 local, $10 extra for every 10 miles or so out).

And I doubt there was any part needing replacing, or if there was that he happened to have the exact part for your door on him.

I'd highly suggest getting someone else out to rekey them and change your lock cylinders out to work with a different, more uncommon key. Shouldn't cost more than double a rekey cost at the most. There's a chance if he's a scammer that he kept an extra key for himself.

Find someone reputable, even if they're further away, it's worth the extra charge. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Luckily we haven't had to deal with the unlicensed people around here, it's a small city that's only had one other locksmith for 30 years until we started about 8 years ago. Unfortunately for the people that don't know we're here, and fortunately for us, the other locksmith isn't great at the job. They can do the work fine, but they're pretty rude, ridiculously overpriced, and they schedule things as simple as car unlocks days ahead because they're "too busy". 

Once in a while we get to clean up one of their messes though, and that's never fun. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> X-posted from r/talesfromretail, someone said I should post it here for you

So I'm a locksmith, I both go out on calls and stay at our shop where we sell locks, keys, safes, all kinds of stuff. It's just me and my dad(the owner) that work here.

This happened a few years ago but you usually remember the really fun customers. We were doing some cleanup around the shop when a middle aged woman comes in and slams a (rather expensive) key down and says she wants to return it. CL for crazy lady and M for me

M: "Is there a problem with it?"

CL: "No, you made this key for me when I lost my car keys last month, but I found my keys so I don't need this one anymore"

M: "I'm sorry but if there's nothing wrong with the key we can't refund you."

I said it was an expensive key earlier, it was for a mid-2000s Mitsubishi, and it had a remote head. The chip keys we sell are $20 plus programming, and the remote heads are more depending on the make/model of the car. If I remember correctly her key was around 80 for the key itself, not counting the service charge to go make it when she lost hers. Total cost was somewhere around 220, which she wanted the full refund of for whatever reason.

CL: "Well can't you just un-cut the key and sell it to someone else?"

M: "No ma'am, we can't un-cut keys. Plus it's been programmed to your car so we couldn't reuse it anyway."

CL: "Go get your manager so I can speak with him"

My dad is around the corner in the back room and heard the whole thing, so as she said this he poked his head around the corner with a chipper "Hi! What can I do for you?"

He then gives the same answers, pretty much word for word, until she's visibly angry that we won't give her 200 bucks

CL: "is the owner here? I'm not leaving without some kind of refund"

My dad's more amused than irritated by this point so he just says "Sure, let me get him for you" and heads into the back.

He's back there for a few seconds, then he pokes his head around the corner, this time wearing his reading glasses, and says "Hi! What can I do for you?"

CL, fuming now: "Do you think I'm an idiot?"

Me internally: "yes, a little bit"

Me externally: "No, not at all. Unfortunately neither of the three of us will be unable to give you a refund though, seeing as it's been over 30 days and there's no actual issues with the key. I'm sorry we couldn't help you any further."

CL: "Well I hope you're happy that you just lost a customer"

Then she leaves, forgetting to pick up her key sitting on the counter. About 5 minutes later she walks back in without saying a word, picks up the key, and leaves. But not before my dad chimed in with a "have a nice day!"

TL;DR: lady wants a refund on a key we made for her because she found her old ones, she can't understand that we can't un-cut keys and gets mad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno about him but I sleep on a bed, it's worked out pretty well so far.

Key was $80, programming was $40, it requires us to go through a service that charges us every time we program a key, then there's making the key when they have none, which for her car involved pulling the ignition apart, and that was $35, then it was $50 to go out to her since she was 20 miles out of town.

In total, it took about 2.5 hours, from the time we left the shop, to the time she paid.

I'm sorry if you don't think that's justified, but honestly it's cheap considering the dealership will charge well over double that, if they still keep records of cars that old. Plus you'd be stuck with the tow bill to the dealership.

	<TEXT> $50 for a service call, which is more than usual because it was a good 15-20 miles away

$35 to fit a key when they don't have one, which for Mitsubishi sports cars isn't that easy

$40 to program, plus the cost of the key itself, which they wanted the remote head one that was 4 times the price of a normal one </TEXT>
