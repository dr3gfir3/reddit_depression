	<TEXT> Sorry meant to say starcraft 2 is sitting on my shelf.
Collectors edition yo.

Also warcraft 3 is in some disc sleeves somewhere, and i'm looking at a shareware copy of dune 2 to my right.

I never did finish that game, and hilariously my desktop case still has a disk storage drive. Maybe I can get it to work...

	<TEXT> same models as what the tabletop game? If so whatever tweaks they made to those models are pretty sketchy. Dynamic positioning helps the table minis too.

You're right. That isn't how winning a war or RTS works. From the videos I've seen, that's how winning the campaign of this rts in particular works, and I cant say anything different for multiplayer because  they haven't shown us any yet.  

Let me be clear: When i say you can throw away units, I mean that from what I've seen, in the campaign,  throwing away units is something that you can do on the regular and not get punished enough to create any real additional challenge in finishing the level.

And yes textures are lazy. not bad in and of themselves, but in the context of the other textures surrounding them. Not lazy enough that they can be ignored completely to allow a focus on gameplay
(dawn of war 1, starcraft 2, meridian new world) and not detailed enough that they draw your attention(Dawn of war 2, company of heroes, Grey goo) But some in-between state, of thinking hard about what game they wanted to make, but not thinking about the design aspects affected by the changes made  to make that game.

So, half-assed basically(Although i realize the danger in minimizing the amount of thought that did go into this, and that they probably think they DID think this through all the way.

I also realize that Multiplayer could operate differently, emphasizing
unit preservation because of the increased need and difficulty of holding an extremely important objective.

I still cant buy it on account of not being able to distinguish a damn
thing. These aren't my main complaints, and i really hope that more people don't take them as such.

My main problem is that between overdone particles, extra-bland textures, things like rangers looking like guardians, lockstep model animations, Size-of-Model being uniformly the same, health bars blocking the unit behind them, and so forth. the game is unwatchable for me and by extension unplayable for me.            </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah i know what they said, but they would have to decide to redefine 
what they want by clarity pretty freaking soon and now that the game is 
A: well received by their target audience(Not people who like the type of rts that relic popularized) 

and B: fairly close to release

I believe it will be up to a mod community to 'create' and popularize
the game that they actually wanted.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> okay, but are you saying i'm looking at a video and it is unwatchable for me, so i should buy the game and see if it is unplayable for graphics reasons? 

Or are you saying i should play starcraft first. Because i grew up on those games, and starcraft is sitting on my shelf, and i assure you that those games did not have these problems.

Lets be clear, none of these things are game-breakers individually, and none of them are unfix-able, but taken together make the game completely unwatchable for me personally, and by extension unplayable.

Easily mod-fixable(as much as anything is easy in development)
depending on the tools in question.   </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dawn of war 3: I legitamately can't tell what is happening onscreen. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-08 08:39:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I played dawn of war 1 and 2, and if the footage is anything to go by this game is basically unplayable for me.

I can't see any unit that any eldar unit is shooting at.

I can't see any unit behind the giant heatlh bars.

There are no unit type indicators, which wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for all this bloom.

Everyone moves in lockstep, how hard would it be to just make stagger the animations a little. Just assign a number to each unit, and put a bit of a delay on all the ones with an odd number. 
Actually, get me to do it, I'll code it for you, I volunteer.
I did just do exactly this five hours ago.

I have a buddy who is a professional artist who told me that this game breaks a lot of rules of character design 101, the main thing being that a characters silhouette should have a shape distinct from the others.

He also said the textures are generally lazy. I replied that my eyes wanted to slide off the backgrounds, but defended it by saying that they wanted it to run on low end computers. Then i saw the frame rate drop and facepalmed.

One of the  things i really like about the 40k universe is that it doesn't matter what aspect of the IP you happen to be playing, things operate the same way. A shuriken cannon is the same whether you're playing Dawn of war or Battlefleet gothic.

What the heck is going on in the eldar trailer? I think the dire avengers have shuriken cannons and the rangers have brightlances? (first 15 minutes of the trailer, after that my head started to hurt.)

This is particularly bonkers because they said they did all this stuff
for clarity. Pretty clear this game is unplayable for me without a change in character design, animation design, and a generous brown layer(Which definitely is not the way you want to fix this, by making everything more brown. Also not likely to happen, first they have to acknowledge that this is a problem.)

sucks, i was looking forward to this until i saw pics, then cautiously optimistic until i saw video, then hoping all races weren't a trianwreck until i saw eldar, now i might forget 2 years from now how bad this was and buy on a steam sale for 10 dollars.

My only hope is that a mod community fixes this. if the tools aren't garbage, I might try my hand. Depends how much control we have, but custom animations and assets are things we have had access to before in this series, withe the exception of the GFWL fiasco.          

Bonus: No exp? looks like we throw our marines and eldar into a meat grinder. I understand big battles, but there's little reason to micro if you can throw units away like this. 

Why are marines, eldar and orks the same size?

Those buildings look a little bland. Sure that objective looks like a com tower, but from a high end mobile game or something.

Is it just me or does Starcraft look more GrimDark than this? I mean, graphics are less important than gameplay, but when you
have things this bright you undercut the setting, which undercuts the story, which undercuts the emotionanal investment in the campaign, which ... undercuts gameplay. Huh. Well Then.

I have an aether vial deck that also plays cantrips, daze, force and therapy. there are 19 creatures, and 7 cantrips. there are 5 three-drops, 8 two-drops  and 6 one- drops.

This deck also plays no wasteland, as it is a combo deck.

color screw isnt a problem, though that could be a function of games being over before i can get wastelanded.

Can confirm, pontiff is great.

do the rhino , sigarda and titania are good finishers.
podding titania token into sylvan safekeeper is gas.
play knight of the reliquary as a three.

Honestly, the key here is that each card is a threat individually, so that you reduce the reliance on pod. 
value creatures are not really the way to go, When you pod you want to sac a guy that is falling behind on the board state for a guy that is now the best thing in town.

no value guy is gonna be better than just drawing three with painful truths. Pod is a repeatable-use board state superiority spell, using it as a value generator is going to get you killed.

edit: five forests is two forests way too many, cut one for volraths stronghold so you can rebuy podded guys.
edit edit: sylvan library is Really Good. gets better with multi rhino.

	<TEXT> might have been wrong to board it out against infect TBH, idk that matchup well, the guy i always ask to test against always says no, so i've got no experience. played it super safe.

extremely weird things happened all night, none of those games were normal. I don't think any reasonable conclusions can be drawn.

I also have no real experience casting brainstorm and ponder in decks that are not ANT or TES, So me being just bad at decks with blue in them is a real factor.

Small sample size is small. I really just posted this to give people an idea of what the deck could look like in 2016.
