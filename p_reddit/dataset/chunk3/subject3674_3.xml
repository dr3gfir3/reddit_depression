	<TEXT> Thank you so much for the information! It's been very helpful. Just joined DNA detectives and I'm digging into it now. I think I'm going to start with 23andMe as I'm most curious about ethnicity right now. My SO said he'd gift me an Ancestry.com test if and when when I decide I'm ready to look for family. Thanks again! </TEXT>
