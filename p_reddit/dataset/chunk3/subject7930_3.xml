	<TEXT> Did anyone else here read the book?

I think reading the book ruined it for me (as usually happens). I wish I could've seen it before reading the novel because I was waiting for certain lines or moments or monologues that didn't happen. I think if I hadn't read the book I would have loved the movie, but the situation being what it is, I didn't love it. 

I thought the cinematography was beautiful, and I really believe Scorsese was incredibly equipped to handle the source material as he is a Catholic himself. I thought he did a masterful job of capturing various crises of faith without pa seeing or bias. However, I found myself vacillating between being engrossed and feeling lost in the pacing. I'm not saying I think it was done poorly. It's not that my attention span was too short, I just had many moments were the material captured my attention only to linger for so long that my heart was no longer held by the scene. 

Overall, still a beautiful film brought to life in a way that only Scorsese could have accomplished.   </TEXT>

I said, "It hasn't left my hands since you gave it to me sir". He looked at it. "No. that's not my watch." I had no idea what to do. "Do you want me to get my manager, sir?" "No, I want my watch". We sort of just stared at each other for a while. After a minute or so he looked at the watch, put it on, shrugged, and said "I guess it is my watch" before walking out the door.  </TEXT>
