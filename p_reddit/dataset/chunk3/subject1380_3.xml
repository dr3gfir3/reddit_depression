	<TEXT> this is incredible bc last month i googled the name christina lee which may or may not have been for stalking reasons and saw your song as a result and decided to click it and i'd cleared my cache for some reason that day so youtube was on autoplay and all your music just kept playing for the next few hours and i'm sorry i don't even have a question, i just feel like this was super coincidental
edit: woah nope apparently i can get banned for not asking a question, ok ok what are your favorite pizza toppings? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oooh okay I'm going to be entering my freshman year at Michigan State and I'm trying to find something that would correlate with my major (computer science) so this resume would be for an IT related job/internship, and if that doesn't work out for me, I'm considering just omitting the objective and applying to a random on campus job. Any advice on formatting or content would be fantastic, thank you!
