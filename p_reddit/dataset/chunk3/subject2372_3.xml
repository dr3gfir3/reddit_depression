	<TEXT> I think I'd be edging more towards level design as I'm more comfortable with modelling structures and terrain than characters etc. I'll have a look on YouTube to see the kind of thing people are after. One last question - do you know roughly what the average salary would be for an entry level gig in this area? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> UK Architects - Is there a limit to the amount of time you can take off between part 1 and 2? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm just about to graduate from my part 1 and want to take a few years off to do some other stuff. Is there a limit to the amount of time I can take off before doing my part 2 or could I theoretically take 10 years off and still come back to pick it up again. Is there a cutoff point where you eventually become disqualified? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, thanks for the advice. Are 360 turntables what employers generally like to see then? Would it be a bonus to maybe stick in a bit of footage from some of the levels I've designed in Unreal Engine as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in the UK, just about to finish my BA in Architecture. Throughout the course I've always found the 3D modelling aspect of my studies more engaging than the specifically architectural side. I was just wondering what scope there would be to move into the industry as an entry level environment designer/3D modeler after I graduate. I have extensive experience in several 3D modeling applications (Rhino, 3DS Max, Sketchup) and the Adobe suite (Photoshop, Illustrator, Indesign) as well as informal experience in Unreal engine from playing around with it in my spare time. Do you think game studio's would be open to an Architecture graduate if I put together a portfolio to demonstrate more game specific skills? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mechanism for architecture project </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to make a reconfigurable system for an architecture project I'm working on. I want to make a pavilion with a ceiling that has a matrix of evenly spaced holes into which will be placed posts that can be easily pushed and pulled towards and away from the ground. I want to find a sliding mechanism whereby the posts would retain the position to where the user pulls them so that they can be at any height and don't simply fall all the way to the ground when pulled. Could someone point me to a diagram of a mechanism that has a function like this? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Advice for architecture project </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, I just bought and worked my way through the Arduino starter kit and would like to work it into a project I'm working on at university. Still a bit of a newbie so was hoping I could get some opinions on the best way to go about what I want to do.

Our theme for the year is architecture and politics so to kick it off I want to make a map of the council wards of Brighton out of translucent acrylic, lit from the back with RBG LED's. I want to make it so that when you flick a switch the LED's change colour to represent the controlling political party of the different areas from the 2010 to the 2015 election results.

Here's an image of the colour changes I'm aiming to achieve:

And would these lights be a good choice for this project:
