	<TEXT>  The Good News isn't marriage between a man and woman. It's about who Jesus is and what his death and resurrection means.

*"For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and be joined to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh. This mystery is a profound one, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church."*

	<TEXT> Nobody is proposing bachelor marriage. 

I never said they were: I'm using a hypothetical question to draw out the problem in the current situation.

If you think think it's a loaded question in the case of married bachelors, but not in the case of same sex-marriage, why?

Or, alternatively, if you don't think it's a loaded question in either case, why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are the falsehoods and half truths I have thrown out?

  A and B can get married as they're a straight couple, C and D cannot as they're a gay couple, how is this equal?

We are dealing with two senses of the word "can" here, and I don't think it's sophistic to make this distinction.

The first is that of who is regarded as being married by the government.

The second is whether a person actually *is* married.

Imagine that, after change in legislation, a person can now can be issued a piece of paper saying "I am a married bachelor". 

In one sense they now "can" be married, and married bachelors now have equality with other currently legislated marriages. 

In the other sense, if being a married bachelor is an incoherent concept (which I think it is), then nobody "can" be a married bachelor, and all the existence of a piece of paper which says otherwise just shows that the law has enshrined a falsehood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Taking the case of a rock with a smiley face painted on, when somebody says "it's cruel to heat that rock" we reply to them "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked by the smiley face into thinking that the rock is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is not cruel to treat in this way."

What I'm trying to say is that, when a naturalist thinks that they have encountered a genuine instance of empathy (i.e. one with a real human, not a rock with a disguise) which provides a justification for treating them differently to an inanimate object, naturalism inescapably leads to the conclusion: "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked into thinking that the human being is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is clearly **not** cruel to treat in this way (blocks of marble, clouds of helium gas, pools of tar, and so on)

A naturalist might, as you have done, put forward the bare description "I happen to experience certain pleasurable sensations when I think I have found the truth or when I help others"

But this leads to the further question "Why are pleasurable sensations objectively good?" 

Plus, the "I" ends up dissolving in the Darwinian acid too!

As Dan Dennett puts it:

*"Youve got to leave the first person out of your final theory. You wont have a theory of consciousness
if you still have the first person in there, because that was what it was your job to
explain. All the paraphernalia that doesnt make any sense unless youve got a first person in
there, has to be turned into something else. Youve got to figure out some way to break it up
and distribute its powers and opportunities into the system in some other way. "*

Blackmore, S. (2006) Conversations on Consciousness. Oxford: Oxford University Press

All discussion is dependent on the truth of certain propositions like "I and you possess selfhood" and "it is objectively good to seek the truth", and thus if naturalism ends up denying these propositions it's not that therefore it's emotionally unpalatable: it's that it's an incoherent belief system.

----

You also said that it is "simpler" to use a naturalistic explanation rather than to "invoke gods"

I certainly agree that if we take a scenario like: 

"there exist certain arrangements of matter which display certain states 
(which those arrangements of matter call "empathy" or "anguish") because producing those effects
under certain circumstances is an effective
way (or at least, the byproduct of an effective way) for particular sequences of nucleic acids to
perpetuate themselves."

And, taking a broad definition of the word "god" we add to that scenario "An immaterial being more powerful than humans who has some kind of interest in human affairs"

I totally agree that adding in a "god" to this picture doesn't help: the physical account already explains things entirely.

But where I think this fails is that this is an inadequate portrayal of the issue.

Firstly, it misstates the nature of what needs to be explained: what needs to be explained is selves, for whom it is objectively good to seek the truth, not the existence of certain arrangements of matter, as sketched in the scenario above.

Secondly, it misstates Who God is. God is not merely "an agent" who "explains" morality
by the fact that He has certain desires regarding humanity and that we should obey them because
He is smarter or tougher than we are, or something like that. Rather, he Himself is pure Goodness:
God's very being is what our wills are grasping toward.

There's more to both of these points, but that's an outline of what I'm getting at.

If people continue to not recognise the question-begging character of the phrasing then I don't see why I should stop.

 As long as people aren't allowed to get married because they're gay,

Imagine if somebody said "Why are you stopping me becoming a married bachelor?" because you didn't want a law to this effect to be passed. Would you call somebody pointing out that phrasing it as "denying rights" or "stopping them from getting married" presupposes what is in question a "desperate word game" too? If so, why not?

How is it not a view?

Some people, including Magda Szubanski, hold the view that, ethically, marriage is a union between two people, of any combination of gender, and that the law should reflect that.

Other people have other views.

Unless you are decrying a kind of relativism in which you see the word "view" as connoting "mere subjective  opinion", which I would also agree is an inaccurate portrayal of this issue, I don't see what the problem is.

	<TEXT>  Voting on other people to have equal rights isn't a good enough start for you?

Phrasing the issue as "denying equality" presupposes precisely what is in question, though:

If you are correct that marriage is between two people, then traditional marriage proponents are denying peoples rights.
If we are correct that marriage is between a man and a woman, then nobody is denying anything when they seek for that to truth be upheld in the law.

As an analogy, imagine if I saturated the media with the question Why do same-sex marriage proponents want to lie about what marriage really is?

Presumably you would answer something to the effect of Well, I dont think Im lying, I think that I have the true view of what marriage is, and I want the law to reflect that. You can clearly see how this begs the question i.e. presupposes that my position is true. </TEXT>

What if it's just a fantasy, and doesn't focus on some particular person who actually exists? To add to this, perhaps the person in the scenario might sneer and dismiss "honour" as being just as much a primitive superstition as the natural law proponent's "proper use", because it's "intangible", unlike the narrow sense of harm previously mentioned.

if we had an innate sense that homosexuality is intrinsically evil, you wouldn't be able to convince a majority of Americans that it's not evil

Surely it's possible for whole societies to fall into massive moral errors, though? I'm sure a 19th century Southern American defender of slavery could say "If slavery is immoral, then why haven't you been able to persuade a large number of Southerners that it is?" </TEXT>

without evidence, any assertion may be dismissed, and design falls firmly in that category

Where does Henderson actually say this, though? I really think Craig's representation is more accurate than yours.

 If you're unfamiliar, I suggest going over the trial

I'm *very* familiar with the history of this topic. Here are some previous posts of mine on why I think ID isn't accurately characterised as creationism:

https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/4enlfh/why_does_the_opposition_to_the_christian_claim/d228hy9

https://www.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/3n7wym/is_intelligent_design_fairly_categorised_as_a/

I'm quite happy to say that there is significant sociological overlap between ID and conservative Christianity, and that the underlying motivation for many ID proponents is how they see it fits in with their theological views, but I really think that a lot of people have an overly simplistic view of this topic which doesn't seem to go much beyond "Judge Jones said it, I believe it, that settles it for me".

	<TEXT> I think Russell's Teapot fails for the following reason:

Russell argues that, suppose that somebody proposes that a teapot orbits the Sun, but that it's too small to be revealed by scientific investigation. Surely it would be absurd to propose that the lack of evidence for a teapot in orbiting the Sun means that we should reserve judgement on its existence?

The reason why it seems intuitively unreasonable to ask people to reserve their judgement on the existence of the teapot is because we have good arguments *against* its existence: it is very unlikely that a teapot could be formed naturally in outer space. It is very unlikely, that a teapot could, unaided by humans, reach the velocity of 25,000km/h needed to escape from the earths gravity. Given the immense effort to conserve weight, it is also unlikely that any stowaway teapots may have accidentally found their way onto a spacecraft and then become lost during the journey. And so on.

	<TEXT> William Lane Craig is helpful here:

*"The much beloved Flying Spaghetti Monster was the concoction of Bobby Henderson, who in the summer of 2005 wrote a satirical letter to the State Board of Education of Kansas to protest the use of textbook stickers promoting Intelligent Design. It (or he, as the Monster is personal) has gone on to become an international sensation (see Hendersons website at www.venganza.org/).*

*Henderson used the noodley Monster to parody the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe. He wrote, Let us remember that there are multiple theories of Intelligent Design. I and many others around the world are of the strong belief that the universe was created by a Flying Spaghetti Monster. It was He who created all that we see and all that we feel. Henderson claimed to know quite a bit about the nature of the Flying Spaghetti Monster:*

*. . . it may be helpful to tell you a little more about our beliefs. We have evidence that a Flying Spaghetti Monster created the universe. None of us, of course, were around to see it, but we have written accounts of it. We have several lengthy volumes explaining all details of His power. . . . He is of course invisible and can pass through normal matter with ease. . . . I have included an artistic drawing of Him creating a mountain, trees, and a midget.*

*As the drawing shows, the Monster is composed of two large meatballs surrounded by a mass of spaghetti topped with two eyeballs. Its evident that the Flying Spaghetti Monster is supposed to be a finite, physical object which, for some unexplained reason, is not perceptible to our senses.*

*Great fun! But now what is the point of the parody? What does it show? Its striking that Hendersons parody does nothing to call into question either the legitimacy or necessity of the inference to an Intelligent Designer of the universe. Rather the point of the parody seems to be that we cannot know much, if anything, about the nature of the Designer. Therefore, its arbitrary to characterize the Designer of the universe as God, especially the God of some specific religion.*

*Whats curious about this parody is that ID theorists like William Dembski have been insisting on this same point for years, but everyone seems to think them disingenuous. Dembski makes it abundantly clear that on the basis of the specified complexity in the universe one cannot infer that the Designer is infinite, omnipotent, omniscient, omnibenevolent, and so forth. It is precisely for that reason that ID theorists deny that ID is disguised religion. The identification of the Designer with God is a theological conclusion that cannot itself be warranted on the basis of the design argument alone.*

*Dembski writes,*

*"Insofar as design theorists do not bring up God, it is because design-theoretic reasoning does not warrant bringing up God. Design-theoretic reasoning tells us that certain patterns exhibited in nature reliably point to a designing intelligence. But theres no inferential chain that leads from such finite design-conducing patterns in nature to the infinite personal transcendent creator God of the worlds major theistic faiths. . . . As a Christian I hold that the Christian God is the ultimate source of design behind the universe. . . . But theres no way for design inferences from physics or biology to reach that conclusion. . . . Far from being coy or deceitful, when design theorists do not bring up God, it is because they are staying within the proper scope of their theory (The Design Revolution, p. 26)."*

*Therefore, Dembski is adamant that religious interpretations of Intelligent Design should not be taught in public classrooms. Dembski himself, had he thought of it, might have appealed to the Flying Spaghetti Monster to illustrate his point! Ironically, then, Hendersons parody actually reinforces one of the central contentions of the ID movement, that it is not religious teaching. The inference to a Designer is not an inference to any particular deity."* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it is the human condition to rationalise our feelings to ourselves. Why am I feeling this way? It must surely be because it is a bad thing to suffer, etc.

That's not true: we often recognise that we experience sensory illusions of various kinds.

We find things like this disturbing because our brains are pretty good at detecting agency and sometimes this can mislead us and cause us to empathise with objects that are neither living nor suffering.

All you are doing there is saying that there are particular sets of conditions which often produce empathy in human beings, and sometimes we get some false positives (e.g. rocks with smiley faces).

It doesn't matter whether or not they are qualitatively different.

It does, because we all recognise that somebody who thinks that their empathy for a rock with a drawn on smiley face is a truthful perception of the world is mistaken, and on this scheme, it's ultimately **all** false positives. 

You might *get the impression* that your spouse who is weeping because they are suffering from an illness is qualitatively different to a rock with a smiley face being split open, but they aren't in the end.

there is no aught here.

*Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying, as through an infinite nothing?* </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  We start with what feels wrong and this arises due to a powerful sense of empathy and provides the motivation to engage in moral reasoning

Why does possessing a sense of empathy "provide a motivation" to engage in moral reasoning? 

 But keep in mind that our moral intuitions are not flippant things like "favourite flavour of ice cream" - they are deeply ingrained in us and it causes us real anguish when we see others suffer.

To draw out the absurdity, we would consider a person to be mistaken if they said "it is **cruel** to heat mineral X to 200 degrees Celsius because unlike mineral Y, when this happens, 80% of the time it releases a gas."

Similarly, saying that moral sensations "aren't flippant" is to commit the same mistake, on this scheme: the fact that aggregates of matter have particular arrangements which produce effects which we call "anguish" or that such effects occur with regularity (i.e. are "deeply ingrained") doesn't show that they are ultimately qualitatively different from 200 degrees Celsius causing the effect of gas release from mineral X 80% of the time. 

On this scheme, one might be given the *impression* that certain physical phenomena are "less flippant", but that impression is itself, merely another physical phenomenon, not a perception of some real qualitative difference.

"It is objectively good to seek the truth" but it is my opinion that truth seeking is a more rewarding and less risky path to follow and because I like it so much

Why does the fact that you experience pleasure from holding a belief imply that you should hold it?

	<TEXT>  The feeling that it is wrong is ultimately a powerful SUBJECTIVE feeling that is shared by most people.

A few questions:

1 . In situations where we recognise that certain things are merely subjective, we usually make statements like "You may have the impression that vanilla icecream is a better flavour than raspberry, but that's ultimately all it is, and you can't impose that on others."

And, similarly, doesn't this view inescapably lead to the conclusion "Certain people think what Hitler did was right, others (like /u/Aceofspades25) think it was horrific, but we can't impose our own subjective tastes on each other, now, can we?". 

2 . You mention that most humans agree with you, but a large proportion of people experiencing a subjective impression that genocide is wrong is quite compatible with the truth of nihilism.

3 . How is this your position not self-refuting? The fact that you are making *any* statement and seeking to persuade somebody presupposes the truth of the proposition "It is objectively good to seek the truth". </TEXT>

Polyphyletic has no **a** in it, and thus doesn't include a common **ancestor** of all the taxa in the group.

	<TEXT>  Solomon was a revered king of Israel, in what was and is looked on as a golden age. Whatever happened later, god clearly sanctioned him

Where on earth did you get this bizarre view that whatever happened in Solomon's reign, God approved?

The condemnation of Solomon is explicit in 1 Kings 11:3-13

"Solomon married seven hundred princesses and also had three hundred concubines. They made him turn away from God, and by the time he was old they had led him into the worship of foreign gods. He was not faithful to the Lord his God, as his father David had been.  He worshiped Astarte, the goddess of Sidon, and Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. **He sinned against the Lord** and was not true to him as his father David had been.  On the mountain east of Jerusalem he built a place to worship Chemosh, the disgusting god of Moab, and a place to worship Molech, the disgusting god of Ammon. He also built places of worship where all his foreign wives could burn incense and offer sacrifices to their own gods.

Even though the Lord, the God of Israel, had appeared to Solomon twice and had commanded him not to worship foreign gods, Solomon did not obey the Lord but turned away from him. So the Lord was angry with Solomon and said to him, **Because you have deliberately broken your covenant with me and disobeyed my commands**, I promise that I will take the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your officials.  However, for the sake of your father David I will not do this in your lifetime, but during the reign of your son. And I will not take the whole kingdom away from him; instead, I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city I have made my own.

This really isn't "my spin". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for continuing to engage with me.

 That's different from "acquired from a retrovirus."

I don't see what you're getting at with that distinction. The first paper says *"This gene, encoding a protein that we have called syncytin, is the envelope gene of a recently identified human endogenous defective retrovirus, HERV-W."*

It doesn't seem to be saying "those are genes, not ERVs".


 it shows that different cells express different sets of transcription factors, so ERVs will only be active in some subset of cells.

What if the activity is [only present in taxa which have the ERVs, though?](http://gbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/11/gbe.evv049.full.pdf+html)

I  have heard the objection that these sequences are undergoing spurious transcription, but I hadn't heard about the rapid degradation of the transcript before. Would you mind giving me a reference for that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's take the example given at 2:29 in the video, that Solomon is described as having multiple wives. The video makes the unjustified leap that because a particular behaviour is described in Scripture, this implies that is being set up an ethical ideal. 

If you take a look Deuteronomy 17:17, you'll see that a King of Israel shouldn't take multiple wives "**lest his heart turn away**". And we see just this happening Solomon's later life, "for when Solomon was old his wives **turned away his heart after other gods**" (1 Kings 11:4). It's clearly serving as a lesson in what *not* to do.

The sad fact is that this kind of media is really shallow stuff, but it still gets applauded by people who pride themselves on being "critical-thinkers" and "educated" and so forth, not realising the painful intellectual inadequacy of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   none of it qualifies as functional.

Haven't some researchers discovered that at least some sequences which were putatively ERV-derived can have a functional role though?

E.g.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10693809

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4827613/

http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.0010044

Regulatory regions like promoters, enhancers, and silencers are all non-coding but extremely important functionally. 

And aren't there [plenty of promoters in ERV sequences](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18535086)? </TEXT>

Arrogance is when a person has an inaccurate overestimation of their own state, isn't it? Can you see how this is impossible when we are talking about God, Who is perfect?

I'm not a moral relativist like you are, I apply morality to everyone equally, including god.

No, what you are doing is treating God as, at best, a being which merely possess goodness, beauty etc, in the manner that humans do, but to some greater degree. But this isn't "equality": this is a fundamental error about Who God is. </TEXT>

I think your thought process seems to to be"If a human told us to worship them, we'd think that they were really full of themself, because they'd have an inaccurate self-perception. Therefore, if God told us to worship Him, he would similarly be faulted."

Again: given that God, *unlike human beings*, is the source of all that is good, it is fitting that we worship Him, and sinful if we refuse to. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might Makes Right is your entire argument. 

I don't think your summary is justified. I agree totally that simply being more powerful or more benevolent than Kim Jong Il doesn't make one worthy of worship, and I didn't argue that in my post. Rather, I think God is worthy of worship, not because he possesses characteristics like goodness, etc. to some greater degree, but because He Himself is pure Goodness in his very nature.

, according to the Bible, God's very name is "Jealous", for starters.

As far as I am aware, when God is described as jealous, this typically refers to prophets urging Israel to turn back and worship God. I don't see how Israel having this unique place in salvation history and being warned about coming judgement implies that God possesses some "need" for worship.

As I've said elsewhere in this thread, If one does not inherit eternal life, then God's justice cannot be faulted, as the offer of it is utterly gratuitous on His part.

Beyond that, any pains that will be experienced would be presumably proportionate to the way one has lived.

So, I don't think the justice of God could be faulted in such a case.

Does anybody know any other good slow melodies arranged for trumpet and organ which would be suitable to be played during communion?

Our priest preached well, and used a quote from St Benedict that a disciple is somebody who prefers nothing else to Christ, and tied that in to the Gospel reading (Luke 14:26-35). 

The final hymn "O Jesus I Have Promised" (Tune: Thornbury) was a real ripper, and fit in with the Gospel reading and sermon, I thought. </TEXT>

I'd argue that the convertibility of transcendentals implies that that which is the source of being must also be the source of goodness.

Why does God need to be glorified? What's wrong with him emotionally that he needs that or thinks he's entitled to it?

Why do you presume that God's glorification must proceed from some inner lack?

 he is still going to torture me if I don't worship him

	<TITLE> On the objection that God is a celestial dictator who unpleasantly commands us to worship Him </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-03 09:40:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Some skeptics have argued against Christianity in the following manner.

**Arrogance**

- Scripture contains exhortations to worship God during our earthly lives, and condemns Israel's failure to do so properly. 
 
- The final state of the redeemed includes the praise of God throughout eternity

- It doesn't seem to fit with the alleged greatness of God that He would command others to worship
Him. After all, doesn't it seem arrogant when people like Kim Jong Il or other dictators do this on earth? 

Along these lines, Christopher Hitchens once said 

*I used to wonder when I was a kid, what would it be like praising God and thanking him all day and all night? 
Well, now I know because North Korea is a completely worshipful state. 
It's set up only to do that, for adoration and its only one short of a trinity. 
They have a father and the son, as you know, the Dear Leader and the Great Leader."*

He goes on to ask Who would really want this?

I think we can unpack this objection by asking: why *is* the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders
so bad, anyway?

Let me submit that it is because there is an incongruency between the way they are presented
and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the 
*true source* of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature. 

That is, it's so absurd precisely because he  is *not God*.

And so, I think the Christian can quite happily agree that if God were merely an immaterial version of Kim Jong Il, then He would indeed not be worthy of worship, but that in terms of addressing the internal consistency of Christianity, the objection doesn't hit home.


**Emotional neediness**

Another aspect of this argument is an alleged contradiction between the perfection of God, and Gods command to worship Him. Doesnt commanding somebody to worship you necessarily imply a kind of emotional insecurity and neediness in God which would contradict his purported perfection?

Again, I think the Christian can partially agree with this argument: if God was the kind of being that commanded people to worship Him on the basis of personal insecurity, then that *would* seem to contradict with Him being perfect.

However, I think that the commands to worship God in Scripture have a different basis:

1. To glorify God. 


2. By God's grace, when we persevere and worship Him, we are sowing seeds that will be reaped in eternity. It is fitting for us and to our own benefit that we worship God.

	<TEXT> I think the following reflection by Ed Feser is helpful:

*"... according to Christian theology, God offered to our first parents more than what was owed to us given our nature.  He offered us a supernatural gift.  Here it is crucial to understand what supernatural means in this context.  It has nothing to do with ghosts, goblins, and the like.  What is meant is rather that God offered us a good that went above or beyond what our nature required us to have.  In particular, he offered Adam and Eve the beatific vision  a direct, face to face knowledge of the divine essence which far transcends the very limited knowledge of God we can have through natural reason, and which would entail unsurpassable bliss of a kind we could never attain given our natural powers.  He also offered special helps that would deliver us from the limitations of our natures  that would free us from the ignorance and error our intellectual limitations open the door to, the moral errors our weak wills lead us into, the sicknesses and injuries our bodily limitations make possible, and so forth.*

*By definition, none of this was owed to us, precisely because it is supernatural.  Hence while God cannot fail to will for us what is good for us given our nature, He would have done us no wrong in refraining from offering these supernatural gifts to us, precisely because they go beyond what our nature requires for our fulfillment.  Still, He offered them to us anyway.  But this offer was conditional.* 

*The fall of man*

*The condition was the obedience of our first parents.  Yet they did not obey.  And of course, that is the point of the account of their eating of the fruit of the tree of knowledge.  It wasnt fruit per se that was important, but rather the will to rebel against the Creator.  (Recall Augustines youthful theft of the pears, where what was attractive about the theft was the fact that it was forbidden, not the fact that he got some pears out of it.)  The penalty was the loss of the supernatural gifts they had been given and that their descendants would have been given, and a fall back into their merely natural state, with all its limitations.  In particular, it was a loss of all the helps that would effectively have removed those limitations -- and worst of all, loss of the beatific vision.*

*In short, the penalty of original sin was a privation, not a positive harm inflicted on human beings but rather the absence of a benefit they never had a right to or strict need for in the first place but would have received anyway had they not disobeyed.  And it wasnt the prospect of pitchforks and hellfire that Adams descendents had to look forward to because of what Adam did, but rather the privation of this supernatural gift.  What is essential to Hell is the loss of the beatific vision, and while Hell can certainly also involve more than that (including the pains of sense) the standard view is that it does so only for those guilty of actual sin, and not those (such as infants who die without baptism) who merely suffer the penalty of original sin, without ever having committed actual sin.  (For this reason the Scholastic tradition came to settle around the view that infants who die without baptism, and thus without removal of the penalty of original sin, probably enjoy perpetual natural happiness -- the highest state we could have attained without being raised to the supernatural gift of the beatific vision.)*

*You might compare the situation to that of a landowner who has sold an unimproved parcel of land to a certain family  which, just to be cute, well call the Adams family.  In allowing the Adamses to take possession of the parcel, hes given them everything he owed them.  But suppose he offers to throw in, for free, something extra  to plant on the land a vineyard using the finest quality vines, whose fruit will make possible the best wine.  This is something that all the descendents of the original Adamses who bought the land will profit from.  But the landowner makes the offer only conditionally.  He wants to see how Mr. and Mrs. Adams are going to handle things before turning the vineyard over to the Adams family as a whole, including the many descendents who are not likely to do any better with the vines than their ancestors are.  So if Mr. and Mrs. Adams do well with the first vines planted, they and their descendents will get to keep them and reap the benefits.  If not, the landowner will tear them out and leave the Adamses and their descendents with only the original unimproved parcel, which is all they were owed in the first place.* 

*Now suppose that Mr. and Mrs. Adams botch things up, and the landowner removes the vineyard.  The fault is entirely theirs, but all their descendents necessarily suffer the penalty just as much as they do, just by virtue of being Adamses.  Yet it is not a positive harm that is inflicted on them, but rather the loss of a benefit they were not entitled to but nevertheless would have received if not for the actions of their ancestors.* 

*The hereditary stain*

*Notice that there is nothing the least bit unjust about the landowners actions, since he never owed the vineyard to any of the Adamses in the first place.  He would have done Mr. and Mrs. Adams no wrong if he had refrained from offering the vineyard, and he does none of their descendants wrong in denying it to them.  Notice also that there is nothing remotely mysterious about how our fictional Adamses inherit the penalty of Mr. and Mrs. Adams error, and do so genetically.  For they do so, not because theyve got some strange vineyard-losing gene but rather simply because they are the biological descendents of Mr. and Mrs. Adams, and the deal that would have gained or lost them the vineyard was a deal made with Mr. and Mrs. Adams on their behalf.*

*Similarly, we inherit the penalty of original sin, not in the sense that weve got some original sin gene alongside genes for eye color and tooth enamel, but rather in the sense that the offer of the supernatural gifts was made to the human race as a whole through their first parent acting as their representative.  Inheriting this penalty from Adam is more like inheriting your fathers name or bank account than it is like inheriting his looks or his temperament.  And there is no more injustice in this inheritance than there is in the landowners not planting a vineyard for Mr. and Mrs. Adams descendents."*

in with their theological views.

	<TEXT> Lyrics:

O wie schn ist deine Welt,

Vater, wenn sie golden strahlet!

Wenn dein Glanz herniederfllt

Und den Staub mit Schimmer malet,

Wenn das Rot, das in der Wolke blinkt,

In mein stilles Fenster sinkt!

---

Knnt ich klagen, knnt ich zagen?

Irre sein an dir und mir?

Nein, ich will im Busen tragen

Deinen Himmel schon allhier.

Und dies Herz, eh' es zusammenbricht,

Trinkt noch Glut und schlrft noch Licht.


-----

O how beautiful is your world,

Father, when she shines with golden beams!

When Your gaze descends

And paints the dust with a shimmering glowing,

When the red, which flashes in the clouds,

Sinks into my quiet window!

-----

How could I complain, how could I be afraid?

How could anything ever be amiss between You and me?

No, I will carry in my breast

Your Heaven for all times.

And this heart, before it breaks down,

Shall drink in the glow and the light. </TEXT>
