	<TEXT> Well some new beginners (like me) (i know other people too, see it on reddit, youtube, etc) they intend to throttle when they pull the front brake, like they pull the trottle while using the front brake, and that's so annoying. People say use the clutch for that, other people say you should you learn to not do that because if you use the clutch it gives you less stopping power. Because you could use the engine braking </TEXT>
