I used the 2014 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample which can be found on the ACS Website. This visualization uses Tableau to show the migration status of people for every age.

The visualization groups individuals into 3 groups: those who arent at a different address than the one they had 12 months, those who have moved within the country to a new address 12 months ago, and those who have moved from another country 12 months ago. Children that are under 12 months old are not included in the data because they hadnt been born a year ago. A picture of the survey question has been included in the post. </TEXT>

I'm guessing you saw the mobile version. Be sure to come back on your desktop when you have a chance. There is a gender filter that you can use to play with the data. Tableau, just isn't as mobile friendly so I only include the static image. 

Thanks for your insight!

	<TEXT> That would be cool and something I could technically work out. The problem is that some of researchers are concerned about the data quality of same sex estimates. This is because of the way that it is currently gathered you have people that are counted as same sex that actually made a mistake on the questionnaire.

	<TEXT> A few months ago I created a visualization that allowed users to compare age distributions for various topics and another one that showed marital status by age range. I decided that I wanted to take a closer look at marital status and I thought this tool would give me a good base to start from. This visualization uses Tableau to show the marital status for every age.

The data for this visualization comes from the American Community Survey which is completed by the US Census Bureau. I used the 2014 One Year Estimates Public Use Microdata Sample which can be found on the ACS Website. In the post, I have provided examples of the questions that are asked to create this data. </TEXT>
