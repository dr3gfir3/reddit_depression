	<TEXT> I would like to start with saying that my native language is not english. But I am really found of writing, especially in english. I practise a lot, read a lot and also try to make some short stories and poems using prompts. 

I find it quite difficult to build scenes or build a character. I was reading The Magician's Nephew and it has a chapter in which Narnia's creation is discussed. That chapter was so impressive, I was totally engrossed in it.

So my question is; how to build scenes which activate almost all the senses of the reader to totally absorb the reader into the book? </TEXT>
