	<TEXT> I think it's very important to note how Natalia *specifically* responds to Adam. She is in no way "overwhelmed by a drunk man" in this scene.  He tells her to get on all fours. She does. He tells her to crawl to his bedroom. She does. He puts her on the bed, and says he says he wants to fuck her from behind. She says **"OK."** When he enters he, he asks her questions, like if she "really likes" him, which she answers affirmatively. When he flips her over and is about to come on her, she says **No, not on my dress.** So he comes on her chest. The expression on her face is one of displeasure and then disgust--expressions which, perhaps importantly, Adam NEVER saw before they began having sex. Then she expresses that she did not like that," to which he apologises. To even imply that this is rape is so fucking insulting. 

And honestly, *Girls* is a very interesting show. It's a truly engaging character study of four very different young women in New York, full of awkwardness and humour and poignancy. There are frank and sometimes disturbing portrayals of sex and love and desire. I wouldn't discount it for this 3 minute scene, taken waaaay out of context. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, historically it's not that long ago that people AGAINST racism would have been part of that ideological fringe you're so quick to disregard. As for "extremism"--well, it depends what kind. In most cases politically/ideologically, there's a huge gulf between the beliefs of "extremists" and "the mainstream". Usually it's where you'll find the truth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It appears that, according to your logic, everyone who`s not the majority would qualify as "fringe"--any minority would. So therefore no minority needs to be taken seriously. British Columbians? Fringe. Non-caucasians? Fringe. Non-christians? Fringe. French? More fringe. Seniors, children, green-eyed, homosexual -- fringe. Don't need to be taken seriously, and they don't matter either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To say that 5%, or 1/20, of Canadians are "fringe" or don't matter is ignorant and undermines the very notion of democracy. But to look at it from a more big-picture angle, NDP + Green support equate to 17% of the popular vote, which is about the same as the Liberals'--and that's not counting the one million BQ supporters, whose environmental policies are in between ndp and green. Now we're up to 41% of Canadian voters who do NOT support Liberal/Con environmental policy, which is more than Conservative supporters. But in a democracy, everyone's opinion "matters", whether that translates into a tangible vote or not.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say yes. I'm really not sure how I'd rank it among the USBBs, as I tend to forget each season pretty soon after they're over, but it's definitely a good show. Great mix of characters, interesting house dynamics, and affably cheesy competitions and dramz. The houseguests are not exactly more down-to-earth, but have a more.. well.. Canadian type of personality, if you understand what that looks like.  A bit... more civil, a bit more like people you'd meet in your everyday life. It's hard to describe.

**TLDR - Yes** </TEXT>

But one night I was sick and AMC was on, and I was coming in and out of wakefulness (you know, that fever type sleep) and realised that I was hearing some dialogue as good as any dialogue I'd ever heard, ever.  I tried to wake up to watch but fell back asleep instead.  The next morning I woke up, completely unaware of what that damn dialogue had been, but knew I had to watch that show.  Which I did.

	<TEXT> A lot of good ideas in the comments here.  Here's another: why not try a one-month membership at a yoga studio, then use what you learned there to build a practice apart from the studio?  Then you can get your gym membership and do your gym thing.  Once you learn what you need to from a good teacher, all you need is your mat to keep it going.  

If you're really concerned about calorie-burning a typical hour of yoga probably burns 100 calories, maybe more, while toning.  30-45 minutes of cardio at the gym would burn 300-500; 1/2 an hour doing strength training would burn 200 calories or so.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I pulled this off an buddhism forum a while ago.  I'm not a Zen practitioner, but I do like this interpretation too:
Zen teacher Reb Anderson says, "In the broadest sense, anything we ingest, inhale, or inject into our system without reverence for all life becomes an intoxicant." (Being Upright: Zen Meditation and the Bodhisattva Precepts, page 137). He describes the act of intoxication as bringing something into yourself to manipulate your experience. This "something" can be "coffee, tea, chewing gum, sweets, sex, sleep, power, fame, and even food." ... This doesn't mean we are prohibited from using coffee, tea, chewing gum, etc. It means to take care not to use them as intoxicants, as ways of soothing and distracting ourselves from the direct and intimate experience of life. In other words, whatever we use to distract ourselves into heedlessness is an intoxicant.

	<TEXT> A lot of your examples here are interesting, but there are different categories of harm; things that are in themselves more harmful than helpful; and those that in moderation are quite helpful but in excess become intoxicating.  So for you, celery would be in the latter category; meat, fats, complex carbohydrates, etc., would likely belong in the former.  We both agree that many non-chemical things can also be harmful in that 1st category sense, but we do clearly disagree on the chemical stuff.

We are at 2 impasses.  #1: I would go so far as to say all chemical intoxicants (mind- and mood-altering, and/or intoxicating even in small doses to the liver/kidneys/brain) also belong in that first category.  I approach this from the point of view of most interpretations of Mahayana and Theravada Buddhism, but more importantly (personally) from a Yogic perspective, where the things I consume I try to make sure are sattvic (or pure) according to rather clearly-defined principles.  From my personal experience, I have experimented moderately with marijuana and LSD, and to a much lesser extent mushrooms and MDMA; several years ago I made the decision to refrain from consuming these things in the future, for reasons I wont redundantly list again. 
 
When it comes to a lot of things (morality, politics, diet, drug-consumption) Im an objectivist, where it seems that you are much more of a relativist, and/or hold that many important truths are subjective (impasse #2).  The figure-it-out-yourself approach may work for some peopleyourself, for example, maybebut in general I find that approaches like that can be quite dangerous.  Our understanding is so limited, particularly self-understanding, and  I think that drug consumption can be an invisible harm, one that you dont realise has hurt you physically and spiritually.  Just because that harm cannot be immediately (or ever) perceived does not mean it isnt there.

	<TEXT> Well, contextually I tried to keep the discussion related to chemical intoxicants since, you know, that's what the post question was asking. And whether this is trivial or not, if a chemical substance intoxicates you, it is an intoxicant.  Yes, some intoxicate in different ways; some are more or less harmful than others; but the precept is semantically very clear. Reject and/or interpret it however you wish.  I agree with you about caffeine, which I consume fairly regularly, and though it is slightly mood-altering, it has no effect on one's judgment (unlike other more obvious "intoxicants"). Other seemingly mild or accepted intoxicants, like alcohol or marijuana, have more far-reaching effects on one's mood, state of mind, and judgment, and are therefore in a rather different category.

Can one be intoxicated by other things?  Certainly.  Power, hubris, sexual desire, greed, fear, etc. And I would agree/assert that these intoxications can all be dangerous and damaging.  But truly, all Ive done is repeat the precept its own simple terms, and yet you seem to have taken my comments personally, then went so far as to imply that Im unwilling to examine my beliefs and am actually perhaps intoxicated by my own ideals.  Neither of those implications is true, and I can't imagine any good will come from arguing this anymore.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, if you want to say all corporations's only responsibility is to the shareholders, fine--but that doesn't make them "good guys."  It makes them corporations being corporations.  To be "good" you'd have to do something, well, morally good.  A start would be to not-create unhealthful and addictive chemical concoctions marketed aggressively to adolescents, for one.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check out [r/leaves](http://www.reddit.com/r/leaves/).  I don't have any personal experience to relay, but would probably recommend using a healthy diet and exercise to boost your energy in a productive and healthily effective way.  If you're eating well and exercising regularly, you will find reserves of energy that were totally dormant before.  Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Studies show that once a person's general needs are met (food, shelter, security), and they achieve a secure level of comfort, the total amount of money earned really does not contribute to higher happiness levels.  Personally, the happiest people I know aren't rich, and the richest people I know aren't that happy.  Happiness comes from somewhere else, somewhere very immaterial. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, there`s probably not much you can do to "get out of this one."  The school admin will dole out some suitable punishment, which you can take like the teenage man you are.  Moral of the story: don't bring porn to your catholic school again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't possibly do this.

If she's pregnant, then you already did.  It's done.  If the girl is anti-abortion, then pressuring her to have one because you can't face the consequences of your own actions is just wrong on so many levels.  She can give the child up for adoption; no one's making you raise or support the baby.  If your friends hate you for having sex with this person, then they likely aren't your friends.  Your girlfriend will leave you?  Well, maybe you should have thought about that before you cheated on her.  Good luck. </TEXT>
