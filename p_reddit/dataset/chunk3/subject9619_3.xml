	<TEXT> Complicated title, but fairly recently a well known exploration company found a sunken Spanish Gold ship. They put their claim in which was later turned over to the Spanish government (back room deal involving some art that I won't go into), but the country in South America where the gold originated from was barred from staking a claim. Why is that, and where do those exclusionary laws come from? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I remember a while back, months easily that this came out. I remember seeing it on imgur before I was on reddit more. The artwork wasn't exactly stolen, but some artist took another fox image and reproduced it very, very closely. Added the text and Taylor Swift posted it on twitter. It's like the ultimate form of dejavu if I'm wrong, because none of this seems new or original, but reddit is freaking out like this is a new event. Anyone else remember it? I'll go look for the original posts now.

	<DATE> 2015-12-07 17:59:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I figured I'd come here for some advice on which surface for her to get. She did the online helper on MS's site and it said for her to get the Pro 3 or the Surface 4. I only know that the pro 3 is where they started being good machines, and I was wondering if you could provide some more insight.  
  
She's going to be going to grad school and that this will be her primary device, she currently uses an older Apple Macbook. Her degree is more Arts and Sciences than engineering, so I'm not worried about her needing compiling power and she won't be doing any film editing or rendering as far as I've been told.  
  
Thanks in advance for any help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi all, I'm looking to get some accessories and looking for recommendations and deals that you know of.  
  
A trigger seems to be the biggest thing I saw that got switched out on forums of this gun, any recommendations on trigger and why you like them?  
  
The sight is a V type that isn't adjustable (unless I have that vice like tool) and I have to aim the front site pretty high above the rear sight to hit what I'm shooting at, so I'm looking for an adjustable sight. Any advice there?  
  
Magazines, any to stay away from? Any good deals you've seen out there?  
  
I have a Serpa holster in coyote tan for it with the leg platform (my preference of placement for handguns and revolvers), so I'm good there.  
  
Anything else you all can think of that I should look into changing or upgrading? </TEXT>

I know a few people have had this happen, but I haven't found any fixes, a new band, a few restores and it still comes back immediately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone that types a negative comment will have a slightly lower credit score. If you like the comment your credit score drops too. If you follow someone on twitter they don't like, lower the score. You retweet how awesome your banks are it'll probably go up. http://www.computerworld.com/article/2990203/security/aclu-orwellian-citizen-score-chinas-credit-score-system-is-a-warning-for-americans.html  
  
With how much the government and by proxy the corporations that pay for those politicians want to be able to know who you are behind your IP this reality is more and more likely.  
  
The thing is most credit score evaluations metrics are trade secrets, so no one outside of the company can tell you exactly what's measured or what their weight is in the metrics. For example your job and your pay are included, but you never told anyone where you work or how much you get paid besides the government for tax time.  Oh wait, your employer might have, and one of the 3 credit reporting companies sold it and tracks it, and if a potential employer wants to know they can get your past pay info: http://www.nbcnews.com/technology/exclusive-your-employer-may-share-your-salary-equifax-might-sell-1B8173066  
  
It's scary how much information is out there that you might not even realize because you got a credit card, yet somehow a lot more than that is reported to credit bureaus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I search for something and it gives me the links that bing/cortana come up with like "search for Harrison Ford Movies" after searching for "Harrison Ford" I get a "we can't find the web right now" type of error.  Then if I click the search bar where the new search is as in "Harrison Ford Movies" and click the search/enter button on the bar it works.  It's just a weird glitch I've been noticing.

	<TITLE> HQL the process for me, a story for others </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-04 15:13:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So the tl;dr version is, I applied ave got my HQL.  
  
I finally decided to stop waiting for the law to be overturned and since I've been finger printed for my job I knew my prints were already on time somewhere. Personally I don't believe that they don't store them after s background check.  

I found a place to do finger printing without an appointment. This cost me $52.00, *son of a bitch*, right? The guy then circled the tracking number as the number you enter. This turned out to be incorrect. The number that begins with a "Y", which I confirmed with an employee at the MSDP.
  
I went looking for an HQL certification class. The day I signed up for a nonrefundable class I mentioned it to my coworker. He asked if I had taken a hunter safety class, which of course was a yes. He pointed out that I didn't need the handgun class then.  
  
He showed me online that it was buried in an exceptions area not on the main pages of the HQL section of the Maryland State Police Department website. I dug around the site using Google and found that it had to be within 3 years. Luckily for me I took it two years ago with a friend when it was offered for free at the local ruritan. She didn't want to go alone so I said I'd go with her.  
  
Quick short story, I wore my NRA hat the second day. She said she "couldn't believe I was wearing it and that it embarrassed her." Several people at the class complimented me or gave an NRA shout out to me and later at the local market a guy that was in the class came up to its and said he saw my hat earlier and wanted to say it was awesome. She couldn't believe the positive response.  
  
So I went home after work and got my hunter safety certificate and took a picture to upload it to the website. As I'm filling out the website the prerequisite section would not load up. I went looking online for an answer, turns out you need an older version than IE 11. Compatibility view wasn't working and I tried to install 10 on a friends laptop after installing 11, but it would always bomb out.  
  
Online someone on a forum and another person on reddit said they called in and a person did it over the phone. So I called up, no one was in the office until Monday. I called Monday and a lady said she would call me back after seeing if she could do it for me instead of me having to drive all the way down there.  
  
I called back later that day since the lady hadn't called me back by the designated time. As I'm talking to another lady I hear a woman say my name in the background, I mention to lady 2 that I think lady 1 is leaving me a voicemail. Lady 2 confirms this and transferred me to the original lady I called, lady 1.  
  
I had to give her my user name and password, I bit embarrassing since I used an unknown comic book character with an unfortunate name to give the police department lol. But she was able to see that first, I was using the wrong application, I need the qualification exempt application and second, that she was able to confirm all of my entered info was correct and formatted appropriately.  
  
Once completed I paid the $50, so that's $102 plus the $100 I've wasted on my nonrefundable class I didn't need. I completed the application on Monday. By Thursday/Friday it was complete and active. On Monday I had my HQL and Tuesday I went in and started the paperwork and 8 day wait to get two pistols.  
  
I was surprised how quickly my license came, but it's still a burdensome process to go through. I traded my class to a friend of mine for a tattoo or piece of art, don't know which will be cooler to have yet. Hopefully this story helps others. </TEXT>
