	<TEXT> The issue that so often gets forgotten in these cases by both sides in the arguments that spring up in these cases is not that the person was innocent of wrong doing (which appears to be the case that some of advocates for the dead woman try to say). It is that she was executed by a police officer. The claim that officer felt a threat to his life is simply not credible for someone who with his job role, physical capabilities and training/experience. It is clear he felt empowered to be both judge and executioner of a petty criminal given the slightest opening for a legal excuse. People who applaud this action, saying "she had just committed a crime": look yourself in the mirror and say " I approve of traffic police executing people exceeding the speed limit".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you look at the history of prosecution of police officers vs  the criminal charges against ordinary citizens, the same standard of "can you prove it" doesn't seem to apply. Looking the list of charges against the people Obama just commuted sentences against almost all, perhaps, all (I didn't read the details on every one) were charged with "Conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute". So how do you prove intention for criminal behavior that the suspects didn't even do?  You're right in that prosecutors seem to pull the punches with charges against police officers. There are high hurdles to get them charged with crimes in the first place, an apparent higher burden of proof than ordinary citizens, and a judiciary that seems to bend over backwards looking for reasons to acquit or dismiss charges. If by chance you happen to get a prosecutor that actually works at convicting a police officer and judge who's willing to dismiss the really really incredible defense arguments, it always seems there is yet another judge on an appeal who will accept these incredibly thin arguments. Two cases bear out this latter case. The police officers who shot and killed refugees trying to leave New Orleans after Katrina had their incredibly kid glove "manslaughter" convictions reverse on appeal. In Maryland, police officers who testified they'd been assaulted by a retired judge's son before they nearly beat him to death were convicted of perjury when their testimony was shown to be false in recorded video. Yet, on appeal, their convictions were reversed on a technicality that they shouldn't have been the one testifying in the first place. Both cases illustrate the example that if you're going to get reversed anyway, you might as well throw the book at the officer for murder or assault. That way when the corrupt judge goes to reverse the conviction, they'll have to be explicit about ignoring evidence rather than using some very grey detail about paperwork.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the case of Freddie Gray, who was killed by injuries sustained in a rough ride, the police officers have been charged with "failing to render aid", "negligence" and "dereliction of duty". Nary a word about intentionally causing injury with their rough ride actions. As much as people cry out agains deliberate abuse of authority, the old boy network of law enforcement seems unable to bring themselves to charge police officers with actual crimes of violence. These officers are guilty of assault and battery, kidnapping and interference with a federal officer in carrying out his official duties. Bratton is sputtering about fucking uniforms when he should be talking about breaking up organized criminal activity on the NYPD </TEXT>

Given the secrecy surrounding law enforcement's use of these devices, it is a law enforcement slanted spin to describe their use as sporadic.

	<TEXT> This is a great answer and appreciate your detail. There is one aspect you haven't covered that I wonder if you have information on. I've seen in others and experienced myself upon sudden cold water immersion an effect that seemed to be a diaphram muscle spasm making it difficult to breathe. The sensation is not unlike getting a body blow and "having the wind knocked out of you". In one instance a friend and I were moving a sailboat in winter when a sudden gust caused the boat to capsize. My friend went into the water while I was able to climb to the high side without getting wet. He literally lay on the gunwhale of the boat gasping, unable to breathe in for half a minute. When the boat came back up and his body was pulled from the water, he was slowly able to start taking successively deeper breaths. Is the diaphram spasm also part of the vasocontriction effect?

	<TEXT> As a kid I had science book on insects that I read voraciously before going out to collect bugs. I recall a passage on ants that described and pictured how ants heading out for foraging and ants returning from foraging would meet and overlap their antennae before each going on their way. These were kids books written in the 1960s. Seems like this behavior very clearly suggested some kind of communication between the ants. Why would it have taken 50 years to determine they actually were exchanging information of some kind? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My dad was a fighter pilot in the USAF. When I was a kid and relatives would visit, he would take us all out to the flightline and we'd climb up in the cockpit of the aircraft/stand on the boarding ladder while he told us about various stuff. The cockpit always had 4 or 5 levers or pull mechanisms that were painted in a black and yellow "barber stripe" pattern. These were all the ejector seat triggers. They were in different places because if you're in a tumble or spin or roll the gee forces are going to be all different possible directions, they wanted to make sure you never had to reach more than a few inches to grab one of these. On the ground every one of those levers/mechanisms had a pin stuck through it with red streamer tag labeled "Explosive". They were making damn sure somebody's sleeve didn't get caught on one so it got pulled accidentally. Some time around 1970, dad stopped being able to take family out to the flight line to checkout the planes. Apparently on some base somewhere, some pilot's asshole brother-in-law didn't believe there were really explosives in the ejector seat. He pulled the tag pin out of the handle and yanked it. The explosive bolts blowing the chair free killed the pilot who was standing on the boarding ladder instantly. The brother-in-law, who was sitting in the seat, but not strapped in, got launched a good portion of the 800 feet the ejector seat rocket lifted up off the tarmac. However, he did separate from the chair, so he came plummeting down like he'd fallen off a skyscraper while a parachute brought the chair down somewhat gently onto the airfield.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The explosion appears to encompass multiple pixels, not just one very bright pixel. It also appears to have structure with a bright initial point spreading out when it reaches some maximum altitude. That said, the galilean moons to the right of the planet appears smeared out as if some kind of jpeg block artifact expanded their size as part of the DCT transform. I have a related question though. The bright patch definitely seems to expand outward and then collapse, but it does so in less than a second. What would we actually be seeing in that case? Would superheated gases from the collision propagate up through the atmosphere for a distance on par with the diameter of the earth in a half of a second? Or are we seeing a shockwave move upward, and where the shockwave passes the local gases are compressed/shocked to the point of incandescence? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since Cal was not granted a patent, seems doubtful they could be licensing. Their lawsuit essentially claims Broad Institute's patent was granted unlawfully given that Cal filed first and Broad paid to jump the line. Complicating factors are Broads patent is for more extensive IP than what was claimed in Cal's; but at the very least Broad's patent should have been more narrowly granted. Because it was so broadly granted and then licensed, it makes the biotech using their license IPO less valuable. This is what has the financial world up in arms. In theory the biotech is worth a bunch of inestment potential; but if the patent they've licensed is reduced and the have go get a new license from cal, that money will come out of the investors profits </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Vietnam a company of marines surrounded by VC called for an airstrike much closer to their position than USAF policy allowed. The Marines were about to be overrun and said they didn't care whether they took casualties as they expected to be tortured or killed anyway. The pilot made the strike against policy. It was a cluster munition that basically  kills everything in a donut pattern -ie there is "hole" in the middle that doesn't get blanketed with the fragmentation munitions. The pilot intended to strike to one side, but accidentally dropped directly on the marines with the "hole" exactly centered on their position. They took 4 casualties killed from the strike, but it completely wiped out the attacking VC, with almost 100 KIA. The pilot returned to base and was being brought up on court marshal by the USAF brass when paperwork arrived from the Marines putting him up for metal for having saved a whole company (even though 4 were killed).   </TEXT>

You turn individual bits on and off by pushing those buttons (setting up the boot sector cylinder and sector address) before you start the computer running with the LSO/Start switch in the lower right. This was the system that your military used to run the sonars in the US fast attack and boomer nuclear missile submarines until probably 1990.

	<TEXT> During my college years, the university made the transition from punch cards to electronic terminals for the student programming projects. Prior to switch over you would write your code on paper, then enter it in on punch cards that had to be submitted to run. Punch cards were an office supply you bought either in decks of 100 or a large box of 2000. The latter was larger cost, but much lower on a per card basis. A friend bought the large and had only used about 1/3 when the university switched over to terminals. At graduation he still had that box with a brick of ~1200 cards.  

Cleaning out the apartment post graduation, doing final partying, somebody had the bright idea to go onto the roof of the apartment building and throw the brick of punch cards off so we could watch the explosion of paper cards spread out in a huge twirling cloud. One guy stayed downstairs to video the cloud from below while the rest of us troop to the top. The brick of cards was carefully tossed in a horizontal orientation to best riffle between the cards.  However, instead of exploding into a huge twirling mass, it stayed cohesive, basically a cellulose brick. It plummeted straight down onto the hood of the car driven by one of the partiers where upon it sort of broke into several large chunks. The hood of the car was left with a perfectly rectangular dent right in the middle. Talk about your buzzkill.

	<TEXT> When I google "Axion Analytical Labs", a lot of the hits I get are for law enforcement officers performing forensic crime scene analysis who are citing their training at Axion Analytical Labs as part of their CV. In recent years a lot of evidence that has become standard LEO testimony has been shown to be compromised or lacking scientific credibility (e.g. blood spatter pattern analysis, hair fiber pattern matching). While these aren't directly relevant to gas chromatography, can you provide some detail on how the processes you have developed and trained LEOs to use are relevant to criminal forensic investigations? Where these techniques are used as evidence in a court of law, how has the scientific credibility of the test results been demonstrated to support the conclusions they're used for in court? 

---EDIT ----  

I've been amused to watch the karma points on this question tick up and down over the past week. I can understand people who up vote a question hoping to see it answered; but who down votes a question, especially after it has been answered? All I can think of is there are some LEOs or police groupies out there who object to the idea that a scientific test used in forensic investigations actually has to have some scientific basis for asserting facts in the court room. Although my question could have been better stated, it was interesting too that Dr Polite's response was basically an evasive non-answer.  

What prompted my question in the first place was this [article](http://www.chromatographytoday.com/news/gc-mdgc/32/breaking_news/how_is_gas_chromatography_used_in_forensics/30185/#sthash.N37CIAqH.dpuf ) online about gas chromatography used in crime scene investigations. It makes this utterly unscientific assertion: *since it can accurately identify substances with no error margin.* No one with a testing background would ever make the assertion that a test has no error margin. Every testing methodology has an error margin which one seeks to minimize. The failure to acknowledge and discuss the pros and cons of gas chromatography in crime scene investigations very much strikes me as indicative this testing methodology has some skeletons hiding in its closet.

It is not clear from the article whether the authors were looking at the technical definition of "economic backwardness" or whether they had their own more modern english semantics in mind when they wrote the article.

	<TEXT> Not from perspective of janitor but of the perp. My dad suffered from a bad case of hemoroids and diverticulitis, also flatuence. When he would shit at work he would leave the toilet bowl splattered with shit and blood. In the early days of low flow toilets installed in government buildings, even multiple flushes wouldn't clear the sides. Janitorial bathroom service was only twice a week, but after dad left the restroom, someone would call janitorial service complaining that the toilets weren't being cleaned. On one of these occasions, janitor cleaned up the one restroom, then went to check the other restroom. Meanwhile dad had to shit and left a particularly bloody bowl. Janitor came back a few minutes after he finished to put out new toilet paper, found the toilet he'd just cleaned coated with bloody spatter. He went apeshit running through the halls screaming and cursing everyone saying they were going to cut off service of the company didn't get rid of the damned ass bleeder who kept fouling the bathroom. Janitorial staff threatened to go on strike. The final resolution of the issue was the government agreed to reinstall a full flow air pressure flush assist toilet to help keep the bowls cleaned  

--EDIT--  

After posting this, some of the details of this 20+ year old story came back to me. In his screaming tantrum running around the building the janitor accused them of doing various bizarre activities. Since this was a military weapons development lab office building, some of these were dark conspiracy theory accusations like using the toilets to flush away cut up fatal human test subjects.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the movie Gattaca, it was not the gene editing that caused the issues. It was instead the societal norms and laws that made individuals second class citizens who were denied opportunities because "of course" they couldn't perform as competently as the people with perfected designer genes. Somehow people seem to make this the fault of the gene editing rather than the societal bias based on the genetic editing. Mixed into all of this is the pseudo science fears injected by religious authorities against people "playing god". When you put it in those terms it is really cynical and cruel. If you could edit the genes of an embryo to prevent it from developing down's syndrome, is that "Playing God?" What does that say too say about the values we imbue to our god? That having been dealt genetic faults leading to development disorders, it is our duty to suffer them rather than thwart God's will?   </TEXT>

These statements begged the question, seeming to simply assume designer babies would be an evil act regardless of the context or the specific genetic edit applied. If designer babies are inherently unethical, a scientific conference discussing the ethics of using CRISPR for human genetic modification would seem obligated to make the case for this assertion, point by point.  Each point should be backed up with the legal/moral rationale behind the argument. Since it wasn't done in your podcast,  can you review the specific moral or ethical objections to designer babies? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the reservoirs are filling to near normal levels, this "Mother of All El-Ninos" has only left the snow pack at near average levels. The reservoirs are a blip of capacity compared to the amount of water normally stored into the snow pack. Normally, the melt then refills the reservoir levels as they are used for irrigation during the year. If you [compare the snow pack this year with the big El Nino of 1982-1983](http://cdec.water.ca.gov/cgi-progs/snow/PLOT_SWC), you can see it is only just barely reaching the average level of the previous several decades. When you consider the higher temperatures that come with global warming/climate change, that average snow pack is going to melt into those reservoirs, probably faster than they would normally be used. The result will be melted snow and empty reservoirs before the snow comes again in the fall, if it comes again in the fall.  </TEXT>

A more accurate name would be "River Drainage Basins of the World" (with some errors for failing to account for closed basins that don't drain into a sea, like the USA Great Basin or the areas around the salt desert formerly known as the Aral Sea.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Based on your brief description above (rather than a read of your paper), it sounds as if you've concluded increasing ocean temperatures are extending the normal range of whale sharks into more northerly latitudes. Since whale sharks are plankton/basking feeders, this suggests the range of the species on which these sharks feed is also shifting north. Is there also a corresponding reduction in the southern range of whale sharks? --ie are increasing ocean temperatures also killing the whale share prey species or making the waters too warm for the sharks to survive at the southern end of their range? </TEXT>

An example is high school chemistry experiments where you create tiny hydrogen bubbles by reacting zinc particles with hydrochloric acid. The presence of hydrogen is confirmed by holding a burning splint over the beaker. The sounds caused by the tiny bubbles of hydrogen exploding when they hit the flame are amazingly loud for the fact that they're the size of pinheads. The sound is caused by the extremely fast speed of the hydrogen combustion creating a shockwave </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The current estimates for the age of the universe are between some numbers in 4th significant digit after 13.7 Billion years ago. Calculations derived from the Spitzer Space Telescope observations recently pinned down the rate of the universe expansion at 74.3 +/- 2.1 km/sec per megaparsec. If you project this linearly (which probably isn't completely valid), then anything further than 13.4 billion light years away is increasing in distance from the expansion of space faster than the speed of light. However, such movement is not said to be "traveling" -ie it is not moving at that speed. Space is simply getting bigger at that rate. Not really sure how general relatively handles that case. It might also be noted, the furthest observed galaxies are at about 13.2 billion light years away. However, they were nowhere near that far away when the light we're seeing from them now was emitted. According to theory, they will at some point in the future "wink out" when the expansion of the universe takes them out of our light cone.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shortly after the explosion, while there was still uncertainty as to whether it was simple atomic or thermonuclear, a weapons expert opined even a 1% boost of the base fission device with thermonuclear elements would be considered a hydrogen bomb -ie thermonuclear is not determined by the size or even the amount of the boost. The fact that the explosion was smaller than their previous fission only explosion suggests they've either been able to miniaturize their original fission design (but reducing the yield), or their thermonuclear design ended up disrupting the yield more that it boosted it. I've seen references to poor thermonuclear weapon designs being subject to "tritium poisoning", where impure tritium/deuterium gas intended to boost the explosion actually ends up making it fizzle.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The title of the news article linked "Why Pollinators Forage on Toxic or Bitter Nectar" seems to suggest the nectar of plants containing bitter compounds is itself bitter. Since, by its nature, nectar contains sugar. It will most likely ll have at least some level of sweetness combined with the bitter. While it may not apply to insect tastes, I can't help but be reminded that things humans consider "interesting tastes" are generally a blend of two or more of the primary taste senses --e.g, BBQ sauces tend to be sweet, salty and sour at the same time. Ditto for thai food sauces - Sweet and Salty. Bitters in sweet cocktails are another example more relevant. Rather than bitter compounds having secondary microbial effects that then attract pollinators, I wonder if bitter compounds might simply be a case of creating a  bitter   sweet combination that pollinators find more attractive. At least one of the cited nectars, citrus, contains high levels of caffine, which is considered a bitter compound. Supposedly bees are attracted to it for "the buzz" they get.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this isn't really about soap, but might be relevant. In homebrewing, many beginners start with kit brews, normally consisting of a can of malt syrup, yeast and possibly hops pellets.  They're often disappointed by the lack of head in these beers. The secret to headier beers is the use of grains from which the proteins in the kernel get leached into the solution for fermentation. Perhaps proteins are just a specific example of surfectant, but as a class, proteins are generally "sticky", they will hydrogen bond with each other at multiple distinct points and have long chain like structures that allow those sticky bonds to be stretched. I would suspect your tougher soap bubble soaps might have some protein or protein like substances linked onto the hydroloyzed hydrocarbon chains/alcohols that make up the major component of soaps.

	<TEXT> Anti-muslim racists/bigots will sometimes cite the legal process in Muslim countries as "Rule of Judge" as opposed to western countries as "Rule of Law". Basically in non-rule-of-law countries, the judges can just make it up as they go along. They can decide one person is guilty and punished for the same crime and evidence that another person is let off, without justification or even having to provide a rationale. I see stories like this and question how we can claim "run of law" in our country when something like this can go on for years. Even now, the only repercussion for the judge is that he agrees not to do it any more. Why wasn't he charged with criminally abusing the power of his office? How is a simple agreement not to do it in the future providing justice for his clearly  illegal rulings? Specifically, why isn't this judge removed from office and thrown in jail? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So to the point on OP's question, even successful construction and operation of ITER will not get us to the point of generating fusion power. ITER, if it is successful will teach us how to start and sustain a fusion reaction. From this, it should be possible to design a fusion reactor from which we can extract heat and generate power. A comparison could be made to the timeline from the first controlled fission reaction to the first military and commercial fission reactions. It is not completely fair  both because there was a war going on and the technology was quite a bit less advanced; but the timeline from the construction and operation of Fermi's Pile-1 at the University of Chicago 1942 to the opening of the Shippingport Nuclear Reactor (1957) and launch of the USS Nautilus nuclear powered submarine(1955) was about 12 to 15 years. So, assuming ITER lights up and runs this year, could we expect a commercial fusion reactor before 2026?  </TEXT>

Some definition of terms would be useful here. Will ITER actually "generate" power? It's my understanding it won't. It is still at the stage of trying to sustain a fusion reaction from which more energy could be extracted than it took setup and sustain it. It doesn't mean that energy will actually be extracted and used to generate power.  It should be noted, the US's National Ignition Facility has already achieved the breakeven threshold of more energy produced than required to setup. However, it was never designed to be a power generation facility either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Another method might be to mess with the internal structure of the sun to turn off its nuclear fission.   

Fusion - the sun is doing fusion, not fission. 
In his book "Iron Sunrise", Charles Stross imagined how this might be done, although the physics was sort of magical: all the remaining fuel for fusion in the core of the star was transmuted into iron, causing an immediate stop of fusion. Outward radiation pressure from the fusion processes is balanced by the crushing inward gravitational pressure from the mass of the sun. Stop the fusion and the star collapses, much like a fission implosion bomb. When all the mass comes crushing it, maybe you get a neutron star, maybe you get a black hole, maybe you just get a ball of really hot iron; but there is a shitload of energy released just by the conversion of all that potential energy as the giga-giga tonnes of matter fall from the outer layers of the sun toward the center. All that energy is going to blow all the outer layers off in a huge explosion, like a supernova

	<TEXT> Back in the 1980s the USA had this thing called Milk Price Support (hell they may still have it today). Anyway, if the dairy farmers couldn't sell their milk at the federally set price minimum, the government had to buy it from them at that price. This had been going on since probably the 1930s. The upshot was that over time all that government milk was being converted into velveeta cheese food. Now the government was stockpiling cheese food. Additional government spending was occurring just to store the fucking velveeta. Reagan decided instead of giving people money   food stamps which they tended to use to buy wonder bread and velveeta, they'd just give them velveeta directly. This would empty the government warehouses, allowing the leases to be cancelled, thereby saving the government money. About 1984 there commenced the great government cheese food gifting. Anybody could show up and get 20 pounds of velveeta style cheese food. The next day you could get 20 pounds more, etc. Recipes were invented e.g. Spam logs with cheese food and instant Mac noodles. It was a simpler, cheesier time. Soon demand for liquid cheese food pumped onto chips became a mainstay of the American diet. Dairy farmers could start selling the produce of their velveeta producing cows directly to movie theaters, bars and street vendors. The economy grew in leaps and bounds, and cheese food took over the world. Thank god for those pioneers who first braved the culinary challenge of wtf do i do with 20 fuck lbs of cheese food? Without theses early chefs, the USA would have collapsed under the weight of all those warehouses full of it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you'd find the primary motivation for the us intervention Libya primarily came from the UK. They essentially called in the chit owed for the UK's support of the US going into Iraq. Obama was very reluctant, Clinton was supportive of US bilateral relations with the U.K., and republicans like McCain, Rubio and republican house committee leads were baying for unleashing the military. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During the NATO intervention in Libya, Obama intervened only very reluctantly and under pressure from republican war hawks in the US congress. However, once agreed to participate, the US got called upon again and again to run bombing missions because the Europeans had literally run out of ammunition (bombs). The US also supplied a large percentage of the munitions to the other Nato members aircraft for the same reason.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While they may not have stand alone military bases, other countries, Germany in particular have military installations on US Soil. Having lived on military bases in Germany as a kid, the colorful red, yellow and black painted guard shacks of military facilities are a brilliant spot in my childhood memories. Imagine my surprise then at seeing one at Dulles Airport in the 1980s. It has moved around a bit since then but is still located on the Dulles Airport grounds, currently adjacent to the cargo terminal buildings which are North and West of the main terminal. Also, the German Air Force had their own compound, aircraft hangers and office space on Holloman AFB in New Mexico. It was fenced off from the rest of the base, with access into and out of the area controlled by German Air Force officers.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's like pretending anything from before 1776 isn't part of American history  

No it is instead naming wars by the organization/nations involved. We don't call it the American-French Indian War. We call it the British/French-Indian War. America didn't exist then, neither did Canada. 

I will also note, the war of 1812 was also fought in British Florida. Jackson kicked the British ass in Pensacola and New Orleans </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At my bird feeder, squirrels will drive away birds that try to land and eat while they are on the feeder. In addition, some of the larger, more aggressive birds like the Flicker woodpecker will sometimes attack and attempt to drive the squirrels away. Usually doesn't work, but sometimes juvenile squirrels are skittish and will jump away. They definitely do interact with each other in this case, albeit, one in which they are competing for a food source

	<TEXT> While using the genetic profile of insects in different localities to determine the migratory range is a interesting technique, the experiment did not "find" that the insects migrated the distances cited. That is not how science works. 

Instead the results only suggest that these insects migrate long distances and experiments to verify this assertion should be undertaken. Other possible explanations for the finding include the possibility that the insects are unusually homogeneous in the genome and perhaps suffered a recent genetic bottleneck. Or, the theories suggesting the rate of gene clocks need to be reconsidered.   </TEXT>

First time I walked by it I was sure it part of the military training camp in the movie. Clearly there is still a lot of the monumental architecture inspired by Albert Speer, Hilter's architect still around. A bit off topic but I think illustrative that there are some fascist iconography still residual in our own societies </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's only bad if you don't know it's a satire  

I've mentioned this elsewhere but will restate it here. Starship Troopers as written by Heinlein represented a heartfelt ethic of 1950's / 1960's conservative America. In some ways it is not all that different from near worshipful status of anything associated with the military in today's GOP conservative culture. When Hollywood decided to make the movie they went over the top with their fascist iconography and comments like those of the recruiting sergeant with half his body blown away: "The Mobile Infantry made me the man I am today!", all said in the tone of true enthusiasm. It truly is satire, but at least a portion of today's population doesn't see anything wrong with the idea that only former members of the military should be qualified to vote or hold political office.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last year I made the plunge into interchangable lens digital photography with a Sony A5100 mirrorless camera. In general I liked the photos and features available on the camera, but had one complaint: the rotating dial used to switch between different photo modes kept getting bumped by the ball of my hand when I was composing photos. It turned out less than 6 months after buying, the photo got dropped overboard into salt water. So I'm back in the market for another camera. Can anyone comment about their experience with the user interfaces on other $1000 DSLR and mirrorless brands? Anything you liked or turned out to be a pain? </TEXT>
