	<TEXT> Well, we saw the body covered with the blanket and, if I'm remembering this bit correctly, Chloe is wearing a new ring on her right(?) hand (presumably Joyce's?), so they definitely didn't just book it immediately. They probably went to the diner and to Chloe's house before they left, but there's no real evidence of *that*. </TEXT>

I try to be funny here and there, but I'm no pun wizard. 

I love this community, and I always want to be a part of the discussion (and help keep it going!). I'm here for the long run; I don't want this sub/community to die. I gotta admit, it makes me sad seeing how there are way less posts here now that the game has finished.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I put up [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/lifeisstrange/comments/3tcwwc/ep5_spoilers_rank_the_episodes/) yesterday where I asked people to rank the 5 episodes. This is what I had to say: 

 **1. Episode 3:** This is why I love Life is Strange. Max and Chloe, back in action. Getting to sleuth around Blackwell with them and beginning to uncover the truth was great. This episode gave us some of my favorite interactions between Max and Chloe. We start to see them develop as characters and come to understand them better. The pool scene and waking up in Chloe's room are awesome. I love this game for the positive emotions it stirred up in me, and this ep is my favorite because of that. Playing Episode 3 I finally started to realize how much I had fallen in love with these characters and this world. The cliffhanger ending blew me away, and I realized what depths I was willing to go to in order to save Chloe. To me, this story is all about Max and Chloe, and this episode epitomized that. Not to mention I discovered this sub after playing Episode 3. :)

My second fav was Episode 4, but I actually considered putting Episode 1 in the number one spot because it's the most chill and the most atmospheric (in my opinion). To be honest, I have viable reasons to put Episodes 2, 4, and 5 in the number one spot as well. It's just a great game all round, and each episode is a progression of the previous one.   </TEXT>

Besides, it would be plain *cruel* to bring someone like Max into the real world without Chloe. If I can't bring them both, I'd bring neither.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually totally agree with you on your points on Episode 1, and the general tone-trajectory of the series. However, as the game progresses you get to watch the characters slowly become people, while in the first episode they're not much more than stereotypes (but that's not a bad thing). Maybe that's why I like Episode 3 the best: it's right in the middle, where the characters have started to become real people and the tone is still for the most part pretty light.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [EP5 SPOILERS] Rank the episodes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-19 00:09:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Simple yet difficult: rank episodes 1-5 of Life is Strange (season 1) according to your personal preference. Spoiler tagged so that we can freely discuss the episodes without hassle. Sound off below, I want to see what all of you guys think!

Short List: 

**5: Episode 5**

**4. Episode 1**

**3. Episode 2**

**2. Episode 4**

**1. Episode 3**

Now with more detail.

**5. Episode 5:** I loved every second of the finale but it is still drastically different from the rest of the series, and lacks some of my favorite things from the previous eps; it's got a very different tone and a distinctly different atmosphere. I'd like to stress though that I still *love* this episode, as with all the others. This was a hard list to make.

**4. Episode 1:** This is hard. I considered putting this in my number one spot. At this stage in Life is Strange we had no idea what the game was actually about, and I love that. We got to explore Blackwell and meet new faces with a clean slate and no worries. 

**3. Episode 2:** I also considered putting this at number one. Fuck it, I also considered putting the next one at number one. The Kate story is incredibly emotional, and this is when the greater plot of Life is Strange begins to be revealed. But I love this Episode for it's dope intro sequence (the best in the series in my humble opinion), and for the extended period of Chloe Price and Chill. I love that diner scene. This episode hit both emotional highs and lows, and it balanced them really well. 

**2. Episode 4:** This episode was just something else. We finally began to uncover the dark secrets of Arcadia Bay, characters showed their true colors (Warren, Nathan, Frank, Jefferson, Victoria), and we got to play detective while listening to Sparklehorse and Amanda Palmer (and it was AWESOME). But I love Episode 4 for its first act in the Alternate Universe. Like with Episode 2, this sequence hit such highs and lows. Getting to be with Alt-Chloe provided some of the most heartfelt and fuzzy feels in the whole game, but then punctuated them with some of the most depressing and guilt-inducing ones. The Euthanasia scene is one of the most powerful scenes in the whole game, and it's something that I'll never forget. *See you around.*

**1. Episode 3:** This is why I love Life is Strange. Max and Chloe, back in action. Getting to sleuth around Blackwell with them and beginning to uncover the truth was great. This episode gave us some of my favorite interactions between Max and Chloe. We start to see them develop as characters and come to understand them better. The pool scene and waking up in Chloe's room are awesome. I love this game for the *positive* emotions it stirred up in me, and this ep is my favorite because of that. Playing Episode 3 I finally started to realize how much I had fallen in love with these characters and this world.

	<TEXT> I finished the game last week, and I'm still finding it really weird to think that Life is Strange is over. I was happy, not heartbroken, with my ending, but I'm still filled with this odd emptiness knowing that LiS is done. Like, I don't really want to do anything else right now. I don't want to play other games, I don't want to listen to other music, I don't want to do anything that isn't LiS related. It's weird, and it will probably pass. But Life is Strange felt like a huge part of my life for most of 2015 (and the best part of my life for most of 2015!), so having it just be finished is so...weird. 

Regardless, I wouldn't trade it for the world. I'm glad to have had these memories and to have spent the year in Arcadia Bay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a lot like letting the storm hit Arcadia Bay. *Teeeeeechnically* you don't know if it'll work as advertised, but that's not the point. The point is making you choose in that hypothetical scenario: do you save the world, or do you save the person you love more than life itself? You have to be willing to give anything for your cause.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First thing I'd like to say is **yes, your choices *do* matter.** They matter throughout the story and, even though the ending outcome is decided by a single choice, your choices will impact what *you* take away from the game. That sounds like a kind of cheesy cop-out answer, I know, but just trust me. This story is about what you experience; you might understand this better once you've finished the game.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The big failing of TLoU was an inability to choose an ending, despite the fact that it really seemed like you should have been able to.

I disagree. The Last of Us is not meant to be your story; it's meant to be the story of Joel and Ellie. Instead of letting you control the characters, it puts you in their shoes in order to allow you to *understand* them. No matter how much you like or dislike the ending, we can all understand why Joel did what he did. It would have been incredibly out of character for him to go the other way. 

I think the game's biggest failing is how forced some of the combat is. Some of it is *extremely* forced, and some of it feels super organic. It's so strange; that "ludo narrative dissonance" is at both its best and worst in The Last of Us.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if they'd specifically reference the Paris attacks, but it seems likely that they'd cover some kind of shooting or police brutality or something of the like. Fun fact: I was convinced that the climax of Episode 4 would be Nathan shooting up the Vortex Club party. I was pretty surprised that a school shooting never happened at Blackwell in the game; it's a growing issue in the world today, and I can see a lot of things they could have done with that idea.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What kills me the most about the Bay ending is that Chloe dies alone and scared. That's what I can't bear. But to answer your question, it *would* be worth it to me to spend one more week with my best friend, even if it wasn't "real". If it's true to me, then it *is* real. Chloe says it best: "All those moments between us were real, and they'll always be ours." 

But at the end of the day, I'd give anything to save my best friend/save Chloe. I don't want them to suffer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd probably be just as invested in the characters, if not more invested. What initially drew me (a guy) to Life is Strange was a parallel I saw to my life in the relationship of Max and Chloe: I haven't seen my own best friend (also a guy) from my childhood for five years. Being Max and getting to reunite with Chloe was like me getting to see my bestie again. So male protagonists wouldn't turn me off; it'd probably make the game feel even more personal than it already does. And if they were gay? Well the way I see it, love is love. I don't really care. Platonic, romantic, it's all the same love to me. </TEXT>
