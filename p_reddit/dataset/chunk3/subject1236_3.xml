	<TEXT> Im looking to main GP in Season 5 since it melts squishies, and i hate Adc so i just remove then from fight. In teamfights you first gotta get a good ult off, and ofcourse before teamfights poke the bitches. In teamfights, raise ur teams morale by using your so you give them some more AD and also a bit of mobility. In teamfights, if you get CC'd and you know it has a long CD eat oranges, so they basically wasted a CC, and you can do ur stuff on. Other than that, try to Q Q Q Q Q in teamfights. For build i recomment: Shiv-Triforce-IE-Hydra-Tank Item (depends on the situation). Also get Mercs somewhere there for ultimate CC reduction. Start building triforce by sheen, shiv by avarice and get like 500 extra gold from Q and Avarice together. Sheen gives you more slapping power. Critplank is the best version of gangplank. You will have 300+ AD with my pirate stuff and crit like 1200 so its quite amazing - Have fun and AHOOOOYYY </TEXT>

So do you have 40cm dreadlocks or is it like 20cm at bottom are dreadlocks at 20cm hair at top is just hair. I know, the question and my problem is dumb as hell but I just dont have any idea and I kill myself by overthinking. Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello folks!
I recently picked up Vladimir and I kinda like  him and I thought I would give this champion a go for main. I won a lane against a Gragas, shit on Xin Zhao with  him being lvl 2 at 8 minutes and carried the game single-handedly by destorying their carries with Q E and 2 autos and they were dead. I would love to know what kind of runes are good on him, and general tips about him. Also my build path looks something like this: Start - Ruby Crystal 2xHPots. Core: Hauting Guise - Sorc Shoes - Will of the Ancients - Zhonya - Deathcap - VoidStaff or Upgrade Guise to Liandry. Sums I have always gone Flash/Ignite. In lane at 20 minutes I end up with like 140-150 CS which in my opinion is fine since Vladimir's basic attacks are piece of shit but I somehow manage to last hit with them a lot. Maxing Q E R W

	<TEXT> AT the beginning a woman drives a car and talks with her telephone but suddenly she makes a car crash with a person, who is a cannibal. She goes to see what she has done but ends up getting beaten and killed by cannibals friends. She was driving to a surviving in the wild without tools TV show. On the place itself, on the plains in the center of the forest near the road they all get to know the rules and leave to the forest and the cameraman goes to his bad-ass streaming studio on the wheels, a RV made to it. Already on the first hours they see wierd fast stuff which are cannibals and see their friends die. They end up in an old paper factory which is the cannibals base and there are tons of cars there who belong to cannibals victims. In the factory, some gang-bang happens and 3 of them survive. The show creator, and a pair who was made at the beginning - man and a woman. </TEXT>

AS for faster clear, obvious and 1 crit chance because of personal preference.
Movement speed for moving faster between lanes and in the jungle
Now yellows: All flat HP since I buy armor always more than magic resist, and +72health makes it easier to survive the first clears.
Scaling Magic Resist since I prefer to buy more armor which means I will have less magic resist than armor by quite amount. Most of the MR is straight for late, but early MR isnt bad aswell.  

Ofcourse depends on what enemy team is off but I consider it to a team atleast with 1 AP champion.  
  
Hopefully you understood everything, I know that my sentence ,,build'' is kinda bad but English isn't my native language.  
  
EDIT: My regular build would be TrailBlzWarrior TriForce Tabi/Mercs/Swiftness Randuins Warmogs and Spirit Visage OR the same build with an expection to replace TriForce with Frozen Hearterino/Sunfire Caperino if im the only tank. (the choice between frozen heart and sf cape depends if enemies have more AS dependent champion other than adc) </TEXT>

I usually build  Trail Blazer Devourer - Merc Treads OR Tabis with Alacrity (My fav enchantment:P) - Trinity Force / Frozen Heart / Randuins / Banshees or Zephyr, depens on what you want: more tankyness or AS to take turrets down fast. If you Mercs zell them get tabis and then get zephyr or reversed.  You can tank all inhib turrets but I havent yet found a way how to tank nexus turrets alone. Lasers do damage. But TP Smite can bring cancer to enemy team, I recommend it too </TEXT>

Fizz early game is very hard, lasthitting with him is hard since when  you go and lasthit a creep you will get a lot of poke. gotta know how to roam good.

	<TEXT> Hi! Im a Silver 1-2 player who has not yet found a champion that he can play 24/7. I have tried many. I get tired of them after 10 games. But I do not get tired of Katarina and Vlad. I like playing champions that are kinda rare like Vlad. My question is that has Vlad the pontentional to solo-carry a game kind-of? Like do most of the damage so your team can finish off etc? In my opinion like 60% and 70% ap ratios are quite okay, 45 for a AoE E would not be bad too, I have a nice ultimate that deals a nice portion of damage. In lane I could sustain and pool the gankerinos (hehe). So shall I give him a try? He seems so badass </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the dark, depths of Bronze of Silver,
where players flame eachother. There is you, the friendly guy who gets annoyed if others are flaming and tell them to shut up. Riot, the almighty god has made a nice feature, that when you press tab................................there is magical chat-shaped button in the flaming fellas horisontal line called ,,MUTE''.

TL;DR use the mute function its free and works flawlessly. No need to start flaming yourself to get one guy to shut the fuck up </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a terrible winrate in most of the divisons. Im overplayed. Most of my players are guys who think you just need to AA. They are very wrong. Im hard to play as shit (:p). A lot of them flame when playing me, usually I feed but when in good hands like one of my mains then I can 1v3 the folks. Laning with me is hard aswell, but If i get going im UNNSTOPPABLEEEEEEEE  </TEXT>
