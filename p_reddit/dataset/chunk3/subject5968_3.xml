	<TEXT> I had an absolute nutcase for a CO when I was in Alabama for OCS training. 

The guy was 6'6" and I swear sounded exactly like Forrest Gump when he talked, and he could run like the damn wind (easily a 4 or 5 minute mile pace) and could move almost completely silently in the woods. 

So, naturally, my platoon being one of the least fucked-up, he decides we need to stay up a little longer than everyone else on the last night of Night Land Nav. 

I'm sitting watch in my hasty while my battle bud sleeps (50% security suck) and suddenly this fucking face looms out at me from between two trees next to my position. All I can see is this grinning, gleeful, shining white face attached to a neck that seemed far too long to be allowed. 
I literally froze. All my life I've been relatively quick in my self-preservation sense and, up to that point, had *never* locked up in the face (literally) of sudden danger. But this motherfucker froze me exactly where I sat. 

Turns out Captain Mangum, our wacky CO, was juiced up on coffee and 5 hour energy since it was the last night of the cycle, and had decided to fuck with the platoons to see if he could nail someone for being asleep on watch or something stupid like that. He had snuck through every position and finally came to mine, where he got down on all fours and stuck his head through the trees right in front of me. I'm no night-ops expert, but I can generally hear when someone approaches me, and the moon was out and *very* bright that night and this son of a bitch walked or crawled to within 5 feet of my fighting position *in silence* before he surprised me. 

That was my experience with one fucking whacko of an officer in the National Guard; I'd imagine there are much more sinister types of people who possess the same, and probably more advanced skill set as Cpt. Mangum, but choose to employ them in more nefarious ways. I do not doubt for a second that there is *something* or *someone* that is either very old, very skilled, or both, that preys on the unsuspecting, unaware, untrained person who happens to draw their attention in the wilds. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you're misinterpreting what the term means by trying to apply the laws of conservation of momentum and energy. In no way is the force of the bullet itself going to cause a person to be "knocked down", just as the force of the firing of the bullet would never be enough to knock the firer over either. You are right in that aspect.

However, a .40 caliber round tends to have more "stopping" or "knock-down" power in that it tends to have a lower muzzle velocity and thus does not penetrate through a target like a smaller caliber, higher velocity (i.e. 9mm) will.

Simplified, this means that the .40 caliber bullet will hit a target, fragment *within* the body of the person/animal/demon, and most likely cause traumatic enough injury to slow or halt their advance.

Smaller caliber, higher velocity rounds tend to pass straight through people/animals and not inflict nearly as much physical damage. I know this because I have seen a man take x12 5.56mm (.223) rounds to the chest, arms, and abdomen, and continue running. Every one of those rounds penetrated his body and kept right on going without so much as knocking the wind out of him.

A .40, .44 magnum, or .45 caliber round *will* drop the fleshy target you fire it at, so long as it isn't a bear or a moose or some shit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> .40 caliber has more knock down power than the 9 mil.

9mil will penetrate just about anything, but if I'm going to shoot something that's running, jumping or advancing on me, I don't want to scare it, I want to put it on the fucking *ground*. 

.45 is not for the faint of heart, but .40 ammo is right around the same price point as 9mm and equally accessible at local sporting good shops. Both calibers are reasonably well-suited to the beginner shooter and will do the job well enough, if you're in a dangerous spot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd really like to talk to some of the other various teachers who have taught in B210. But, seeing as most of them are significantly older than Mrs. Roberts was at the time, I doubt I'd get much from them. Older folks tend to repress a lot of things and are extremely good at withholding the truth out of some misguided sense of pride, protection, or fear.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been a few questions that some of you seem to need to know. Here's my guesses, which are the best I can do for now.

-I graduated in 2009 and since that year, the ELA (English Language Arts) Faculty has remained the same with zero turnover other than Mrs. Roberts. 

-When I entered RHS as a freshman in 2005, the ELA staff had been the same for at least the previous 22 years, as ALL of the teachers I encountered in my tenure there were the same ones that appeared in my older brother's yearbook from when he attended the same school.

-This leads me to the assumption that any ELA teacher who gets hired at RHS does not leave. Either from some kind of unspoken support code, or because of some contractual obligation.

-The room where Jeremy's suicide occurred is B210, the room where Mrs. Roberts taught English 2-3.

-As far as I know, nothing dangerous has occurred nor has any student or teacher been harmed in the classroom since Jeremy's death there in 1991. I guess Mrs. Roberts could see him though, and I cant imagine how horrific that must have been on a daily basis. I think I would break too. 

-There was a slight misunderstanding about the means by which I went about getting Mrs. Roberts fired. She and I never had sex. All it took was my reporting that she attempted to force herself on me in the parking lot and her admission that she had been attempting to solicit sex with me, and she was done. I know she was married, but I had never met, much less seen, her husband, and I don't really know what happened there. I have never seen her again. 

I don't know that I have much else to write about concerning this subject, so I doubt there will be a part 2. Unless you want me to hash out in detail how the process of her getting fired went. The story ends there, but if you want to know more about Jeremy, I suggest you go to the source: the ELA department at Richardson High School.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Pearl Jam song "Jeremy" is about my school. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-27 17:10:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Do you all remember that Pearl Jam song called *Jeremy*? 
It's about a real person, and a real event that happened at my high school.

Eddie Vedder wrote the anthem of misunderstood youth after reading a newspaper article about a student who shot himself in front of his classroom peers and teacher on January, 8th 1991.

I won't get too much into the backstory, but Jeremy Delle had a lot of problems. Whatever was going on in his life, it was probably really tough. 

I feel so bad that my school literally has his blood on their hands. 

Trying to get anyone on the staff to admit that, though, is another thing entirely. 
******

I had a bit of a reputation for being an explorer around the school. I was in three band or music classes every semester and always had a long lunch, leaving me plenty of time to discover the 100+ year old building that comprised Richardson High School. I probably went in a lot of doors I wasnt allowed through and searched through a lot of rooms I shouldnt have, but damn did I know almost every inch of that campus. Made for a lot of good, private make-out sessions with any of my various girlfriends during my high school tenure. 

What I never found though, was any shred of the memory of Jeremy Delle. There were no memorials, no tributes, no plaques on the walls. Not even a brick outside in the A courtyard that has his name on it, and there's a *lot* of names etched out there. I couldn't find him. 

It took me two more years of hunting, sweet-talking teachers, and curt grunts from old staff members to even get anyone to admit he'd gone to school there. 

Then one day I caught my 4th period English teacher crying after class. 

I played pranks on her to no end, but never in a malicious way, and just that day had reversed the contents of her desktop and drawers in an attempt to throw her out of her robotronic teacher routine. They never worked, the pranks, and Im certain she always knew I was the perpetrator, but I made sure I did my work well, and I actually liked her as a person. So when I saw her crying, slumped in her seat between classes, I was truly worried I had crossed a line. 

Mrs. Roberts, Im sorry I pulled that on you today. I should have been in my seat, working, not messing with your stuff while you were out of the room, I apologized. 

Its fine, Sean, she sniffed, if I couldnt handle pranks from teenagers, I probably shouldnt have chosen this career.

Yeah, I guess so. Are you alright?, I asked. 

She straightened up a little, Yes and no. This class is just overwhelming at times, and I feel like I need to escape, but then at the same time I have a duty to every student who sets foot in here.

No matter what age you are, hearing an authoritative adult admit theyre having a hard time is always tough for a kid to comprehend. Here was one of my most respectable, knowledgable teachers telling me that she might be in over her head with us students. 

Butwhy? It was just English class; nothing incredible ever happened, save for my pranks, and she always seemed more than capable of handling all of us, even at our most foolish. 
I did notice that she often left the room during the period to go check on something, but always chalked that up to her looking in on another class or checking the microwave to see if her lunch was done or something. 

I guess I stood there a little too long without speaking, internalizing this dialogue in my head, and she busted my thought bubble, asking, Is there anything else?

She stood up from her desk and began trying to wipe away a stain on the chalk board with a wet rag.

Oh, no, maam. Sorry I spaced out there. Sorry again for messing with you today. I hope you have a better day. See you tomorrow., and I headed for the door. 

Apology accepted. And please leave the door open when you go. Please., she smiled. 
*****
By the next semester, I had pretty much given up the whole Jeremy thing. I had scored this exceedingly attractive girl named Meagan as a serious girlfriend and we spent a lot of time in the hidden places Id discovered over the past two years. 

Mrs. Roberts didnt show up to class for the first week and a half, and we never had a substitute stay more than a day with us. We didnt get anything done for a solid eight days, and it was awesome; no grades, no homework, just sit there, dont get crazy, free period, basically. 

But when I heard the Thursday sub say, Your teacher will be back with you tomorrow, I kind of wilted but was honestly a glad to have Mrs. R back; something way down deep in me needed stability and consistency. 

Friday came and went and I think we did some kind of reading assignment and then had a class discussion over To Kill a Mockingbird. Mrs. R seemed okay, but looked extremely tired and her eyes were always very quickly shifting from the black board to the back of the class, where I sat, and back again. I chalked it up to her being nervous about me pulling some kind of jack-assery on her first day back and made sure I was attentive and not disruptive of her class. I felt it was the least I could do. 

At 4:10 that afternoon, I was walking to my car to go home when, out of nowhere, this blur of floral print, high heels, and too much eyeshadow came flying at me and pinned me to Trevor Hodges Jeep Cherokee. Hands groped my neck and chest and I felt hot breath *very* close to my lips. 

Just kiss me, Sean.

What the fuck? 

Up to that point I was thinking Meagan had attacked me in a frenzy of hormonal, teenage lust. Hearing Mrs. Roberts voice accompanying the volley of sensation threw the brakes on the freight train of adrenaline pumping through my veins. 

Holy shit, lady. What are you doing?, I coughed.

I have to do this. It has to be you., she sobbed.

I pried her off of me. Even at 16, I was still a good three inches taller than her, and I guess I never realized how truly feminine and fragile she was; Meagan easily had 15 pounds on her, even though I remembered my teacher being healthy-looking and full-bodied for as long as I had known her.

Mrs. Roberts, please dont touch me again, I said, still trying to calm myself down, and what do you mean it has to be me?

You wanted to know, didnt you? It was you asking all the questions, trying to pry the lock off the schools past, right? How many teachers told you to go away, or to quit asking about something you had no right to know? How many?! She was shouting at me now, her desperation bubbling over.

I cant go back in that room. I wont. Youre going to make sure I dont step foot in this school again. Ever. 

Astonished, the only thing I could get out was, What? Howwhy?

She backed up from me and looked me squarely in the eye. 

You wanted to know why we dont talk about Jeremy. Why we dont honor him with some kind of memorial or moment of silence. Her tone was deadly serious.

I mean, yeah, I gue-, I started, but she cut me off. 

Jeremy never left, and she visibly shuddered. If she didnt already have my full attention, she sure as shit had it now. 

The last thing that happened before Jeremy shot his head off in front of everyone was that an English teacher wrote him up for being late to class and sent him to the office. He left and came back with a gun. He hasnt left the classroom since then.

I could tell she wasnt fucking with me. As I studied her, I started to notice how thin her hair looked, how really very slight she had become, how her eyes werent just tired, but completely exhausted. 

Mrs. R, I dont understand. What do you mean Jeremy never left?, I asked. I already knew the answer, but I had to hear her say it.

Every time you pulled a prank on me, every time you sat in the back and messed around, I would look up to make eye contact, but it wasnt you I was looking at, she said as tears started to fall.

It was him. The grey hoodie, the blood pouring from his nose. And that stain. That *fucking* stain.

The one on the blackboard

Miss, I d-dont un-understand, I sputtered.

DONT YOU GET IT?, she screamed, *EVERY* English teacher who gets assigned that class is in Hell. For 16 years theyve told any teacher that uses that room they are *required* to accommodate any and all students, past or present, who set foot in the room.

A horrific light bulb went off in my head. 

So, I not only have to deal with *your* shit, but, she started to break down. Literally. I saw her just begin to fold where she stood, sinking down to the concrete in a mess of wet hair and scuffed heels and floral print. She sat there for a moment, recomposing herself. 

I knelt down in front of her. What do you need me to do?

She looked up and said, softly, I need you to get me fired. 

Okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Enjoyed that one too, sir. Just finished reading. 
AC4 is a great story and I guess I never really bothered to consider the events from Mobius 1's point of view. I personally never inserted myself fully into that character, as I've always been more interested in the relationship between Yellow 13 and 4. For me, the most tragic moment comes from a simple order at the end of a hectic mission: "Eject, Yellow 4". I think at that point Mobius 1 defeated 13 and it was all just a matter of time from then on. 

Great writing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> YOOOOOOO figured out some stuff about this game. 

I had no idea that all the "parts research" I was getting and all the parts I was "procuring" weren't actually being applied to my F-14A. I went into the aircraft editing screen and realized that I needed to actually *equip* the parts I have been unlocking. My Tomcat was already at level 9, and I was faring pretty well with it as an absolutely stock, unmodified fighter, but now that I've upgraded it with parts and bumped it to level 10...mannnn this thing rocks. 

I'm super new to this and figuring everything out on my own. I did *something* today (completed a challenge, I guess?) and now suddenly have 32 stocked fuel. Not sure exactly what I did, but it was a nice reward. 

I've been trying to get in rooms with only 4-6 players so I can guarantee myself points and not just be battling 7 other people the whole time for lock-on's and shit. 

I've gotten quite a few "drop" planes, like the Mickey F-14, Shin F-5, Kim AV-8B, and the Sulejmani MiG, but don't really want to stray away from my Tomcat as 1) I really enjoy using it, and, 2) I don't want to be bothered with leveling another aircraft. But that mentality could change based on your suggestions

Is there anything else I can be doing to start scoring progressively higher? I feel like I've found my identity in this game as far as what I excel at, but do I need to start doing more all-around to really get the "elite" experience? 
Also, are there any "skins" for the standard F-14A that I could possibly get hold of? I'm cool with the stock look as it is, but it would be neat to have an option there for alternate paint. 

Let me know what you think. 


Here's the setup for my F-14A
