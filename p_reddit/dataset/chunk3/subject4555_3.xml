	<TEXT> There is nothing wrong. Why is it that people can't hold an opinion just because it's not socially acceptable. If he feels like that and wants to talk about it let him. He should have just made a throwaway its his fault for being an idiot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry it took me so long I didn't realize anyone has posted. Simply because she can't do it for herself. She is completely useless in any way and has no idea about the real world.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As of now it's not clear, my medication doesn't seem to be working so after we adjust it and hope we get it right then I'll have a clearer understanding of what will end up happening.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hallucinations really range depending on how bad my anxiety or depression is at the moment. They can be anything from like little things moving around on the walls and floor to actual people. When I had made this post, I was going through a moment of increased hallucinations both auditory and visually. I saw things like a black dog in my mirror, I felt like I was being watched and knew something was in the room with me, a hanger I have with ties on it started shaking a lot. I heard doors closing, and people talking in my bathroom. I heard my name being called out a lot. Stuff like that. They can be and usually are extremely terrifying.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No. There is also no reason I would go running around shooting people... Just because I don't understand why certain things are considered wrong, doesn't mean I don't know that they are wrong. I would never harm a person for no reason, I would end up fucking up my own life for a stupid flow of anger I had for a small moment.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not belittling, perfectly normal question. I know its in my head. I don't think that would work. What you're talking about is how some people treat depression. Everyone who tries to cope with depression or suppress memories alone does it in a different way. For me in particular I was manifesting it in my head as anger and violence. Eventually building up to the point where it was comforting. Severe cases of depression could lead to other mental disorders which is what happened in my case. I took anti-depressants and they didn't work well, because by that point it was no longer just depression.  </TEXT>
