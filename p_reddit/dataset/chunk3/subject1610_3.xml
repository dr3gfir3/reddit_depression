	<TEXT> **GTAV Things to Do: Vehicular Long Jump**

Mark a starting line on the highway. Stand in front of an NPC driver. Aim gun at the driver. The driver will panic and floor it, and hit you -- and, if you're positioned right, you'll fall onto the driver's hood and be carried a good 40-50 feet before you slump off onto the pavement. 

Whoever is carried the farthest distance down the road wins. 

And you're disqualified if you aim your gun at the driver and he just exits the car and runs away, like a bitch.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There's a note in improv that goes, You followed the plot. It's not a good note to get. What it means is that rather than spending a three minute scene exploring the ideas presented and creating fun, textural details, the improvisers rushed to incident.

I've seen more examples of the opposite, in the scripts I've read: pages and pages of plot-less talk, milking the idea dry and still going, while the story gathers dust. We get it, these are our characters, now where's the story to put them to use?

It's a narrow middle ground. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My thoughts:

-- One line of prose (e.g. "Funeral of PAUL MASHABA's wife") is a very short scene for the next one to go "One week earlier". We don't even know who Paul is, yet we're supposed to be mourning his wife's death? At this point, it's just an abstract funeral. 

-- Some very expository dialogue: "Didn't you see my white shirt Lebo? The one I love wearing when going into town?" Same with "Go back to your broken bicycle", and "Since my mother died everyone just manipulates me." These characters are telling us everything single we need to know, and it's hurting the flow. These don't sound like real characters talking. 

-- I'd use some contractions to make the dialogue feel natural. "I am sorry dad" has a stilted feel. 

-- You don't have to write "astonished face" in the parenthetical. Just "astonished" will do. 

-- These characters don't feel very broken up over the death of their mother. No one is adjusting to the new life, or trying to get over their feelings -- they're just going through their daily routines, as usual. 

-- It's hard to judge the story in these pages, because the story hasn't really begun. But it does seem as though there are some unnecessary elements. I'm wondering why Lebo's mother even has to die in the first place. Why not have the family be Lebo, Bill, and Paul, and then Paul dies and Lebo is forced to fend for herself, and goes down the path you mentioned? 

The story you mentioned above shows promise, but what's written in these pages is very stilted and expository, introducing all the characters for later purposes, letting the story idle in the meantime.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Read every single word aloud. Every. Single. Word. Does it flow? Do you trip over the words? Where are the pauses? Where are the accents? Does it have rhythm? By law, any conversation about dialogue and rhythm has to link to [this scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kZg_ALxEz0).

In any scene, if you were in that specific situation yourself, what would you say? How would you phrase the idea, articulate the idea?

Which character has the power in the scene? How does he/she use it? Demonstrate it? And how can the power dynamic shift? *Every* dramatic conversation is a battle over the power of the scene -- like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFHYiOfBRng) or [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8PxG5zvgOM). In both those scenes, the two characters are trying extremely hard to steal the power from the other.

	<TEXT> Gender doesn't matter with regards to the PASS/CONSIDER/RECOMMEND verdict, in the sense that the gender of a specific character -- done well or poorly -- will not help decide a specific verdict. But a character is written **poorly** (male or female) will. 

And no, believe it or not, there wasn't an instance of a script's **sole** male character serving as a crutch. That's what I meant by underwritten female part: there's only one woman in the entire script, and she's the Standard Love Interest. I didn't find any examples of the male equivalent.

Now, does there need to be a strong female character in every movie? No, of course not. Just look at *12 Angry Men* and *Glengarry Glen Ross*. But poor characters stand out. So when there's only one woman and she's shitty, that's when the "underwritten female part" comes into play. 

And, though the infographic doesn't state this explicitly, the headings "The villains are too cartoonish" and "The protagonist is a standard issue hero" ultimately apply to male characters. "The protagonist is not as strong as need be" applies to male and female protagonists. 

There's no evil plot here, or double standard. I'm not some uber-feminist demanding strong female characters in every story. All I noticed was that male writers, generally, have trouble writing female characters. That's all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With an absence of female lead characters, the female presence in those script was generally condensed to one specific role: the Love Interest, who doesn't affect the story or the characters, and is simply a crutch for the male hero to lean on during lulls in the plot. 

Poorly-written female characters generally fall into one of three categories:

-- Crutch (something for the hero to lean on, or kill time with)

-- Corpse (lives only to be killed, often to motivate the hero)

-- Eye Candy (nice to look at)

Poorly-written males characters, on the other hand, had -- frankly -- lots more ways to fail, which are detailed in that infographic. It's just that poorly-written female characters failed in very specific ways (above), and thus deserved their own little heading.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made this (http://i.imgur.com/T22gGBO.png), which lists the stats as such. Out of 300 scripts:

-- 204 had male protagonists, 77 had female protagonists. (And 19 had ensemble heroes). 

-- 8 were "RECOMMEND", 89 were "CONSIDER", 203 were "PASS". 

Unfortunately I don't have the data for the genders of the "RECOMMEND" scripts. 

But the thing is: it doesn't matter. The gender of the protagonist has **no bearing whatsoever** on the PASS/CONSIDER/RECOMMEND verdict. Even if, say, all eight of the RECOMMEND scripts had male protagonists, that wouldn't prove anything: correlation does not equal causation. 

Frankly, you might as well look at page count to determine what makes a "RECOMMEND" script. Details like that don't matter. What matters is the strength of the story and characters. 

for reading. Now, for *production*, maybe there's a different story. But, for me as a script reader, the protagonist's gender has no significance, and no influence on the final verdict. 

The Ellen Ripley way definitely works, even if it's a little indirect. I've always thought of it this way: Why would an actress want to play your female character? What would be appealing about the character to, say, Charlize Theron?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Script reader here. I would **never** ding a script just because it has a female protagonist. If the character is strong, and if the story is strong, the gender of the protagonist doesn't matter. 

Now, are well-written female protagonists more rare than well-written male protagonists? I'd say so. Probably because the majority of writers are male, and have a harder time writing about women than about men. 

This doesn't mean that scripts with female protagonists are inherently and objectively bad; they're not. They're just harder for most writers to do well.

But I won't dismiss a script for having a female protagonist. I'll dismiss it if it's a bad script. And the criteria for "bad" has no relation to the gender of the hero.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-10-10 01:48:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> All of a sudden, in every other script I read, there is a distinct moment where the characters call attention to a detail/action/behavior and say something along the lines of:

*"This isn't the movies, kid. This is real."*

*"That's just some Hollywood fantasy; that's not how it is in real life."*

*"It's not like it is in the movies."*

Dismissing the "Hollywood" representation of an idea as inauthentic, and insisting that **this** is how it's really done -- in the middle of a cliched, Hollywood script. It's a weird irony. 

Now, if I take off my script reader hat and put on my Barbara Streisand in *The Prince of Tides* ass-masking therapist pantsuit, I'd say something as pretentious as: Some writers are disillusioned by the "phony" state of Hollywood movies and have embarked upon a quest for authenticity even in inarguably "Hollywood"ish scripts. 

Or, you know, whatever. 

*   *   *

EDIT: There's another trend that sticks in my mind. I swear I've read this at least five times in the last three months: [the Cherokee "two wolves" story](http://www.firstpeople.us/FP-Html-Legends/TwoWolves-Cherokee.html) 

One character describes to another a story told to him/her by a grandfather/parent/mentor/etc. The story goes, there are two wolves inside each of us, locked in an endless battle. 

One wolf is evil - he is anger, envy, sorrow, regret, greed, arrogance, self-pity, guilt, resentment, inferiority, lies, false pride, superiority, and ego. 

The other wolf is good - he is joy, peace, love, hope, serenity, humility, kindness, benevolence, empathy, generosity, truth, compassion, and faith.

Which wolf wins? The one that you feed. 

It's the idea that if you harbor hate, it corrupts you and it'll eventually be all you see, and the same goes for good. 

It's kind of becoming the new [Scorpion and Frog parable](http://johnaugust.com/2012/the-scorpion-and-the-frog).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll take a stab at answering your question here, away from the downvote downpour. 

 I'm writing a story that sets in a small town in Southern California which later escalates into the city of Los Angeles. So the first act sets in a small town in Southern California, and the 2nd and 3rd act sets in Los Angeles. How can I write a story that sets in Los Angeles without looking like an amateur? What kind of research should I do? Thanks.

I definitely would recommend Googling small towns in Southern California, just to know what's out there. Ojai, Cambria, and Julian come to mind. 

As for tone, it doesn't really matter if LA folks act differently than NY folks, because it's negligible difference. There are saints, sinners, angels, and assholes in every city, and in every story. You could write a script set in LA with all pricks, or a story set in LA with all kind-hearted folks, and both would be fine. *End of Watch*'s Los Angeles is very different from *500 Days of Summer*'s Los Angeles, but they both work. It's your story; you can make the city whatever you want.

As for accuracy, it honestly doesn't matter. I'm a script reader (living in LA), and if I read a script that, for example, confused Sunset Blvd and Hollywood Blvd, I wouldn't care. I'm not judging scripts based on their factual accuracy; I'm judging them based on the story they tell. So as long you don't make any major mistakes (e.g. if you made it snow in Los Angeles), I won't pay them much attention. I'd suggest just checking a map of LA, or Googling the area/building/location, to make sure whatever detail you're using is what/where you need it to be. 

If you're worried about coming across as an amateur, that will be FAR more apparent in the *story* than the *accuracy*. A script that can't tell a good story screams amateur much louder than a script that confuses its geography. 

The other commenters may have made this point a bit harshly, but there might be some merit in not setting the script in Los Angeles. If I read a drug/mob story set in LA, there is a voice in the back of my mind that says "I've seen this story before". On the other hand, if I read a drug/mob story set in -- for example -- Portland or Monterey or Lahaina or Gainesville or Salt Lake City, then it's definitely fresh and new. Just look at *Breaking Bad*'s setting in Albuquerque, or *True Detective*'s setting in backwoods Louisiana. Setting is just as important as character or story; new is always appealing -- as long as you make it *work*, of course. 

If they announced that *True Detective*'s season two was taking place in NY or LA, I wouldn't be half as excited as I am now, knowing it'll actually take place on the California Coast. A cool setting means a lot.

(Note: If you do want a rough primer course in Los Angeles, play Grand Theft Auto V. That city lines up pretty closely to Los Angeles, in terms of geography and, surprisingly, tone)

EDIT: And it doesn't matter if there's not a well-known drug scene/mob racket in Portland -- invent one. There doesn't have to be a preexisting meth empire in Albuquerque for *Breaking Bad* to work.

So in a movie marketplace that relies so heavily on international appeal, the western kind of fell by the wayside, because westerns don't play so well in countries that don't have that specific connection to the Wild West. 

Comedy, romance, action, horror: these are all universal genres and can be translated across cultures. But the western is purely American, and that led to its demise.  </TEXT>
