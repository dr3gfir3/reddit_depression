	<TITLE> I tried to kill myself Wednesday. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-14 18:01:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Remorse] I took something like 30 tablets of tromadol and promethazine before I went to bed because I didn't want to be a burden on my parents or anyone anymore. My stomach started hurting and my breathing got slow and little but I was worried that if it didn't kill me I'd get brain damage so I focused on taking deep breaths until I fell asleep. I hoped it was gonna kill me then or at least give me a seizure to punish me for it but it didn't.


I woke up feeling very weird. I had a hard time walking and I had to focus really hard to think and breathe. I managed to take a shower but realized I couldn't go to school like that so I told my dad what I did and be flipped out. I don't remember much that day. He said I didn't have to go to school (I couldn't exactly function) and after yelling some more about how I could do this just because of ap spanish (he thought it was because of that but i tried to explain it was because i didn't want to be a burden, but it was hard to talk and think). He helped me get upstairs and drink more water and go to bed. I couldn't think and I was dreaming while I was awake sometimes. My tongue and jaw muscles kept doing this weird twitchy thing and I giggled at it. I tried to go to school the day after but I eventually realized I couldnt think well. My hands and body were jittery and I couldnt remember where my 4th period was. I got something like a 30 on a test and then just went to the nurse and said I threw up, so she let dad pick me up.


We didn't tell mom anything. It would kill her if she found out. She'd be so worried.


I still want to die today. I feel so stupid for still wanting to. He said killing myself would punish him and mom, that it was impossibly cruel and selfish and how could I do that?

I went to a hospital last year for it. I had to make my parents spend lots of money on that and courses I had to retake. Thousands of dollars. He had to drive 5 hours there and back to take me there and pick me up. It was horrible. I changed meds and that helped and I felt good in the summer, but now I'm here writing this. I went to a therapist for a while too and I stopped because I thought I was better.

It's been two years of feeling like this and I'm sorry. I'm just sorry. I need to get myself together. I don't want to be a burden to my dad but it feels like I am like this. </TEXT>

Then, when you wake up, try to think rationally and focus on moving your limbs and remembering shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in Alpharetta, GA. The people at school that are okay with lgbt people don't really say anything/care, and the people that aren't okay with it tend to be a bit rude. Usually not mean stuff, more stuff like "Idgaf about gays, I just dont want them to get married." And "God, I hate San Francisco. Filled with gays, it makes me uncomfortable."


So basically, not super tolerant but not mean either.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of weed-themed clothing/phone cases are basically just a giant pic of the leaf or some cartoon animal with red eyes holding a blunt. Don't get me wrong, some of it's dope and has cool art, but it's not exactly subtle and it can get pretty tacky. Could anyone link me to some examples of shirts or cases that have subtle references to trees? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh shit, I think I got one for free at some library sale when I super little - I don't think I could even read in English at the time, or speak much of it either, but I thought it looked cool even if the sound didn't work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah sorry, I just mentioned it in trying to be funny and reference the character of Sniper in Team Fortress 2 because that's one of his main lines. Your dad seems like an interesting man. 


My dad kinda said similar stuff, too. When I was very little, he stare out the window sometimes and say in English, "And now, it is time for me to die..." with his arms outstretched. Or he'd look out the window at random times and say, "Ah, Cecile, aidez moi." (cecile was the name of his mother and he was asking her for help). After a few minutes, he'd go back to work. I never understood it. </TEXT>
