	<TEXT> 8 years Hulu launched for public access in the United States on March 12, 2008. It was in private Beta testing in October of 2007.

9 years ago Netflix launched streaming videos in January of 2007. The selection was small but it existed.

10 years ago Amazon debuted Unbox on September 7, 2006. 
On September 4, 2008, the service was renamed Amazon Video on Demand. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If it's an apartment complex you could very well have terrible WiFi signal.

If you don't have small children or pets you could always run Cat5e throughout the apartment and just have it on the floor. Might be able to tuck it between the walls and the carpet, under rugs, etc... Might not be super pretty but it could work.
Not sure how much power line adapters cost but a box of Cat5e is pretty inexpensive. </TEXT>

I know if you have Comcast and use the default modem/router they allow any other Comcast customer's to login with their own Comcast login IDs and get online.

	<TITLE> [TOMT][MOVIE] Asian film from late 90's early 00's </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-12 11:16:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think the main character was a cop who was undercover.

  
I remember the main character being a little stocky.


The one scene I remember was during the rain with a parked car. You could see the rain hit the windshield in slow motion. Possibly a kid was in the car? Some sort of outside sidewalk steps were in the background? Maybe there was a fight involving an umbrella? 
The scene had some sort of song playing while it happened. Fit very well in the scene.


Another scene later involved a fight at a warehouse. Possibly the last scene of the movie?


I think the English name of the movie was 2 words long.


Had it on an English dubbed VCD.


I'm not sure exactly when the movie was made. Late 90's early 2000's. But I think the absolute latest it could have been would have been 2004.  

Actor's NOT in the movie:


Jet Li

Jackie Chan

Sammo Hung

Takeshi Kitano


Worst description ever. Sorry. Thanks for any help!


Edit:

I don't remember guns being used. Maybe a baseball bat?

I think the movie was kind of humorous. Not Stephen Chow funny. But way less serious than Infernal Affairs.

Full Asian cast. Not a Hollywood movie. 

I really want to say Chow Yun-fat is not in it. But when I browsed his Wikipedia page he was wearing a baseball hat. Which reminded me that the lead may have wore one and might have slightly looked like Chow Yun-fat. Reviewing his filmography nothing jumps out at me. And the time table of when the movie was probably made he was to big of a star to be in this.

MOAR EDITS:

I think the lead wore **overalls** in one scene? Maybe the final one in a warehouse? And had a baseball bat, hat and a silly grin?

I think the lead may have wore **overalls** the entire film?

Not a sports movie!

Is there a chubby/stocky actor that resembles Chow Yun-fat?

I wouldn't be surprised if this movie did not have an English Wikipedia page. Why? I've spent hours reviewing Asian actors/directors Wikipedia filmography pages and can't seem to find it. And it was far from a blockbuster budget film. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was looking for WiFi Tether for Root Users by Mller, Lemons, Buxton. I used to use it all the time. Was amazing! I can't seem to find out what happened to it.

You used to be able to find it on the Play Store here:
https://web.archive.org/web/20120623083901/https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.googlecode.android.wifi.tether

The project home was:
https://code.google.com/p/android-wifi-tether/

before Google shut down code.google.com

Anyone one know what happened to it? </TEXT>
