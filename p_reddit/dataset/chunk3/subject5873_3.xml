	<TEXT> My name is Aaron and I work for a call center. It is a ridiculously boring job but it pays the bills and I know what I am getting into each day, you know? Very scheduled, very compartmental, very accommodating of my OCD tendencies. The company that I take calls for is pretty famous for their bad infomercials and sketchy product but yet we get hundreds of calls a day wanting to schedule a free consultation. 

Those are the calls I usually get. Take their information, fill a spot on the calendar, next call. The reason I am posting here today is because a few nights ago I received a call Id never taken before and pray I never take again. At first I thought maybe it was a prank (we get those a lot, too) but pretty soon I realized this man was serious and I freaked out. Below is the transcription of that call.

03/02/2017 - 7:14PM

*Operator* - Good evening, thank you for choosing [REMOVED]. You are speaking with Aaron, are you ready to change your life?

*Caller* - Please help me!

*Operator* - I like your enthusiasm, sir. May I have your first and last name, please?

*Caller* - [REMOVED]

*Operator* - Great, thank you so much for calling us [REMOVED]. I have a few simple questions I must ask in order to speed up the consultation process. The entire process will only take a few moments. Would that be ok?

*Caller* - You dont understand, I already have your product. I need HELP! 

*Operator* - I am afraid I dont understand [REMOVED], why are you calling the consultation line if you already have our product?

*Caller* - This was the only number I could find. Look, I really need help. I doubted you, the product, whatever. I cant get it to stop!

*Operator* - Sir, get what to stop?

*Caller* - My hair! It keeps growing! 

*Operator* - I am sorry [REMOVED] but isnt that what our product is designed for? I am failing to see the issue. Are you afraid to get it cut at a barber shop? I can assure you, sir, that no one will know you used our product.

*Caller* - LOOK! IT IS GROWING SO FAST I CAN LITERALLY WATCH IT GROW! I NEED HELP! WHAT THE HELL DO I DO?

*Operator* - Sir, please try to remain calm. I am going to put you on a brief hold while I contact my manager.

-Hold music-

[I called my manager over and explained the call, telling her that I thought it was a prank call at first but the terror in the guys voice sounded so real. She patched into the call and took over. I just sat there in stunned silence while I listened to the exchange.]

*Operator* - Good evening, this is Julia, the telecomm manager. Would you please explain the situation very calmly, sir?

*Caller* - OH MY GOD.. OK ok ok umm. So a few weeks ago I called and had a consultation. The product came and I was excited to try it out because I had a blind date in a few days. I admit I had my hesitations about the legitimacy of your claim so I applied a little more product than the directions stated and no..

*Operator* - I am sorry to cut you off sir but did you say that you did not follow the instructions in the packaging?

*Caller* - Oh God is it going to stop? Uh, yea that I didnt really read them carefully. Shit. loud buzzing- I just scooped out a bunch and rubbed it in and took a few vitamins.

*Operator* - Sir, put the clippers down and listen to me carefully. Think hard now. How much of the product did you apply to your scalp? How much of the jar is left?

*Caller* - There is none left. I used about half last night and the rest of it this morning. grunts and the sounds of a struggle come across the line-

*Operator* - I have one last question. Did you use any of the specially formulated shampoo and conditioner?

*Caller* - Uh yea I did this morning when I took a shower.

*Operator* - Ok I need you to listen closely. DO NOT use any more product. Pills, shampoo, condition, nothing. Understand me?

*Caller* - Yea ok.

*Operator* - Good. DO NOT under any circumstances cut your hair, trim your hair, run a comb or brush through your hair. Not even your fingers. All of these activities promote hair growth and that is the last thing we want right now. Am I making myself clear?

*Caller* - Yes but you are really scaring me. What is going on? 

*Operator* - One last thing, sir. DO NOT fall asleep. Once your hair stops growing you will need to wait two full days and then you will be able to cut it like normal. We will check on your in the morning for the next three days for updates.

*Caller* - Uh yea ok, uh bye.

---------------------------

Because I was the one to take the call I had to check up on him each morning. The first morning he answered and thanked me for checking in. He sounded incredibly tired and scared. So far it hadnt stopped growing. The next morning he didnt answer so I tried back two more times, at thirty minute intervals. 

After the third call going to voicemail I called the police to head over and check on him. They found him on his sofa where he had fallen asleep. His hair had grown so long and thick that it had suffocated him. They found over ten feet of hair in his airways. 

Because of this incident we now sell our product in daily capsules and have warning labels on every part of our packaging. We also have a special protocol designed for calls such as these. I beg you, regardless of the product, no matter how harmless or innocuous it may seem, always follow directions.  </TEXT>

I get those silly comments as well and I try hard to ignore them. It doesn't always work but when it didn't I go and read all of the positive comments and messages that keep me writing. 

You are great, you are special and brave for putting your work out there. Keep it up and prove them wrong with a best selling book! 

Oh and congrats on the upcoming wedding. We just celebrated 6 years and my daughter turns one in a few days. It is such a great experience and I know you'll enjoy it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me first start out by saying I really enjoyed reading that. It caught my attention and kept it. Good job.

As far as not being creepy enough, sometimes you need to start in the middle. What I mean is write out the entire story and figure out where it is going. Is the overall story creepy? If so, try to find a way to write it in such a way that your first submission holds the creepy aspect and then you can fill in later as updates. 

I have had a few ideas I thought would be great stories but just didn't have a good creep to them until a few parts in. Figure out how to make that part the first one. </TEXT>

**All members** - Understood.

**Team Lead** - Two of you, on me. We enter through the front, left to the kitchen and down to the basement. Lets go.

Splintering wood can be heard on the comm. Grunts and then heavy footsteps for 78 seconds.

**Team Lead** - PUT DOWN THE SAW NOW, ON YOUR KNEES! 

**Mans voice** - No need for yelling, officer. I am putting down the saw and placing my hands behind my head while moving to my knees. 

**Team Lead** - Check to see if she is still alive. Sweep the home, check for anyone else. All units hold exits.

**All members** - Yes sir!

**Team Lead** - Do not move. I am putting cuffs on your hands. If you so much as twitch I will use force to subdue you. Do you understand?

**Mans Voice** - No need for force. Ill come willing. I wish you would have waited another week so I could have finished my work.

The soft clink of the handcuffs can be heard on the comm.

Breakfast delivered.

**Dr.** - Good morning. I hope breakfast is adequate for your tastes.

**98** - Oh yes, fine. The egg was a little undercooked.

**Dr.** - My apologies. You may be asking what you are doing here instead of in a prison cell. Let me assure you, your work will be completed. It might not be in the exactly the same way, but it will be completed.

**98** - I must admit I was a little perplexed when I was thrown into the back of a van instead of a police cruiser and then put on a train of some sort. Would it be a fair assessment to make that those were not police officers last night?

**Dr.** - Your genius has not failed you, 98. You are indeed correct. The men who brought you here are my own creation and you are here instead of rotting in a cell for the next eighty years because of your gifts.

**98** - A fan of my work, yes? Splendid. May I ask why you call me 98?

**Dr.** - You will be unhindered in your research here. Anything you need we will provide you with so long as you cooperate with my questions and tests. You are very unique, 98. Your ability to sense others pain, know exactly what is causing it, if it is life threatening. Truly remarkable. I would like to understand how you do these things and the full extent of your abilities. To answer your question, you are the ninety eighth patient to be tested here in my facility. A great amount of research and scientific breakthroughs have happened in the very room you occupy now. I do hope we can learn more together.

**98** - I see. I will be a lab rat performing on lesser lab rats.

**Dr.** - You have a personal log that you can access simply by saying Patient 98 log. Make a list of everything you need to perform your experiments and we shall bring them to you.

Patient 98 Observation Log

Patient 98 is the first to seem somewhat happy here. It is a nice change of pace from the yelling and screaming and sobbing. His abilities are incredible to say the least. He certainly chose the right profession as a surgeon. Each day we have brought in a new terminal subject with varying issues from cancer to aneurisms and internal bleeding from car crashes. We have also brought in several with a simple head cold or other minor ailment.

So far Patient 98 has correctly identified each situation as life threatening or non-life threatening by simply looking at the subject. He then describes in detail the cause or lack thereof and what needs to be done in order to save the subjects life. At first I believed it to be Patient 98 reading the mind of the subject in order to ascertain the information but soon ruled that out by secretly administering terminal diseases into subjects and bringing them to Patient 98 for analysis. 

What I now believe to be happening is Patient 98 *sensing* the pain to such a degree that he can pinpoint the location and cause of that pain, even if there is no pain felt by the subject. If true it will revolutionize the way we look at pain in the future. For example subject 21 was given an active strain of HIV. When subject 21 was introduced to Observation Room 1 with Patient 98 he grimaced and told her he was sorry and he would do everything he could for her. He then proceeded to hook her up to a clone for a full blood transfusion. We are still waiting on the prognosis of that test. 

He also senses and even removes fear like some animals do. Even with horrible news like contracting HIV or stage four pancreatic cancer the subjects never show much sign of worry or fear. His bed side manner overwhelms them with confidence and hope in an almost mystical way. 

Patient 98 has stated that he sees how things are connected like pain and fear and likely other emotions from brain to body. I believe this is separate from his other senses in that it is an overarching feeling of how all of his abilities work together. This is not altogether unlike reading peoples mind but instead reading the neurological pathways as they travel in the body and connect emotions to physical.

Lastly, he can not only sense these things but in some ways manipulate or control them. In most cases the subject will not need anesthesia stating they feel no pain or discomfort. Much more testing needs to be done but at this moment Patient 98 appears to have nine senses.

* Sight

* Hearing

* Touch

* Taste

* Smell

* Fear 

* Pain

* Death

* Neuroception


I am very much looking forward to flushing out these senses to their fullest. There are many applications for them if we can find a way to harness and utilize them. Imagine being able to just shut down pain, shut down fear. The Faceless will be much more useless with such [talents added](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5y1fk7/patient_314_has_a_name/)

I have asked each one of them for tips and critiques and some have blessed me with very helpful ideas. I would be very open and welcome to having an area for comments specific to constructive criticism. Not only would it help eliminate the random comments about spelling errors and grammar Nazis mixed in to the legitimate comments concerning the story itself but if used properly could really help each story become more and more polished.

I have had many comments posted to my stories that I am assuming are auto-removed due to something that was said. That makes me sad. I WANTED to see what they had to say and now I'll never know.  </TEXT>

For some reason I feel like I have a resistance or immunity to the ill effects of the stairs that others don't have which is why it always ends in tragedy.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Builders - Part 2 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 17:11:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I need to apologize in advance to you right now; this will probably be long and rambling but I need to get my thoughts out on paper so to speak. It has almost been a month since my first post about my family and the strange staircase I encountered as a boy. Since that first post I have been dealing with taking over the estate of my family. Go [here]( https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5rooj1/the_builders/) if you want a refresher on what I am talking about. Anyway I wanted to do some digging around and try to make sense of those stairs in the mansion now that I have read all of the Forest Service stories. 

I arrived at the airport and a driver was there to take me back home to the place I never wanted to visit again. We passed through the town and it was completely deserted. I seriously looked like an old Western movie. Doors hanging on by a hinge, dust coating every building, vines growing up almost every corner, windows broken and trash littering the streets. As the car approached the old draw bridge that separated the town from our estate a wave of emotion came crashing through me. An old memory popped into my head with each bumpy timber we passed over. Suddenly the trees broke and that massive old construct loomed above our heads. In stark contrast to the town my childhood home was still in pristine condition. The land was well cared for and the structure didnt seem to be any different from when I vowed to never return. 

Once we finished the ascent up the long drive the driver put the car in park and helped me with my bags to the front door. No sooner had I rung the bell than I heard the car peeling out and flying down the drive like a bat out of hell. I am not sure why I rung the bell or why I waited on the stoop. The estate was mine now, after all, but waited I did. A few minutes went by before I decided to check the door  it was unlocked. 

With my bags inside I closed the door and shouted out for anyone home. No response. A few feet ahead of me was a round foyer table and on it was a few sheets of paper and an ornate fountain pen. After an once-over I signed the papers and was officially the proud, or incredibly unproud, owner of the family estate. I left my bags there and wandered around seeking any sign of habitation other than the fact that everything was spotless. Not a single cobweb. After checking all of the main floor I went up to the parlor and bedrooms but still not a living soul. 

I started to get a little more panicked not because I was alone in the house but I started to question why I was alone in the house. I had a huge family. Dozens of cousins and over ten siblings in just my immediate family. How could they all have just disappeared? They all seemed so happy and content to live out their days here. And what happened to the town? Sure it wasnt big or anything but it was still rather lively. Even if my family decided to all leave or die or whatever the town should still live on, right? 

Mentally resigned to the fact that I was alone, I wandered back to get my bags and set up in the master suite when I heard a door open and close. Rushing out to the foyer staircase I caught a glimpse of someone running in the opposite direction on the main floor. By the time I made it down the fifty something curving stairs the person was gone and I could no longer hear the pattering of footsteps. Off I went after the shadow but after another hour of searching I came up empty. I warily made it back to the foyer for my bags and unpacked everything. Maybe it was a servant or groundskeeper or a cousin playing a trick on me. My stomach was growling but I couldnt order any food since the town was deserted so I made my way to the larder to see if anything was still edible.

To my complete surprise the larder was fully stocked with all new food like someone had gone to the store today. The fridge and freezer were full of meats and cheeses and vegetables and local milk. Seriously, what the hell was going on? Someone had to be taking care of this place! I was becoming agitated and more pissed off than afraid at this point. Unfortunately when I am upset I binge eat so I sat there and ate a bunch of crap for an hour or so. I didnt even realize it until my stomach started to protest at the sheer quantity of food I had shoveled into my mouth and the unsavory mixture now churning around inside. 

I decided to walk off the calories by exploring the rest of the house and see if I could find any clues as to who the hell was here and who takes care of the place. Two hours later and every room searched I gave up. It was a pretty nice day so I went outside to search the grounds. When I made my way to the back of the mansion I spotted a building a little ways off and remembered we had a separate house for the staff. Of course my luck didnt turn around because no one answered the knocks on the door and after I let myself in I could find no evidence of anyone being there lately other than it being spotless just like the house. 

Back inside I made my way through some of the rooms I had just searched. There was an armory with all sorts of antique rifles and pistols as well as some newer models. I grabbed a few I felt comfortable with and placed them in strategic areas like the kitchen, formal living room, library, and master bedroom. It might have been around that time when it dawned on me that I had not seen the stone stairs I had come out here for in the first place. With a pistol tucked into the back of my slacks I sought out once again for the elusive stairs. 

I am still not sure if I just missed them the first time or if you must be looking for them specifically in order to find them. Like in your mind picturing them and then they are available or something. Either way I found them after about forty minutes of trying to retrace my steps from the memory I had as a boy. There they were. The same as I remembered them in the same side hallway. A massive door at the top that I know Ive never been through. After my first experience with the stairs I was nervous to climb them again but I knew I had to if I wanted to understand what was going on with my family. I dont think I consciously took the first step but rather was pulled up them.

Before I knew it my hand was on the thumb-press of the handle and the door was swinging easily inward. My eyes were glued shut, probably a reflex out of fear. Kind of like when someone is about to make a loud noise and you flinch even though you know it is coming. When I finally pried my eyes open a beautiful, ornate study was before me. I stepped across the threshold and over to the center of the room where a massive desk sat. It was covered in papers and old tomes. Each tome was covered in different colored leather gilt with gold lettering. I started to shuffle through the papers looking for anything about my family but every sheet of paper or parchment or scroll just had extensive plans of staircases. How to build them, dimensions, types of materials, et cetera. There were hundreds of these plans laid out across the desk and nothing else. 

After a few moments I began search the drawers for any clues about my family and found a plain leather tome with our family name on it in a deep red. I sat in the overstuffed chair and began to read. I have no idea how long I sat there reading but eventually my neck and shoulders forced me up and out to walk around. I used that time to explore the rest of the study. I wont bore you with all of the details of what I found in that room because it would take me a lifetime to do so.

The reason it has taken me this long to post an update is because I was in that room for almost a month. Although it only seemed like a few hours, my stomach never rumbled, I never needed to pee, but almost a month transpired. How that is possible is still unclear but one thing is certain. My family is responsible for the staircases people find in the national parks and other places around the world. They are known as the Builders and Caretakers of the Steppes. Each set holds a different power and a different purpose. 

DO NOT APPROACH THEM. DO NOT STEP FOOT ON THEM.

I still have a lot more research to do in an attempt to undo the evil that my family has placed on this world. You may not hear from me for a long time, you may not hear from me ever again. Please do not let this warning go to waste. </TEXT>

I cant do anything with these stupid things! Be gentle, dont push it, we only have one. Stupid obtuse close-minded ninnies! How do you push the bounds of science without taking risks? Just give me one day with them unhindered and Ill know all I need about their race, culture, hierarchy, whatever! Hmm what if it wasnt the only one? What if I made more? Where did that wine bottle go? [low mumblings]

What an excellent way to start the year off! Patient Zero and I have been working tirelessly since my revelatory thought to perfect his ability to absorb cognitive information only and not the physical information. Of course that was quite easy for us and we moved on to searching for specific bits of information to absorb instead of all of it which leaves the victim essentially useless. While still not perfect in administration we have come to a fairly efficient method of pulling small parts of information out of entities without turning them into empty shells. 

Our breakthrough came when I could translate that ability onto the system and do it myself. No need to put Zero in harms way unnecessarily, right? Longevity of Patient Zero aside, the real beauty of the process is that I can copy the information and then stick it back into the entity so that they lose nothing. What truly makes this a breakthrough is now our system can replicate physical life forms! By taking the physical information that makes up Patient 2 and 3 we can then imprint that information into a living host.

So far the host has not taken kindly to the new information and dies out before more than one or two changes can take place. I have high hope that we will find someone or something that has a higher resiliency to the changes but if necessary we will need to create a host of our own.

There are only so many lost hikers to choose from before you need to give up and move on to something else. Patients 2-10 all failed miserably at retaining the physical information  Patient 4 was quite glorious in his explosion. The research team has been working with Macrocystis pyrifera to see if we can either steal the growth rate from it and apply it to a basic bacteria or imprint the information onto Macrocystis pyrifera in such a way that it maintains its growth rate while taking on all the other aspects we want it to have.

We were going about this all wrong from the beginning! The whole point of this is to replicate any being many times over. If I take a human and a mosquito and a sheep and I give them the same information I should get the exact same end result from each so how can I do that? Symbiotic parasite! If you design the parasite as simply the mode of transportation and carrier of information to the host you can then implant whatever information you want into that parasite and it does the changing for you. Again, timeframe is a factor here so we will need to improve that but initial testing has been successful when the host has been less complex than the information it has been given.

Experiment C final observations  logging

With our first successful clone walking around the building I believe we can put the wraps on Experiment C. Continued improvements will certainly be made and we shall observe my clone very closely for the next year for any signs of degradation or failure. It is quite enjoyable to watch a faceless human walking around sneaking up behind new staff. From this point on all mentions of Experiment C will be referred to as Patient 11. 

* Patient 11 must be administered to a living host.

* Patient 11 needs similar biomass to be effective. Too little biomass results in double or triple the incubation time.

* Patient 11 incubation time ranges from three (3) days to nine (9) days depending on biomass.

* Patient 11 can only be accessed by S-class personnel.

Patient 11 experiment observations  logging

Improvements made since the last update:

* Patient 11 incubation time ranges from thirty six (36) hours to ninety six (96) hours.

* Patient 11 has successfully cloned Patient Zero, 1, 2, and 3 as well as dozens more of itself.

* Patient 11 has not yet shown any failures or regressions.

* Patient 11 is exceptional at performing mundane, dangerous, or obscure tasks. 

* Patient 11 now has a new form  that of Staff Sargent John Dansk.

John was the fortunate, or unfortunate depending on your reference point, winner of the strength and fitness competition we held. Instead of keeping all of these fine young soldiers here at the facility we decided to make a staff of clones that we could easily manipulate and control. In winning the competition it was clear he had the best physique and form and therefore was chosen to be the face of Patient 11. My dark humor is getting the best of me. Staff have begun calling Patient 11 as Faceless and it does seem to be catching on quickly. 

The troops stationed here have been reassigned to new bases and a clone of SS John Dansk promoted to Captain. He will be some of my eyes and ears outside of the facility for new Patients.

Dr. Feldman Personal Log

Our clone in Russia has paid off nicely thus far. It seems as though they are trying to determine the human potential as well but in a vastly different way. Steroids, pft. They must think getting into space was more important than getting into the human brain. Obviously space travel is important but knowing everything about our race, planet, et cetera should be higher on the-to do list than traipsing out into the great void. We know of two alien races already and if we ever ran into them on a larger scale they would wipe us out, easy peasy. Just two hundred of Patient 2 would probably be enough if they landed without our knowledge. Who knows, we may have more Patient 3 in our oceans right now and they are watching and waiting. The ocean is enough mystery for me. Lets focus on that, huh Russia?

	<TEXT> My practical nature is going to rear its ugly head here but couldn't you just have night lights in every room instead of blasting overhead lights all the time? We have some nice ones that don't give off heat now that we have a little one running around and they put out a decent amount of light. 

With that being said, I truly hope the best for you, OP. Should the power go out you better be ready with candles and flashlights. I am positive you can make it through this! </TEXT>
