	<TEXT> Something that is easy to do doesn't mean it has no skill, Doing something simple in the perfect way is better than doing something complicated and bad... I chose post the picture because i was proud with the outcome, In my opinion the ribs were not overcooked, when slow cooked that's just the way i like them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Were did i mention liquid smoke ? I never used liquid smoke, I used Smoky bbq sauce.  If you don't like slow cookers i respect your opinion, But it definitely is a good way of cooking and making things as tender as you'd like :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the way i like my ribs, tender as can be. Plus in a slow cooker cooking them to this point lets even more of the sauce to be absorbed into the meat. And yes the beefy goodness was still there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the best ways is in a slow cooker, Best way to cook ribs is in a smoker low and slow. Ribs should always be cooked low and slow.

That's my opinion of course :) </TEXT>
