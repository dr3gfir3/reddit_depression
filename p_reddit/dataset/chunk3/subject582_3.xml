	<TEXT> For my first trip, I took an 8th of some shrooms that I was specifically told were not the best. Not that they were laced, but just old or bad quality, something like that. I had a great trip and think I took just about enough to have a good trip. Any more and I knew I would have done too much. Your stuff must have been good, you just took too much. I don't think it has much to do with you, per say. Props to your connection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> At first it didn't do much, which is why the meds take so long to work. After a few weeks of regularity with them, I would generally feel more focused, energized, and motivated. I don't know how to describe it. Over time, I just got... happy. When the meds don't regulate out you're going to be getting headaches and random side effects (it changes from person to person but it's best to push through them.) After the side effects stop is when the meds are working properly. Now, I never get bad headaches if I take mine every day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That doesn't sound like something that would be bad to say back. I mean, he needs to hear it, the basics of what to do, because his mind is shutting everything down and everything that seems to make sense, doesn't. Also, go to your counseling center at school and ask a counselor how to communicate with him, obviously saying you're worried about him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was that sad roommate last semester, my first semester away at university. I was diagnosed with mdd just like your roommate.
He needs to be in a better environment, asap. It's the only thing that helped me. No matter who is trying to reach out to you, his brain is saying that everyone in that environment is one-sided, can't help, won't understand. Nothing against you, I'll assume. He just doesn't want to open up about what kind of awful things go on in his head. 

Tell him that he needs to give himself a break from school and open up about how he feels and give medication a chance. Tell him things that make him feel better, like a joke or something funny that happened during the day, little talk. It helps suit the mood a bit better, none of that "are you okay? what's wrong?" nonsense. There's no way to put what's going on with him into words, to be honest.

I made it out all right, i hope your friend does too.

	<TEXT> Tell her times will change and she won't have to be like that forever. 
Tell her not to be scared to try to fight back, to try to live normally. 
Tell her to get up out of bed everyday and that the sun comes out every day, and that you think of her every day. 
Tell her that life is not out to get her and that she is stronger than her brain is telling her.
Tell her that medication can help as long as she doesn't miss doses.
Tell her not to isolate herself and to TALK to people where she is for support. It's vital for her therapy.
Tell her she's going to be okay.

These are some things I think I would have liked to hear when I was away at college during a bad depressive episode.

-edit- and tell her to exercise. It helps with energy and seratonin levels. It will boost her up a little. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Depression is now the largest cause of disability in Europe. There are many effective treatments but only about a third of individuals respond fully. At least 10% fail to respond to three different treatments. We badly need more types of treatment but we cannot pursue these because the government is denying scientists access to powerful tools that could help people in need."

Depression is real, people. </TEXT>

I do know he went for free, and one crazy moment was when his car broke down a few minutes after leaving from his home on his way there, to which he solved by going home and riding his motorcycle to woodstock, a state away. </TEXT>
