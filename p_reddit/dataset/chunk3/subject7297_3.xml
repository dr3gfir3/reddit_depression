While I should have managed my time better, yet, I do not think I can complete the workload for this semester.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My federal loans reached a limit due to my pursuit of teaching credential not gaining a loan increase [$55k max].

The semester is about half way through and I can't pay for food or rent: my support system is just my girlfriend who is just a loan fed student. 

While my rent in Los Angeles County is $325, I still can't make ends meet. 

I've called a couple of banks [discover] and they said while they do have a loan relationship with my university, only do loans for bachelor's or Master's, doctorates. Not for teaching credentials. 

My score is estimate to be 550. I don't have parents and the only people who might cosign for me have bad credit or are out of state. 

I have a bachelor's degree and associate's degree. 

I need $7k this semester and $5k next fall. I'm taking spring 2017 off of school to do tests so I can student teach in fall 2017.

I began the credential program in English then I wanted to seek out history too [because I could get a highly qualified competent credential as my undergrad was closer to history than English]. So this current semester is all history classes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boy oh boy. So I'm in this class, "history for secondary school teachers". We have to know all the world history then relate it to the readings (which in this semester I'm taking 2 world history courses - so I'm technically still learning all of this or most of it). We barely go over any world history in class. Just new historiographies. So that would be new theories about how history should be looked at (taking the pov away from eurocentrism and western exceptionalism) . 

The first exam is sufficiently knowing 20-25 topics and only writing on 5. And knowing all of Asian geography and significance. Then a 3-4 page take home essay [51 hours to complete]. 

3 tests like this, and one of those is a cumulative final.

So yeah, teachers who do subject matter competency are significantly different from CSET teachers. Not putting anyone down, I'm just stating a fact. 

Most of the people I know working in the credential program are doing the CSET in English as I will too. But I was told I was only 6 classes away from competency in History/social studies. So I decided to do them in tandem. One of the scariest decisions I ever made. 

If you did SMC how was your journey? 

TL: DR - history 401 is scary and teachers who are doing subject matter competency, godspeed. </TEXT>

Through CSULB, I should have a subscription for:

* Office 365 ProPlus for Students
* Office Online for Education
* Microsoft Forms (Plan 2)
* Sway
* The latest desktop version of Office

https://portal.office.com/account/#subscriptions

"Install status

Detected installs: 2

You can install Office on up to 5 PCs or Macs, 5 tablets, and 5 smartphones." https://portal.office.com/account/#home

Every time I start Word I get the activation wizard, I push next and it asks me to activate online but I get the error "We couldn't contact the server. Please try again in a few minutes. (0x80072EFD)"

My current installed version is Office Pro Plus 2013 64 bit (It gave me a 30 day trial period). https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-office-professional-plus-2013

Before this I only got 9 days or something when this version wouldn't activate; https://portal.office.com/OLS/MySoftware.aspx (I tried Install Office 365 ProPlus with the new 2016 apps 64 bit). I reached this 2nd link from my email log in above the current activated installations of Office in picture 1.

My PC is running Windows 8.1 Pro x64 based CPU. Intel i3 Clarkdale. 8gb of ram. In system my Windows shows as activated. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was a red hardcover Frankenstein book I had as a kid. I'm trying to find a copy of it. I think it had a dust jacket but I can't remember what would have been on it. 

It was a hardcover, the size of those time life occult books, somewhere about 11x14 inches. Wasn't too thick either. But it had a lot of pictures, Just about every page. 

I got it from pic n save store [now Big Lots] in the mid to late 1990s. It already seemed outdated. 

It talked a lot about films featuring Frankenstein and parodies, not so much about the Shelley book. 

It had nudity from a hammer horror film and mentioned Frankenhooker. 

And a picture that scared me as a child. The monster from hell, hammer horror. 

And a film from a European country that likened Frankenstein to the Golem in Jewish mythology. 

Anyone had it too or has a copy now?  </TEXT>

As Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983) was released in May of 1983, Jean's comment regarding poor third films predates most famously weak third films which would later establish the trend.

	<TITLE> Can't watch BRD Hunger Games 3/4 region B (AACS) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-15 10:16:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "To play this BD, you must renew the encryption key. Perform a system software update to renew the encryption key."

I'm not looking to do anything like circumventing copyright, I just want to view the blu-rays that I paid for. I changed the BRD region from A to B in multiman and I can't get the film to play in another app - all they do is explore disc contents.

I did some research that I need to change the AacsModule.spu.isoself to a newer one. I wasn't able to decrypt 4.78's AACS file with scetool 27, so the tutorial on wololo is not helping me.

I do not really understand the cfw but, is there a way to install a newer CEX and keep my ps3 modded?

I can get more information about my cfw ps3 tomorrow. I have little understanding about the hack due to me not having done it, I got it done to my ps3 by a guy on craigslist. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has anyone tried an SNES to AES controller adapter? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The AES and nes share connectors. 

The SNES and nes use the same protocol but a different connection. 

I wonder if it would be possible to use an SNES controller on AES without a fancy adapter.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Financial aid and taking classes @ csulb and lbcc </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-08 04:58:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For subject matter competency in history I need 5 classes. 

3 of those are lower division which can be taken at lbcc and transferred to csulb.

If I take 2 classes at csulb that's part time. Tuition is  1900 for part time instead of 3300 for full time. 

Would my financial aid be affected [lowered] if I am part time at 2 campuses? I'd still need to edit my fafsa to add lbcc. 

Anyone have experience with this or know where I should start looking for advice?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I remember listening to this one on a children's DVD [veggie tales? ]. The speakers were basically talking about how the mother and baby animals [raccoon or opossum] should try and get child support from the dead beat dad. This was like the first scene. The animal family was trying to get across a road or something.

It was quite strange to me, I don't think I finished listening to it much more.  </TEXT>
