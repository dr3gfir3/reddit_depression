	<TEXT> That does it.
I love the hardware and was really looking forward to Windows 10.
But the lack of apps, poor integration, MS insistence on doing nothing to actually promote the platform... My next phone will be an android. 

Something silly happened today. I got an ad for MileIQ from MS in my email. And it advertised that it was supported by iphone and android. Not Windows Mobile. Why. WHY?! I don't even care about the app but Why would MS send out an ad for an app that doesn't work on their platform. Maybe they should develop it for Windows and then advertise it? Or even say "coming soon to  windows phone"?

It's just sad. The phones have been a problem. The Surface, which had amazing potential, is, in my opinion a failure (I shouldn't have to spend an obscene amount of money to get the model that actually works), Windows 10 isn't terrible but they discontinued support for many good features and apps, the wearable which had potential turns out to be garbage. 

Come on Microsoft. I spent the last 5 years as a fan boy mainly with the hope that in the end, it would all work out. I just don't believe it any more. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Updating to Windows 10 Mobile Preview </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hello All,

I was wondering if anyone has any advice regarding upgrading to Windows 10 Mobile. 

I have a Lumia 1020 running 8.1.

I updated a few months ago and it wrecked havoc on my phone. I found out that since I had chosen to be on the "slow" track I got a bad version.

What version will definitely work? How do I make sure I get that version? Will all of my contacts, texts, apps, pictures, etc., still be there?

I liked many of the features of Windows 10 once I got it working and would like to give it another try.

Thanks in advance for any and all advice. </TEXT>

I thought you couldn't vaal uniques? I vaaled an unique amulet (i'm at work right now so I can't link it) and all that happened was that it got corrupted. Same stats and everything. I was able to vall some unique jewels though. But all I've gotten from that are rares that kinda suck.

Am I doing something wrong? Can some uniques be vaaled and not others?

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the reply.

I won't be upgrading again anytime soon. At this point I've seen it and will just wait until the full roll out, March I think? I'm pretty happy with WP8.1. I also don't want to do another hard reset. It takes like 3 hours to download all my apps and texts and contacts etc. 

I did find this article published yesterday though:
http://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-may-have-just-fixed-stuck-app-updates-windows-10-mobile-store

So, that's some good news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello r/windowsphone!

I've been a windows phone user for some time now. Ever since the Lumia 900 came out anyway. I've been very happy with the hardware and the OS has been pretty good. I argue that it's better than the Android I am forced to lug around for work, but there are google features and apps that work better on Android. But I digress.

I recently took the plunge to try out the Windows 10 preview. A friend at work got a 950 and tried the WP10 preview and it just worked great. He has no issues and loves it. I have a 1020 and did not have the same experience. Generally, I liked it. Features missing from WP8.1 that are in WP10 are great. I fully understand and anticipate GREAT things when full WP10 rolls out and integrates with Windows 10. I love the look and feel of WP10. But I ran into a nice long list of issues:

**Email didn't work**

* Although I could see that my google accounts were there I couldn't access them. Apparently this is a known issue.
* I couldn't add a new email account either, I think this is related to the same issue.

**Apps**

* Many apps just disappeared. I saw this with my upgrade to Windows 10. All I want is a list of programs that didn't transfer so I can find a replacement. Instead, I had to stumble upon what apps were missing.
* Why did Cortana disappear? Why did some apps transfer fine while others I needed to re-download? 
* At some point all of my apps were inaccessible. The Apps list was blank. But all my apps on the start screen worked fine, so I know they were installed. This was the final straw to roll back. 

**Crashes**

* Oh My Gawd. The OS crashed daily. Certain apps, like MS weather, would crash the OS every time.
* Certain apps would randomly crash themselves.

**Phone stopped working**

* After the initial set up, and after I kinda got things going, the phone stopped working. I couldn't make or receive calls or texts or connect to WiFi. I could navigate through the phone, but otherwise it was a brick. I did a hard reset and had to start again and re-download and re-set up EVERYTHING.

**Bug reporter**

* This is a preview, I get it, it probably shouldn't work perfectly. But what SHOULD work is the bug reporter. I would have LOVED to report all the issues I had so they don't happen in March. But every time I tried to report something the OS crashed. 

If you've made it this far, thanks! 

My advice to anyone thinking of trying out the Windows 10 Preview is, back-up EVERYTHING. I forgot to back up some photos I hadn't synced to OneDrive yet and after the inevitable hard reset, I lost them. Not a big deal, it was like 4 pictures, but I forgot about them. Another redditor suggested making sure you have a back-up phone. Luckily, I have my work phone so I wasn't without phone and text for a weekend before I got the phone part working again.

Now for the issue, which I more curious if anyone else has this issue. I rolled back. Had to log back into everything and set up a few apps, re-download almost everything. But now I have 5 blank apps that won't download. Instead of the app name, it just says "Downloading Application" and the subtext is "attention required." I click the "try again" button and the same thing happens again. There's also no image for the app. So, is there any way to figure out what these apps are? Is there a way to force the download? Is it possible these are apps that downloaded on WP10 but now don't work on WP8.1?

Thanks for reading. Remember, there are dozens of us, DOZENS! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In middle school one of my best friends found out I was jewish and started being super weird and standoffish. At some point he called me a "fucking Kike." I was shocked. Someone I had been close with, eaten at his house, played on the same baseball team, etc. That was the end of "us" and I never talked with him again. I think he's in jail now.

Looking at some of the other stories here I guess it wasn't the worst thing in the world. But at 14 I was floored. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chassis.

I had done a huge report on different types of cars in middle school. We had to also do a presentation but all the research I had done was via books and owners manuals. I got up in front of the class and proceeded to speak very intelligently about all sorts of car stuff. And I was really getting into cars and stuff too, like I wanted to be a "car guy." Then, after class, the teacher told me "great report, but it's "Chas-ee", not "Chass-Is". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Abraham and the Idol Shop. Not sure if it's in the Bible or just the commentary.

Basically, Abraham, as a boy is working in an idol shop. His father leaves the shop and tells Abraham he is in charge while he's gone. A woman comes in and wants to pray to the idols. Abraham then smashes all the idols and put the hammer he used in the hands of the largest idol. When his dad comes back and asks what happened, Abraham tells him the idols got into a fight and the largest one won. His dad is pissed but realizes that this must mean that idols are not gods and therefore there must be only one god that is not an idol. Or something like that.

This story was told to me when I was in hebrew school before I was a Bar Mitzvah. I think the idea was "prove" that worshiping idols was dumb because it makes no sense to put faith in an inanimate object. I think it just made me question my faith even more. I remember asking my hebrew school teacher how is this any different than putting the torah in the ark or worshiping "the one true god" just because we're told to. I didn't last long in hebrew school... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had the same problem with a 925. Everything worked fine until I plugged in some headphones and then the phone never figured out that I had unplugged them even after I had. I sent it back through AT T and was sent a replacement. Immediately upon putting in headphones it happened again. I did some research and found this was a "known issue" and that it should only happen to a small fraction of the phones. But since it happened to me twice on two different phones I asked for a different model. They sent me a 1020, which has not had any problems.

So I'd suggest contacting your provider or Nokia to see if they'll replace it. I think it is a defect with the hardware they use in the jack which is failing to dis-engage the headphone. </TEXT>

Turns out they had dated for the entire summer before freshman year and I didn't even know. 

They're married now. Good thing I brought her to that party... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In middle school/High school we had 2 Sex-Ed classes, one in 7th, one in 10th. They were pretty comprehensive and did a good job of making the scary parts scary (STDs, pregnency, etc.) and the rest prettyy informative. I always hoped one day after we'd learned everything there was to know they would pair us off and we'd get to all have sex with each other, right there in class. Like some sort of practical exam. It only made sense to try it out after learning all the hypotheticals. 

Then I found out in the 10th grade class that half of the school was supposedly sexually active and had plenty of practice.  </TEXT>
