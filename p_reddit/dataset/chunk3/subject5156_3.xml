	<TEXT> It really is almost an exact clone. At this point it's a little buggy.  I like some of the stuff they do differently. The single player is a lot more in depth. And your base is locked from editing until you hold your finder on the screen for like 5 seconds, so no accidentally moving stuff around, which is nice. You also have to either pick rebels or imperials. I like it, I basically play in between training CoC armies </TEXT>

Although Gilles de Rais was convicted of murdering many children through his confessions and the detailed eyewitness accounts of his own confederates and victims' parents, doubts have persisted about the court's verdict. Counterarguments are based on the theory de Rais was himself a victim of an ecclesiastic plot or act of revenge by the Catholic Church or French state.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had a ticket open for over 4 weeks. Keep giving me the same bullshit about needing to talk to a "dev". Seems like most of the time, the only way to get things solved is by complaining on reddit. I fear for mintpal with moolah taking over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, not necessarily. The difficulty for SHA256 mining is much higher than scrypt. Partly because almost everyone mining sha256 is using an ASIC. You can use the website coinwarz.com to see exactly how many coins you would get using a sh256 ASIC or a GPU mining scrypt. It all depends on current difficulty levels, and exactly what your hashrate is compared to the entire network.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, a premine is basically exactly what you described. At best, it is used to fund projects related to the coin, but at worst it's a way for the developers and early adopters to make profits.

Myriad has 5 separate algorithms, that can only produce 1/5 of the coins mined. So if you are using a sha256 ASIC, that has no impact on the scrypt miner using his GPU. ASIC miners compete with other ASIC miners, GPU miners compete with other GPU miners, and so on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The long block-halving schedule (every 48 weeks) ensures that the coin is fairly distributed. You have the same opportunity to mine as people who were mining months ago. This is key for decentralization. Also, there was no premine. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When matchmaking for clan wars, is it based on your clan's average strength, or individual members' strength? For example, and I'm just using an arbitrary scale here, if you have 5 members who are rated a 10 and 5 members who are rated a 5, that would make your clan average a 7.5. Would you get matched with a clan whose average is 7.5 no matter the composition, or would you be matched with 5 10s and 5 5s? Thanks for any help, my clan hasn't gone to war yet, and we're trying to decide if we're ready. </TEXT>
