	<TEXT> Aside from a few unintelligent door knobs, I haven't actually seen any negative feedback on this lol. 

I lived in the Bible Belt in Georgia when I was a teenager and they actually gave a pretty good sex Ed class. They thought about contraception, abstinence, condoms, horrible std pictures. They called it "life choices" or something. Either way, it was good and it gave my enough information to want to look up more.  Didn't get pregnant in high school. Married for 2 years and still not pregnant thanks to birth control :D </TEXT>

It's not about "free" stuff or huge promises. It's about someone willing to stand up to those who say "no". It's about someone who aims high, knowing we will meet somewhere in the middle. It is about someone who truly cares about the wellbeing of every man, woman, and child. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with what you listed as relatively harmless. As far as the other drugs, I agree they're harmful. I think they should still be legalized. 

I've heard in Amsterdam, you have a daily allowance of marijuana you're allowed. They monitor it by inputting you in a system. Apparently this list is accessible by potential employers with background checks. It would make sense to do the same thing with the harder drugs. People are going to do it regardless. If it was monitored somehow, it could be regulated better. Employers wouldn't end up hiring an addict and then be surprised one day when they don't show up or lose their shit. 

I don't know if the Amsterdam thing is true or not. I feel like I've heard it before but idk lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys!

I'm making this post because a lot of conversations have come up recently, and I can't get them out of my mind. I'm a hard core Bernie supporter, so naturally I like to discuss him with people.

Anyway, first things first. I had a coworker who is very antigovernment mention that, technically, because Bernie is calling this a "political revolution" he is basically condoning communism. I can't personally see that, based in the research I've done. Dude says he wishes he could vote for Bernie because he believes in a lot of his policies, but the "communist" thing prevents him from that. Could things be going differently had he not used the word "socialist"? Would we look at him differently?

There was another coworker who was very pro-death penalty. I personally don't care. I did mention that it costs more for a death penalty inmate than it does for a life sentence inmate. However, this is based on court cases and appeals. His response to cases was "they need to stop the court cases then, just kill the bastard". I explained that that is in place because of our constitutional right to fair trial, due process, and all that jazz. The subject of how we identify came up. I said I don't identify with either of the parties. I just do what feels right. He said " I consider myself a constitutionalist" my response? "You mean you believe in a country for the people, by the people?" He answered yes. Did he not just contradict himself based on his death penalty statement?

I've run my own numbers with www.bernietax.com and would probably save like $4k a year. I've also been spreading this around Facebook so people who are scared of taxes understand.  Anyway, I firmly believe in healthcare for all. What I'm curious about is how this would be implemented. Basically, we wake up one day and be able to go to the doctor? Would all private insurance go away? I have to go to the doctor/dentist periodically for work and if I have to wait a long time to get in, that would be very inconvenient.

I've heard a lot of propaganda regarding Bernies plans that say we would be put into deeper debt. Have we actually had a non biased source run his numbers? Would his proposed plans ACTUALLY pay for themselves? Do any of his plans show a decrease in the national debt?

I've tried to do a lot of my own research to keep people informed. I can't phone bank or canvas right now, so I've taken to social media to convince people. Pretty good result right now, so long as I message them directly and ease into the conversation. 

Guys, my mind is completely overrun with politics to the point where I can't sleep because I'm thinking about it so much. I get emotional when I see Bernie videos. I have more passion about Bernie than I've ever had about anything in my life. If I'm not actively working, I'm trying to find out more about Bernie. I get upset when I hear people don't like him because he wants to help other people. My heart aches when someone tells me they want to vote for hillary.
