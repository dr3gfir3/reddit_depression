Another one I enjoy is the smell of sunscreen, probably because it reminds me of fun summer stuff.

"While there is no direct evidence for Tyrannosaurus rex having had feathers, many scientists now consider it likely that T. rex had feathers on at least parts of its body,[31] due to their presence in related species of similar size.[...] Subsequent discoveries showed that even some gigantic tyrannosauroids had feathers covering much of their bodies, casting doubt on the hypothesis that they were a size-related feature." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, I'm not sure why people are giving this a hard time. The Twitter content *should* be different from the usual trolling since I'd imagine the large majority of your followers are aware of the act and Twitter doesn't really lend itself as well to the 'dumb clever old man' type stuff like Yahoo and Facebook do. Stay classy Ken </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [x-post /r/LeagueofLegends] 24 hour charity stream for childhood cancer research! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-25 21:07:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/47khr6/24_hour_charity_stream_for_childhood_cancer/)

Last February, a few friends and I hosted a 24 hour Twitch stream of League from Drexel University to raise money for childhood cancer research  and we ended up raising **over $6,600** in donations to the [St. Baldricks Foundation](http://www.stbaldricks.org/), more than tripling our expectations.

Tomorrow, beginning at 8 pm EST, we are doing it again! With your help, our goal is to raise at least **$10,000 for childhood cancer research.** Every little bit helps!

Here are some links:

 - [Donation Link](https://www.stbaldricks.org/donate/team/98364/2015)

 - [Twitch Link](http://www.twitch.tv/drexelbaldricks)

 - [Our Twitter](https://twitter.com/DrexelBaldricks)

 - [A cool infographic](https://magic.piktochart.com/output/10927026-baldricks-stream) 

If you guys have any suggestions for things we can do during the stream (e.g. tournaments, specific team comps, challenges for the streamers, things we can do at certain donation milestones, celebrity connections, etc.), let us know! 

If youd like to contact us privately, feel free to send me a pm here or send an email to DrexelBaldricks@gmail.com. 

**Thanks for your support!**
