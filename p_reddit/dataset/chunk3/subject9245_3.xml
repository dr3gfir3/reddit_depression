	<TEXT> when my cousins and I were telling scary stories in front of the house. My Grandpa told us to stop telling scary stories at night or something will make us stop. Of course we didn't listen. A dog we never had seen before walked up to us and I swear gave us the SAME look our Grandpa did and turned around and left. In pure puzzlement we went after the dog and it was no where to be found. Just vanished in to thin air.  </TEXT>
