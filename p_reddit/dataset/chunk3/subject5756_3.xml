	<TEXT> Was this in California, or another state? That's good to know, but sucks for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's true. And a lot of teachers who did get jobs in districts got pink slips. Last hired, first fired. One of my Master Teachers was a recently displaced Assistant Principal for LAUSD and many subs were retired teachers. If that's happening, then there must not be much room for new teachers. Then again, that was 6 years ago. Hopefully things will change soon... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the info. I'll definitely remember that next time I put in an application.

When you say supervisor, do you mean the district HR contact person they last with the application, or someone else? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No... what is the best course of action when following up with a large district, though? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I took the coursework and passed the CSET for English, but I still haven't filled out the paperwork to clear it.  So technically, yes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you working at a charter school?  I created my own curriculum for my first five years.  This was at a brand new charter school.  We had purchased curriculum the first year we opened, but it was used more as a resource bank because we realized it didn't fit in with our school's particular philosophy.  We are finally adopting new curriculum for the Common Core this year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed.  The more you can get into a classroom with students BEFORE you have your own classroom, the better.  Classroom management is one of the things new teachers struggle with the most, and it can only be learned through experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rubistar is a great place to create rubrics, but it also houses a wide array of ready-to-use rubrics in various areas.  Hope it helps!

	<TEXT> You can organize your lessons/quizzes/tests by Standard for easier access from year to year, or by month/quarter if you have a certain pacing you know will follow from year to year.  You can also purchase hanging file folders in different colors to designate different subjects. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I subbed Pre-K to 11 my first year with a multiple subject credential as well.  You should be able to, just not 12th grade because it is more specialized content.  Like syd_malicious said, you will only be able to long-term sub in the areas you are fully credentialed in.  I did a lot of long-term subbing and it helped me land a full-time teaching job.  Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is the state of "new teachers" where YOU live? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I am a teacher going into my 6th year at a charter school in the Los Angeles area.  Pretty much every year I've been at the charter school, I've applied for jobs at public school districts and never received a reponse.  While I am excited for the work I am doing where I am, what I would like is to get a more secure job at a public district closer to where I live (Orange County).  This year a great district nearby put out an application for potentially 30 positions, and I never heard a word back from them.

I don't consider myself a new teacher, but I wonder what experiences others have had in this area as teachers who have been stuck in the charter system or perhaps even in other states.  Every teacher I've met can only find charter school jobs, one even moving as far as Northern California just to have one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you tried heavier toys?  Sometimes they just like to have a little resistance, that is to chew something that won't move very much.  My buns are obsessed with the hard and heavy hay tunnel I get from the pet store - I get the large one and it lasts about a month for my my buns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You probably experienced a honeymoon period with him until recently.  Now he is more familiar with you and communicating his disapproval with you through nips.  Avoid physical contact unless he approaches you  and only give pets when his head is down for awhile.  To encourage him approaching you, lay still in a space near where he is.  It may take time, but be patient and don't get discouraged.  This is how you earn trust.  I took in a bunny off the street and the same thing happened with her.  

It is also natural for rabbits to chew on things as it helps them keep their teeth from overgrowing.  I recommend going to a pet shop and providing him with a few options to keep him from damaging furniture - my rabbits love the heavy hay tunnel because it doesn't move much when they chew on it, but every bunny is different.  If you have carpet, make sure all of the corners are inaccessible because he may pull it up.

Rescuing bunnies is one of the most rewarding experiences ever, so keep up the good work!  =) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LOL... my girl used to wake me up when I didn't have breakfast ready in a timely fashion too.  She would pick up her plastic dish and swing it around until the noise was loud enough to wake me up and bring her pellets. </TEXT>
