	<TEXT> I'm sorry to hear, it sounds like you are struggling at the moment.

The most important thing is to speak to your primary care physician about how you are. Make sure you tell him about your suicidal ideation also.

Hopefully he can refer you for psychological input. In the UK (England) this would be IAPT, otherwise I'm not sure what it would be in the states.

Best of luck with it </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do it if you need it.

People ideally need to stop thinking about it as taboo and more like something they simply need some support with.

Sometimes we get ill and can get over it our selves, sometimes we need to ask for loved ones and friends advice. Other times we need professional help just like when we need to see our doctors for professional help.

Help comes in the form of medication or talking therapies generally depending on where you are. My advice is if you think you need help go for an assessment/consultation somewhere. It doesn't mean you need to engage in full treatment but can help answer any questions you might have and to see if it is for you.

	<TEXT> I don't think I have ever used the pee hole. It seems like so much hassle. 

Maybe once as a kid, before realising it wasn't worth the effort. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Did steam with ice cubes yup, but I think the oven was not hot enough to form a crunchy crust.

The insides were nice and fluffy though, thanks for the input! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll expand on how it kind of has:

In times of difficulty I've seen it band people together and do some remarkable things.

In times of comedy, it has been one of the funniest places to visit (particularly comments sections).

Plus the AMA's are usually pretty awesome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A surprise meal somewhere, or even better a home cooked surprise meal with candles etc is always a safe bet.

That plus surprise theatre tickets are the classic/clich but can still be great if it's what you're in to. </TEXT>
