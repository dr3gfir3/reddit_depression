	<TEXT> I started yesterday at rank 18 and was trying to practice with miracle rogue, but I got destroyed in every single game because I only faced aggro shamans, like 65% and the other 25% was pirate warrior and one ore two games against reno mages..  I just quit playing because even in casual fucking mode people are playing shaman.. WTF? :S </TEXT>
