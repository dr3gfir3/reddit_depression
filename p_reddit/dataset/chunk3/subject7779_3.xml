	<TEXT> He recently updated the original post:

3. UPDATE: 10 Years of 7kwh Cycles. Cheap Enough. Im adding this after some twitter conversations with Robert Fransman. Lets assume for a moment that the Tesla Battery actually can be used for full 7kwh charging and discharging every day during its 10 year warranty. That would make the cost around 12 cents / kwh.

[I had initially assumed that daily 7kwh cycling was impossible, despite the specs Tesla provided. No Li-ion battery today can handle 3650 discharges to 100% depth. But Robert Fransman has done the math on the weight of the battery vs. Tesla car batteries. He suggests that the 7kwh battery is actually a 12kwh battery under the hood. Discharging a battery to 60% 3650 times is still a stretch, but much closer to plausible. Tesla may here be just assuming they'll have to replace some on warranty before 10 years, but given that the price of batteries is plunging, future replacement is far less expensive. Smart.]

All three of these prices are the price to installers. Its not counting the installers profit margin or their cost of labor or any equipment  needed to connect it to the house. So realistically the costs will be higher. If we add 25% of so, the bottom price, the one backed by the warranty, is around 15 cents per kwh. 

Tentative Conclusion: The battery is right on the verge of being cost effective to buy across most of the US for day/night arbitrage. And its even more valuable if outages come at a high economic cost. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great question. I think that this piece from the article highlights the difference, but I'd love for someone with more expertise to chime in about MIT's cam: 

"Another optical imaging technique, called the pump-probe method, can create movies with an even higher frame rate than STAMP, but can only capture one frame at a timelimiting its use to processes that are exactly reproducible." </TEXT>

These types of weeks are what gets me SO excited about the future! From Elons unveiling of the home battery to the worlds thinnest transistor, the fact that we are living in a time of exponential progress has never been more apparent!

	<TEXT> Greetings Reddit!

This is a monumental week in science as we saw the first instance of scientists genetically modifying human embryos. The impact of such research is widespread and marks the first public exploration into altering the human germlline. Id keep a close eye on CRISPR research going forward as it has the potential to dramatically alter the future of humanity.

A HUGE week in Space, including evidence of liquid water on Mars. It seems as though we are finding hints of water everywhere in our solar system as of late. Something that wasnt even imaginable ten short years ago.

I hope you enjoy!

	<TEXT> This is absolutely a great point. I've been looking into how to execute on this for a while, as I agree that allowing people to follow the progress of an innovation would be awesome.

The difficulty is that the only stages that are actually covered are initial discovery, and possibly commercial launch. Everything in between is constantly in limbo. Getting in touch with the original authors/scientists behind the study and having them update on progress is a feasible alternative though </TEXT>

Welcome to this week in science! Some truly awesome space discoveries, including finding hints that the building blocks of the chemistry of life are universal. 

NASAs Chief Scientist recently stated that he predicts well find signs of alien life by 2025!

From DARPA working on autonomously evolving computer programs to tree planting drones, this was one of my favorite weeks yet!

Its truly amazing to see how fast new technology transitions from experimental to actionable.

From DARPA working on autonomously evolving computer programs to tree planting drones, this was one of my favorite weeks yet!

Its truly amazing to see how fast new technology transitions from experimental to actionable.
