Well, that's the problem. I need to learn WHEN to actually use such things. 

But when people say combo. Does it need to invigde a special attack to be a combo?

	<TEXT> Oh thank you!
I almost forget about such things that You mentioned, that I need to be more passive aggressive and "poke", as I always find Myself either too aggressive Or too defensive.

So basically I need to play ALOT of games to figure out which attacks can be linked into specials </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically, I have to play ALOT so I can over time recognize these block-strings.

As I mentioned earlier, I've been soo interested into guile, but many people have adviced against him since he is not top tier and is terrible for beginners... so "ryu" would be optimal.

I have no problem with ryu since I already have memorized all his special attacks that is mentioned in the game already, But still dont know IF guile is a good char.

Thank You for your advice Btw 3 </TEXT>
