	<TEXT> Ok so for a while now I have been having an issue handling girls and depression. Recently I started talking to this really cute girl in my class and we have gone out on a few casual dates. The issue started to arise when she mentioned she is in a long distance relationship with her boyfriend who she cares a lot about. I felt rejected. And have been really bummed out about it.  I wish I could seduce her even though she has a boyfriend,  but my depression literally brings my  confidence down to zero.  Since I feel rejected i have been feeling sad.  I feel like it's a repeating cycle. Should I pursue or Learn great seducing tips? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Eh yeah I understand what you mean by that but, me and him don't have that type of joking relationship. I'll let this one slide...  I'm pretty sure if I where to say something like " hey [insert ass hole name here]  are you related to Donald trump? Because you both are dicks. I would get fired or screamed at. I'll let this one slide,  thanks for your feedback :)  </TEXT>
