	<TEXT> I implore you all: no matter how cool a trailer looks, no matter how promising previews and demos appear, please, PLEASE do not preorder games. Preordering rewards publishers that overhype games, leading to situations like No Man's Sky selling millions despite terrible reviews from both players and critics. Publishers are actively discouraging players from making informed purchases--more and more publishers refuse to send early reviewer copies, for fear that negative press will kill early sales.  Don't let these companies prey on consumer impatience. Wait for the game to release, see if it's any good, and THEN make an informed choice to buy the game. What's the harm?   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Past performance doesn't always ensure quality.  Square Enix has made divisive games before. And FFXV being in development longer than NMS doesn't mean much, when you consider games like Duke Nukem Forever being in development for 15 years and still being terrible. Really, the only point of preordering is to get the game slightly earlier than others. I just feel waiting that extra couple days  to evaluate a game's quality is more valuable than being among the first to play.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there are no reviews out. some outlets were permitted to play the first five chapters, on the condition that they explicitly can't call it a "review" and to only give rough impressions.  previews are always more positive than reviews, so we will see what the final verdict looks like upon release.

Edit: I don't see why I'm being downvoted for stating an objective fact </TEXT>

	<TEXT> nothing personal, but could I kindly persuade you not to preorder?  Preordering is encouraging game developers to churn out mediocre games and diverting development resources into marketing and hype. No Man's Sky sold millions of units through preorders before everyone realized it was essentially a scam.  Wait for the game to come out, see if it is any good, and THEN buy it.  What do you have to lose?

Edit: really? downvotes?  I'm making a perfectly reasonable and sound argument... </TEXT>

As the magnetic field pinches the plasma for an incredibly brief moment, the result is a massive burst of X-ray radiation and the formation of a tiny piece of white dwarf star, which is 10,000 times more dense than the surface of our sun." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think total annihilation was a fantastic game that really nailed physics-based large scale RTS.  It was way ahead of its time, and it  still impresses me today. Yes, it sacrificed precise micromanagement for slower-paced overall strategy, but I just feel Blizzard has the capability of defining a new kind of RTS that marries elements of both sides.  Let's not be so defeatist.  

I actually think Supreme Commander 2 already achieved great strides in streamlining gameplay while maintaining it's sense of scale.  IMO, the main issues with the Supreme Commander series are storytelling and developer commitment to competitive play. And these are precisely the two components Blizzard excels at.  Think of the possibilities.

	<TEXT> I might be in the minority, but I yearn for a StarCraft successor with a true sense of scale, ala Total Annihilation or Supreme Commander.  I want the game to play like the jaw-dropping cinematic trailers that left us breathless. I want to see ultralisks stepping on tanks, battlecruisers the size of bases, zerglings swarming literally in the tens of thousands. Blizzard lore and storytelling combined with strategy at a grand scale.  One can dream... </TEXT>
