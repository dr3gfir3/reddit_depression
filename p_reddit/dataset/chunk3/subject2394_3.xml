	<TEXT> Is your Grandmother some kind of artisan? I envy you. This is a [folding screen] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Folding_screen), and although I can't say anything about the contents, the letters are highly stylized Chinese characters. Are the letters sewn into the screen, or are they handwritten? If it's the latter, then it has some resemblance to the [Buddhist sutras from Goryeo] (http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/works-of-art/1994.207/) which also has golden letters written on indigo paper. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure about what you're talking about, but if you're talking about the dish, won't they eat it afterwards? Gotgam is a traditional snack, and this is no different from an ordinary one. But what do I know. Maybe they dump it afterwards because it was meant to be an ornament. But this is unlikely seeing as how preparing for the dish is a complicated process. Sorry for not being of any help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I didn't think there was any part considered "downtown" in Seoul. 

What do you mean by that? Are you implying that cities outside NA and Europe don't have a downtown equivalent due to the way how they were developed differently? Or are you saying that it doesn't have the same kind of density or size found in the downtowns of NA European cities? I'm generally curious. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Trump himself -- through his lawyers -- have also argued that there was no evidence of voter fraud in the 2016 election. In a court filing objecting to Green Party candidate Jill Stein's Michigan recount petition, lawyers for the president wrote, "All available evidence suggests that the 2016 general election was not tainted by fraud or mistake."

He *knows* that this isn't true, so one can only assume that he has ulterior motives... </TEXT>

It was the tallest building outside the US for a brief period before the Westin Stamford Hotel took its place. Wouldn't that make more sense since the North and the South were always trying to one-up each other, especially in the 80s. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The US had the capability and the resources to become a superpower, and it even had the opportunity to shape the world to its advantage. China has none of those. And the current world order was made by the US. It's a intricate machine only the US can operate, and it has 70 years of experience. And the current administration will only last a maximum 8 years. Overall, the notion that China could overtake the US as the sole superpower is absurd, at least for the foreseeable future. </TEXT>

To make matters worse, the alternate name of the mountain is Mt Eungbong, which happens to be the name of another mountain in Seongdong district that is lower than the aforementioned one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's always good to see a photo getting the appreciation it deserves. Don't forget to read the rules and include the resolution and context and etc in the title. You should get it once you look at the other submissions in those subs. And in your case, since you took the photo, you can include the [OC] tag to show that it is your photo. And also consider /r/ArchitecturePorn, with a title like 'contrast of old and new' or something like that. </TEXT>
