	<TEXT> I went to a baptist high school in Indiana for my freshman-junior year. I watched some of the more upstanding kids from my youth group bully the shit out of these two kids at my highschool for no other reason than being skinny and talking kinda strangely. My history teacher taught us that homosexuality was a purely modern phenomenon starting about 100 years ago and that American democracy started going downhill when women got the right to vote. My science teacher taught us that "macro-evolution" was an affront to the Christian faith and actually taught young earth theory as a viable scientific theory. On more than one occasion, my gym teacher berated the weaker kids in class, asking why they couldn't be like the strong athletes and do more than 10 push-ups. Our chapels would mainly consist of fear-mongering stories about hell and secular evils etc. Needless to say, I'm not too keen on the Christian faith anymore. It didn't really fuck me up per say, more just changed my perspective on religion. </TEXT>
