	<TEXT> You DM 3.5e, don't you?

I'm the same. I want the players to know I'm not making shit up out of the blue. I want them to know if it happened once, it will happen again, exactly the same.  
Basically I want them to know my universe obeys the cosmological principle. Precisely because of that expectation of fairness you mention.

However my approach includes slightly more common sense. I hold RaW strictly as nothing but guidelines. That said, the default assumption is there is always a good reason RaW was written as it was, therefore if I have to alter something I exhaust every possible avenue before resorting to house-ruling myself.

I don't actually tack on "rule of cool" explicitly and separately, I let it become an emergent property of the system. </TEXT>

I bet you even those here who think this instance is stupid have their "yes, but..." preference for a fumble system. While the truth is, fumbles suck as a game mechanic.

They unfairly penalize characters who roll more dice and hit more often. They make players feel bad because they're left at the mercy of the dice.

Remind your DM that the point of the game is fun for everyone, not just himself. If he doesn't agree he can go suck on a cactus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can't make easy comparisons. The game too diverse. A wizard would have scant use of an ability point that can't go to his main casting stat. However he might see a great deal of use of an extra metamagic feat.

On the contrary a fighter who has tons of feats but relies on many different ability scores to be effective, might see a great deal of benefit from shoring up his weaker stats.

So this *"+1 ability score ~= 2 feats ~= 10 skill points"* spiel is utter bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Numbers can always be fudged.  
So that should never be a problem.

What changes at high levels are the stakes. Bring out the exotic locales and the truly cosmic plots. Expeditions to the cores of planets, to divine pantheons, to the depths of hell, flying fortresses in space, the far realm. Heck. It should become *easier* at higher levels, because you can let your imagination run wild.

Too often do DMs get stuck in the D D mindset of dungeoneering adventurers. If you've done your job as a DM well, they should be deeply invested in the inner workings of your world, not merely pine for the next pile of treasure. Your players are no longer adventurers, they are avatars of the gods, of pure ideals, they are forces of nature. Treat them as such. </TEXT>

1. You or him might not be understanding the concept of ECL properly.
2. You are most definitely not understanding the scope of the game. HP damage and AC defences is but **one** of a great multitude of tools the game provides to resolve conflicts.
3. Be glad he chose Monk. Of all things... He's *trying* to make it easy for you.

When a DM struggles with an OP character like that it is almost surely because he is throwing things at the party that this character is specifically strong against. Such as throwing HP dummies at characters with a high damage output. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well they are the pinnacle of D D on PC after all. And Pillars was specifically modelled after the IE games.

Also Dragon Age 1. Fuck the sequels.

But honestly, you can find inspiration in a lot of unlikely places, as long as you're willing to look. KotOR is 3.5 in space. Any other BioWare title('cept the DA sequels). The Witcher series. StarCraft 1 Etc...

And an incredible example outside of games - "The last airbender" follows the structure of an epic D D campaign to a tee. It's uncanny really. </TEXT>

**Side-questy:** The seed of a nearly extinct tree, some druids want really badly. It is part of the hoard of a loony, pig-headed ancient blue dragon.  
**Campaign-arc-y:** The journal of a dead king that could plunge an entire nation into civil war. It details some shenanigans pertaining to two old feuding royal bloodlines.  
**Endgamey:** A thing that can grant great power or unlock the passage to a place where another thing is imprisoned that some "bad" "guys" would like to see unleashed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some of these are good and some are bad. You should have probably set rules before starting this.

For example:  
1. **No hijacking of player characters!**  
- Don't be "that DM". (Incidentally this disqualifies like half these suggestions.)   
2. **No nasty combat encounters.**  
- This list would work much better if the events provided solely RP potential, separate from whatever "random encounter table" you have.

	<TEXT> This is an indicator of a larger issue - and knee-jerk reactions like "banning sex talk" is missing the forest for the trees.

The problem is the BF or both evidently seem to be unable to separate fantasy from reality. Which is sort of a prerequisite for playing this game.

You can't really help them there, but maybe you can use that tendency to disincentivize such behaviour - like have them play unrelated characters, maybe have them play same-sex characters, possibly both male. If one or both are immature enough to let a game affect their relationship like that, chances are they'd be immature enough to be uncomfortable with making fantasy homosexual advances. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Finally, a post of substance in a thread that is otherwise power tripping and completely random, arbitrary rules.

1. This is just personal preference, but I like the volatility of the d20 vs the bell curve rolls. I feel like it provides a nice gradient for characters through their heroic journey, where in the beginning their success is mostly governed by chance, while mighty characters take fate into their own hands(as simulated by the fact that with low modifiers, the relative contribution of the die is great, while as the modifiers get higher, the relative contribution of the die result diminishes significantly).

2. I completely agree with the sentiment behind this rule, but feel like the implementation could be better. Though I'm not sure how to go about it...  
Maybe one of your stats is your affinity(your highest or maybe by choice), and all checks with it receive a bonus. Or - since I like to borrow mechanics from all over - receive advantage.  
You can also logically expand this and require a "weakness", where all checks receive disadvantage.

3. I assume you're aware of the existence of action points? If not check them out.  
Me, I use them to create a fair fumble system - you know, one where those who roll more don't get unfairly penalized. The basics are really simple: It's optional, but you get 1/2 action point for every fumble. The fluff is also neat - you either play a cautious fighter who doesn't risk too much or a daring warrior who takes risks - which sometimes fail spectacularly, but sometimes pay off in just the right moment.

Me, I stick to a specific personal design philosophy - instead of arrogantly assuming I know best, I like to look at what other people have done first, and only if I find nothing, then I start making up shit on my own. I.e. I tend to borrow from a lot of places.

Like for example the "Bloodied" condition from 4e, Called Shots and death at -con(vs -10) HP from Pathfinder, or the advantage mechanic from 5e. One of the few actual house rules I have is the Combat step - it allows you to give up iterative attacks for bonus 5-ft. steps. </TEXT>

Except not the boring, regular kind, but the new, exciting one, where you *double the number of dimensions*.

Even a 3-wide tesseract would be enough of a head-scratcher. For example [like this](https://i.imgur.com/2G46uAp.png). </TEXT>

I'd go with either a more cliche, but more reasonable option or a more personal stake - love of an individual, envy of humanity, revenge, desire for freedom, etc.

It's not the grand motivation that will be important, it's the details in how he goes about in achieving it. </TEXT>
