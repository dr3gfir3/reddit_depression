	<TEXT> Why are you/they being so secretive with the email? Why wait for a blog/magazine to verify their statement versus just issuing a press release hosted on their site?

Or even a Twitlonger from their Twitter account, if it's not big enough news to warrant a company press release?

I'm not doubting you -- but it feels unnecessarily complex.  Just put it out there in an official channel. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's reportedly a leaked message from Denton's private FB. His alleged source can't archive it because it would give away who the source is.

His alleged source can't archive it because archive.today isn't logged in to his account.  For example, if you're logged in to twitter, and try to archive.today twitter.com, all you'll see is the generic please sign up/login welcome screen.

That's because archive.today grabs content from a third party machine.

If this was truly a "private FB", then achive.today **won't** give away the source because all archive.today would fetch is the public version of Nick Denton's feed, that everyone can see.  The user in question who was logged in to Facebook and screenshotted the exchange won't have any personalization shown, because in the archive, he won't be logged in.

	<TEXT> To be fair, Patreon isn't exactly like Kickstarted or similar games. Not always, anyway.  There are many Patreons that are used to fund writing, or a bunch of other endeavors not strictly related to "making a game".

IMO, Patreon is exactly what it sounds like: being a patron for someone, financially, because you think given the time and money, that person is capable of producing work that you find interesting.

Personally, I think it should be disclosed -- but not prohibited -- by journalists writing about people they have backed on Patreon.  The nature of Patreon is that backing someone is implicitly supporting them *as a person*, vs something like Kickstarter where the argument for backing something *as a product* is much stronger. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So while I generally agree with your sentiment, I also think there are very real effects that Twitter and other social media have had on the transmission of things like GamerGate.

In 1992, or even in 2007 to a lesser degree, your average person who is angry had a harder time finding like-minded people online.  

That said, I really do think that "feminism", being socially progressive, and criticism of games as a cultural artifacts, and a general misunderstanding -- purposeful or not -- of what those things actually mean are resulting in GamerGate.

It's obviously not about "ethics", as ethics is not some sort sort of binary achievement that a person, or publication, has or does not have.  

It's part of the same mindset that the recent catcalling Youtube video has garnered. It's proponents, many of whom would probably support GamerGate in principle, lead to interviews like this: www.buzzfeed.com/adamdavis/this-guy-mansplained-catcalling-on-cnn-and-got-totally-shut

But the key thing for me is that with today's social networks and the unique way that Twitter acts as both soapbox, megaphone and mailbox at the same time, along with articles like the above buzzfeed piece, a culture of  escalation of outrage is only prevalent, but also encouraged.  

Outrage has become the currency of the internet.  So it's not terribly surprisingly for me -- though disappointing -- that GamerGate is not focused on ethics, but outrage. </TEXT>

http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-02-digital-foundry-hands-on-with-halo-the-master-chief-collection

 The Master Chief Collection is in the house - the single-player elements final, with multiplayer and co-op currently being fixed up via that forthcoming 20GB Day One patch. With embargoes firmly in place and the multiplayer modes still being polished off as we write, what we can tell you about this fascinating package is limited but enlightening nonetheless.

Eurogamer's wording is a little vague on whether or not multiplayer at all was available to try, or if its just problematic, with the day 1 patch fixing it up.

Either way, yes, it looks like prior to the 20gb Day 1 patch, the multiplayer aspect of Halo:MCC will not be representative of the final product. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sadly, my gaming PC is in the office and not next to the couch where I do most of my gaming these days -- so most of my gaming is console gaming.

Anyway, I'm sure there is a difference with Titanfall at 1440p. I'm not going to tell you that there isn't.  But I don't care as much as you do.  I don't think my experience with Titanfall would have been significantly improved with higher res or framerate.  

But if you care, more power to you.  

I'm just saying that I don't, but if all other things are equal, then naturally I spring for the higher res/framerate (the PS4 version in most cases where cross-platform games arent equal) because why wouldn't I. </TEXT>

I'm not going to sugarcoat it: I own both the Xbox One and the PS4, and I own precisely two games for the Xbox One: Ryze and Titanfall.  Everything else -- Destiny, AssCreed, Diablo 3:UEE, Mordor, and more -- I've gotten for the PS4. 

Mostly because even if I don't care about resolution, if games are the same price, why not opt for the higher res/higher framerate version?

So I'm super happy that Sunset Overdrive will, at least for a time, allow my Xbox One to become a game console again.  And not just a super expensive Netflix and Youtube box for my TV. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's not a tactic unique to GamerGate.  I've seen it for a long, long time from all kinda of people for all kinds of causes.  And it irks the hell out of me every time I see it.

If you want to boycott something, just do it.  Don't visit the site.  Don't read the site's content.

Using archive.today or the like to "get the content" while not "rewarding the site" is intellectually dishonest at best.  It's saying you disagree with the site enough to want to boycott it, but are curious enough about its content to warrant reading.  It's saying you HATE clickbait articles, but will still "click" them via archive.today to read the content.

This is like me saying I'm going to boycott Modern Warfare 2 and then going out and downloading a pirated copy.

If you say you are boycotting something, then mean it. </TEXT>

Similarly, I played Fire Emblem the same way.  Not having a perfect battle and losing a character meant *losing* that character.

On the a different spectrum, SimCity and games like that dealth with failure my making me play better next time.  Sandbox games like that means I learn, over time through multiple sessions, what things work the best.

In fact, some of the best times I've had in sandbox games are when I make a mistake and have to recover from it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, perhaps games being interactive is that distinction, or perhaps it isn't.  The fact is there's been precious few articles or even talk on most gaming boards about this.

Personally, I think this discussion about the purpose of reviews -- and how that purpose informs how a review is written -- is much more constructive than simply calling for the boycotting of any site writing a review you don't like. (I'm not saying you did it, but it's hard to deny that the sentiment exists).

One can, truthfully, say that don't want the critic's experience in a review, but rather wants what the critic think's the consumer's experience woud be.  That's fine.  That's a stance a reviewer on a site can write towards.

One can, also, truthfully say that want an experiential review, one where they want to hear about the critic's reaction to the game first hand, without any consideration for how readers might play that game.  That's also fine.  That's the model many film reviews follow.

I think the problem, then, comes from expecting sites to all follow the first model.  You can disagree with the site -- god knows I disagree with plenty of reviews everywhere in any medium (games, movies, books).  I've watched/read (and liked!) my share of critically panned films and novels.

That's why it's so bewildering to me when peopel get so mad at a review, so enraged that they start attacking the site.  

Reviews are not a value judgement on the people buying that game.  I feel just as good buying Destiny as I do buying Mordor.  I feel just as good watching (and liking!) the latest Transformers movie as I do when watching the much better reviewed Guardians of the Galaxy.

Anyway, I think that tension between game as product and game as experience is an immensely interesting one, and one I'd love to hear and read more about in various places.  I think it marks the beginnings of a real shift in how we see games -- not as merely products to spend time with, but actual cultural forces that critics (and players) can discus and talk about in the same way I discuss and talk about films and movies with friends.

Obviously, some won't want or like that shift, that's that perfectly fine.  The discussion about that shift is more interesting to me than whether or not one supports the shift. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Gies' review of Bayonetta 2 are his own -- he doesn't, and I'd argue shouldn't, be letting any one else's opinion of the game color his own opinions of the game.

But I think you actually touch on something interesting: should review's treat games as a product or as art?

Traditionally, games press has approached games as a product -- how are the graphics, how are the mechanics, does this games do what the game devs say that it would do.

But if you look at film reviews or book reviews or other reviews of artistic works, the majority (maybe vast majority) of them are *experiential* reviews.  Meaning, the critic's review is purely about the critic's experiences while watching/reading the item in question.  In many ways, the fundamental focus of a film review is not on the film watcher, but on the reaction of the film critic.

I think there's tension (and probably unavoidable tension) as some game sites (I'd argue many game sites) are in the process of transiting from a primary product-driven game review to one that is more akin to the experiential reviews common in the film industry.

Whether or not you like that type of review is, of course, your choice.  There are (and will still be I imagine) outlets that put out that kind of review.

Anyway, it's interesting to think about.  Partly it's interesting because I think when a lot of people say they want "objective reviews" it's not because they think reviews can be truly objective, it's because they don't have the vocabulary to really express what they want, and so fall back onto "objective".

What they really want is a product focused review of the game, as it pertains to the functioning of that product according to developer promises.

I think there's room in the world for both, but I also think that the best way to have both is to not get mad at outlets that try for a more film-esque experiential review.   

If you don't like a review, move on, and read a different one.

(And before an argument is made that Metacritic should separate out different "types" of reviews, it should be noted that neither Metacritic nor Rotten Tomatoes separate out different types of movie reviews from the major pubs) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's also important to note that many games press outlets differ site to site for how they see ethics and where/what ethical behavior is. Some sites disclose in every review how the game was obtained, some note.  Some sites take free travel because they think it's fine, some don't.

Trying to paint a broad brush that "all" gaming sites must follow these rules as some kind of unbreakable law is silly and totally ignorant of the way any journalism industry works.

One correction:

 The calls for bullying from game journalists listed above have been most unacceptable and immature indeed... But what do they have to do with Anil? 

Sam Biddle and Erin Ryan are journlists, but not *game journalists*.  Valleywag is a site dedicated to rumors and other similar news for Silicon Valley and tech companies.

Jezebel labels itself as "celebrity, sex and fashion for women."

GamerGate has literally been spending the last two days putting themselves into a frenzy because two non-gaming journalists said something they didn't like (admittedly, Biddle's tweet was kinda stupid).

A movement for ethics in games journalism, indeed. </TEXT>

That time commitment context really helps me judge what someone with 40 hours in a game says vs someone with 4 hours into a game says vs what someone with 180 hours in a game says.

It's not simply a matter of more hours = more trustworthy, as due to self-selection, players with more hours will like the game more.  It's more information that lets me frame the written review properly in my head. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Polygon describes their scores this way:

 Sevens are good games that may even have some great parts, but they also have some big "buts." They often don't do much with their concepts, or they have interesting concepts but don't do much with their mechanics. They can be recommended with several caveats.

 Eights are great games, and easily recommendable with caveats in mind. They're examples of consistently sound design, or a novel concept well-developed around a functional core. A game that executes well enough to be remembered, even if there are better contemporaries.

Personally, I think the text of the review makes it clear that while Arthur had a big problem with the sexualization, he also enjoyed the rest of the game.

Hence a 7.5 that falls between those two quoted descriptions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This self post brought you by finally getting 100 relic iron.  And the self loathing that comes from looking at the clock, realizing it is 1am on a Sunday, and that at least part of your Saturday night was spent repeatedly running into dark rooms that are usually empty.

I hate doing chest runs.  I'm not entirely sure why it bothers me so much.  But it does.  It feels like it takes the accepted grinding of Destiny to a whole new level.

EDIT: I KNOW WHY.  THIS IS WHY

 My problem is that chest runs are one of the only "grinds" in Destiny that do not organically follow from Bungie's prized 30 second combat loop.

 In fact, combat is almost antithetical to chest runs, because it wastes time between opening more chests.

 If enemies would occasional drop materials relevant to the locale, then materials gathering would actually feel like it's part of the game, an organic consequence of combat.

ORIGINAL:

But the worst part?

If you dedicate 6 hours to gathering materials, you dont' have to do more chest runs for weeks and weeks. 

That's stupid.  Why is it even in the game, at that point?  It's not even a useful grind, or a required grind.  It's just a stupid, inconsequential, easy to surpass gateway that requires me to dedicate time that could been spent on other more useful, more challenger, and more demanding grinds.

I hate you, chest runs. I hate you so much.

EDIT: more than loot changes, more than nerfing auto rifles, more than letting me shoot weapons in the Tower so I can finally pump some shotgun shells into the Cryptarch's face, I wish **enemies would occasionally drop materials**.  That's all I ask.  

Make material collection a natural extension of that vaunted 30 second loop.  </TEXT>

I didn't understand him as a character.  I didn't get his motivations, or how he kept his internal moral compass consistent.  And as a result, the narrative never really grabbed me.  

I finished the game, but only out of a sense of duty to finish something that I started.

Granted, some of the gameplay mechanics had promise. And there was some quite timely depictions of a surveillance state, and what that means for the public.  Unfortunately, none of that ever gets explored all that deeply. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Note: I'm around level 150 Paragon on console, and around 300 Paragon on PC.

Some classes are just outright better feeling with the console controller: Demon Hunter, Crusader, Monk, Barbarian.  There's  just a special kind of physicality being in direct control of a character gives you.

Target/AOE spell casting fare a little worse.  Abilities that you that you used to be able to pinpoint target on the PC (ie, with most Wizard AOE abilities, Crusader targeted abilities) are now autotargeted on an enemy.  

That isn't super important most of the time, but can get annoying when it autolocks on the wrong monster, or when you can't tactically position a spell in a specific location.

FWIW, even with minor drawbacks in targeted spells, I still find it hard to go back to PC mouse based movement and attacking.  That method of controlling just feels so distant now.  Making me feel like I'm controlling a robot drone rather than a character that's supposed to be me.

Other than controls, there are certain UI enhancements made to the console version that I wish carried over to the PC.  The console version gives you a nice red/green arrow based instant compare between items, and also the ability to mark items as junk means you can sell or salvage all of your junk at once.  

The console also gets rid of inventory management -- now items just auto add themselves to categories in your inventory.  Same with your stash.  Gems, weapons, etc all get autosorted into stash categories. </TEXT>

His racism, however personal, however private, casts a *very* long shadow when he's the owner of a team in a professional sports league with a sizable African American player base.

His free speech rights were, also, not violated at any point.

I give Josh the benefit of the doubt for his original reasons for tweeting his position (that media sensationalism can many times do more harm than good), but this specific case is a dumb example to make the point.

	<TEXT> FWIW, we did look at Snap.  But Snap itself doesn't help you create the line art in any way, and the things it does do -- let you easily create SVG objects and group/animate them -- was way overkill for the two specific properties we wanted to change.

Ultimately, in this case, Snap would have been a superfluous 70kb of minimized JavaScript.  

Snap would not have:

1. Made SVG creation easier in this case.  In fact, it would have taken longer due to the line art.

2. Made SVG manipulation any easier -- all of our effects were applied wholesale to any path elements inside the SVG.  

It *would* have:

1. Helped animate the two properties we wanted to animate.

A short 15 line JavaScript snippet would also have done the same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yes, sorry, good point.

though i had to use a bit of hackery to submit it again -- reddit ignores everything after the hash in urls, so every single iwata asks interview url 
is considered to be the same :|

Ie:

http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/a-link-between-worlds/0/0

is seen as

http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/

which is why i did

	<TITLE> A new Dota patch has a player mode called 'coaching', which makes someone an invisible 6th member of a team that can draw lines onto the screen, ping maps, and more. This would be great for me in LoL to introduce friends to the game! </TITLE>

The specifics from the patch notes:

- Anyone in a matchmaking party can specify that they'd like to coach the party instead of play. In lobbies, players can choose to coach a team instead of play or spectate. Coaches cannot be used in Team Matchmaking, or Tournament lobbies.

- Increased maximum matchmaking party size to 6, to allow a coach to teach an entire team of students (but you can't Find Match if you have 6 players with no coach)

- Coaches are able to use in-player perspective views and broadcaster tools like line drawing to teach their students. They are able to ping on the ground, the minimap, and anywhere in the HUD itself.

- Coaches are considered to be on the same team as their students, so they cannot see anything in the game that their students can't see.

- Coaches and students have private voice and text communication channels.

- Coaches can hit their 'Hero Select' key to cycle through their students.

- Coaches see spectator-style item purchase popups for their students.

- In-perspective player view now shows the correct state of more HUD elements (Shop Quickbuy, KDA/Last Hits/Denies, Buyback). These improvements apply the the in-perspective view in live games and replays, as well as coaches.

I think donating to a charity or maybe some local school/kids group after launch would be pretty neat, though. </TEXT>
