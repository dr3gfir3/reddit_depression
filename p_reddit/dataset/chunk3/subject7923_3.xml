	<TEXT> /u/CelestialRose, it looks like a crazy amount, but the cake part itself is actually pretty fool proof. Macarons are finicky if you're not used to making them. BUT, you can decorate with whatever and it'll still be delicious! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, there are 5 main components for the cake, including the macarons (green tea sponge, whipped cream frosting, green tea glaze, green tea macaron shells, strawberry curd filling). The optimal timeline is probably: make the cake and whipped cream and assemble and chill. Make mirror glaze and cool to RT. While that's cooling, make the macarons.  
**1. Matcha Sponge :** [makes 1 jelly roll sheet]  
112g cake flour  
1 tsp baking powder   
16 g matcha powder  
1/4 tsp salt  
5 large eggs, separated  
156 g granulated sugar  
60 g whole milk  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven at 400F. Line baking sheet with parchment paper or silpat.  
2. Whisk together sifted flour, baking powder, green tea and salt.  
3. In a different, large bowl, whisk egg yolks, sugar, and milk until pale.  
4. Separately, whisk egg whites until medium stiff peaks (if you whisk too stiff, it's harder to incorporate).  
5. Add dry mixture to wet mixture and fold together. Then slowly fold in the medium stiff egg whites.  
6. Pour batter onto the baking sheet and then rap the sheet down a few times to release any big air bubbles.  
7. Bake for 9 minutes (a toothpick should go in and out cleanly).  
8. Using a knife or something thin, move along the edge of the pan and cake. Remove cake from pan and silpat and let cool on a baking rack.  
 nbsp;  
Note: I'm guesstimating on amounts for the whipped cream frosting. To make it stabilized, just make a corn starch paste first and add enough to make the whipped cream firm. Also sugar can always be adjusted based on your sweetness preferences.    
 nbsp;  
**2. Stabilized Whipped Cream Frosting:**  
350 g heavy whipping cream  
10 g powdered sugar  
10 g powdered sugar    
10 g corn starch  
some strawberries, not wet and sliced
 nbsp;  
1. Whenever whipping your own cream, make sure the first thing you do is throw your bowl and whisk attachment into the fridge or freezer. Cold is your best friend.  
2. First make your corn starch paste. Add corn starch, one 10g of powdered sugar, and about 100 g of cream and stir in a pot.  
3. Heat over medium, stirring constantly. When it becomes paste-like (you will see a drastic change in the consistency from liquidy to custard like), take the pan off the heat and continue to mix until smooth. Make sure it cools down to room temp (throw in freezer if need be).    
3. Take out chilled bowl and whisk and add the second powdered sugar and remainder of the cream. Whisk until soft peaks.  
4. Whisking at a fast speed, add in the paste (make sure it's not hot!), a bit at a time.  
5. Whisk until stiff peaks.  
6. Remove about 1/3 of the whipped cream and save that for the outside of the cake.  
7. With the remaining 2/3, fold in the strawberries. You could also use whatever other fruit you like. Purees should work too, but just be careful of how much you add to not deflate the whipping cream (I usually make extra whipping cream if I know I'm adding a puree).  
 nbsp;  
**3. Matcha Mirror Glaze:**  
100 g white chocolate  
35 g condensed milk  
50 g sugar  
61.25 g corn syrup  
25 ml water  
4 g gelatin (+ about 15 ml water to bloom)  
3 g matcha powder  
 nbsp;  
1. Mix gelatin in water until you get an apple sauce consistency. 
2. In a small pot add corn syrup, water, matcha powder, and sugar and bring to a boil.  
3. Add in gelatin and condensed milk. Whisk until gelatin fully dissolved.  
4. In a bowl with the chocolate, add the liquid mixture and whisk until chocolate is fully melted. If you have a hand blender, I highly recommend that you use it to blend the chocolate. 
5. Add desired food coloring.  
6. Bring the glaze to room temperature or slightly colder. (You can cover it with cling wrap and throw it in the fridge, but be careful. You don't want it to solidify, but don't want to melt the whipped cream frosting either.)    
 nbsp;  
**4. Matcha Macaron Shells:**   
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
40 g powdered sugar  
2 g matcha powder    
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar, matcha, and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks.  
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already. Make sure you set aside some of the batter if you plan to make faces.    
 nbsp;  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
 nbsp;  
Add black/ other food coloring to the batter you set aside and fold until the right consistency and put into a bag. (I have tiny piping tips, but if you don't, a sandwich bag with the very very end cut off would work well too.)  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times. Pipe on derpy faces onto the shells. You could also probably use a toothpick if you're gentle enough.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
**5. Strawberry Curd:**   
5 - 8 strawberries, pureed (you can sieve if you want)         
16 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (sometimes less, depending on how thick you make the custard)  
 nbsp;  
1. Add puree to a pot. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar, sifted corn starch, and lemon juice. Get it so it's not lumpy.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up puree onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the pot and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste.  
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time.  
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.    
 nbsp;  
**Assembly:**  
1. Slice off a small piece for topping decoration. Slice cake into thirds. Remove any obvious crumbs.  
2. Smooth out a layer of strawberry whipped cream between the cake.  
3. Use the normal whipped cream to surround the cake. I go slowly to not get crumbs showing. You can add a small amount then throw it in the fridge. Then add the final amount to cover any crumbs.  
4. Once finished frosting, chill the cake in the fridge or freezer.  
5. When mirror glaze if room temp and the cake is cool, add it over the top, with only small amounts so you can get some nice drips.  
6. Assemble macarons.  
7. Make the top look pretty by adding sliced strawberries, macarons, cake fragments (from that small piece you cut off before you sliced it into thirds), and strawberry curd.  
 nbsp;  
Enjoy!

	<TEXT> /u/elevenvt,  
So this was my first time 1. making pistachio macarons and 2. using a buttercream as a filling (I usually prefer curds, as most of the macarons I make are fruit flavored).  
My swiss meringue buttercream is not a normal one because I initially tried making the buttercream from [Sweet and Savory by Shinee] (http://www.sweetandsavorybyshinee.com/pistachio-macarons/), but it was too sweet and too runny, so I made some swiss meringue and incorporated that in. And for the shells, I saw pistachio macaron recipes online were all Italian method, but the ratio of pistachio flour to almond was roughly 1:2, so I followed that for the French method recipe I use.  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
30 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
16 g pistachio flour (grind up pistachios, sift)
41.66 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. If you want food coloring, add it at the soft peaks stage.  
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times. 
5. Add larger chunks of pistachios on top.   
6. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
7. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Pistachio sort of Swiss Meringue Buttercream  
32.5 g sugar  
15 ml water  
1 egg yolk  
27.5 g butter (softened)  
10-20 g pistachio paste (grind up pistachios and add a bit of water)  
1 egg white  
32.5 g sugar   
 nbsp;    
1. Dissolve one amount of sugar and water in a small saucepan and bring up to 250F to make a syrup.  
2. While heating up syrup, beat egg yolk.  
3. When syrup is ready, slowly pour into bowl while mixing at medium speed until temp drops to 100ishF (smooth and white mixture).  
4. Add the butter, a bit at a time. Then add pistachio paste and food coloring.  
5. Make meringue by putting egg white and second amount of sugar in a bowl and mixing until incorporated.  
6. Put bowl over boiling water and mix until mixture reaches 120F (sugar dissolved), then take off and finish mixing until stiff peaks.  
7. Add meringue, a bit at a time, to the pistachio cream until you get a stiffer filling. I ended up using about 1/4 of the meringue.  
8. Pipe on filling and assemble macarons.  
9. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!  
Gluck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ooo, I've recently seen a few videos mentioning those buttercreams but have never tried them (at least I don't think?). I think I'll give it a shot.  
And cooling is probably a good idea. I am usually in a hurry so I only let it chill a short amount of time in the fridge before adding the glaze. Never actually put it in the freezer though (smart!.. a bit disappointed I didn't think to do that on my own :p)  
Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone,  
I have recently been trying to get into making cakes, but I am horrible at making buttercreams. Also, I can't seem to overcome their sweetness. So I've been using whipped cream frostings instead. The issue has been that when I pour mirror glaze over my cakes, the obvious happens and the frosting melts.  
I have two questions:  
 nbsp;  
1. What do you use in lieu of buttercreams if you want to top your cake with glazes?  
2. Do you know of any buttercream recipe that is not overwhelmingly sweet?  
 nbsp;  
Many thanks!

	<TEXT> /u/Masculine_Apricot,  
 I'm copying and pasting the recipe I posted [previously](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/5as6dh/homemade_dragonfruit_macarons/). The shells are adapted from Macarons by Natalie and the curd was from a Macaronguy.  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
41.66 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. If you want food coloring, add it at the soft peaks stage. For these dual color ones, I didn't add it until later.    
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
 nbsp;  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.   
 nbsp;  
For dual color, I incorporated dry ingredients with meringue gently, then separated the mixture into two. Added food coloring to one half. Fold both batters to the right consistency and put into separate piping bags without tips. Then put both piping bags into a piping bag with a tip, so when you squeeze, you're squeezing both bags into the tip. Here's a [Honey and Butter video](https://www.instagram.com/p/BNlEFymFxy-/) from earlier this month showing what I mean.   
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.

Star Fruit Curd  
3/4 star fruit (that way you can use the other 1/4 in your picture :D      
16 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (sometimes less, depending on how thick your )  
 nbsp;  
1. Puree and strain. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar and sifted corn starch. I also just add the lemon juice, so that I can make a nice non-lumpy mixture.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up juice onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the pot and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste.  
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time.  
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.    
6. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness! The flavor tasted much better after resting as well.  
Gluck! </TEXT>
