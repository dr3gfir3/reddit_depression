	<TEXT> Yes and no. A lower court will almost always defer to precedent from a higher court because that is the highest say in terms of the law in that jurisdiction. Now, if a lower court wants a different outcome but feels bound by precedent, they can write an opinion basically stating that. This will go to appeal and when you get to a court that has an equivalent or higher precedential authority, you can get the law changed. However, a lower court judge going against higher court precedent without sufficient justification will probably get struck down. There's a lot of deference given both ways, from higher to lower in terms of facts and from lower to higher in terms of law. 

Anyway, if the 10th Circuit doesn't agree with a Supreme Court opinion, they can always make a ruling that goes against it. But they'll probably get struck down, depending on who is on the higher court bench. However, this can work to effectuate changes in the law or to point out that the precedent doesn't achieve its intended goal (for example with something like "separate but equal" originally being declared constitutional but subsequently struck down). 

So for the most part, they're bound by precedent (especially at the trial level). But there are cases where they can go against precedent and depending on the case, their ruling might stick. However, what's more likely is they'll write an opinion strongly suggesting that the law needs to be revisited while ruling with the precedent to enable a justifiable appeal. Circuit Courts tend to have more leeway to affect changes in the law than other courts (excluding the highest state court or the Supreme Court).  

Edit: Also worth mentioning that decisions outside your jurisdiction are persuasive, not binding, so the court isn't obligated to follow them. Also, if it matters, I'm a lawyer and practice constitutional law among other things.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lawyer hired by the family of Sergei Magnitsky, a Russian whistleblower who died in jail, has been injured in a fall from his Moscow apartment.

Nikolai Gorokhov, 53, reportedly plunged from his-fourth floor apartment Tuesday as a crane was lifting a large bathtub into his home. He is now in hospital with serious head injuries, according to a statement from William Browder, Magnitskys former employer at the Hermitage Capital Management firm.

Gorokhov was due to represent Magnitskys mother Wednesday in a Moscow court and is a witness in a U.S. money laundering case.

Either there's a long string of *really* unfortunate coincidences or some highly shady shit is going down.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For context:

Manafort was a top adviser to Yanukovych from 2004 to 2014. **Ukrainian authorities have said Yanukovych created the conditions that led to the security forces opening fire. Ukraine's interior ministerissued a warrant for his arrestshortly after the uprising.** He fled to Russia and was granted asylum.

Manafort has not been linked to thekillings.

Well, until now when his daughters' text messages drew a straight line. 

Manafort, a Republican operative who had advised authoritarian leaders like the Democratic Republic of Congo'sMobutu Sese Seko and the Philippines' Ferdinand Marcos, is credited with revamping Yanukovych's image and helping him win the presidency in 2010.

**Manafort continued advising Yanukovych until he was ousted amid the Euromaidan protests and forced to flee to Russia, where he is now living under the Kremlin's protection.** Manafort resurrected the Party of Regionsin late 2014, rebranding it as the Opposition Bloc and expanding it to include parties that were opposed to the protests and, later, to the new pro-EU president Petro Poroshenko.

 Edit: Further context. 

**On February 20, 2014, Ukrainian riot police opened fire on thousands of demonstrators who had gathered in central Kiev.** They were protesting President Viktor Yanukovych's last-minute decision to back out of a deal with the European Unionthat would have distanced Ukraine from Russia and fostered closer ties with the West.

A human-rights lawyer representing the victims of the mass police shootings,Eugenia Zakrevska, now wants to knowwho was advising or influencingYanukovychwhen he ordered Ukrainian security forces to crush the protests with force.

	<TEXT> Saw it over the weekend and I was pleasantly surprised. I didn't especially like Emma Watson's singing style, where she didn't hold notes as long as the original, but her performance overall was great, she has a good voice, the movie was well made, and the performances were all solid. My only other complaint is that if was a little long...ten minutes shorter and it would have been ideal. 

Anyway, I'm not really the demographic but I went into it open and walked away happy I saw it. I think the animated version is still better, but it's a good, highly faithful adaptation.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which is great and I'm all for that. But he's not some leftist part of the party, he's his own thing. The party has its own far left elements. I honestly believe that Sanders should make his own party. He'd have the support. 

But he *chose* to use the framework of the Democrats party. Then he *chose* to abandon it once the party voters overwhelmingly didn't vote for him in the primary. And he continually bleeds support for the party while chastising it. Which, of course, means that Dems don't get votes. Which means that the policies he wants passed don't get passed. Because he's operating outside the party again and positioning himself against them. 

So what fucking point are his rallies and support if he has no party/candidates of his own and holds hostage support for the party to which he's more closely affiliated? Republicans don't want what he's selling, aside from the fracturing of the Dems. And Dems are still wary of him because, again, he's not a Democrat. 

I get that people hate incrementalism and it's fair to have a more direct policy agenda. That's an honest criticism of the party. But Sanders is doing fuck all to aid his agenda. 

For example, with the West Virginia stunt, he's not currently running for office and they aren't his constituents. They don't even have an election right now and there aren't any candidates on the table for 2018. So what the hell is he doing there? Telling his supporters in coal country how much the administration sucks? They already know that, they're his supporters. He's not announcing a new party, he's just saying Republicare blows. He's got an idea with Medicare for All and its currently in a House committee, but he's not going out and talking about the specifics of that bill. Same thing with the debate against Ted Cruz. What did that accomplish? What new thing did we get from that? Did that magically create new legislation or the formation of a new party/ideology? Or was it two people who lost their primaries talking issues that they have no political power to shape. 

Seriously, for the sake of America, Sanders has to fucking decide to actually win and have a real plan for what he's going to do then stick to it. Or else the left will keep fracturing and losing elections and the right wing fascism of the GOP will continue tanking this country. You can't do shit if you keep losing because of principle.  </TEXT>
