	<TEXT> Well, I was never able to find out . but in general I am not very social person. however after starting the psych therapy I figured out that my problem was always that I am not really connected to my self ( as in I look to my self as if someone else) so i really never cared about my self. any how I am trying to change this and yes just recently I am trying to go to parties and bars and so, yet I don't have much of friends. </TEXT>
