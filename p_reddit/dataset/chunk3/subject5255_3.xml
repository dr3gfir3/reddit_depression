	<TEXT> I only had two major problem with the film

[SPOILERS]

I hated the "last dying breath" thing in the film,
it's literally one of Hollywood's worst cliches is someone dying in someone's arms as they say one more last sentence and he goes poof...

And last the "talking instead of shooting" cliche when Krennic sees Jyn and has his gun pointed at her and instead of finishing her off he just stood there and said absolutely pointless stuff, I would have accepted it if he went and said something like "So you're planning to blow off the death star? Count me in, they're taking credit for my creation and I'm gonna destory it"...

Something like that...

Those are my only two problems but overall I freaking love this movie =P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Producers [2005] 50% - Such an underrated movie, it's beautifully shot, the dance   singing sequence we're well executed I don't know why it has a low score but I assume that because people like the original more than this remake. Of course Gene Wilder and Mel Brooks but this was actually pretty good in my opinion.

Paycheck [2003] 27% - it's a dumb movie, but it's so goddamn entertaining. It knows what is wants to be and it goes on with it consistently. This is on par with the Fast and the Furious series for me. The action sequence were filmed practically with real cars and explosions and it looked amazing, it barely has any CGI but when it does it looks great for it's time.

Death Proof 67% - sure it's not that low but for me it deserves atleast a full 70. This is everybody's least favorite quentin tarantino movie and yeah sure there are better ones but I just simply love it.. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I "bought" an I Am Legend Copy, 
but it turns out it's the "Alternate Ending".

I've never seen I am Legend and I'm curious, is it okay to watch this first before the one with the original ending or it doesn't really matter?

I Am Legend is a 2007 film starring Will Smith, Alice Braga, Willow Smith, Dash Mihok and it's directed by Francis Lawrence. 


The synopsis from IMDB says, 

Years after a plague kills most of humanity and transforms the rest into monsters, the sole survivor in New York City struggles valiantly to find a cure. </TEXT>

The Butch storyline wouldn't go as it did because Marsellus will probably focus more on killing/finding Vincent for letting his wife die..

It's clearly just a way to show how hot these actors are and doesn't make it seem realistic. That's my stupid pet peeve... </TEXT>
