	<TEXT> In your assessment of my biking experience, you are correct that I don't have much aside from my childhood. It wasn't necessarily the cushion that drew me to that seat as much as it was the style. The stitching color and curves, along with the fact that the French stitch is a premium automotive stitch gravitated me towards that one. If discomfort ensues, I'll look into your recommendation. Thanks for your feedback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The new parts I bought were the seat, brake/gear cables and tubing, and a new chain because the other one was unsalvageable due to rust and corrosion, new tires and tubes, aside from the brake pads. Other than that all parts were refurbished.

I didn't use a single guide when doing this rebuild, I just used my mechanical and amateur painting experiences to rough my way through it. The guys at my nearby bike shop came in handy whenever I had a question (essentially my consultants). Their eagerness to see the bike helped push me when I felt I needed it, so it's nice to have that rapport.

If you have any specific questions, feel free to PM me. Good luck on your bike! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hah, well Detroit is going through a major cultural shift with the new players downtown. I work for an automotive company and drive a car every day, but inside the downtown/midtown area, bike riding is what everyone does. I'm just now joining the party. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Biking is ridiculous in Detroit. There are racks literally everywhere, and they are full at all times. They are building tons of trails and bike lanes around the city. It's something that should get more attention, but doesn't unfortunately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much for the uplifting words. I came into this project with only some semi-advanced automotive experience and have never attempted work on a bicycle before. I'm glad that someone with experience with bike restoration and repair can compliment me on what I did.

Again, thanks. That means a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The hardest decision was whether to clear coat it or not, but I just couldn't bring myself to potentially ruin the contrast. I have plenty of back-up paint if it comes down to maintenance, at least. Thanks for looking! </TEXT>
