	<TEXT> Cute.

For a second there, I actually read what you said and thought, 'man, this person knows Politico'. And for a full minute, I actually gave two fucks.

The glory is gone. As is the notion Politico is any more or less fulfilling than any other click bait political site. Breitbart may be unconventional in its own right, but whatever. It's a site. I support neither site fully. I support free journalism which means anyone with an idea should be allowed to share it, even if that means breaking molds or having people contest their viewpoints.

So take your exaggerations, pedantic ruses and whatever else you're trying to get out of this discussion and click on over to something else - maybe /r/nottheonion is more your speed since it appears you've mastered irrelevant commentary. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right you are.

One thing I'd like to add is the fact that dreams will vary by definition. For example, I wanted a simple house (got it) paid in full before I'm 50 (almost there), and to own a Bentley GTZ (nowhere close yet). The next person, however, would envision an American dream being somewhat simpler - home, kids, husband, dog. 

Any dream, whether it's Icelandic, Swiss or American, is each person's to *own*. No government can take that from you, unless your dream involves necessary freedoms that are being infringed or taken away completely. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, no, you are incorrect. You are basing this assumption that the liberal youth will all enter politics. You are also loosely assuming that these young people won't grow old, change their ways and suddenly have a moment where they make a sexist comment.

See my point here?

You can't assume the future of politics will be free of sexism or illicit ideologies because, again, it's the future. Power changes people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Umm, that's not how it works.

Old sexist white dudes have kids who have sexist ideologies, too. Their kids have kids, etc...

Your point would have been valid, umm, never. The earth's populace doesn't just stop creating sexist people - changes in belief systems alter sexist beliefs, not a sudden shortage of old white folks (which, consequently, get replaced with younger white dudes with the same mentality). </TEXT>
