	<TEXT> Best thing I've learned about how to move up quickly - take on assignments that are highly likely to fail early in your career. You're young so someone might give you a shot thinking that there isn't much to lose. If it fails, they won't blame you and you will get good experience/exposure. If it succeeds, you will be a rockstar.  </TEXT>
