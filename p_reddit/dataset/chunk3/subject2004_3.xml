	<TEXT> If it's a team that's in need of a scoring guard and a hustle guy I think they'd pull the trigger. Plus we still have the Houston pick to trade if need be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think if they offered Clarkson, Nance and Deng for a pick in that range most teams would bite.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I became a lakers fan mostly because of Kobe, Eddie Jones and Shaquille. I've seen some shit. There's no denying that we've been in a terrible spot for the last few years(Kobe contract...it was bad guys, Moz, Deng, Pringles, Hamburgular, etc)but I really do feel like everything is trending upwards after this year. The last season was very encouraging, even though a lot of people in the sub were beating themselves up as the losses kept coming. But remember, we started 10-10 and finished the season on a great winning streak. Luke was getting his feet wet, Ingram was getting his confidence, everyone was continuing to try and gel.

Along the way a few things became clear. Randle, Russell, Ingram, Zubac and Nance are our most valuable contributors going into next season. That leaves Clarkson as either a 6th man or a valuable piece to a team that we can package with Deng or Moz. There's too many different scenarios to go over as far as the roster goes but it's clear to me that we will hold on to most of the players that I listed above. They all have great potential, with Randle and Nance probably being the closest to their ceiling, which is fine.

The average age of our core is 21.6 years. Extremely young! We have nowhere to go but up. We won 9 more games compared to last year, with a new head coach and a ton of changes in the middle of the year. I honestly think we are 1 piece away from the playoffs. With the continued maturity of our roster and another offseason together, we should win at least an extra 5-6 games next season with no roster changes. If we can get ahold of a couple consistent role players and a primary scoring weapon to help out with Ingram and Russell, we will be pretty dangerous. We don't need Blake Griffin or Chris Paul. Kevin Durant isn't walking through that door. If we keep our pick, that's obviously best case scenario but if we lose it there are still some attractive options at shooting guard or point guard, which are our biggest needs, along with needing some depth at Center.

I think the biggest priorities will be convincing Nick Young to come back on a team friendly deal, trying to get rid of Deng or Moz(hopefully both), and filling in the other holes with experienced vets that won't break the bank. We've got a very realistic shot at the 8th seed next season if we keep our pick and get Monk or Ball. I personally don't think it's gonna happen but it would be nice. But regardless of the pick, we still have a shot and something to look forward too, which we haven't been able to say since 2012. So let's stop arguing with each other and get excited for 2017-2018! Who are some players you'd like us to target in free agency? Who should we draft? Let's talk and get hyped! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's called the meat eater podcast. It's a hunting, fishing and general outdoors podcast but it's VERY informative. Steve the host has a lot of wildlife biologists and wildlife historians on the show so they cover a wide range of topics even if you're not a hunter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I listen to a great podcast and they cover this question about bears and cougars pretty frequently. The reason some predators seem very skittish is because they're opportunists, and they do a cost/benefit analysis when they're coming after prey. It's why babies and old animals always get eaten first. Predators don't WANT a fight unless they absolutely have to. If they're outnumbered or the "prey" is acting all crazy it makes the predator re think it's decision to attack. Any good survival coach will tell you to scream and yell at most bears, and never try to run. If you're in an area with cougars, wear a mask on the back of your head (yes it works), cause those fuckers like to come from behind or above. But generally, just make a lot of noise and you'll scare off most stuff. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I could honestly see Paul going to San Antonio and Blake going to OKC. As far as DeAndre goes, I'm glad he didn't sign with Dallas. They're in much better position for the long run now with the core they've got. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh ok, you're close to Mars Hill then. That used to have a good basketball team back when I played, not sure how it is now but the high school sports were always pretty entertaining if you're looking for something to do. You should also look into field gleaning. It's a good way to get free or cheap produce from the farmers after they've harvested. There's also lots of fiddleheads (edible baby ferns), wild apples, berries in the fall, etc. The hunting is bad ass up there too. I've been wanting to move back for years now, can't stand it down here lol. </TEXT>
