	<TEXT> Your article is full of passion but it's little pessimistic. You don't need so big marketing budget to achieve your goals. If you believe in your skill and have really good idea you may start kickstarter campaign. It will give you money and what is important may give you huge marketing boost. Lot of ppl without money achieve something with help of it. 

Anyway emotional / idealistic part of article is good and I think that there are a lot of devs that spend even more thatn 14h/day in front of monitor ;) </TEXT>

Game is valid and logic is good but, everything else is lacking. Your icon is just gradient. I see that you made few games. I see that you take them to the level of good tutorial and then you leave them, you should put more heart and work into them make something bigger (it doesn't mean complicated, it means polished).

I was nerd with 0 graphics skills so I know that you just don't want to make graphics and keep coding but this link may be helpful to you: http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.com/ Almost everyone today can make graphics applicable to mobile casual games after some praticing and this blog should be your first step. Of course the better way would be finding some with art skill and make something together. </TEXT>
