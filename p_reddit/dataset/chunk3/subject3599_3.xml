	<TEXT> Yeah, no. Audiophile turntables are great but you can get a built-in-Japan '90s 'hi-fi' turntable dirt cheap off CL (under fifty bucks), throw a new twenty buck P-mount cartridge on it, and be light years ahead of anything under $250. No alignment, no tracking force issues, they just work until the belt breaks. $3 belt and you're good to go again. </TEXT>

The notices seem to be triggered based upon what networks the phone sees even if it can't register. I've been in the north of Israel and thanks to atmospheric conditions gotten a "welcome to Egypt" notice followed by a Welcome to Israel then a Welcome to Syria. Did a network scan and sure enough saw two Egyptian networks, the three Israeli, and two Syrian networks pop up. The control channel broadcasts can carry quite a bit farther than the network can be used. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My guess- you aren't activated properly on USCC and perhaps not at all. "Emergency calls only" happens on the GSM side when your sim isn't activated or your carrier has no roaming agreement if not on your home carrier (or you aren't permitted to roam for some reason but that wouldn't be the case here). So either T-Mobile doesn't exist where you are and doesn't roam with the carrier present or the sim isn't active and you can't register at all.

Sprint and USCC work differently; devices on CDMA based networks will find and show signal even if they're not authorized on the network. The message you're getting sounds like what you'd get in the old days if you were roaming in an area where your carrier had no agreement. You'd either get transferred to a "roaming operator" or could register with a credit card to get a PIN you'd enter to make calls that would be billed to your card. If your service isn't properly activated that's exactly what I'd expect because USCC doesn't know who you are. If the new sim doesn't fix the problem and you're not in the T-Mo footprint try taking a drive to where there's native T-Mobile and Sprint service and do the #FIXME# code there. Actually, it might work now with this SIM. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Might try forcing USCC and seeing if their roaming agreements get you somewhere. Fi makes some roaming areas 'look like home' and won't trigger the 5X roaming bug if that's the case. Using the USCC profile I roam on Verizon with 3G without issue in Houston.

Failing that a nuclear option on the 5X if there's indeed CDMA roaming in that area that you can't access due to the bug is to switch to Sprint via dialer code, disable the Fi App, and go enable CDMA roaming. If data doesn't work though you'll need WiFi to get the app back I believe. Disclaimer: it worked for me ONCE.

Might be an issue with the underlying T-mobile phone number (you're assigned phone numbers on T-mo and Sprint) and a SIM replacement may be necessary to fix the problem. If that's so, you'll still keep your Fi phone number. All random guesses however. Hope you get it sorted soon. </TEXT>

What happens when you're on WiFi in airplane mode? Can you receive calls then? Also, when you activated with Fi, did you port your number from another carrier? Was it a new number assigned by Google? A Google Voice number that transferred to Fi? If you ported in, issues with that process might be why you can't receive incoming calls.

	<TEXT> It's unlikely the $10/GB covers the cost of roaming data. This is why Fi reserves the right to limit or terminate someone's service if they roam too frequently or for the majority of the time. Limiting data throughout in this way keeps users from utilizing streaming applications and allows Fi to control the costs of offering roaming data at that price. 

Same reason T-Mobile limits domestic data roaming. It costs and they want to limit losses while still being able to advertise that they offer the service.  </TEXT>

You assert it's a function of the foreign carrier and delineated in the roaming agreement. Then you went into subscriber authorization when roaming and stated that's a function of the APN.

Note that data throughput is not mentioned anywhere in the SLAs, only the ability to attach to the network. 

The foreign network has zero interest in limiting or throttling roaming data. It's a great source of revenue for them. The home carrier does the limiting (if any). AT T does not limit data rates because they charge for roaming data. T-Mobile does until you purchase a high-speed package. That's done at their APN. Fi limits at their APN.  

Also, what Speedtest measures and what is actually received isn't always perfect as you know. 140Kbps is within the margin of error for a 128Kbps link. As for my Fi data rates, all I will say is that they were significantly above what is advertised. I do not know if this was intentional. It was obvious throttling was still in effect, but at a higher rate expected and experienced earlier in the trip. This was consistent for every country I visited.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Registration and denial do not happen at the APN and the APN has no control over whether a mobile is permitted or denied on a network. That occurs at the HSS, which will also contain any geographic and/or subscriber-specific restrictions on roaming.  

The APN can only control whether the subscriber is permitted to attach to a PDN and to which PDNs the subscriber may attach. If the HSS clears you but the APN doesn't, you get voice and text but no data. T-mobile is not a limiting factor on speed insofar as their network likely isn't being used. The backbone between the APN and the foreign network may be a limiting factor but that is not specific to T-mo or Fi. 

Sprint and USCC are irrelevant in this context because they are not used while roaming abroad. Their SIM profiles are inactive.Given that you know so much I see no need to define acronyms for you. </TEXT>

Bandwidth management is a basic function and contrary to what you seem to think is not a function of the roaming agreement. On Fi, T-Mobile, and AT T; no matter where you connect in the world, your data flows back to and from the home APN. This is why you can stream Pandora and other US-centric services when you're abroad but using cellular data. The home APN is what does the throttling of speed, not the foreign carrier. Were that not the case how exactly do you think T-mobile could administer the high-speed roaming data packages they offer?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just got back and did so this last trip. For reasons that don't concern you, I have AT T, T-Mobile, Vodafone UK, and Fi. Even if a local carrier has service, the backhaul to the home APN can be congested and impact data speeds. So results will vary wildly. That said, I never saw T-Mobile exceed ~140Kbps measured while roaming and I chose not to buy a higher speed data pack because Fi never failed.

EDIT:  Also, Fi does have control over their roaming services. They seem to piggyback off T-Mo's agreements, but if they merely mirrored T-Mobile's service they could not exclude countries where T-Mo offers roaming such as Jordan. Fi use their own APN, so they can control data speeds, authentication, etc. </TEXT>
