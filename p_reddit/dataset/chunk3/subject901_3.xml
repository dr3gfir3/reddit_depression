	<TEXT> Raised Catholic and I'm fairly aware of the bible's violence.


2 Samuel 12 is my go to thing to mention. God tortures a new born baby to death for a week after ordering for it's mother to be raped in the street just because god is pissed at the baby's father. 



But for justifying violence in today's world, you're going to have a hard time doing it as a Christian using the Bible. 


Unlike Islam because of how Muhammad came into power. He had a small following and that grew into a band of raiders that grew into an army that did what it pleased for their beliefs. That directly influenced the tone of the Quran and the Hadiths because that's all they really knew or were the biggest parts of their lives. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Peace through extreme violence. Muhammad wasn't some hippie eating mushrooms in the desert but a war leader who established himself by defeating his enemies.


As for the bible, I would agree there is a large presence of violence but unlike the Quran, the Bible doesn't actively say you're justified in acting out more violence. Responding to their claim that Muslims aren't unlike Christians as a nonbeliever myself.


That's the trouble with Islam is that not only do Muslims believe that Muhammad is the perfect man but that the Quran is a timeless document and the Hadiths context clues to the behavior of Muhammad for all time.

	<TEXT>  *radical islam. There's a huge difference.


And what difference is there? 


Have you read the Quran and the Hadiths? Muhammad and his followers did everything Isis and other "radicals" has been doing.


Unlike most of Christianity, Muslims believe that the Quran is the recited literal word of Allah to Muhammad because he is and always will be the perfect example of a man. 



The Quran and the Hadiths are all free online and are well worth the read just to see how others think.

You don't have to like them but you should at least take the time to learn about the viewpoints of others to get a better world view of all the crazies attached to this floating rock with you.


The thread and all of their comments are downvoted to hell for no reason other then the fact people don't like them. Which isn't right because you don't up or down vote based on personal feelings but rather the content. 


Well at least you shouldn't... But giving people the power to downvote those people they disagree with is too much power for some to handle with responsibility.

	<TEXT> That's frame rate not bitrate. Look for "data rate" in windows or bitrate in your media player. 


Higher bitrate is better because the video is clearer, has more color and is smoother. While lowering the bitrate to get a smaller file means that it's going to degrade those qualities. </TEXT>

You can look up the video/audio bitrate in Windows or your media player and see that it's low quality. Can compare that with other groups.

Those other groups go for a balance of quality and size while till using the idea that some people use CD/DVD's to store their movies. Which is why I recommended them instead.

Respecting it is knowing that it can be dangerous if you use it wrongly.


Being afraid is just blind ignorance to not knowing how to use it or what it's for.

Loud pipes are unsafe for everybody around them as well as themselves.


The people who are bitching aren't on the road but in their homes, yards or just out enjoying the day when some douchebag biker comes along and revves their engine like they asshole they are.



It's not selfish to want peace and quiet in your own home or even out in public when you're having a good time. That's only considered selfish to the minority biker who thinks he needs to have people pay attention to himself because he's such an insecure loser that he'll take any attention he can.

	<TEXT> "Common sense" gun control is just a buzz phrase for anti-gun.


The anti-gun crowd will use anything to push their agenda on 300+ million Americans.


You obviously don't need all your guns out but you still should have a gun or two out. And what, if you don't lock them up kids will play with them and kill each other? Ridiculous message when they should be teaching gun safety.


You don't lock up your kid's bikes because kids get hurt and even die every day from bike related injuries. No, you teach them how to be safe on the bike.

The shooter had a shotgun with buckshot so it's extremely lucky that he got within range of the shooter with the pepper spray. 



Makes me also believe the shooter wasn't familiar with guns because he could have just pumped a round into the chamber without reloading fully and taken out the guy coming at him. 


That's a lot of luck involved when seconds matter and the police are only minutes away. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A man traveling across a field encountered a tiger. He fled, the tiger after him. Coming to a precipice, he caught hold of the root of a wild vine and swung himself down over the edge. The tiger sniffed at him from above. Trembling, the man looked down to where, far below, another tiger was waiting to eat him. Only the vine sustained him.



Two mice, one white and one black, little by little started to gnaw away the vine. The man saw a luscious strawberry near him. Grasping the vine with one hand, he plucked the strawberry with the other. How sweet it tasted! </TEXT>
