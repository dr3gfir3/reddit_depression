I  will just cut and paste because it is easier

 If I judge author to be better and therefore more influential to me, and has a conflicting opinion to the OPs post, why is that not relevant?

Your response is to insult and then accuse.

Both seem pretty spot on to me.

And instead of a counter argument you do the sarcastic coward approach.

Post lists a writer saying one thing.

I countered with another writers opinion, and my assertion that he is a far superior writer than the posted one, therefore I am more likely to listen to him.

Perfectly acceptable.

So, you are totally fucking wrong.

Delete your account and fuck off if you can't even understand that.

	<TEXT> Because they are rich, often have access to funding that most of us will only dream about and are unaccountable with what they would with the money they raise.

 If people could actually fathom how much money and other attributes go into film making they'd be astonished and how fucked up it is to make film in a major studio film.

No one has ever tried to fund a major film, yet, but raising money for a film on it has little to do with a studio. You are free to use the money to make a film, then sell it on, making more money for yourself as your fans bleed.

Anyone who does it who is in the position of not needing, I will never watch anything they do. Anyone who contributes to making millionaires even richer for their art - we are not talking about Tarkovsky or Bergman, we are talking about relatively stupid throwaway work - is an idiot.

I wonder if Dredd 2 put up one how many retards would support it?

The world is fucked up. 

And before tries to argue I have heard it all before.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What am I branding now? I was just arguing that ripley as a candidate is darn out impossible on any level.

There is very little to argue for that being the worst. User mentions not liking a type of film, so there could be others in that genre alone worse.

In response to his question I answered him, explaining my opinion briefly.

So I think I am pretty sure what the phrase means  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I agree, if that is the worst movie you have ever seen then I assume you haven't seen enough movies in your life.

It's not even mawkishly bad like shawshank, it isn't good or bad enough to warrant anger, it isn't bad enough for fans of highsmith to get upset over, it's just a non event. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Em, in a way you did, or else your comment was fucking wholly irrelevant to mine. Which means you just tagged onto a post to get karma. 

I pointed out that NGs comment was incorrect for some and gave an example.

You started in about consistent output making a career.

I said that RF only writes when inspired, so does not produce a book every  months. And yet somehow he has a career.

So pick one or be quiet.
