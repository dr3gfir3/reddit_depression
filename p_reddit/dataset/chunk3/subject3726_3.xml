	<TEXT> I get you. If I think of any really good ones I will let you know! I am sceptical though, still suspecting that films we respond to positively on an intellectual level are usually those that reinforce opinions we already had, or at were at least in the process of developing. I connect particularly with Assayas because cultural theory is an interest of mine, and very few films engage with cultural theory as openly as his. A very good and very clever friend of mine thought *Sils Maria* was 'pretentious rot'. 

PS. If *Annie Hall* challenged your youthful romanticism, what on earth did you make of *Husbands And Wives*? Maybe you will have to wait till you're 48 to get in line with that one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmmmm... not sure about your examples as some of them sound like films you *learned* something from, or that opened your eyes to something you hadn't previously considered. A film can teach us something or even alter our perspective slightly without necessarily 'challenging' us - that is presenting us with intellectual material we disagree with, but ultimately persuading us to allow sympathy for an opposing POV. Sounds like *Raising Arizona* is your best example after all. I would love a film to do this for me - probably my original example of *Clouds Of Sils Maria* is the best I can do. It took what is, for me, an intensely frightening and depressing cultural progression, and gave it an upbeat. But I would love for a film to challenge me politically. As a life-long lefty, I would like to see a film that allows me to consider right wing views with sympathy. As a lapsed capitalist maybe you are the one to write the screenplay! Get on it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not OP, but I actually think *The Matrix* is a great example of a film that provides an unambiguous intellectual experience. It's a very rare type of film - both wildly popular and containing a strong intellectual allegory that is universally understood - so much so that it has become a kind of cultural touchstone. If I say in conversation 'Shit - It's just like *The Matrix*!', everyone knows exactly what I'm talking about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I get where OP is coming from - and I'm impressed by the breakdown of audience experience suggested. With the risk of misinterpreting - to give a simple example, a narrative-led film might be most easily discovered in the murder-mystery or thriller genres. A simple TV 'who done it' would be a good example of a purely narrative-led form. Perhaps Hitchcock may be suggested with a film such as *Strangers On A Train*? But in the cinema it's rare to find such a simple example, and most films contain a combination of all the 'types' of audience experience OP is suggesting. It's a question on emphasis.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's the questions that are interesting, and questions don't necessarily need answers.

Yes I very much agree! This is what I think Durkin achieves in *Martha Marcy May Marlene*. He asks a very difficult question and that is all - the ending is inconclusive. 

But in your description of an imagined narrative about American democracy, you suggest a kind of 'catch all' approach, where a spectrum of points of view are included so that a wide audience is engaged. But you then suggest the film has a thesis. Doesn't a thesis require a judgement call? At some point, doesn't the story-teller need to come down (even softly) on one side or the other of an argument? And will this not alienate to some extent the portion of the audience that disagrees? 

Can you think of an example of a film that has changed your mind on an intellectual level - or challenged your beliefs in a constructive way?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I love this question! It's so interesting. 

Personally I love the feeling when I leave the cinema that I've connected with a film on an intellectual level. I do have questions about that experience however. When that happens powerfully, is it not often the case that the intellectual narrative we've enjoyed is probably something that aligns with a narrative we more or less agree with - or with something we were thinking about/ have thought about anyway? Is there a danger that the film has merely been 'preaching to the choir', and what is the worth in this experience? 

I also believe this kind of connection with a film is almost never universal, and individuals in an audience will respond in radically different ways. Maybe the 'levelling' effect we can enjoy by way of an emotional narrative (*everybody* in the audience was crying!) indicates that it is on an emotional level that most human beings are similar - where as intellectuals we inhabit relatively niche little planets!

Anyway, from the perspective of my own niche little planet (!), I have recently felt a deep and quite exhilarating intellectual connection with two films by the french director Olivier Assayas - *Summer Hours* (2008) and *Clouds Of Sils Maria* (2014). Without going into detail, Assayas in these films takes a brave, open and honest look at the fault line between what we might think of as 'old' and 'new' culture. Culturally speaking, technology has changed the world almost beyond recognition in a very short space of time, and for some of us who grew up in the 'old' culture this is pretty terrifying. It is easy for us to fall back into a 'modern life is rubbish' attitude - to assume the 'old' way was better; authentic! Where is authenticity in the age of the internet? Especially in *Clouds Of Sils Maria*, Assayas creates a thrilling meta-narrative in the casting of Juliette Binoche and Kristen Stewart as the leads - surely a decision that raised eyebrows among cineasts the world over! But when you see the film, the casting makes total sense, and you realise that Assayas is a very, *very* clever man. (The 'meta-narrative' effect spins into orgasmic post-modern delirium with the further casting of Chloe Grace Moretz - someone I had not even heard of.) The wonderful thing about these films is that they are *not* bitter - they do not simply damn contemporary culture are wallow in nostalgia for the old ways. They manage to find a way forward - they end with hope for the future, which both surprised and inspired me. At the end of *Sils Maria*, for example, Binoche's character - previously so appalled and dismissive of splintered, pluralist internet culture and of the creative direction popular cinema is taking - is defeated. But in defeat she discovers a re-birth - she simply submits to the new world, she gives in - and you know what? It's OK. Everything is OK. It doesn't matter - give up! This is what I took from the film! It sounds nihilist - but it is far from nihilist. It is  constructive - positive - and beautiful. 

I must put in a word also for Sean Durkin's brilliant *Martha Marcy May Marlene* (2011) which I felt was grappling with an absolutely central contemporary issue of how we live our lives in a secular capitalist society - there was something absolutely vital about this film's intellectual thesis. (Sean - *make another movie please*!).

I guess I'm a sucker for Fellini's theatrical flair with the camera - the way he choreographs action - it's thrilling, and I don't remember getting enough of my Fellini fix in this movie! Also I remember thinking that some of it felt like sketches in preparation for *La Dolce Vita* which Fellini made immediately afterwards. I will revisit it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is such an interesting question. As well as film, I have an interest in theatre, and it's always struck me how differently the two forms work in this respect. *Very* generally speaking, film is good at constructing heroic characters that function as gods in a way (objects we can worship), where theatre is good at exposing would-be heroic characters and demonstrating that all human beings are flawed. So a character like Atticus Finch in *To Kill A Mocking Bird* could only really work on film, where Willy Loman in *Death Of A Salesman* only really works on stage. Having said all that, *most* films sit somewhere in the grey area in between.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry I'm pasting the same reply to another comment! ;

Thanks for your reply. I'm following Michel Roux Snr's recipe for apricot tart from his Pastry book. According to the recipe, the pastry case is unbaked, you fill it with the pastry cream (already cooked - unless this is a variation he fails to mention in the recipe), put the fruit on top and bake the whole thing for 40 minutes. I usually make it with ordinary pastry cream, but to be honest it's pretty hit and miss. Sometimes the fruit produces a lot of juice as it cooks, and this seems to split the pastry cream just a little bit (still delicious - but not the pastry cream of my dreams). The double cream was an experiment, because as much as I adore a fruit tart, I just don't *love* traditional pastry cream. I will not try this again though! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello askculinites. 

So I'm working on pastry cream at the moment and it's very hit and miss. I like the idea of adding whipped double (heavy) cream to pastry cream because.... well I like the idea of adding heavy cream to anything truth be known. My question is - if I add the cream, can I still use the resulting pastry cream mix as a filling for a fruit tart that is then to be baked? I've tried it once and it was a disaster - the filling did not cook and set so much as it rose and boiled over! I guess when you alter the proportions of the pastry cream this might happen? Is the creamy version really only good for filling pre-baked pastry as in eclairs etc? Any thoughts/experience to share? :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! Thanks for your reply. Sorry to be pedantic, but I did mention in my post the 45 minute total time in that recipe, and the covered time is 15-20 minutes! My problem still stands I'm afraid - even 45 minutes on the stove does not cook my chicken. I think it's the chicken I'm using to be honest. That particular recipe I have had success with by braising the chicken in the oven for around an hour after the browning. :-) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello great minds of AskCulinary. 
Recipes that require you to cook chicken pieces on the stove top. 
This never works for me. Often the recipe will say 'cook the chicken for 20 - 25 minutes', but in my experience chicken pieces take *much* longer than that to cook. I'm in the UK here - is it possible we just like our chicken to be well done, where other countries don't mind it rare? I *love* rare meat - but not rare chicken! Or could it be the kind of chicken I'm using? I buy free-range organic chicken from the local farmer's market - often a cockerel because I think they taste better. The legs and thighs of these birds are often dense and can be *large*. Am I answering my own question here....?

Edit: sorry should have been clearer - by chicken pieces I'm talking legs and thighs, not the breasts. 

Further edit: [Example of what I mean](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/chicken-mustard-poulet-la-moutarde/14048/) - OK so when you add the browning time to the cooking time you get 40 - 45 minutes, but even this leaves my chicken nowhere near cooked through! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anderson's *Magnolia*, *The Master*, and *Inherent Vice* certainly question the human condition and search for an authenticity of experience I would associate with existentialist concerns. And if we're being picky I would in return strongly question your assertion that Kiarostami's character's treat life, people, and their surrounding world with care and respect. 

Woody Allen's work I was thinking of would be films like *Crimes And Misdemeanors*, *Another Woman*, and *Husbands And Wives*. Apart from that there are quite a few individual films I would suggest. Farara's *Bad Lieutenant*, Sean Durkin's *Martha Marcy May Marlene*, and Pialat's 1987 film *Sous Le Soleil De Satan*. Perhaps that most challenging film I've seen for years that deeply explores the human condition is Oppenheimer's *The Act Of Killing*.  </TEXT>
