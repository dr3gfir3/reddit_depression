	<TEXT> I'm not usually the type of person who would tell someone to eff off, but I try my best to explain to them that what they're saying isnt ok. Often times it seems like they either dont care to listen or understand. I guess I should try telling them to fuck off next time instead of trying to explain.  </TEXT>

Second: Yes. I am quite aware of how to dress with around teenagers with a body and face like mine. My students and colleagues respect me. 

Finally:  Not a single colleague nor student would DARE say something like that to me.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Being Sexualized </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've run into this issue waaaaay too much. I am a high school math teacher, and I teach seniors (17/18 year olds). I dont mean to sound full of myself, but I've been told that I am attractive. That being said, a ton of people I meet make disgusting jokes about boys staring at my ass and having crushes/sexual fantasies on me. When I retort with an "ew, those are kids you're talking about." They try and laugh it off as if *I'm* supposed to find it funny too OR even go as far as accuse me of not taking a compliment!!? I find it repulsive   pedophilic. I cannot help my appearance, but why do people think its ok to say this to me?? 

Does anyone else have this problem? How do you deal with it??!?


EDIT; everyone is misunderstanding. The people saying this are outside of work. My colleagues, students   their parents respect me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I'm 24 and I teach 17/18 year olds. I get mistaken for a 17/18 year old in my everyday life and even my kids thought I was 22 in the beginning of the year. Dress professionally, act like an adult, talk like an adult, hold yourself with confidence Do what makes you feel like you're an adult is the best way I can put it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So totally normal. You will feel better once you're done grading the finals and grades are in. I have no idea why myself and my younger colleagues get into this brain dead, "i cant do this anymore" type mood when finals come around. Maybe its something you get used to over time? I'm not sure. I had finals early because I taught all Seniors this year, but those last few weeks before graduation and finals this year were so rough. I didnt even want to socialize on the weekends. The end of the year stress is contagious. Once its over, you will feel that relieving smooth glide into the summer:) Its been two weeks since finals for me and i was 100% the second I submitted my grades. I hope the same for you! Stay strong :D  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg yes!!! I only talk to 2 coworkers, who are in my department and are my age, because they're the only two that I have anything to talk to about (besides work)! Since we're on the same page of life right now, chillin with them outside of work is actually fun. 
First and foremost, I'm in an introvert. On top of that, I hate the gossip about other colleagues, I hate the shit talk about students, I get bored listening about their family   drama at home. The only conversations I enjoy with my other coworkers are about cool projects they/ I  am doing, student success stories, or collaborations on how to help problematic students. 
No one has said anything to my face about me being disconnected from the rest of my colleagues, so far so good:)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi!! I am a high school math teacher with self harm scars. When i interview I wear longer sleeves, not because of my scars but because i think its just more professional. I decided a long time ago that I will NOT get rid of my scars. That I will not hide them when I teach (I'm wearing no sleeves today actually, its 80!).  

In my opinion, it is SO important for kids to see them. You never know who needs to. I have had one student confront me about them and I was able to have the "you can get through this, it *does* get better with time and help and effort" conversation. Can you imagine if you had the opportunity when you were a student? I can. It would have been life changing, dont you think?? 3 

So proud of you for getting this far.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Private, not unionized. So roughly translated you're saying that its his responsibility   not mine. If he messes up and doesn't see me, its not my problem. (he can always refer to the math chair for his evaluations, right?) I guess I'll inquire about my contract once the other finals come around (if i dont hear before)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So just let it go and see what happens? They have *already* put themselves in that situation, because Senior Finals are taking place (which means all my classes are over!). If worst comes to worst, he will have to rely on the evaluations made by the math chair. 
I guess I'm most worried about the contract. One teacher has been let go in the math department, so I'm assuming they wont let go two since now there are only 5 left. ugh nerves.

Thank you for the response!!! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Principal Hasn't Observed - Worried. Advice? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I teach all seniors, and it is finals week for them this week.... and my principal still hasn't come to observe me (which also means I didn't get my contract). I have 4 juniors in my first period class and my last lesson with them will be next Monday. After that they will be working on an in class project. Should I tell my principal to come observe me Monday? I'm mostly worried about not knowing about my contract/having a job for next year. (although i'm 99.9% sure I have a job for next year...that 0.1% bothers me). OR should I not say anything because this is his responsibility? 

ps. My math chair said dont say anything, but my nerves are getting the best of me.

Thank you!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 24   I teach seniors. Now, like you I'm not bragging because that's just disgusting, but all these boys have crushes on me. I know 100% because my female students tell me (they think it's a compliment... ew?). In the beginning of the year they'd hit on me, using 'double speak' - you know the shit that can interperted several ways. I gave them my best teacher death stare each time and also made a disgusted face. I still deal with this but it's more rare now. At least they take me seriously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno man. Having a test be worth 40% of a grade is just... odd.... if it was a final,  I guess that would be fine....ish.  Its a very strange way to distribute your grading. How much would a final be worth if you only have 60% left to assign??   </TEXT>
