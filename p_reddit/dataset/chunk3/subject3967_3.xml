However, the folks over at /r/headphones constantly suggest [Shure SE215s](http://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE215-K-Isolating-Earphones-MicroDriver/dp/B004PNZFZ8) and [MEElectronics M6 Pros](http://www.amazon.com/MEElectronics-Universal-Fit-Noise-Isolating-Musicians-Detachable/dp/B00SLVB71Q) for working out.

I have a pair of [RHA M750i IEMs](http://www.amazon.com/RHA-MA750-Isolating-Headphone-Warranty/dp/B00ELAM8LE) that I use outside of the gym that sound excellent, but might be a bit expensive for gym beaters.

	<TEXT> I bought a 1998 Jeep Cherokee (XJ) 3 years ago for $4k. I do all the maintenance and work on it myself. It gets me from point A to point B, as long as the distance isn't road-trip length. My wife has a 2006(?) Mazda 3, which we use for longer drives.

I highly recommend getting a "beater" car, especially if you have a newer, reliable vehicle in the household. That said, you, personally, might lose some peace of mind on your daily commute ("will this break today?"). A beater car requires more energy, time, and patience. You have to really take care to find **and** maintain it.

Side note: I also used the opportunity to learn about cars in general. Which is valuable information if you have the time and energy to learn. So, that's a plus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 30 now, but after I graduated I put all my excess income into an OptionsHouse brokerage account. Low-commision, 100 free trade, etc. Bought some stocks in companies I knew well, with respected leadership, and high growth potential (your method of stock-picking will vary). Cashed it out 5 years later (taxed and all) to pay off the rest of my student loans last year. I didn't feel right having my money in stocks while I had debt lingering, even though I was technically "up" in my brokerage, beating the interest on the loan.

Don't really know if that counts as advice, just my experience.

tl;dr - graduated college w/ debt, took excess income (after retirement, emergency, etc.) and opened brokerage, picked stocks, sold off gains to kill off student loan </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife suffered from the same, paralyzing beginning. She read all the diet books, knew all the strength+conditioning programs, watched all the Youtube clips, followed the right blogs, etc., but it was like trying to drink from the firehose. Her main goal is look athletic and lose fat.

Our approach? Keep it as simple as humanly possible. 

Calculated her daily [caloric limit](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html) and made sure she stayed under. Forget about macros, forget about "low-carb", forget about fasted workouts, blah blah blah... just *stay under your damn number*, simple as that (for now).

Next, we added an *activity* rather than following some kind of 5x5 PPL Strong Fit Cross program. Yes, I know many programs [listed here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/getting_started#wiki_adding_exercise) are quite simple, but if you're not having any fun (or feel like they are too complicated), then *do something you can understand and enjoy doing*. Even if it's basic as hell, like hiking once a week. Consistency is key.

That's all I can offer. I'm no professional or anything, just sharing our experience. Goodluck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with the author that "fat model, skinny controller" is sometimes misinterpreted as "fat ActiveRecord, skinny controller". The word "model" in this context really refers to the entire business-logic layer of an application, which happens to include DB interaction. Sometimes people forget ROR is still Ruby, and disregard SOLID OOP. Keeping objects *within* the model layer small and cohesive is very important, like the author proposes in the example (UserRecord vs User).

Thanks for the share, cheers! </TEXT>

Fix your diet first. Keep it simple: calculate your [TDEE](http://www.fitnessfrog.com/calculators/tdee-calculator.html), then eat below that number.

Once you have diet figured out, add exercise. I'd simplify it even more and just add activities. Hike, jog, go for walks. Ready for something more concrete? I always see [SL5x5](http://stronglifts.com/5x5/) recommended. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> RHA M750s. Just got these 2 weeks ago. Crystal-clear midrange (piano and vocals sound fucking gorgeous) without overwhelming, muddy bass. Very good isolation too. I work in an open office, blast my music, and people around me can hardly hear me.

If you're a bass-head, though, these might not fulfill your needs. I sometimes long for earth-shattering bass, and these don't give them to me.

	<TEXT> I just got the M750s as my first set of "good" IEMs, but here's my humble, rookie opinion on them:

They don't provide the bass you might like in some of the harder EDM songs. I occasionally flip between music like Knife Party (electro-house) and music like DJ Okawari (jazz-hiphop). I don't feel like there is enough "head-banging" bass for the electro-house stuff. However, anything with a piano or vocalist sounds abso-*fucking*-lutely beautiful. Crystal clear, every single instrument can be heard.

Like I said, I'm a rookie, but just my $.02. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm quite new to this hobby and I got a pair of nice IEMs last week. I was wondering how to compare them to my old basic earbuds, then realized I really don't know what I'm listening for. 

After searching through some old threads in the sub, I saw that some posters recommended "breaking in" new headphones for a couple of weeks to get your ears used to them, then slip on the old ones to see if you can actually tell a difference.

Does anyone have any type of ritual before they find out whether or not they like their new headphones? A timeline? A set of tracks? Genuinely curious to learn what everybody does to figure out whether they like new headphones or not. </TEXT>

"Most people assume that a lifting belt supports your back. The truth is that a good belt is designed to increase intra-abdominal pressure, which stabilizes your entire midsection."

	<TEXT> **Budget** - Less than $150

**Source** - Motorola Moto X, 2015 MBP, Lenovo Thinkpad x220

**Requirements for Isolation** - Isolation is important. Mostly used on bus, open-layout office, and coffee shop.

**Preferred Type of Headphone** - IEM, but open to closed-back, over-ear.

**Preferred tonal balance** - Balance is important, but if I had to lean one way, I prefer more bass than less.

**Past headphones** - Most "premium" headphones I've ever owned were Bose.

* [AmazonBasics In-Ear Headphones with Microphone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00L3KSP08)
* [Bose SoundTrue Headphones On-Ear Style, Black](http://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundTrue-Headphones-Style-Black/dp/B00IUICOF8)

**Preferred Music** - Mostly ambient, electronic, and hip-hop instrumentals.

* [musicforprogramming.net](http://musicforprogramming.net/?c=thirtytwo)
* [C418 (Minecraft Music)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3_InDEtpLA)
* [Gramatik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vrVuGiKRVDU)

I'm a software engineer, so I like to go heads down on my computer while having music in my ears. I know a lot of my colleagues prefer huge cans to give the "fuck off" signal to others, but that isn't as important to me. I also commute on the bus daily and fly every other month or so. I would like to tune those noises out.

While my budget is $150, I'd like to get the best bang for buck. So, the less expensive, the better. However, I'm not afraid to shell out more for "better" (depending on what you all say)!

**Considering** -

* [MEElectronics M6 PRO](http://www.amazon.com/MEElectronics-Universal-Fit-Noise-Isolating-Musicians-Detachable/dp/B00SLVB71Q)
