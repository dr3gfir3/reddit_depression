	<TEXT> Puerto Rico is weird and confusing and I don't think can easily fit into the racist/xenophobic outcome you're predicting. I'm not from there but I have met PRs in NYC, and generally they felt as entitled to USC as they should. Meaning they aren't part of the group that is being excluded and could disassociate themselves from feelings of xenophobia towards other Latin Americans because of their current territorial status. (Much like Cubans did with Amnesty and their voting patterns.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to talk this down a little bit and speaking from experience of working in immigration, the general consensus is that everyone is in a wait and see/expecting the worst but right now his guidelines haven't amounted to much (outside of the initial mess up of banning LPRs and Visa holders). They've started to filter to lower agencies but enforcement remains a problem, and funding doesn't allow them to be fully implemented. Everyone is cautious but "holy shit!" hasn't happened yet.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Further dividing a fragmented country by releasing ambiguous executive order's to detain LPRs and Visa holders. For one. Logistically the result of that EM was the detention and suspension of rights for LPRs if momentarily. Secondly continuing to suggest Democratic obstructionism is the cause of his inability to manage a well working White House office administration. Whether leaks or his inability to fill out paperwork to complete his appointments. Suggesting that the Democrats are solely to blame for disorder again just serves to entrench peoples opinions and create animosity towards opposition ideology. I'm sure others could name more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like they didn't update the mouseover/popup from their map infographic with the final results for CA. I get that, it just seemed like a more realistic example because Clinton actually tried and failed to go after a safe red state. Whereas Trump maybe made an offhand comment about flipping CA? It's one splinter versus supposed majority rule and having the middle states be ignored. Which is a counterargument I feel that's based on emotion and impossible to contradict.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was curious about this because Texas is very clearly in the same situation wherein if you are Democrat you are going to be completely ignored. Where did you get that 4 million number? [Politico](http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/president) has 3 mil for CA voting for Trump and 3.8 mil in Texas voting for Clinton. The Texas argument is probably better here too because Clinton was mocked for suggesting that Texas could be in play, and yet the margin was only about 800k. I think somehow solving the "swing state" system would allow for moderate candidates that are representative of the general population.  </TEXT>

[A Legend of the Future](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22067547-a-legend-of-the-future) by [Agustin de Rojas](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agust%C3%ADn_de_Rojas)   

Agustin de Rojas is considered Cubas Father of Science Fiction. His works are just now slowly getting translated into English with this one and The Year 200 happening in the last 3 years.

Additionally after the fall of the Soviet Union de Rojas was convinced-- and tried to convince others-- that Castro did not exist. Interesting guy who plays with form and offers up works that often times include self criticism within.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our Constitution also compels individuals to practice a separation of church and state. It's undue burden because the state cannot create such laws that produce an undue burden for its citizenry, much like adapting or changing the law to accommodate one person's belief when there is a reasonable alternative to that solution. Ie just put her somewhere else. It's not persecution if you don't do your job especially when at will employment is essentially a thing. 

The second part you'll have to expand upon. Sharia Law I mean as in the religious belief of adherence to strict Quranic laws. So how would that not fall under free exercise of religion according to your proposition in the first part?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems like undue burden to me? On the one hand (and keeping in mind I'm not as conversant in other protected classes outside of race) it sounds like it would create an unequal standard for marriage wherein another state could recognize the documents as not valid. Though this may have already come up in the Supreme Court. And on the other hand it seems foolish to adopt your laws to the whims of the personal beliefs of your employees who are merely refusing to follow the law/their job. In the extreme example and borrowing from the right here, this would pose problems for fundamentalist Muslims trying to invoke Sharia Law or some incorporate that into their work. It shouldn't become the expectation. If you can't do your job, no one can compel you and you should move on. This isn't an Eichmann scenario.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The GOP should reintroduce Comprehensive Immigration Reform. While this might seem contrary to the current political climate, I think a lot of what happens in Immigration is confusing and can be manipulated based on how you present information. The Border Wall is not popular, and even if it holds 50% support now, a huge tossing of capital at a useless project that will not see a reduction in drug violence or product will turn public opinion of all those but the most fervent. 

The GOP should sell tough on immigration while revamping the system so they can appeal both to the "they broke the law" group and to "the system is broken" group. Promote an increase in BPA, electronic surveillance, and fence improvements. Promote the dramatic decrease in border crossing because of Trump's rhetoric (40% I think), continue to inflate the number of deportations like under Obama but say it's a good thing, and while all that is happening push legislation to reform the system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You keep using empathy as if it should be a thing in our political climate but I think everyone in this thread and subreddit knows that doesn't hold any water. Try arguing from empathy about undocumented immigrants in the United States and you'll get a response of "they broke the law. period." 

Religious beliefs trump political feelings... unless it overrides your ability to do your job. Is generally how I think that sentence ends on both sides. What I'm drawn to is Salmon Chase's opinion on slavery ie No law is just that deprives another man of life, liberty, etc. (paraphrase). I think on both sides to override a law from personal beliefs you'd have to argue with some certainty that you believed it to be completely immoral and damaging to the fabric of humanity as Chase did AND also realize that persecution is going to be expected. 

Again I think this is extremely complicated. Creating a third way of restructuring the law to accommodate one person's beliefs is not a good use of State power. She should've been fired or reassigned where she didn't have that power. (Which is maybe what happened eventually?)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that's where we encounter problems of actual utilization. Clearly Kim Davis was in the wrong by not issuing licenses to same sex couples professionally. But she probably should have been just quickly fired or reassigned instead of it becoming a public spectacle. This is where I think you have the confrontation of what is universally right comes in. 

Christians probably "persecute" the LGBTQ community as much as they are being persecuted in this instance. Because people feel so strongly about it. I don't know what the correct answer is for bakers and photographers here, because truly a member of the LGBTQ community probably won't willingly use someone who they know does not support their choices. (Why would you there's no way to compel them to even do a good job.) But a situation could arise in which they are faced with the only photographer or baker or etc. At that point do you defend the right to discriminate based off a characteristic you disagree with or use the state to compel that person to act against their moral beliefs? There clearly isn't an easy answer. Which is why I think the rhetoric gets so heated and divisive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think part of the problem is a lack of vocabulary to address the issue. Democrats (I assume) believe in systemic oppression of historically marginalized groups. So everyone is in agreement that ideas are considered on their universal merits, but systemic oppression would have to be erased first, including the disproportionate representation of blacks and Hispanics in regards to poverty, imprisonment, participation in governmental institutions like Child Protective Services etc. In my opinion that's why when you are confronted with someone who willfully ignores your argument about a system of oppression, or runs campaigns focused on the scapegoating of cultures, races, genders, or uses pointless catchphrase terms like "political correctness" or "boys will be boys" (a tautology that means nothing btw) you can draw conclusions of racism, sexism, xenophobia. 

I'd also like to point out that that is mostly on the lower level, wherein Clinton ran a campaign that only highlighted Trump's actions and words and implied they might be inappropriate. But I'm not sure she ever described him as such.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  literally ones of eternity for these groups is a big problem.

I think that's the problem. We are dealing with opposing views on what universal rights should be. A defense of marriage / attack on gay marriage is strange because a) state marriage is not religious marriage and therefore is not an attack on Christians. Anything else presupposes that Christians want their view points applied to everyone within the state regardless of belief. Which is why that gets dismissed a lot. Same with  contraception and abortion tbh except contraception begins a conversation over a universal right to healthcare. So then we enter into the contradiction of beliefs, where one group thinks one thing should be/is universal and the other thinks the opposite. 

I don't know that I would call this persecution so much as political and cultural discourse over values and beliefs.  </TEXT>
