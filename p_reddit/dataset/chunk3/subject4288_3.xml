This is illegal. The yellow light exists to allow people to finish maneuvers they have already started or cannot safely abort before allowing traffic to flow in the opposite direction. 

This includes clearing the intersection after having started a left turn. This does not include darting out from behind the stop line to beat the light.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Witcher 3 honestly would have been a better game if they'd gutted a lot of the leveling-based stuff and just made Geralt a more static character in terms of power. More like an Ezio from Assassin's Creed or something where as the game progresses you simply start fighting enemies who require more advanced tactics to beat or allow for less room for error rather than it simply being a question of how good your numbers are compared to theirs.

I don't mind Geralt "feeling" more powerful as the game goes on. I just think he didn't - just that enemies felt less challenging, rather than more, and the enemies 'over-levelled' to you felt invulnerable and 'under-levelled' felt pathetic. 

I feel like some kind of character-building system was probably necessary to motivate the open-world and side-questing, but the level system in the game didn't make sense.

I *hated,* the equipment level-gating, though. That is a trope that needs to just die. It felt so arbitrary. Nothing is more demotivating than grinding to *use the gear you already have* rather than to get new skills or equipment. It makes the entire game feel pointless.

He's already had so much experience at what he does and fought so many powerful foes in the past that it makes very little sense for us to have this progression where he starts out fighting wolves and drowners and has to work his way up to being able to take on a cockatrice or an elemental or whatever.

Kinda, yeah. The gear power level never made sense either - entry-level Skellige items are better than ancient elven swords, elite knight armour, and the equipment Geralt starts the game with. 

It all could have been a lot more gradual and you could have started off much less weak. I dunno if it would have worked as a straight action game with dialogue trees, however. </TEXT>

I don't think this is true at all. FPtP produces more majority governments, which would in principle allow the winning parties to pass their agenda. Obstructionism works in the US because it's common for the three branches of government to be split between parties. 

  An electoral system which made it viable for more than two parties to exist in Congress would probably produce more co-operation (outside of circumstances like the one in Spain). 

I think this is awfully optimistic. It doesn't exactly go smoothly in Greece or India either. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He inherited a budget surplus from Clinton.

This is true. 

Somehow he thought it wouldn't fuck the country up to blow that surplus on tax cuts while trying to pay for two wars out of a depleted budget.

While I don't think the Bush tax cuts were a good idea, they didn't exactly "fuck up the country" either. The debt-to-GDP ratio was [actually fairly stable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_debt_of_the_United_States#/media/File:51129-land-summaryfigure1(1\).png) during the Bush years. 

[In the absence of the financial crisis, they [approximately balanced the budget](http://static2.businessinsider.com/image/50eb25216bb3f7a826000005-960/causesofdeficits.jpg) - which is usually a good thing. It's poor practice to run an actual-dollar surplus, even at the best of times. Given the wars and (especially) the financial crisis, they made a large deficit much worse.

 There's no way to spin the recession as anyone's fault other than Dubya and his terrible wartime economic policies.

This is just plain [false](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causes_of_the_Great_Recession). The financial crisis was caused primarily by depleted regulations and lax regulation enforcement on lending and security trading, and naive consumers over-borrowing on their homes. "Wartime economic policies" had nothing to do with it. The existing deficit didn't even hamper the large stimuli deployed by the Bush and Obama administration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Games undergo an optimization process to ensure they operate reasonably well on a reasonably inexpensive machines. This involves improvements to the code of the game to make it run more efficiently and avoid unnecessary operations, as well as providing the lower-quality textures and various filters that make up the "video settings" menu in the game. 

During this process they typically target a few different common specs that they want to support well - for example, many games are optimized to use about 3GB of VRAM at their highest 1080p settings, since the GTX 780 is an extremely popular card among 1080p gamers (while 4GB and more is usually necessary for 1440p or 4k.) Of course, it is also important to provide a good experience for everybody using a GTX 680, 770, or one of the various R9 AMD cards with 2GB VRAM.

CPU performance is pretty linear - it's not difficult to ensure the game runs on an i7, i5, FX-8XXX, and FX-6XXX and figure out at what point the game stops working. Most games are optimized to run on 8GB of RAM.

	<TEXT> Overclocking a graphics card (or CPU) tells it to run faster by increasing it's [clock speed](http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/C/clock_speed.html). If you increase the clock speed of a part by 15%, it will give you 15% better performance. 

Increasing clock speed isn't really dangerous - it will cause the part to draw more power and create more heat, but graphics drivers nowadays will keep your temperatures under control by reducing the clock speed and increasing the fan speed to prevent the card from overheating. However, you can't just crank up the speed as much as you like, because for various reasons, eventually a card will begin to crash and execute instructions improperly if it is clocked too high. You can squeeze even more overclocking out of a card by improving cooling or increasing the voltages, but higher voltages can shorten the lifespan of the card, so proceed with caution. 

If you buy a "factory overclocked" card like that ASUS, you are buying 

a) A card that is "guaranteed" to run at those clock speeds. You *usually* can achieve the same speeds on a non-overclocked card by increasing the clockspeeds and voltages yourself, but not always. 

b) Often, a card with better cooling.  </TEXT>
