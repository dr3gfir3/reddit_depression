	<TEXT> Wow, didn't realize that all the top memory record holders used this. I always thought they had something else going for them.

Also, any source for the cause of the ban in Middle Age schools? I didn't see that part in the Wikipedia page. </TEXT>

But hopefully you get my point. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> LPT: Each customer in line takes as much time as 17 items (generally spent while paying).  So if you see an express register with 15 people and 10 items each, it's roughly equivalent to 405 "items" (since (17 + 10) x 15 = 405).  Therefore if there's another line with only 5 people but with 75 items each, that's about 375 "items" and you should take it.  Obviously this breaks down when people are buying big bulky items, or have a million coupons, etc.

So if you have to go through the line multiple times, it might not really be that time efficient (though I guess your anecdote suggests it worked out well). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obviously stay away from the excessively inebriated folks.  They tend to do stuff they regret.  Of course, this goes for any fan at any stadium.

Cheers, and welcome to Pittsburgh! I've survived for over 3 years here, though I've only made it out to one game (cause I'm a broke college student). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Now that they own WeatherUnderground, Jeff Masters is going along with the winter storm names as well ([Winter Storm Athena](http://www.wunderground.com/blog/JeffMasters/article.html?entrynum=2289)).  In my opinion, the subjective decision to give them names is going to cause just as much confusion as the fact that some news networks will be using them, and that some won't.  

It's not a terrible idea to name them, I just wish everybody was on board in making the decision, and that there was an absolute definition to what they consider to be a "winter storm". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for a Ravens bar in Pittsburgh, but... yeah.

P.S. repping the Ravens during week 4 of 2010 (we took it, 17-14 at Heinz) was one of the most fun experiences I've ever lived through.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well... it's definitely not your average category 1 hurricane.  Right now it hardly resembles a hurricane--though it has a central pressure of 940mb and a 1000 mile windfield and is hitting the largest metropolis in the U.S. </TEXT>
