	<TEXT> Thanks. Brand new sleeping bags sell for $20 and up. This bag is 30 plus years old. You sold it at a great price but I guarantee you I can get $50 for it today If I wanted. I've already been offered $45 from someone who knows what I paid for it. In the coming years they will become more rare since they are falling apart. If by chance MOTU gets a Hollywood reboot then the price will jump again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I may or may not be the Master of my Backyard tonight. Got this gem today at a thrift store in town that my room mate suggested I check out. I'm glad I did. This bad boy was selling on Ebay 3 years ago for $20. The only open sales I could find were for $50 for one with stains and $115 on Etsy with 1 in stock. Zipper works like new. Colors are like new. It's a piece of art in my mind. I may hang it up long ways because the artwork is just so vibrant. Gotta love Thrifting!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In third grade, I cheated on my history exam. In fourth grade, I stole my uncle Maxs toupee and I glued it on my face when I was Moses in my Hebrew School play. In fifth grade, I knocked my sister Edie down the stairs and I blamed it on the dogWhen my mom sent me to the summer camp for fat kids and then they served lunch I got nuts and I pigged out and they kicked me outBut the worst thing I ever done  I mixed a pot of fake puke at home and then I went to this movie theater, hid the puke in my jacket, climbed up to the balcony and then, t-t-then, I made a noise like this: hua-hua-hua-huaaaaaaa  and then I dumped it over the side, all over the people in the audience. And then, this was horrible, all the people started getting sick and throwing up all over each other. I never felt so bad in my entire life. </TEXT>

The kicker is that the system and controller are mint! The system had to have sat in an attic since the early 90's. No Box but it's so beautiful that I had to put it out on display as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> * Samurai Shodown - Classic Japanese style fighting game in the box for around $20 on ebay. 
* Star Fox - Must have in any collection $14 buy it now cartridge only ebay. 
* Mario Kart - the O.G Mario Kart for Snes , worth the extra $10 it goes around $25-$30 cart only ebay. 
* Donkey Kong Country 2 - just as good if not better $20 cart only ebay. 
* Doom - one of the first fps games besides Wolfenstein 3d also for Snes, the latter is my favorite however Doom goes for $20-$25 cart only on ebay while Wolfenstein 3d (Nazi and Hitler references) goes for $35-50 cart only on ebay. 
* Super Smash TV - this game was way ahead of its time. Very quoatable one of my personal favorites $20-$25 cart only on ebay.
* If you buy these games it will definitely look like you know what you're doing. The list of great games around $20 is too long to list but these are a few off the top to start building a strong collection.
