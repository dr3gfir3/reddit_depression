	<TEXT> The dough is way too thick in my opinion. I like them thin and crispy, but its a matter of taste.
Also, it doesn't hurt to knead the dough a little, and make it better afterwards.

And there is no olive oil in real pizza dough. 

500g flour/250ml water/10gsalt/2g fresh yeast or 4g dry yeast. That's it ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you ! Yes I have to cut it in half to insert the crispy praline, usually in cubes or rectangles, its chunky. I could pipe it if I would warm up the crispy praline,but it's more work everyday, and I cut it in half for the aesthetic as well.

Cutting it in half allows you to insert whatever you like and get more volume. I do it with strawberries or raspberries like this one:[eclair framb.jpg](https://postimg.org/image/y8y1zih09/)

This raspberry eclair was baked with a crunchy layer that makes it looks different by the way.

Oh and for your question to pipe inside a 10cm eclair usually two holes on the bottom (flat side)  ==x====x== are enough if the pate a choux rose correctly. Otherwise a third hole in the middle bottom can help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your compliments! 

The hazelnuts on top are not candied to avoid too much sweetness, just roasted to enhance their taste and grossly peeled so some skin remain on them. It adds bitterness. Note that the chocolate whipped ganache is only 1 liter of cream and 700g of milk chocolate 38% cocoa. No sugar added. 
The sweetest thing in here is the crispy pralin which is made of butter, milk chocolate, pralin hazelnut, pure hazelnut paste,salt, crushed roasted hazelnuts and paillet feuillantine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yep my headchef said the same thing than you ! But it's a question of taste. He's more like let's concentrate on the main element while I'm more considering a plate like a painting support. Thanks for the compliments ! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesnt take much time if the cake is already prepared and you just have to put the 2 sauces, pipe two thingy and spread the powder stuff. 1min30 max if the mise en place is well done. But this one was for the NYE night, so I had to make only 15 of those and I had a lot of time to prepare myself.

 Note that there was also raspberry sorbet but served with it but I took the picture before they were needed </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was part of the 31st december menu, it was around 250euros for 4 courses and a cup of champagne. It was on a panoramic tower so they paid the view as well. And the New Year Eve event..

But if it would be for the "a la carte" menu it would probably be sold around 18euros yeah </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the restaurant I used to work in France they would cover the salmon of sea salt and whole red and black pepper berries and let it rest in the fridge 24h before smoking it in a smoker for a few hours. I cant remember exactly I'm in pastry...

How do you guys smoking it in the oven ? Do you put some wood in the bottom ? I wish I could smoke my salmon at home  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lol yeah but its already so hard to create new pastries nowadays, giving them a name that will sound good to everyone and describe a little the pastry is even harder. 

Those guys just give simple easy names:
Cronut was easy:Croissant+Donut
Churroduo well its just two churros together so the name says just what it is.

In France we had a meringue pastry covered in chocolate sprinkles in a ball shape. We used to call it "Tete de negre" which literally means "Nigger's head". 
Thanks it was changed a few years ago for obvious reasons...but all those decades with this racist name in every pastry shop of France makes me shameful of being French.

This tarte tatin looks awesome by the way, I wonder how much do they sell it for. </TEXT>
