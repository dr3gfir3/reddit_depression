	<TITLE> Brian Eno's has a great way to use a Library </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-15 13:11:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm listening to [Chain Reaction on BBC radio](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00lgkzc?ns_mchannel=social ns_campaign=bbc_radio_4 ns_source=twitter ns_linkname=radio_and_music) (it's a tag team chat show where last weeks guest is this weeks interviewer)

This episode is one where Alan Moore is interviewing Brian Eno and highlights how Eno's uses Libraries, which I thought I'd share. 

Eno would make note of the licence plates near his library before walking in. He would then use these numbers to create a basic dewy decimal reference number and find the book in the library which matches it. 

It meant he would read more books on subjects and areas he might not have looked at before and would give him ideas or new areas of knowledge.

	<TITLE> [Spoilers Everything] Fun facts about Demogorgon from mythology </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-11 16:32:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [According to Giovanni Boccaccio's Genealogy of the Pagan Gods](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YGUhj8rcbm4C pg=PA794 lpg=PA794 dq=Thebaid+4.516 source=bl ots=6bPwILbUHI sig=F1qyuzaGc1YVmOC-Kc8sZBT0uio hl=en sa=X ved=0ahUKEwjTho7HvrnOAhUrGZoKHZzHA8YQ6AEIJDAB#v=snippet q=tenth%20child%20demogorgon f=false) the Demogorgon had 9 children. The eight is Earth and the ninth is Erebus. Child of Demogorgon Erebus had 21 children, [the Eleventh was Hunger.](https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YGUhj8rcbm4C lpg=PA794 ots=6bPwILbUHI dq=Thebaid%204.516 pg=PA115#v=onepage q=hunger f=false)

This god, as has been said, the ancients calls the Demogorgon. That they were born from Erebus and Night, as Cicero says, can be explained in this way. Erebus, as will be explained more fully later, is the deepest and most hidden place on earth. Allegorically we can understand this as the profundity of the divine mind into which the human eye cannot penetrate. And because the divine mind can really see itself, knowing what it will do, and therefore produced them in an act with nature, we can surely say that they were born from Erebus, that is, the from the arcane and most profound inner sanctum of the divine mind.


Not sure if the show was having fun nodding to mythology though.Pretty cool that Eleven is first seen as very hungry and may also got her powers from when her mother was in the psychic tank, the same place she crossed dimensions.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Picking teams by experience for new players   Gym tips </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-14 13:31:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So got the game early. So if you're going to be joining a team in the future. Here are some observations on what it's like once you pick.

Overall seen some people hold gyms for a long time and seen gyms shift hands within minutes. You can still get XP and coins if you go back and win back that gym within time. 

On fighting gyms. Running can still give out damage to the gym if you at least beat one pokemon. So there's an exploit of taking out lowest levels pokemon first. tap to attack. when blue box is fill hold down till it releases the special attack. swipe to dodge (some players say screen at the corner flashes yellow before an attack). Train a gym up to make it harder to defeat for rivals. You can add pokemon to your teams gym if its at the right level and not being battled on.

**Red Valor** - Defender. Due to larger numbers your are more likely to see red Gyms with larger teams of players defending it. Strategy is what pokemon to have on the gym and which to take with you to take the next gym. 

**Blue Mystic** - Attacker/Defender. Also high numbers of players. Yet in my experience usually not as many people defending gyms as reds but lot of them attacking gyms and holding them for longer than Yellow.  

**Yellow Instinct** - Raiders. Low numbers of players mean holding or leveling up gyms is difficult. More likely going to be raiding gyms for quick XP boosts and defended coins if its a frequent gym for raiding. Will most likely always have their most powerful pokemon on them. 

Though this can still vary where you live, yellows can be defenders if you notice high amount of local players in your area etc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was thinking about different game experiences people have for each team. 

Reds must be defenders. They like to hold their gyms with teams of people. 

Blue are kinda between us and Reds, they attack a lot of red places. Sometimes they have teams to hold them. 

We, by our smaller numbers, are the trouble makers, the raiders, the pirates and the little ninjas. We don't hold gyms for long or level them up much. Yet we strike to break the blue and reds team defense. 

We harvest XP or the defense bonus and we move on. Till next team tries to build bigger defenses for us to raid.  </TEXT>

Heard suggestions elsewhere Go players should litter pick while out at gyms.

Anything else? Maybe from leaving tips in pubs we take gyms from, helping other players. Dropping lures near places which need them. If trading comes in when Europe goes live maybe giving high level Pokemon to people who didn't get the game early etc.  </TEXT>

**Salary of MEPs**

MEPs, in general, receive the same salary under the single statute which came into effect in July 2009.

The monthly pre-tax salary of MEPs under the single statute is 8,213.02 as of 1.7.2015. The salary comes from Parliament's budget and is subject to an EU tax and insurance contributions, after which the salary is 6,400.04. Member States may also subject the salary to national taxes. The basic salary is set at 38.5% of the basic salary of a judge at the European Court of Justice.

There are a few exceptions: MEPs who held a mandate in Parliament before the 2009 elections could opt to keep the previous national system for salary, transitional allowance and pensions.

**Pensions**

Under the statute, former Members are entitled to an old-age pension from the age of 63. The pension equals 3.5% of the salary for each full years exercise of a mandate but not more than 70% in total. The cost of these pensions is met from the European Union budget.

An additional pension scheme, introduced for MEPs in 1989, was closed to new members from July 2009 and is being phased out.

https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/apr/27/meps-final-payoff-157000

Departing MEPs get final payoff of up to 157,000
European parliamentarians who step down or lose seat entitled to 'transitional allowance' worth a maximum of two years' salary

All MEPs who step down or lose their seats are entitled to a "transitional allowance" of at least 39,000. The value of the payment increases with length of time in post, meaning the longest-serving MEPs could receive two years' salary after leaving. The allowance provides one month's salary for each year an MEP has been in parliament, with a minimum of six months and a maximum of 24.

The revelation follows a row last week over the second pensions to which many members of the European parliament are entitled, in addition to their statutory pension. The longest-serving MEPs accrue statutory pensions of up to 55,000  70% of their salary. They are entitled to draw this non-contributory pension, which is funded solely by the taxpayer, at age 63.

Many MEPs also have a second European parliament pension scheme, which is expected to pay out up to 41,000 a year. The fund, which closed to new applicants in 2009 and stopped accepting contributions, was criticised last week by Tory MP Philip Davies as "the perfect example of the grotesque self-serving extravagance of the EU".

Public anger escalated last week after it emerged that an "actuarial deficit" in the second pension scheme will require an extra 187m of taxpayer funding to plug the gap. UK taxpayers have already contributed more than 100m to the fund.

Out of Britain's 73 serving MEPs, 38 contributed to the European Parliament's "additional voluntary pension scheme". According to documents leaked to HansMartin Tillack, a German investigative journalist, and think tank Open Europe, many high-profile MEPs are members of the scheme, including Syed Kamall, Leader of Conservative MEPs; Glenis Willmott, the leader of the European Parliamentary Labour Party; Sir Graham Watson, the president of the EUwide Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe; and Nigel Farage, leader of Ukip. </TEXT>

**Stephen Crabb** [Votes List](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11768/stephen_crabb/preseli_pembrokeshire/votes) These individual topic lists linked are long so add any you find important to the comments.

Voted Remain. 

Where he stands on Brexit (from bbc summary): 

Campaigned for Remain but now says: "The result was for the UK to leave the European Union. There can be no stepping back from that. It's a clear instruction to the government. There can be no attempt to dilute it, to sidestep it. And there will be no second referendum."

Mr Crabb has set out three aims for the EU negotiations: "One: controlling immigration, and for us this is a red line. The one message that came through louder than any other in the vote last week is that the British people want to control immigration. Two: it is vital that we seek to achieve as close an economic relation with the EU as we have now. Three: the end of the supremacy of EU law."


Voted Summary

Stephen Crabb is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs. 

However, Stephen Crabb sometimes differs from their party colleagues, such as: Stephen Crabb generally voted for removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords, while most Conservative MPs generally voted against. Stephen Crabb has never rebelled against their party in the current parliament

**Liam Fox** [Voting Record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10213/liam_fox/north_somerset/votes)

Voted Leave.

Where he stands on Brexit: 

"I do not believe there is room for membership of the single market if it entails free movement of people. Those who voted to leave the EU would regard it as a betrayal and frankly they would be right. We do not need to be part of the single market to sell into it. Countries like the United States manage to do that very well. It is in our mutual interests to have a free and open trade relationship with our European partners but we cannot accept the concept of free movement of people as its cost."

Voted Summary

Liam Fox is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs. 

However, Liam Fox sometimes differs from their party colleagues, such as: Liam Fox generally voted against allowing marriage between two people of same sex, while most Conservative MPs generally voted for.

**Michael Gove** [Voting Record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/11858/michael_gove/surrey_heath/votes)

Voted Leave

Where he stands on Brexit:  

"The British people voted for change last Thursday... they want Britain to leave the European Union and end the supremacy of EU law. They told us to restore democratic control of immigration policy and to spend their money on national priorities such as health, education and science instead of giving it to Brussels. They rejected politics as usual and government as usual. They want and need a new approach to running this country."

He said "huge challenges" but also "huge opportunities" lay ahead for the UK.

He ruled out a snap general election if he becomes PM - and he said he would abandon Chancellor George Osborne's target of eliminating Britain's budget deficit by 2020. Mr Osborne himself has since abandoned the target.

He said he would wait until at least until 2017 to kick off the two-year process of negotiating the UK's withdrawal by invoking Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty.

"I will only trigger it after extensive preliminary talks ... so I have no expectation that Article 50 would be triggered in this calendar year," he said.

**Andrea Leadsom** [Voting record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/24829/andrea_leadsom/south_northamptonshire/votes)

Voted Leave

She has described the referendum result as "a huge opportunity for our great country". She believes in scrapping free movement and wants to do free trade negotiations with the rest of the world.

Mrs Leadsom told Sky News: "My personal view very genuinely is the next leader is someone who has to deliver on the promise of the referendum because they can see the huge advantages and they believe in them. I think it's very difficult for somebody who campaigned to stay in, who thinks that there will be disaster if we leave to suddenly turn it around and start believing we can make a go of it."


Voted Summary

Andrea Leadsom is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs. 

However, Andrea Leadsom sometimes differs from their party colleagues, such as: Andrea Leadsom consistently voted for removing hereditary peers from the House of Lords, while most Conservative MPs generally voted against.

**Theresa May** [Voting Record](http://www.theyworkforyou.com/mp/10426/theresa_may/maidenhead/votes)

Voted Remain 

Backed Remain campaign but says vote to come out must be respected: "Brexit means Brexit... There must be no attempts to remain inside the EU, no attempts to rejoin it through the back door and no second referendum." Mrs May also said there should be no general election before 2020 and no "emergency" Brexit budget - and that she would abandon the target of eliminating Britain's Budget deficit by the end of the decade, a day before the chancellor himself abandoned it.

Setting out her priorities for Brexit negotiations, she said "it must be a priority to allow British companies to trade with the single market in goods and services but also to regain more control of the numbers of people who are coming here from Europe". "Any attempt to wriggle out of that, especially from leadership candidates who campaigned to leave the EU by focusing on immigration, will be unacceptable to the public."


Voted Summary

Theresa May is a Conservative MP, and on the vast majority of issues votes the same way as other Conservative MPs.

	<TEXT> So after the death of Walder Frey I thought 'oh good Ayra will be off to Winterfell next for the Stark reunion.'

Yet realized it's more likely she'll travel south with Jamie Lannisters camp. Since most of her next targets are in Kings Landing. Also word about the Starks taking over Winterfell hasn't reached Walder Frey so it's unlikely she'd know to go there. 

I doubt she'll be successful against Cersei (that's a younger brothers/valonqar job). But I wonder if she'll try another Shakespearean attempt show wise (like the pie) by setting up a play murder. As she knows the Joffery play off by heart and was told she'd be good on the stage by the the star actress. The play is exactly the kind of thing Cersei would want in Kings Landing after seizing power and destroying what the Sparrows did.

Though the Red Woman is on her list and is also travelling South. If they run into each other Ayra will get that magical necklace which would up her game in changing faces. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The good and ugly side of coming out, and why it was worth it. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-26 22:37:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I posted some [Pride Nerves](https://www.reddit.com/r/bisexual/comments/4phowr/pride_nerves) where I mentioned I was nervous for coming out and also nervous how I'd be accepted at pride with my partner. As we're opposite gender. 

I mentioned ugly in the title, so read on at your own capability for it. 

**The ugly**: Told my dad I was going to pride during our friday facetime chat. He wondered why. I went 'well...I am Bi.' I knew his reaction might not be good, but there was some hope. He's bit Jekyll and Hyde on everything. He had gay friends when hitchhiking and always said they were lovely couple. Yet when my mom left him, she left for London and lived with her gay friends. My dad blamed them for decades (and not his shitty behavior to my mum) for the divorce and has been homophobic about it. This made moving to London for me very difficult later on in life. He still hates the fact i live in London and have a boyfriend. He's very overprotective and if he got his way even seeing me as hetro. He would want me to be single and take care of him. He's usually most happy when people break up with me than when I start dating someone new (of course he even knew about the guys).

So when I said the words Bi, he went from cheerful dad to utter repulsion. He really used the words 'eeew', 'Thats disgusting', 'you're not gay', 'you should have a family', 'the gays and London have gotten to you, they've sucked you in. don't go. this is what they do'. etc I tried to tell him nothing changes, I've known before I moved to london, this isn't about his divorce etc. He wouldn't listen. We hung up. I cried. I warned my sisters. Between me typing to them, he called my sister. Who called me back and was on my side (yay) she said she was so proud of me and said I was brave (she knew all the good words from the coming out rule book). She said dad called her first and told her he was worried he had upset me. 

**The ugly improves a little**: So a while after my sister gives me her support. My dad calls again. He asks if he upset me and I cry again. He apologized and back tracks on what he said with 'I meant we shouldn't label things, it's just love' and 'i had gay friends'. He admitted the hurt from the divorce affected what he said. We had a good chat and made up. I mentioned I was nervous about pride. I explained me and my partner might not be as welcome due to biphobia from LGBT side as much as straight side. He said 'you go, you deserve to be there as much as anyone else.' So at least he was supportive to me going in the end. TBH his words hurt that evening and during pride. Yet i've cleared it out my mind now after much processing (which i will touch on later)

**The good**: Both my sisters are very supportive. One had Bi friend come out to them and knew the drill. The first sister who called me who was very supportive and sorted out my dad, has lot of gay friends and goes to pride. So she sorted my dad out. She mentioned I was brave and said 'if she was in my position she would not say anything'. Not sure why but it was still surprising when she told me she had slept with women before. So not sure if that's her way to say she's bi too and still hidden. My mother was very happy and proud. Excited i was going to be in the parade. She admitted she has dated women and knew since she was a kid she liked both (we're all a bit bi in this family!). She even agreed coming out is hard since you have to tell everyone and always need to tell new people. My partner came round to my flat when I told them how the dad call went, lots of hugs were had. I feel like I'm not alone in this. 

**Pride**: Went great. No one questioned me or my partner. The gay guy who was bi-evasive kept quiet and friendly. There were so many cheering faces and Bi flags and banners. I felt very welcome. It was nice boost after coming out and the mixed reaction. I was still bit nervous around people I don't know very well, but my partner kept my mood up. He was in Brexit blues and hadn't done much LGBT stuff for himself, so it was nice to hear how much he enjoyed the day and felt welcome in london. 

**Coming out post review**: I spent lot of time hurting over my dads words. No matter how much support I got from others or how he said sorry, it still stung. Despite how strained and difficult he can be, we still had a solid relationship. I think this has nuked it in some way, but life was strained already. Like I said moving to London already strained it and me being bi was always there but invisible. Instantly I questioned if I should of kept my mouth shut (or why did I tell the most difficult person first!). Watching Seinfeld and Curb like comedies helps this 'oh damn what did i say' moment. It' annoying this has become all about his negative feelings than my positives, but I feel this experience might helps others with the difficult people in out lives. 

Overall, it was a good thing. I wanted to be able to post pride or any activism online without hiding myself, he's on my social media so he was going to find out Friday or Saturday anyway. I know he wont be 100% okay with this and if I had been in same sex relationship this would be much harder. He can be quite needy so i'm wondering if i wont have to deal with that, now the golden child image has been nuked. But at least we talked about it.

I'm so glad I moved out and did this over the phone! I'd recommend it to anyone with difficult families. It allowed for the knee jerk, and on hanging up for the guilt to kick in for the negative reactions. I know I'm not disgusting, it just internal anger and past history I cannot control. All I did was tell someone something simple like 'I like these flavours of ice cream, I've always liked them' since to me being bi is no big deal. They make it into a big deal.

I'm still going to treat him like a caring daughter (and live my own life safe in the city) hopefully he can still continue as my dad. As I don't want this to turn me into hateful person, I'm still going to be a caring open hearted person. Even if as i argue with people online and they find my history, I will still listen to their views even if it comes from twisted place like my dads personal turmoil ;) I've still got lot of people out there who support me and will cheer me on.

When another blames you or hates you, or people voice similar criticisms, go to their souls, penetrate inside and see what sort of people they are. You will realize that there is no need to be racked with anxiety that they should hold any particular opinion about you.  Marcus Aurelius, Meditations

**The Future** With some thought I don't regret what I did. Everyday that passes, I know it had to be done and I feel stronger now and whole. I can't lie though. I feel like I took a hit, a hard hit. I feel like I have lost the heterosexual privilege I had when in the closet with people I know. Even people who support me might act differently.

However, in a wider sense, we have to come out and take a hit for a future generation. My dad and others grew up in a world where we were a fetish perversion and criminals, we hid ourselves away. Thanks to those few people who came out fighting early on, I've been able to grow up in a world where we can have rights and have more open lives. We can parade in bigger happier numbers. Where police went from beating us up, to proposing to each other at pride. We've got to come out as Bi, even if it means taking a hit from family and LG individuals. So they know we are here and we won't be invisible any longer. So one day Bi people can come out and not take the hit we took. We keep coming out and keep working hard for the next generation. 

On a personal level I feel no different. Nothing has changed. Maybe people will act differently, but at least I'm no longer walking on eggshells and twisted with anxiety over it. I do feel bit more whole and stronger as a person, so if anything happens to me; family issues, a bad day at work, my team losing at match, drama, world war III, alien invasion etc. Pfft I got through this and came out better. Bring it on.

	<TEXT> Group I've signed up with is taking part in my cities pride parade and i joined up to wave at people with my partner. 

Reasons to be nervous: 

* Me and my partner are both bi, but we are not same sex. So we're can easily be confused as hetro couple at events. So already feel like an outsider oddly. I'm planning on bringing bi colours and hoping my group supply some too. 

* One member of the group when mentioning i was bi laughed that Bi are greedy in a jokey way. Didn't bother me, but refereed to me as a lesbian later on which made other comments seem less jokey. No idea on the others taking part who might be chill or not (group says its LGBT and lots of people i'm not too familiar with.)

* I'm using my Pride participation to finally come out. Wondering how. I told some people who don't know i'm taking part but in my nerves wasn't clear that I'm not there just as an ally. They seemed awkward when i mentioned it. I'm tempted to just do it as facebook post as it reaches everyone in one go and I can deal with the awkward questions or people who don't like it later at a safer distance. Gah seems shitty though. 

What are your thoughts? am i ballsing up taking part in pride. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard there's a fair amount of incorrect information being used in this campaign (tbh and in other election) from fact checkers. 

My question is are there any regulations on this, or should there be? 

Bit like newspaper regulations, if it's shown an official campaign is using falsified figures should they be made to publish an apology and distribute it in same way they did the previous way? Or is there good reason why we shouldn't have this (like how they generate figures or easily abused by opposition campaigns). 

Thought i'd post this today and not when there's post result grumblings.

	<TEXT> So lot of Sansa hate about not telling people about the Vale fighters. 

In her defense:

- Everyone who promises to save her, fails her at some point. She doesn't trust these words, they've gotten her into worse situations usually. She's doing better when making decisions herself or not trusting everyone by their word. 

- From what I recall after one viewing. When she warned Jon about Ramsey and talked to him about Rickon (someone she knew Ramsey might use or kill). Jon lost his temper and didn't listen to her about defending himself from traps. She knew Ramsey was going to land a trap and in that moment she knew Jon can easily lose his temper to fall for the trap. Telling Jon about the Vale then would mean he'd lead them into the trap too. It was best for her to not tell him in that moment, and hold her own troops back until they could attack with force.

- She had to play a game herself. Her character has been trapped by game players like Ramsey and Littlefinger. She's learnt a lot from watching them both and learnt a lot about how honorable men like her father die. She might be becoming a more cold and powerful woman than Lady Olenna. The ultimate game player and Queen in the north. We've had theories she will develop this way in the book i think.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Bit of a mad theory which I don't 100% believe myself (or want to).

Yet have we addressed there's a chance that Ayra did lose the fight? and the person who looks like Ayra is the Waif in changed identity. That she shed off the jealous girl character and is now Ayra. 

Finally, a girl is no one, So in death she finally became no one. 

Maybe the Faceless Men truly are faceless and can even remove their own faces to reach this level of worship. With Ayras death maybe they will follow through with her death list as payment as she kept praying for it. Did she come over as a trainee or as a customer.  

My memory is fuzzy on the waif book character, she doesn't seem to have same hate levels. Yet she does seem to be learning common tongue and other things from Ayra.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently there's lot of talk and action in comics revolving round changing timelines.

Though oddly seem people judging this online as permanent changes while we are reading stories where the possibility of changing timelines is mentioned. 

Tony Starks position in issue 1 is about not using the Inhuman Ulysses since we might be seeing a 'possibility' of the future. And if we even know his powers are really about seeing the definite future. If you ignore the minority report comparisons this could be a different story all together.

Civil war 0 she-hulk opens it up about people changing thier destiny and how it's not set in stone but our perception is. The jester was a bad guy but not anymore because he changed. 

We've seen Captain America change to Hydra and it looks like his past was altered (or at least this is the strongest theory). 

We are seeing stories about powers being used in the present which are changing people's past and future. We don't know much about these new powers or if they are changing reality. By the end of these storylines I suspect things will change again, people won't be evil or dead. Maybe we will get to see rhodes as president.

Any thoughts? Or am I clutching at straws and drinking marvel hope cool aid. Or have I missed some press of other issues which say otherwise  </TEXT>

Even though referendum isn't on individuals, still be interesting to see who we voted for and what they've been upto.

For example if UKIP meps wanted changes to immigration, have they done anything in EU parliament to try and change things.

	<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Who is the Shrouded Lord? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-28 00:10:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We've seen the Night King and the White Walkers raise an army of the undead. 

Yet we know of another person or creature with similar powers and origins. Plus we see a repeat of a women with an icey kiss to the Night Kings possible origins. 

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Shrouded_Lord usuing the wiki for this one, also look up greyscale, grey plague, yi ti, Rhoynar and Asshai. 

The Shrouded Lord is said to rule the mists around the Sorrows since the time of Garin and to **spread greyscale through the grey kiss**, although he does not bestow his kiss lightly according to Haldon.[1]

According to some rumors, he is thought to be Prince Garin himself, risen from his watery grave. Others believe that there have been numerous Shrouded Lords, and when one dies another one takes his place; the one currently holding the title is a corsair from the Basilisk Isles. **Rolly Duckfield likes yet another version of the tale, in which the Shrouded Lord was a statue at first, and a grey woman from the fog kissed life to it with lips as cold as ice.**[2] They say the Shrouded Lord will grant a boon to any man who can make him laugh.[1] According to Septa Lemore the stone men were proud, and the Shrouded Lord was the proudest of all.

The curse of Greyscale was brought on by a Rhoynar. Who's magic could be like greenseers or like CotF

The captive prince called down a curse, and that night the Rhoyne flooded out of season, with greater force than known in living memory. A fog fell upon the city, and the Valyrian conquerors began to die of greyscale.[1] To this day, the ruins of Chroyane and that part of the river Rhoyne are known as the Sorrows, where the stone men live and travelers can still be infected with greyscale.

Legend has said that the Rhoynar had their own magic  a water magic very different from the sorceries of Valyria, which were woven of blood and fire. **It was said the Mother Rhoyne herself whispered to her children of every threat, that the Rhoynar princes wielded strange, uncanny powers, and that their cities were protected by "watery walls" that would rise to drown any foe.**

**The children of the forest may have had their own form of water magic. According to legend, their greenseers called upon the hammer of the waters twice in attempts to stop the First Men from invading Westeros.** The first use of the hammer of the waters resulted in the shattering of the Arm of Dorne into the Stepstones and the Broken Arm. The second attempt, to break Westeros in two, only resulted in the flooding of the Neck.

Like with abandoning Babies and taking the dead. The Stone Men get an increase of tributes and forces. 

They are rumoured to have a leader, the Shrouded Lord.[2] Thrice each year the triarchs of Volantis send a galley upriver with provisions, but they often deliver more afflicted than they do food.

and in the background of A Feast for Crows we're seeing an outbreak of Grey Plague in Yi Ti, which could be perfectly placed like a movement of Stone Men as we see movement of undead. The only other mention of Yi Ti is Jorah begging Dany to go there with him. It's not far from Asshai.

Garin tells Arianne Martell that according to sailors in Planky Town, grey plague, possibly referring to greyscale, has broken out in Yi Ti.

So is the Shrouded Lord a character we're yet to meet? Another less icey version of Night King. If so, would they be allies or enemies given the geography between them. One is made from Ice and other like stone forged from either water or fire. Is the Shrouded Lord also related to CotF?

If Shrouded Lord was created from icey womens kiss, are we sure the Night King isn't a woman (but that might take theory bit far) or if the Shrouded Lord is a woman or the very last CotF. Or if being near Asshai and hint Shrouded Lords can change with LSH be the next Shrouded Lord (lady) given she was brought back with Asshai magics. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rent Caps in other Capitols. Could London do the same? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-24 13:39:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Been hearing and reading about different rent controls implemented in different capitols and its ideal and slowly the speedy rises in rent prices. 

Some of these were introduced a while back, so do we know if they're working or if similar plans can be placed in London?

Some info below: 

Paris: The Loi Duflot is an attempt to tackle these problems head-on. When it comes into effect in 2016, agents fees will be capped, rental lists accessible by fee only will be banned and the number of documents required by prospective tenants will be cut. More radically still, high demand areas such as inner Paris will get rent caps. No new rental contract will be permitted to charge more than 20 percent per square meter above the neighborhoods median rent, which will be assessed annually by a "local rent observatory." Existing rental contracts that overstep that limit will have to be brought down when they are renewed.

None of this rules out the possibility of rent increases. If all landlords set their rents at the highest legal level, then the median will surely push up year on year. But it should slow the process down and ensure enough regularity throughout neighborhoods for prospective tenants to feel confident that theyre not getting ripped off.

Landlords are also getting some benefits, too. Theyll get a cap (albeit at a not inconsiderable 18 percent) on the tax they pay on rental earnings if their property is in an area of shortage. More significantly, both tenants and landlords will pay into a government run insurance fund against unpaid rent. If a tenant defaults, landlords will no longer have to chase them through the courts, but simply apply to the fund for reimbursement.

http://www.citylab.com/cityfixer/2013/07/new-rent-laws-aim-keep-paris-becoming-only-rich/6187/


The law seeks to cap rent increases from one lease to the next in the countrys largest cities as part of a sweeping housing reform, known in France by the acronym ALUR.

Rent in Paris has soared by 42 percent in the last 10 years, according to official data.

An OpinionWay poll published in June showed that 75 percent of French people supported the price-capping measure, although it has met with harsh criticism from estate agents and landlords.

http://www.france24.com/en/20150801-rent-control-law-paris-france-effect-regulations



Barely a month after the German capital introduced a new set of rules that limits rent increases within a given area, figures collected by ImmobilienScout24 show that the average cost of new Berlin rental contracts has dropped 3.1 percent within a month. This cant be written off as an example of a general countrywide downward trend. In other German cities where such laws havent yet been introduced, rents have remained more or less static. This is good news for the legislators of Berlins Senate as their new law is doing exactly what they promised the electorate that it would.

The new law introduced on June 1stcalled the mietpreisbremse or rental price brake in Germanworks like this. An overseeing body fixes a standard median rent per square meter for each city district, using figures based a biennial state census of rents. No new rental contract within the district is then permitted to charge over 10 percent more than this amount. This still means that price increases for new rentals are possible, but if they come, they happen far more slowly.

It was mentioned she was sure to have seen Jon fighting in Winterfell and she claimed more about Stannis in her visions. 

Given all the latest (and upcoming book wise) battles is there a chance she instead saw the raised dead of the White Walker horde fighting as they ravage the north and has misinterpreted what her visions are actually showing/warning her. So instead of preventing the darkness, she helped it gain an army.   </TEXT>

Personally I fail a lot when the fish suddenly switches direction. So it floats around one place (until green bar is near the top) and then suddenly sinks/rises to another spot and moves up and down a lot more. As I chase the fish with clicks/no clicks the bar goes to red and I fail. 

What's the best tactic to chase the fish with the sudden movement without losing too much of the green progress bar?

Is it just matter of collecting the junk until I can add upgrades and level up?

	<TEXT> I look at all the things I want to do in game, and all the money I need to raise to get it. At first I panicked at how long that will take me (given my current progress) and then I realized it was the first season and I had ton of in game seasons to pass me by and improve the farm. And I love that. 

Lot of games get tiresome when you work towards things and gain them too quickly, so far feels like I can always have a task to aim for in this game. Bit like how in old WoW how long it took to hussle and grind to save up for a mount and how rewarding it felt to finally get it. But this is more relaxing to play too (even if fishing mini game stresses me out a little). So I will always be able to jump in here and there to try some farming or a dungeon. 

It's sets a good challenge but in a relaxed gameplay way. Sorry for the random gushing, maybe a question....how long has it taken some of you to clear the farm land?

	<TITLE> Government response to petition on Reverse the decision to allowing fracking under our national parks.. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-12 11:34:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Think post to sign it was posted here, so the response for the curious on any outcomes:

Our regulations introduce an extra layer of protection, adding to existing protections. They define sensitive areas in which operators cannot frack by prohibiting fracking above 1,200 metres in them.

The Government supports the development of domestic energy sources in a safe and sustainable manner. Gas  the cleanest fossil fuel  still meets a third of our energy demand and we will need it for many years to come. We believe shale gas may hold huge potential for adding to the UKs energy sources, helping to improve energy security, create jobs and meet our carbon targets.

The Government has been clear that shale development must be safe and environmentally sound, maintaining the very highest safety and environmental standards, which we have established as world leaders in extracting oil and gas over decades. The Infrastructure Act 2015, which received Royal Assent in February 2015, introduced a range of requirements if an operator is to carry out hydraulic fracturing, to provide the public with confidence that this industry is being taken forward in a balanced way. These include the assessment of environmental impacts, groundwater monitoring, community benefits and the exclusion of protected areas. 

The protected areas in which hydraulic fracturing will be prohibited have been set out through the Onshore Hydraulic Fracturing (Protected Areas) Regulations, which were formally approved by both Houses of Parliament in December 2015. These regulations ensure that the process of hydraulic fracturing cannot take place above 1200 metres in National Parks, the Broads, Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs), World Heritage Sites and areas that are most vulnerable to groundwater pollution.

Rather than enabling operations in protected areas, these regulations introduce an additional protection to our most sensitive areas and complement the strong protections already provided by the planning system. Moreover, it is worth emphasising that the regulations do not in themselves grant any form of permission for associated hydraulic fracturing to take place under any of these sites. They simply establish the principle that hydraulic fracturing should be prohibited by legislation in the specified areas and down to the specified depth. A company looking to develop shale will still need to obtain all the necessary permissions, like planning and environmental permits - and any proposals will necessarily be subject to further detailed consideration and scrutiny under our legal and regulatory regimes.

Separately, the Government has also committed to ensure that hydraulic fracturing cannot be conducted from wells that are drilled at the surface of the UKs most valuable areas in a way that is not intended to impact on conventional drilling operations. We have formally consulted with industry and other interested parties on how best to implement this commitment and will issue a response to our consultation once we have reviewed their responses. 

The UK has one of the best track records in the world when it comes to protecting our environment while also developing our industries  and we have brought that experience to bear on the shale gas protections. The shale industry will be developed safely with world class environmental protections, creating jobs and delivering better energy security while safeguarding of some of our most precious areas.

	<TITLE> [Help] First time dealing with breathing issues </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-28 13:07:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Part help and rant. I've dealt with stomach and odd heart bump when I go aah internally. But over last two weeks I've had the breathlessness. Doctors checked my lungs and it is not the horrible health issues i feared all week (which is tiny relief). Luckily doctor suggested/form me for an x-ray later so double relief if that comes through clean. I'm fighting thoughts of 'what if she's wrong'

The breathing exercises just remind me of that feeling in my chest.  So harder to shake than the others. I think the trigger is everything work, life, health. Been sick a lot over Christmas and news had too many health fear stories (even headlines make me worry). Currently trying to drink all the herbal tea in the office

Any tips on sorting breathing stress or avoiding the health fear triggers? 

I'm signing up for counselling but doctor and my bf suggested i should tell work. Urgh i fear my boss would treat me different and things which cheer me up/good challenge at work (like projects and trips) will be lost to me.   </TEXT>

Here's a snippet:

* You can get on a bus and end up in Paris

* Everyone knows more about our history then we do
 
* Radio is still a big deal. The BBC is quite good

* The newspapers can be awful 

* Everything costs the same but our money is worth less so you have to add 50% to the price to figure what you're paying

* Beer comes in large, completely filled, actual pint glasses and the closer the brewery the better the beer
 
* Butter and eggs aren't refrigerated
 
* The beer isn't warm, each style is served at the proper temperature 

* Cider (alcoholic) is quite good.

* Excess cider consumption can be very painful.
 
* The universal greeting is "Cheers" (pronounced "cheeahz" unless you are from Cornwall, then it's "chairz")
 
* The money is easy to understand: 1-2-5-10-20-50 pence, then-1-2-5-10, etc bills. There are no quarters. 
 
* Their cash makes ours look like Monopoly money
 
* Cars don't have bumper stickers

* Many doorknobs, buildings and tools are older than America

	<TEXT> Often seen it argued that men have less of a support network when it comes to emotional matters, there's a 'man up' attitude rather than seeking help and support from people they know. Often argued why suicide rate is higher due to shame and pressure of masculinity and not being able to reach out. 

Sometimes when you meet someone who's acting up in a bad way, turns out they're dealing with issues relating to a bad break up or relationship, social problems by themselves. 

So are there any healthy and not get bitter support, books, blogs, sites, etc which aim to help guys with these issues?

	<TEXT> from wiki it's looks like we've taken in around and more than 20,000 in the past and coped.

Was the reaction the same from social and government level? 


https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_immigration_to_the_United_Kingdom
Following the end of World War II, substantial groups of people from Soviet-controlled territories settled in Britain, particularly Poles and Ukrainians. The UK recruited displaced people as so-called European Volunteer Workers in order to provide labour to industries that were required in order to aid economic recovery after the war.[22] In the 1951 census, the Polish-born population of the UK numbered some 162,339, up from 44,642 in 1931.[23][24]

 The flow of Indian immigrants peaked between 1965 and 1972, boosted in particular by Idi Amin's sudden decision to expel all 50,000 Gujarati Indians from Uganda. Around 30,000 Ugandan Asians migrated to the UK.[25]

There was also an influx of refugees from Hungary, following the crushing of the 1956 Hungarian revolution, numbering 20,990.[26]

How many people we've taken in so far according to guardian 

Only 200 have been taken by Britain so far under this scheme, although the government has given asylum or other forms of humanitarian protection to nearly 5,000 Syrians who have applied for asylum having reached Britain since the crisis started in early 2011 </TEXT>
