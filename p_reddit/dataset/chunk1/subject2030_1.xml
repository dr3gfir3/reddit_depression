	<TEXT> In an interview, Edgar Wright said the film is less of a comedy, and more of an intense action thriller. While personally, I was hoping it would be a full-on comedy like his films normally are, but I'm keen for anything by Edgar Wright, since he's my second favourite filmmaker (first is Christopher Nolan) </TEXT>
