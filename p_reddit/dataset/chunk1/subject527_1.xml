	<TEXT> I'm too afraid to post this to Facebook...

Some of you already know but a lot of you dont. On the 4th of February 2014 I underwent the Gastric Sleeve Procedure. This involves the removal of 85% of the patients stomach. A few people that know I have had this surgery dont understand why I did it and why I thought it was best for me. 

I suffer from a condition that makes it virtually impossible for me to lose weight but, all too easy to put weight on. When talking to my surgeon and my specialist they both informed me that my projected weight in two years time would be well into the 200s. I was not happy with myself at allno confidence, no spark left and no humour anymoreI just wanted to be a hermit for the rest of my life. 

It took me well over a year to decide that this surgery was the right direction for me to go in. I spent countless hours researching, finding the best surgeon in Australia and talking to my mum who is a Doctor. After considering alternatives and trying multiple different diets I decided that I would take the plunge. I booked in to see a psychologist, a dietician and the surgeon of my choice. The process had begun

After 5 months of preparation and 3 weeks of liquid diets the day of my surgery had finally arrived. I got to hospital, was put to sleep and woke up in a whole world of pain. I was placed in the ICU because my blood pressure was barely measurable and my heart rate was dipping. Apparently I am allergic to every pain medication there is. I dont remember much of the 36 hours I spent in ICU except for the pain. 

Two days later I was sent to the regular ward in which I was able to talk liquids through an IV and begin sampling different soups and high protein fluids. The first phase was really hard, I felt miserable (probably from the anaesthetic and other medications), and I was alone; most of my family and boyfriend working all day. After 8 days I was allowed to return home with strict instructions and a very sore abdomen. 

It has now been 2 and a bit months since my surgery and I am 41 kilograms lighter overall, and 22 kilograms lighter post-op. I am astounded at how this surgery has changed my lifeI am a new person. My confidence is back, I am wearing clothes I would never have dreamed off and I am so much happier. 

I know a lot of people have told me I am living a lie because I post photos of my weight loss and my gym shoes but the honest truth is; THIS IS NO EASY FIX SOLUTION. The weight does not simply fall off and it certainly does not change the problems/relationships with food in your head. I am not living a lieI am being ME. I am so proud of everything I have accomplished in this short few months. A giant Fuck you to the people that told me I am living a lie and portraying something I am not simply because I dont want my life story on Facebook.

That is all. </TEXT>
