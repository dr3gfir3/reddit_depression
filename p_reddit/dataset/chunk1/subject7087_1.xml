	<TEXT> Just started playing online in MHGen and was looking to exchange friend codes with some people to make an informal "Clan" of sorts
I played loads of MH3U and 4U but only ever played locally or with randoms online in 4U.

If you wanna, go ahead and drop your FC and message me or something when I'm on!

Btw, I've just gotten into the 4 star village quests and havent even started tackling the 1 star hub quests.... sorry haha
