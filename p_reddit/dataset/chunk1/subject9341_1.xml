	<TEXT> Q = M.C.T  
Q = heat transferred  
M = mass of water  
C = heat capacity of water  
T = change in temperature  
Q will be the same for hot and cold so we can equate them.  
Mc = mass of cold water  
Mh = mass of hot water  
Tc = temperature change of cold water  
Th = temperature change of hot water  
Mc x Tc = Mh x Th  
Mc/Mh = Th/Tc  
Mc/Mh = (100-43)/(43-9)  
Mc/Mh = **1.68 parts cold water to hot water**  
This basically means for every 100 ml of hot water you need to add 168 ml of cold water. But this assumes no heat losses. There will be some inevitable heat losses during pouring so I would use 160 ml of cold water for every 100 ml of hot water.

	<TEXT> From [this](http://www.windows2universe.org/earth/Water/temp.html) image it can be seen that the sea temperature varies, but the bulk of the water (below 500 m) is approximately 5 C. So the temperature will need to be raised to 15 C. Certain assumptions must be made.  
1) There is no evaporation.  
2) The average temperature of the sea is 5 C.  
3) There is no energy transfer out of the system.  
4) The system reaches thermal equilibrium (in reality the oceans are so large that there will always be pockets of warmer and colder fluid).  
The equation being used will be  
Q = m.c.T  
where  
Q = heat transferred  
m = mass  
c = heat capacity  
T = change in temperature  

The heat transferred will be the same for copper and water. So we can equate both sides.  
m(copper).c(copper).T(copper) = m(water).c(water).T(water)  
Rearranging to make m(copper) the subject.  
m(copper) = m(water).c(water).T(water)/(c(copper).T(copper))  
m(water) = 1.386x10^18 tonne  
c(water) = 4.184 J/(g.C)  
T(water) = (15-5)C = 10C
c(copper) = 0.385 J/(g.C)  
T(copper) = (50-15)C = 35C  
m(copper) = 1.386x10^18 x 4.184 x 10 / (0.385 x 35)  
m(copper) = 4.304x10^18 tonnes  

The density of copper is 8.96 tonnes per m^3 so the volume of copper is as follows.  
V(copper) =  4.304x10^18 / 8.96 = **4.803x10^17 m^3**  

**This is 35% of the volume of water in the oceans.**

EDIT: During my calculations I mixed up the delta t for copper and water and so my answer was slight wrong.

	<TEXT> Being the pedant I am, I must point out that as the event has happened then the probability of it happening is 1.  

Pedantry aside, assuming childhood you picked a colour at random to colour in your car and it was one of these [basic colours](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/56vvdAmAogY/maxresdefault.jpg) then the chance of it being yellow is 1/11. The percentage of yellow cars in the USA (which is where I assume you're from) is [3%](http://www.cars.com/go/advice/Story.jsp?section=top subject=colors).  
1/11 x 0.03 = 0.00273 or **1 in 367** so your friend is an idiot. It is worth noting that this is just the chance of a random car you received being the same as a randomly coloured-in car. Specifying the time period between them and the other events would make it even more unlikely, and almost impossible to calculate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Using your for dimensions I got a very different answer.  
First calculate the volume of the dot modelling it as a cylinder.  
V =  x r^2 x h  
V = 3.14 x (5x10^-4 m)^2 x 10^-9 m  
V = 7.85x10^-16 m^3  
Next calculate the mass of the dot based on the density of graphite.  
M =  x V  
M = 2266 kg/m^3 x 7.85x10^-16 m^3  
M = 1.78x10^-12 kg  
Then calculate the number of moles by dividing by molecular weight and using conversion factors.   
kmols = M/Mr  
kmols = 1.78x10^-12 kg / 12 kg/kmol  
kmols = 1.48x10^-13 kmol  
mols = 1.48x10^-13 kmol x 1000 mol/kmol  
mols = 1.48x10^-10 mol  
Finally use Avagadro's number to calculate the number of atoms.  
No. atoms = mols x Av  
No. atoms = 1.48x10^-10 mol x 6.02x10^23 atoms/mol  
No. atoms = **89,300,000,000,000** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the helium was contained by a weightless boundary which covered the bottom of the dome then it would actually be buoyant (assuming it doesn't structurally fail from the forces involved.  
Force(up) = Vo x (air) x g  
Force(up) = 9.802x10^10 m^3 x 1.29 kg/m^3 x 9.81 m/s^2  
Force(up) = 1.240x10^12 N  
Mass(dome) = 7.684x10^10 kg  
Mass(He) = Vi x (He)  
Mass(He) = 9.799x10^10 m^3 x 0.164 kg/m^3 = 1.607x10^10 kg
Mass(dome + He) = 7.684x10^10 kg + 1.607x10^10 kg = 9.291x10^10 kg  
Force(down) = Mass(dome + He) x g  
Force(down) = 9.291x10^10 x 9.81 m/s^2 = 9.115x10^11 N  
Force(net) = Force(up) - Force(down)  
Force(net) = 1.240x10^12 N - 9.115x10^11 N = 3.289x10^11 N  
Acceleration = Mass(dome+He)/Force(net)  
Acceleration = 9.291x10^10 kg / 3.289x10^11 N = **3.5 m/s^2 upward**  

So the dome would float upward until the air density reduces enough to prevent the buoyancy overcoming the weight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Natural light consists of all of the colours of the spectrum. The colour of an object is just the colours of light which are reflected by the object, the rest are absorbed. Different molecules absorb different wavelengths of light, so for and object which is black, the molecules it is made of will absorb almost all wavelengths of light, so very little is reflected back to your eyes. Anyway, the UV light in the sun can changes the structure of the molecules in cotton so that they absorb a different wavelength of light and so the colour of the cotton changes because it it now reflective different wavelengths of light. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly we need to calculate the  size of the dome. Springfield is based on the real town of Springfield, Oregon. The size of this town will be used to estimate the size of the dome. The area of Springfield, Oregon is [40.79 km^2](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Springfield,_Oregon). Assuming the Simpson's Springfield is a circle of the same area then the radius of the circle can be calculated.  
r = sqrt(40.79/) = 3.603 km = 3603 m  

The thickness of the dome must also be estimated. [This](http://m.imgur.com/KXxpuOn) picture shows that the dome's thickness is approximately two times the diameter of Prof. Frink's head. The average circumference of an adult male's head is [56.9 cm](http://www.smf.org/docs/articles/pdf/chingtechbrief.pdf). Assuming Frink has a circular shaped head of average circumference then the diameter of his head can be calculated.  
56.9 cm /  = 18.1 cm   
This value is doubled to calculate the dome's thickness.  
18.1 cm x 2 = 36.2 cm = 0.362 m  

To calculate the dome's volume we calculate the volume of the outer layer of the dome and then take away the volume of the inner dome.  
Volume of outer dome (Vo)  
Vo = 2/3 x  x (3603 m + 0.362 m)^3 = 9.802x10^10 m^3  
Volume of inner dome (Vi)  
Vi = 2/3 x  x 3603 m^3 = 9.799x10^10 m^3  
Volume of glass in dome (Vg)  
Vg = Vo - Vi = 2.955x10^7 m^3  

The density of glass is [2.6 t/m^3](http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/density-solids-d_1265.html). This can be used to calculate the mass of glass.  
2.955x10^7 m^3 x 2.6 t/m^3 = **76.8 million tonnes**  

The Bell-Boeing Osprey is a VTOL aircraft of similar appearance to the ones in the film. It has an external cargo carrying capacity of [6.8 tonnes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Boeing_V-22_Osprey).  
76.8x10^6 t / 6.8 t/aircraft = **11.3 million aircraft** so the answer is: **NO**  

**Edit: Thanks to /u/ElliotJW for pointing out that I used an incorrect Springfield and here is my reply to him.**

You're perfectly fine to question my sources, I welcome constructive criticism. After viewing my source again and looking at other sources it turns out that my source was a mis-interpretation of some of Matt Groening's comments and the real world location (if it exists) of Springfield remains ambiguous. Don't believe everything you read on the Internet, kids.  

**Edit 2: So many times on this sub I have seen incorrect calculations which are just blindly believed. A similar thing happens on social media and in the news/newspapers. People just believe what they read without questioning. Sometimes genuine mistakes are made and sometimes there is an agenda behind misleading information. Please, please, please keep a healthy skepticism and don't be afraid to question things which don't seem correct or which you're unsure about. I would rather be wrong and everybody knows, rather than wrong and everyone believes I'm right** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You figured right. It is much larger.  

0.02 g/cm^3 = 20 kg/m^3  
1 tonne = 1000 kg   

So divide the mass by the density  
1000 kg / 20 kg/m^3 = **50 m^3**  

This is the volume he should have calculated based on his density data.  

I found the density of feathers to be 0.0025 g/cm^3 or 2.5 kg/m^3 ([source](http://www.visionlearning.com/en/library/General-Science/3/Density/37)).

1000 kg / 2.5 kg/m^3 = 400 m^3

Based on this value the volume is **400 m^3 !** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The volume of Earth's water is 1.386x10^9 km^3.  
This is equal to 1.386x10^18 m^3.  
An Olympic pool is 50 m long, 25 m wide, and between 2 and 3 m deep. So the smallest possible pool is:  
50 m x 25 m x 2 m = 2,500 m^3  
The largest possible pool is:  
50 m x 25 m x 3 m = 3,750 m^3  
The distance to the moon is 384,400 km (3.844x10^8 m).  

**For the smallest possible pool**
Calculate the number of pools
1.386x10^18 m^3 / 2,500 m^3 = 5.544x10^14 pools  
Calculate the total distance covered by the pools
5.544x10^14 x 50 m = 2.772x10^16 m
Calculate the number of times to the moon
2.772x10^16 m / 3.844x10^8 m = 72,112,382
Calculate the number of times to the moon and back
72,112,382 / 2 = 36,056,191

**For the largest possible pool**
Calculate the number of pools
1.386x10^18 m^3 / 3,750 m^3 = 3.696x10^14 pools  
Calculate the total distance covered by the pools
3.696x10^14 x 50 m = 1.848x10^16 m
Calculate the number of times to the moon
1.848x10^16 m / 3.844x10^8 m = 48,074,922
Calculate the number of times to the moon and back
48,074,922 / 2 = 24,037,461  

So depending on the size of the pools they could **reach the moon and back between 24.04 million and 36.06 million times!**

	<TEXT> An Olympic pool is 0.0000025 km^3.  

1 km^3 = 1,000,000,000 m^3  

To visualise it imagine a huge cube with sides length 1 km.  
This is 1 km x 1 km x 1 km = 1 km^3  
or  
1000 m x 1000 m x  1000 m = 1,000,000,000 m^3.

So if you multiply your final answer by 1 million you get the actual answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I worked out the length of rope required to fill 1 km^2 and then multiplied that by the number of square kilometres on Earth. Still effectively the same calculation, but just in a different order. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought so too, I even re-did the calculation in a slightly different way to check it. I got the same answer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The surface area of Earth is 510.1millionkm. This is equal to 510.1 trillion m^2  

One inch = 0.0254 m  

Dividing the surface area by the width of rope finds the length of rope needed.  
510.1 trillion m^2 / 0.0254 m = 20.1 quadrillion m

This is long enough to reach the moon and back 26.1 million times. </TEXT>
