Thousands.  You'll begin to recognize patterns this way, and associations accordingly.  But, a specific question when drawing, well, a focal point is just that.

	<TEXT> I like the celtic cross spread...over 25 years, I found that I had devised my own positions for  the cards...go with what feels comfortable.  And do thousands of mock readings, just so as to learn the cards and their patterns....thousands and thousands of mock readings for practice and gut feelings.  Any spread that you are most comfy with that you remember positions best.  You can build off of known spreads to develop your own. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't trust The Moon card in any position, and these three together in my experience would say that this trauma has the potential to rob you of everything you thought you knew....take time to yourself, and re-analyze your assumptions.

	<TEXT> Take a lot of notes, and pay attention to patterns that repeat.  Do A LOT of mock up readings, and i mean a lot.  Use a spread that you find comfortable. Pay attention to groupings of cards, like a triplicate of the more devastating cards (The Moon, The Tower, Knight of Swords, one after another after another, are significant to extreme violence, even when the individual card by itself may/may not be that intense, when in a tight group of three, the definition becomes enhanced).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have found that doing readings for strangers are the most accurate; when I read for my friends, I'm going to read into the reading what I already know to be going on in their lives, so its kind of like cold reading.  A stranger, just look into the cards and the patterns that show.  You'll know by their reactions if you're onto something. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd say each encounter w/ a stranger who is threatening is unique; what works with this guy may not work with another...sometimes telling your would-be perpetrator what you think he wants to hear, stalling for time, may be a good bet....if you know someone to be arriving soon that can help you; other times, 'pulling rank', as in 'I'm crazier than you are', could be a good bet.  You just have to hope whatever mask you pull out of your arsenal will be something they find frightening.  You wouldn't want such a bluff to get called.  The fact that this person is in your home uninvited, he may be easier to spook than you may think.  Act unpredictably.  If you are on a subway, or in a bar, and you feel like someone is watching you, pick your nose. Do something gross.  Play 'hard to want'. 
     Best off is to listen to your gut instincts; if someone seems off/not quite right, they probably aren't.  Don't nay-say yourself.  Better to be safe than sorry.  I'm not law enforcement, I'm just a woman in her late forties who has had her fair share of questionable encounters, and I'm glad to say that I am not prime victim real estate; I hope.  So far so good.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw someone/something ? I believed to be my best friend/roommate...walking into his bedroom, wearing clothes I had never seen him wear. As I spoke to him, *he* asked me to whom was I speaking...asked me from another part of the basement. ? Who/what I saw and spoke to...that's the question.  The apparition was complete, with details like hair and clothes intact.  Not that unique of an experience...not where I live. I'm used to it by now...activity seems to ramp up whenever we renovate or rearrange things. At least when I first moved in, there were a lot of places that had not been tended to or cleaned in 40 years, literally...that was when sightings and weird activity was at its most active.
     the cat has one story to contribute.  One evening she  looked at my face, then over and behind my head...and freaked the hell out.  If cats could scream like *Newt* from *Aliens*, well, she screamed like that, and took off running through the room counterclockwise (which was not arranged at all to accommodate this), finally stopping where she had started from, still looking behind me for whatever scared the shit out of her like it did. She was breathing heavy, fully dilated eyes, and could barely be soothed for hours following.  ?? </TEXT>
