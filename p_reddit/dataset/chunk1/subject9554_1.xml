[Cutting down the old pine tree](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=fbYZ9inXc4c)

O, they cut down the ole pine tree
And they hauled it away to th mill
To make a coffin of pine, for that sweetheart of mine
When they cut down the ole pine tree
She's not alone in her grave tonight
For it's there my heart will always be
Tho' we drifted apart, they cut down my heart
When they cut down the ole pine
