	<TEXT> It's a story that's been playing out on Facebook and Twitter with growing frequency among friends, family members, colleagues and acquaintances as an already contentious presidential campaign between Romney and President Barack Obama enters its final, frenzied weeks. Your close friends may share your political views, but that eccentric uncle, former co-worker or high school classmate may not.
Nearly one-fifth of people admit to blocking, unfriending or hiding someone on social media over political postings, according to a recent survey by the Pew Research Center's Internet   American Life Project. The biggest gripes: The offending person posted too often about politics, disagreed with others' updates, or bothered mutual friends with partisan political postings. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is your life. Do what you love, and do it often. If you dont like something, change it. If you dont like your job, quit. If you dont have enough time, stop watching TV. If you are looking for the love of your life, stop. They will be waiting for you when you start doing things you love. Stop analyzing. All emotions are beautiful. When you eat, appreciate every last bite. Life is simple. Open your mind, arms, and heart to new things and people. We are united in our differences. Ask the next person you see what their passion is and share your inspiring dream with them. Travel often; getting lost will help you find yourself. Some opportunities only come once, seize them. Life is about the people you meet, and the things you create with them, so go out and start creating. Life is short. Live your dream and share your passion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ugadi marks the first day of the new year, it's the first day of Chaitra which is the first month of the Indian calendar (Panchanga). This day is marked by symbolic eating of a specific mixture of six tastes called Ugadi Pachhadi in Telugu and Bevu-Bella in Kannada which symbolizes the fact that life is a mixture of different experiences (sadness, happiness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise), which should be accepted together and with equanimity through the New Year. While the people of Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh use the term Yugadi/Ugadi for their New Year's festival, the people of Maharashtra term the same festival, observed on the same day, Gudi Padwa (Marathi:  ). Marwari, people of Rajasthan celebrate the same day as their new year day Thapna. Sindhis, people from Sindh, celebrate the same day as their New Year day Cheti Chand. Manipuris also celebrate their New Year (Sajibu Cheiraoba) on the same day. It is observed as Baisakhi in Punjab and Puthandu in Tamil Nadu. It is also celebrated in Mauritius.

It's unreal but it can be found at every 7/11 store the company is called N-Joy. The starter kit with charger and everything u need will be $19. Refills are damn cheap. I living in Chicago paid $16 a day for 2 packs. I've only spent the $19 for the past 5 days. I never thought I could quit, the E-Cig proved me wrong!!! </TEXT>
