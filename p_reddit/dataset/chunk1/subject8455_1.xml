	<TEXT> Hey, guys. 
I wanted to share a story from my childhood. Might not be so scary, but it's factual. 
We were still living in the apartment where I spent most of my childhood. I was about 10 years old at the time, and still shared a room with my little sister. 
One night I couldn't fall asleep right away, so I kept tossing and turning constantly. Our room wasn't so dark, as we lived on the 3rd floor and street lights were painting the walls.
Now, the door of our room is half-made of glass. Both mine and my sister's beds were put in such an angle that it was no problem for us to keep an eye on it whatever position we slept in.
So, I'm tossing and turning, when I happen to look at the door.
There I see our mother, just standing on the other side of the glass, looking through. (Even though it was dark, so what the hell was she looking at anyway).
Or at least I thought it was her. At the time I did, since the figure wore a night gown similar to one of my mom's, with blue flowers on it. 
So, a few seconds after I saw it, it turned away and started walking towards the kitchen. I thought that Mom was thirsty or something, but I didn't see the kitchen light turning on (I would have, because it would illuminate the hall and I'd see it through the glass door). Nor did I hear a sound whatsoever.
I thought it was strange, and the next day I asked Mom if she had got up during the night, and she denied. Plus, turned out she wore a different sleep ware then.
Till this day I can't explain what this was; a ghost? Or just a contorted vision of my half-asleep mind? I never had any experience similar to it ever again; this was the closest I've ever encountered to might having been paranormal.
What do you think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because it's freakishly scary! :( Maybe there's a place in the walls or the floor that is hollow and there's some sort of animal living in there? Or weird pipes?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could be a psycho stalker... Could be a previous tenant from the 3rd floor who made a copy of the key without his landlord knowing and when he found out it was just you there he started harassing you. </TEXT>
