	<TEXT> * Height: 5'6"

* CW: 124 :( i binged last night and am hoping this is because i haven't pooped yet. 

* HW: 136

* LW: 114 ish

* GW: 115

* UGW: 110

* WL: ~13 pounds

* BMI: 19.9

* Age: 21

* Gender expression: F

So i have always wanted to lose weight and look very skinny but not overly boney (its not a good look on me) and thought that 110 would be too small. But after seeing what people on here look like at similar weights and heights and after researching different thinspo of girls around that height and weight, I decided to change my UGW! Im so excited!

	<TEXT> The whole thing just made me feel like he settled for me because he couldn't get her and masturbated to her instead of thinking of me.. Like ever, because she was better than me. I remember he used to make fun of her valley girl "accent" and stuff when we heard her talking next door and I thought it was funny too actually! Then one night we were drunk and standing outside his room in our dorm on Halloween and she was wearing a slutty outfit and when she walked by he said "God damn!" Right in front of my face.. I felt so ashamed. I let that slide and didn't bring it up. Then like a few months later I had to use him computer bc mine broke (which he allowed me to do) and After trying to google something in chrome, it kept auto filling the search bar to her profile and through a gut feeling and then questioning him about the nature and time he was viewing these photos, he eventually told me why he kept looking her up. 

We're still together, and I'm still obviously not past this but am trying to be. I no longer bring it up to him anymore because if we're gonna stay together, bringing this up will only make things worse. I only feel ok talking about this to complete strangers now :/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My boyfriend masturbated to photos of our dorm neighbor, who he tried to get with before me. And he did it regularly. She was stick thin, tiny, and your typical basic bitch sorority girl. Since then I started having major body image issues and after an event earlier this summer where we went to the beach and I caught him checking out girls who looked and had the same build of the same girl he jerked off too, I kind of went off the deep end and no longer looked at my body the same. Since that time in May, I've lost over 13 pounds and plan to keep going until I look and feel tiny. I don't blame him for my ED, because I know at the end of the day he's not the one restricting my food, but I do think the circumstances made existing body image issues a million times worse and led me to develop this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i feel the same exact way. i have a few days sometimes in a week where ill eat kinda normally without purging it, and ill think that maybe i dont have an eating disorder, or maybe now my boyfriend thinks im cured or that i should stop talking to my therapist about it, but other days ill fast until 8 and then eat a small meal and call it a day. I feel like no one would ever be able to tell i have a problem with my eating habits unless i dropped to a unhealthy-looking weight. I started out at 136 and am now 123-124 and NO ONE has said anything...it even makes me question if my body looks any different at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahah this is what I tried to do. I ended up with a lying boyfriend. I ended up being the one who had to compromise. 

I was incredibly upfront. right after we started hooking up and then became exclusive I told him this deal breaker and said that even though it's embarrassing, that this is just the way I feel. He said that's not a problem for him and that he wouldn't look at porn because he wanted to be together. A month or so later I found out he was lying to me but I stayed with him and tried to change myself. I still am with him and still don't feel completely comfortable with it but it's gotten a bit better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your response :) Quite honestly i wrote this when i was upset because he was supposed to be back at 7 and we were going to go out to our favorite restaurant for dinner and i put on a dress and got ready but he had to cancel :/. It just sucked and made me wonder if this is going to happen often in the future because of the nature of his job.

 I am definitely going to see how things are in the next few months. Also, i did text him and tell him i was a little upset about this and worried that his job was gonna screw up time we spend together because he will constantly be checking his work phone/canceling dates/leaving early from things etc. He told me that since they just opened up at a new location, they're getting new workers. He told me he wouldn't stay if it were like this all the time, but he signed up for this knowing it would be rough until they hire more employees. 

Also the relationship has been under a ton of stress in the past year, due to unrelated things. I guess i just jumped to doubts and negative thoughts and ended up on the road to my own little self-fulfilling prophecy. Now that i've thought this through, it seems what's best is to be more patient and as always, effectively communicate these thoughts/concerns to him. Thanks again (: </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone! I'm going to be going grocery shopping soon for the first time since I've been seriously restricting. I was wondering if you guys could please post some items you get with the estimated amount of calories each item is! Also it may be helpful to note I tend to learn more towards savory rather than sweet when I snack. 

Some items I already buy are pickles, boca burgers, tons of lettuce, eggs to hard boil, and light tuna fish. Let me know :)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, i know i was super surprised my body looks this different after just 9 pounds but i guess its because i wasnt too big to begin with, but i still have a LONG way to go lol.

As for my hair, thats funny you even bring it up! I was just thinking about going lighter. It's currently ombre (or balayage, basically the same thing tbh) from a chestnut brown to a light (unfortunately yellowish) blonde. It looks more ashy in the photo. There are some parts of it that are lighter blonde because i had highlights previously and they grew out, so dying over them just made them lighter. As for toner, when i got it done i just told my hairdresser that i really wanted it to be as ashy as possible because yellow-blonde would not flatter me. She did her best and it was relatively ashy at first, but i didn't keep up with it and it turned pretty warm and yellow. Since i am no hairdresser, the best suggestion i could give you is to visit your stylist again and ask her to tone your hair. If you tell her you weren't happy with the tone she gave you or were upset it faded really fast, its possible she may tone it for a cheap price or even free!

 Sorry, i guess i don't have too much advice to give here!

EDIT: and yes, i did ask my stylist to lift it as light as she could go :)

I forgot the pepper but THIS WAS JUST WHAT I NEEDED!! I'm relatively new to the whole restricting game so I'm getting used to it but this really filled me up and was like barely any calories!

	<TEXT> thats what i actually have tried! I even was ok with him playing for like 8 hours today when I was at work but asked him to stop playing when i got back but he didnt even do that. I told him that if he played for like 2-3 hours a day that would be OK which i think is relatively reasonable..right? Or is that not? Im really not sure. I dont want to go all controlling and stuff ahhhh.

And yeah we have played together so many times. i would even play longer than 3 hours (my usual gaming time) to spend more time with him. We did that for awhile and it was fine but that was ON TOP OF his other gaming throughout the day!

EDIT: To add to the fact that he continued gaming when i got back from work, I am just more annoyed that I have to ASK him to stop repeatedly and he always asks for a little more time and I usually give in and say fine, but a little time turns into hours and then i turn into a "nag", as he says. </TEXT>

And yeah youre right, I shouldnt yell. I just get so upset when i get home from work and everything's a mess and my own significant other doesnt even want to spend time with me :| i hope you can understand. i truly love this man but his behavior has been making me really upset and im having trouble understanding it. 

What do you suggest saying if i do ask him to talk about this? I just feel like ive tried everything. I used to try calm conversations but after they didnt work my frustration would turn outward into anger!  </TEXT>

He stopped for two weeks when i discussed it with him, but picked it back up when he bought a new game. i guess it must be just that he prioritizes them over spending time with me...unless im just not really understanding what addiction is which could totally be a possibility!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Green tea pills? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Anyone have any experiences they can share with me after using green tea pills? I want to try them out to control urges to binge and have heard good things about them. Green tea itself doesn't seem to do the trick for me unfortunately. 

If anyone have other suggestions for pills/supplements I could take, that would be much appreciated :)  </TEXT>
