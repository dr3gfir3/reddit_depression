	<TEXT> I don't mean to sound like an asshole here

but maybe a lot of woman are terrible at judging mens behavior (of course, not a all men "show" some murdery side of themselves) 

but a lot of woman stay with violent men, because they "love" them.. i at least hear this quite often. a woman was  beaten up and threatened quite a lot by her husband for years, before she was able to see that she needed to leave.

So out of those 11766 victims, how many were in abusive relationships before the actual murder?

I'm NOT saying it's the victims fault in those cases, im just saying there might have been signs for them to leave and get help, before it's too late. And that info could be used today, to save more woman from a potential murderer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i completed both games in a few hours and ive had absolutely no interest in going back and replaying them.

Sure the concept is nice and its an interesting setting but it really doesnt offer much when you look past that.

the puzzles are easy and there's not too much variety and its very short. and theres absolutely no replay value.

I'd love some "Actual" game set within the portal universe with a portal gun, and we might see it.. who know. but portal in its current state seems more like ... proof of concept or something, rather than an actually super awesome game that most people seem to consider it. 

also, try to elaborate. you dont think portal 1 and 2 are easy puzzle games without replay value? </TEXT>

using another browser changes nothing

i run no extensions etc. freshly formatted pc. and worked a few hours ago no problems

up until now i did have some luck searching for a video on google - and then go to videos and clicking something there, but that no longer works either

edit: searching google and clicking a video there works - its just quite slow :P

It also loads NOTHING.. it's only the video itself (And regular video controls, such as resolution and volume). no comments, no like button, no suggested videos etc. </TEXT>

install "DSFix" and use a controller. (Dsfix gives 60 fps cap instead of 30 and you can also adjust the resolution of textures and such)

Get dsfix here

http://blog.metaclassofnil.com/?tag=dsfix

im not gonna spoil the game for you at all. stun1ock said it best. Dont level up resitance and kill the dogs first.

also good luck and dont rush yourself. and preferably do NOT look up spoilers, please. don't do it. you'll ruin your own experience with the game.

If you get completely lost, you can come here and ask for some tips and pointers. (preferably spoiler free ones) </TEXT>
