	<TEXT> Currently trying to get some more information, but we're starting new rounds of testing soon. The testing always has some side effects so my ability to post may be off for a bit. They haven't let me see anyone else who has survived yet, I'm concerned about this.   I'll try to get a complete update compiled with what new information I can find within the next few days. Thank you for your support, the testing is always a pain... </TEXT>

I was always a background character in my life. I never stood out in any way, which is perhaps why I was one of less than ten who survived. In a large city that would be an incredibly low rate of survival, even in a small town it was abysmal. Less than ten, out of hundreds. I have a thing for numbers, not obsessively though. I'm not overtly good at math or calculations, I never even got the chance to go to college before the "events" took place. What a mockery of brutal genocide, They call it an "event" as though it was some show you could purchase cheap tickets to and watch for pure amusement. It feels like that's what They did, but they won't admit it. They'll never admit it to anyone, because they need more "events" and more results. More research. More tests. We were subjects, and you could be one too. 


Everyone in the lab is asleep now, it took me weeks of close watching to figure out the series of numbers they use to password each computer in the building. Every computer is a different sequence of numbers, but I've developed a good memory of numbers. 427. That number is always stuck in my head. Anyways, I'm off track again, and I need to quicken my pace of typing before someone wakes up and realizes I've left my room. I chose the computer furthest from my room to lessen the chances of being found right away if they see my empty bed, and to throw suspicion off myself if they were to find out about this information leak. This was the first place I could think to go that might believe me... But okay, I really need to get going on this so they can't keep it a secret anymore.

I can't remember how long ago it started, I've been stuck here for what feels like years, but They tell me we've only been in observation for seven months, and that the "event" only happened over a course of three weeks. Those three weeks may have been an eternity, I don't believe that They would tell us the truth now. When it started though, no one realized that it was the beginning of the end. 

I wanted to become a journalist I recall, not the shady type who sought out celebrities to stalk, but the honest type who could bring truthful news to our town. Our town of 427 citizens. I wasn't a journalist though, I was a 19-year-old girl with an unknown father and a mother who could barely hold the title. She was a bar crawler even at the aged of 51, but these details aren't that important. All I did was work the cash part-time at the local gas station, and all my money went to paying bills on a rundown trailer that was barely livable. It was in the woods though, so at least no one had to see where I spent my nights. Just another thing that I attribute to my survival though, enough about me though, you need to hear what They did to us.

The day everything all started I was wandering around the town clinic. I was curious about what kind of story I might find by judging the minor injuries and ailments the townspeople came in for. I had never ventured to the clinic unless I was hurt, and on this visit it struck me as odd how advanced it was for being in such a meager populated area. It had more medical equipment than I'd expect based on out population, but it made a sort of sense given the fact that our town was literally surrounded by hundreds of miles of forest, with the nearest hospital being over an hour away by helicopter. People didn't come or go much simply because of our isolation, we really had all the necessities. 

I'm rambling on again, but you can understand the general idea of how the "event" was entirely missed by the rest of the world. in the town of 427 people there were 34 pregnant women, 156 children age eighteen or under, 93 people over the age of fifty ("elderly"), and 144 adults aged nineteen to forty-nine (not including the pregnant women). This is important to me. Population: 427.

In the clinic that day, every single one of the pregnant women came in. Some had regular check-ups, but some said they were feeling off and worried about their growing fetuses. I won't go into extreme detail here, but through my lurking the halls and such I learned that every mother in her first trimester had miscarried, 15 women in the same day. I could tell that the clinic staff was very concerned about this, but they didn't alert any of the women to the fact that it happened to all of them. The other 19 women who were further along had worse issues after examination. Each and every women had no signs of life in their wombs, and upon extensive testing by the doctors to see if they had miscarried, they found something even more disheartening. Those 19 women left the clinic with the news that instead of a baby, there were large tumors, and that they would need to come back to schedule an appointment for treatment and surgery at a real hospital, as the clinic didn't have the means to deal with this.That was day one, 34 fetuses lost, population remaining at 427. 



Through the next week, I stayed around the clinic to see if I could learn some of the results of various tests that the clinic did run on the mothers. I never saw the mothers from the group of 15 return, which I thought was strange, as I was sure there would be follow-up appointments to make sure their bodies healthily made it through the loss. Only 8 of the women who had grown tumors showed up to the clinic. My eavesdropping told me that all of the women should have returned for further examination, but by the end of the week they had all stopped coming in. Upon sending in friends of the women to see why they had stopped appearing for appointments, brutal scenes were found. 12 women in the group of 15 lived with family. It appeared that each had gone on a murderous rampage, every family member had been gutted in their beds. The women were all without eyes, they had torn them from their sockets with their bare hands, and each one seemed to have cut open their own wombs to check for a life that had disappeared. It was assumed that they bled to death from the self-inflicted injuries. 12 women, 12 fathers, 9 children, and 4 of the elderly were among those deaths. The 3 women who lived without family had all brutalized themselves in the same manner, though one had 4 other young children, whose eyes she had torn out after brutally stabbing each of them over a hundred times, and their teenaged babysitter. Population: 382.

The other 19 women were also found dead, though in a much different way. It seemed the tumors had grown so much in those few days that they tore through the stomach of each woman. Instead of looking as one would expect, the witnesses said that it appeared a large, jagged, sickly green type of crystal formation had pierced through the women from the inside, and that the homes smelled as if the bodies had rotted for weeks. Every family member who was in the home when the crystallizations violently thrusted themselves through layers of uterus and skin was found dead as well. 14 fathers had drowned, strangled, suffocated, stabbed, burned, hung or buried their own children alive, and anyone else in the home. 11 elderly, 7 adult children or visitors, and 29 more children dead, and each of those men had torn out their eyes and thrown themselves off the highest point in their homes afterwards. The other 5 mothers were found dead the same way, but each of them save one woman had another child living at home. Those 4 children tore out their mothers eyes as well as their own, and then threw their bodies on top of their deceased mothers so that they were sickeningly speared through in a final embrace. Population: 298.

The town was in shock, no one had any idea what could be going on. The 36 elderly, 17 adults, and 12 teenagers who helped identify and report the deaths of these families all became sick within hours, and these volunteers included half the medical staff in town. Almost the entire town had gone to the clinic to demand to know what was going on, everyone was trying to call out and get help from a larger hospital, from police, or even the CDC due to the strange nature of deaths, but all the lines were dead. Cell reception, internet, data, landlines, and any form of communication we had, was useless. No one had noticed when it happened, the town had spent the entire day trying to find these women, and then tallying up the gruesome deaths. People were enraged, but none more so than the 65 individuals who had gone near the "infected" homes, as the townsfolk were now calling it. I watched the gathering from a distance, I didn't know anyone in the crowd well enough to feel like joining in, and since my few days at the clinic I'd been wary of all people in general. I was afraid. The people exposed to the homes were very angry, it didn't take long for the violence to erupt. As the "exposed" began fighting, they also began changing. Blood began to leak from their eyes, and tiny green crystallizations were appearing to tear jagged holes as they erupted from the skin all over their bodies. 

Those who had not been exposed, quickly noticed the malformations appearing on the other townsfolk, and some ran to their cars and sped off, others ran for shelter indoors, and I suppose those that considered themselves brave were the ones who reached for weapons. I watched this all from a second story window above a store, relieved that I could wait til the obvious bloodbath was over before trying to leave town like some had. Few of those who stayed to attempt to fight the exposed had real weapons, there were some small knives, some wooden posts wrenched from nearby fences, and a handgun or two. I'm not a fighter myself, I couldn't tell you what they were, but I could tell you that it was pretty rare in our town for people to actually bother owning a gun. Suffice to say defenses were low, and the defenders only numbered about 50 people. They were torn apart. The exposed came together and ripped, clawed, scratched, bit, and used every sharp little crystallization they'd grown as a weapon against the people trying to ward them off. When the bloodbath was over the street looked like Mardi Gras, if streamers and confetti were blood, bone, and trails of internal organs. Those people were destroyed, and what was left of them began forming small crystallizations. 


I watched from my lookout spot as the infected people began to tear themselves apart in the street, there were a few of the defenders children standing by, I feel bad that they didn't have the guidance to run, and I was too a


**Edit: One of Them was wandering the halls and I could think of no other thing to do than submit what I had so far, everything seems clear and I'll continue my account of events now, just for clarity I will repeat that sentence I was writing** 


I watched from my lookout spot as the infected people began to tear themselves apart in the street, there were a few of the defenders children standing by, I feel bad that they didn't have the guidance to run, and I was too afraid to draw attention to myself to try and yell for them to run away. They faced the same fate as the others. I decided then I should seek out something to filter the air, in case it really was some type of infection that they were breathing. I had a thick cloth over my face for a few days before I found an incredibly old gas mask in an elderly man's abandoned house. I felt the need to tally up deaths again: 65 exposed, 47 who attempted to defend (22 adults, 7 teenagers, 18 elderly), and 13 children who were torn apart in the aftermath. Population: 173.

 

It was just a few days after the bloody fight the other children started getting sick. I think this was almost two weeks into the disaster we were facing, and it was hard to watch. It was the youngest first. People were bringing in their babies and toddlers who had blood pouring from their eyes, by the time they got in to see the few remaining doctors, they had already died and the disgusting crystallizations were growing directly through their eyes. The medical staff had no explanations, they didn't have the knowledge and advanced technology to determine the cause of death. 49 children died within two days, some of the older ones tried to rip out their eyes before dying. Not long after the epidemic of children, our remaining medical staff became infected like the rest, went on a rampage and tore apart anyone in the care of the clinic, they had much more gruesome ways considering the available equipment they had. 27 adults and 6 of the elderly were in the clinic that day. The gore of the scene had people losing hope in the one place they thought might be able to save them. Nothing like watching through the window as a nurse attempt to sew her crystallized eyes into another persons body before violently crushing her skull with a repeatedly slammed door. I could almost imagine the smell as I watched the green crystals grow from the bloody remains of people, and slice their way from beneath the skin of those who were barely people at all anymore. Population: 91.



People left in the town began to panic even more when they wanted to leave and recalled those who had tried to leave town had never come back, nor had they gotten to truly leave. A few of the braver adults in the town went to see if the families and individuals had made it out of town, only to discover that we were entirely fenced in with electric wire. According to those that witnessed  the fence, it appeared that everyone who tried to leave got out of their cars to walk up to the fence, only to be shot as soon as they were within 300 feet. Some tried to drive through the fence, but bullets go through windshields, imagine that. It seemed the fence was stronger than the cars that managed to drive into it. Every passenger with the people who tried to leave was executed as soon as they exited the vehicle, and those who remained hidden ended up as infected and dead anyways. I think my mother was in one of those cars. 22 children, 30 adults, and 5 elderly died at that fence. Population: 34. I was tired of counting, we were nearly done. I didn't want to be near people, and to hear how many more were slaughtered by their neighbors, themselves, or whoever was keeping us inside this fence. I suppose it was probably by halfway through week two that I ran off into the woods and hid in my trailer, wearing a gas mask that probably belonged to an old man who was turned to vile and infectious green crystal. 


It felt like I was in that trailer for months, I had no idea how long it had been since everything began. Even now it all seems like it happened too fast. Soon I began to run low on food, and the will to go on when death seemed so inevitable. I had no idea that I was walking out from one prison into another. As I hit the main street I noticed that the gore and crystals were gone. I wasn't sure what to think, but the town seemed completely devoid of people. I gave up at that point, I had nothing outside or inside this town, no one would believe me if I was able to leave, and what if I was the last person alive here? I went to take off my mask and hoped the infection would take me with everyone else, but  before I could lift it over my face I felt a sharp prick in my thigh. By the time I looked down to see the cause, the world was a blur and I was falling..


I woke up in this facility. I have no idea where I am or entirely what has happened. All they have really said is that I survived a tragic event, I'm in a special care facility to heal, and that I was one of 9 who survived and was very lucky. They don't seem very happy that I'm "lucky" though...

So you're all caught up, and here's where I am at right now: I've looked through some of the files on this computer, since it seems they thought the password was enough to keep some of the information on the "event" un-encrypted, or whatever it is that people who are actually good with technologically do to keep their things private. I'll tell you what I've gathered from the few unlocked files. It seems that the government owns this place, the files often have "Med_Sci/PopCtrl" in the labels. Most of the files are confusing and hard to read, and there is no copy, paste, screenshot, printscreen or any type of tool I can find on this computer that isn't somehow blocked  so that it does not function. I found what looks like the file on my town, it's not very specific. It appears to have some chemical formulas, but I can't understand them and my mind goes kind of white when I try to write them down. Some notes that basically say, "chemical:  *%###$*, t#### release date: $ /#@/16, Loc: E$% * Springs, 97.9% success rate, test ####". I don't know what to make of everything there, every time I look at it I feel like I'm forgetting something... It almost hurts to look at the stuff in the file for my town. but E#### sp%%%% is definitely its name.

I have to go now I think I hear them searching for me.

I'll try to update if I can get back on one of the computers again, but I have no idea what else I could find that might stop them from causing another "event". Hopefully they don't expect anyone at the facility to leak information, but even if they find it doesn't mean they can hide the truth.

**We have removed the update to this, please disregard this falsified report of events. We apologize to those who may have read and tried to look into this situation, it is a great inconvenience to both our facility and you, the readers. For the sake of keeping things clear, I am a representative of a government funded psychological research institution. The above account was written by a severely delusional patient. We cannot release any further information, as our work is extremely private, and shall one day be groundbreaking for those who face mental illness. Once again, on behalf of our facility, I apologize for allowing the release of all of this information. We'll be seeing you all soon, once our research is complete and ready for global release!**

	<TEXT> Ahh on my old account things like this killed me, I wrote a little three part series and EVERY SINGLE PART had comments like, "Well why didn't you break a window" "Why didnt you call the police and tell them" "Where did the locks come from" "Why didn't you fight back and leave" etc, when half these things were explained in the story. And those comments got more upvotes than the story itself, so the entire believability was shit upon. Call the police and tell them my husbands doppelganger is trying to kill me? Break a window that was barred over every time he entered the house? Even stated in the story something along the lines of the house seeming to enter a different dimension when the doppelganger appeared, where there was no escape. 

But there was also no escape from nearly every comment critizing the lack of the MC's ability to escape, and why these things are happening. 

If the writer in the story says "I have no idea how this is happening" then I assume you are a dick for leaving comments asking how it happened. It's like asking for proof, there is not always supposed to be a solid answer in horror, and that should add to the terrifying effect. 

Admittedly my example story was not well written, but the comments were just out of hand in general.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Perfection </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-21 01:50:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Before my final tasks of today, I have to let someone, somewhere know. This needs to be heard in case it ever happens again. I can't be crazy, I know it, and I truly hope I'm about to end this all tonight. In case I don't, the people of /r/nosleep seem to be the ones who will keep this in mind. When I'm done here, I will have done all that I can.

Have you ever heard of the children's game called "Perfection"? If you haven't played it, heard of it, or gotten the ridiculously catchy jingle from the commercials stuck in your head once before (to the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel"), let me explain it a bit. Perfection is a game in which you are given a red box-like contraption with a blue top that pops up, and is covered in differently shaped slots which you are to fit small corresponding yellow pieces into, all before the the timer runs out. When it does, well, "**POP!** Goes Perfection!". 


As a child I was obsessed with the game, I thought I had it mastered. I could get every single one of those little, yellow shapes into their slots before the timer ended, and then "**POP!**", my meticulous work was scattered as the blue top popped out and destroyed the wonderfully perfect puzzle I had finished. One thing about this game that irked me so, was the fact that I could never prove to anyone that I could actually do it.


Being so young at the time, no one thought I could fit together so many randomized pieces into their perfect locations under the time constraint, "Elizabeth, you'll get it one day, you don't need to pretend, I'll bet it's rigged so no one could do it at all!" My mother smiled at this, she thought it was childish pride just trying to be something more than I was. To my six year old dismay, each attempt to prove that I had done it was somehow thwarted. If I asked someone to watch me, it seemed the timer had sped up and I had less than half the pieces placed before the sudden "**POP!**". It infuriated me, I had tried countless methods, switching off the game after I had completed the task, only to find that by the time I had brought someone in to look the timer had reset to the start, and they merely assumed I had filled all the slots without turning the game on.


"Now honey," my father had once scolded, "There's no pride in cheating, it really doesn't matter if you beat the game. But enough of the silly lying, there's no reason for it.". I **KNEW** that I had beat the game, that I had achieved the goal of Perfection, but I had no way to prove it to anyone but myself. I must have tried hundreds of times to show people, but no one ever believed my young self could do it, especially because no one else in my family ever had. My brother, older by two years, had only ever gotten about 75% into slots on his best days. My parents, aunts, uncles, any adult in my life I knew, simply couldn't finish in time either. They were always several pieces short, and became frustrated with my need to prove that it could be done, and that I was the one who could do it. 


In my daily routine I'd hum the little jingle while I did the meager amount of chores a child of that age has, I was always pleased with my work after it was done, because it was another thing I knew I was doing right. It seemed no one else saw it, the clothes I put away nicely folded in my drawers were always scattered about my room, the toys I had put away in the boxes before bed were set up as if I had spent the night playing instead of sleeping. Everyday I was reprimanded for my pride of doing my tasks so well, when no one ever saw that they were done at all. "Elizabeth, your lying is getting out of hand. There is absolutely no need to pretend you've done your chores just so you can obsess over that ridiculous game! I'm going to take it away if things don't start shaping up with you.", My father was almost at his limit with Perfection.


I was insistent though upon the fact that I was doing everything *perfectly*, and my wording on that was enough for me to be taken to a child psychologist who worked in town. I don't remember much of him, he was an odd tall man, with a smile that was awkwardly large and forced. The most I recall of the hushed conversation was some mention of a possible form of OCD, and some talk of how I may be intentionally leaving things amiss because of the lack of belief everyone had when I thought I was doing things correctly. I'm not really sure if he helped my parents at all, I just know when I spoke to him I had a sick feeling in my stomach, like he was looking for something dark and wrong inside me, and stirring it around.


After so much of my insistence that I had done it, that it really was PERFECT and complete, and exactly as it should be, my parents decided that perhaps I should just stop playing the game and focus on other things. They kind of forced it in fact, I remember seeking out the game one day while I was upset about chores I had done, but apparently *hadn't* done.


Over the years I lost interest in the game itself, but the jingle from the commercials always popped into my head at random moments, "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock, POP! Goes Perfection!*" It started out as just occasional, something I found myself humming while performing random tasks that I was pleased at doing, and the more pleased I was at finishing the task, the worse everyone else saw the results of. 


Around the age of 13, I discovered the game put up in my old closet, and decided to take it down and test out my old skills to see if I still had what it took. Each and every time, I completed it with several seconds to spare, and began singing the little jingle to myself as I restarted my scattered masterpiece over and over again. It felt good to be doing something right that no one could tell me I was doing wrong. Eventually my mother walked in to see me back at my childish obsession. I hadn't realized she was there, I had just started placing pieces, and singing the jingle when it suddenly popped and scattered less than 10 seconds after the timer had started. I looked up to see her standing in the doorway, she chuckled quietly and sighed, "About to start high school, and you're still fixated on that little game that you just can't seem to beat." I frowned in dismay, *why can I not seem to achieve Perfection when others are around?* 


Throughout that summer I played the game in private, pleased with myself at the speed and ease of which I accomplished the game. Right before I was about to begin my Freshman year, I decided to put the old game back up in the closet. I was already one of the youngest to be in my class, I didn't need anyone outside of my family thinking I was obsessed with childish games. 


My troubles continued in high school itself though. I had been an excellent student in elementary and junior high, my grades always excelled and I was a quick learner, but something more than the just the natural teenaged hormones I was starting to gain. More and more often I found myself humming the jingle, especially when it was test time. It seemed to calm me. That year approximately half my tests were missing answers that I could swear I had written, I even told the teachers out loud what I had responded on the test with, and they simply thought I was being lazy and skipping questions I didn't know, and then studying them later to make it by for exam time. I had no idea what was going on, and my teachers were becoming disappointed in my grade drop. I was doing fine on everything except the tests. 


As I progressed through high school I found the jingle stuck in my head so often that it gave me migraines, over and over throughout the days it happily sang through my mind, "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*". My schoolwork overall went downhill as the song played through my mind each day, I was focused and I was getting all the correct answers for my notes, but I was turning in empty assignments I was sure I had completed, emailing in homework files that were so corrupted my teachers assumed I was intentionally trying to ruin their computers so that I could lie about finishing them, flawlessly acing tests that when I handed in were written in unintelligible gibberish.


I barely graduated, If not for my talk with a school psychologist I might not have. She never told me what she thought was wrong with me, but she seemed concerned once again that I considered all my work to be perfect. She kept a file about our meetings that I was never able to see, and she recommended my teachers give me only oral examinations. This helped greatly, I started hearing the jingle less in my head, though when I did, it now caused me a horrible stutter, which impacted my grading slightly, but I managed to scrape by. 


Somehow after that entire ordeal the psychologist from my childhood and the one from my school got together to discuss me with my parents. Being only 17 and a minor at the time, my parents had the entire say in what was going on in that department. I assumed I must be going crazy. At their recommendation, and to my family's relief, I was given a prescription to take that made the jingle disappear entirely from my head. My parents had told me that due to my "condition" the doctors requested I not be told what the medication was, only that it would help me lead a normal life. Which it honestly did for a very long time. 


I was able to function, I was actually completing the tasks that I believed I was doing, I couldn't even recall how the jingle went, or the name of the ridiculous game that drove me insane. After a few years of the medication the doctors decided I no longer needed it, and my memories should be entirely repressed by whatever it was they gave me. I was fine with not knowing, they had cured me, which was all that mattered to me at that time. If memories were to ever reoccur, I was to contact my family and we would revisit the doctors to see what needed to be done. 


I was ecstatic, my entire childhood of being haunted by a hellish game was over. I was done hearing a maddening tune in my head, I was done obsessing over the things I did wonderfully and yet somehow failed at. I was even more overjoyed at the fact that I could leave that small town and the condescending looks from the people that lived there. Half the town thought I was insane, and the more religious or superstitious folks thought I was cursed. So I moved out of state to pursue my normal life. I finally got to do what I wanted, I went to school for a financial degree, finished up and worked a modest job as a bank teller, met a lovely man named James who married me soon out of college, and a year later we had our beautiful baby girl. For a girl in her mid-twenties it was a happy life, an absolutely *perfect* life, until recently. 


My parents died in a car accident a few months ago, and apparently had left to me our old family home so that I may raise my own family there. I was saddened by the loss, but felt a sense of relief to be back in my familiar home. It was almost as if nothing had changed there, my old room looked as it had since I was a child. A pretty pale pink, a white single bed, and a closet full of old toys my mother had kept for sentimental value. My four year old Anna would adore the room for herself, I smiled as I imagined her playing with the old Barbie's and dollhouses I had left behind. 


While unpacking in the master bedroom I heard a familiar humming, something to the tune of "Pop Goes the Weasel". I felt an inner panic though I couldn't quite tell why. I went to check on my Anna, and found her sitting on her bed with a familiar looking game. Suddenly the little yellow pieces popped out their slots and I was hit with a flood of memories. I ran towards Anna and yanked the game away from her, she began to cry immediately, "Mommy! I almost did it, why are you taking it! I want to finish the game!" I felt sympathetic, I just didn't know if the game would ruin her childhood as it had mine. I sat on her bed and put my arm around her, "Honey, this game is very old, it could break very easily, so we have to keep it put away because it was a gift from Grandma, okay?." It wasn't an entire lie, but enough that she may lose interest in the game. She nodded her tear streaked face in agreement, but still pouted when I put the game on the highest shelf in the house.


I tried to get into contact with the doctors that had previously given the prescriptions to block my memories, but as the jingle played through my head, I kept dialing wrong numbers. "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*". The song was giving me a headache, I finally really did have the perfect life and a childhood game was going to ruin it all! 


I asked James if would call the numbers I had searched up, and he looked at me as though I had grown an extra head, "Sweetheart, these are numbers for decommissioned asylums, why would you want to call them?". I then explained to him the repressed memories that were now resurfacing, and the gist of the experiences in my childhood created by this silly little game. He seemed a bit skeptical, and concerned at the fact I had not divulged this information earlier in the relationship. I had touched upon the subject of going through and conquering mental illness during my childhood, but this story seemed beyond his comprehension. He didn't believe me. He thought there must be something else to it, and tried himself to search for the doctors which names I could only vaguely recall. None in this area with names even close to the ones I had thought of. It was a small town, and I knew that at least the woman who worked at my high school had to be on file somewhere, but his search turned up that the small school had never had more than a simple guidance counselor, and each one on file had been male. I felt the same stress and anxiety as I had many years ago, I was wrong when I knew I couldn't be. I knew there had been someone who had stopped this before.


In the midst of James trying to calm my nerves, I once again heard Anna humming the familiar tune. It sent me into a sort of rage, and I ran upstairs to see if she had somehow taken the game from her closet shelf. She was fast asleep, I shook my head in disbelief and dismay, *why is this happening, how can I stop this before it gets to her too?* I checked the time, it was nearly 11pm. Of course I must be hearing the jingle in my head again. I gave a resigned sigh, and went downstairs to ask James to just come to bed with me. I was sick of this day, and maybe some sleep would calm me and put things out of my mind. 


Around 1am I awoke with a start. "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*" I slipped from the bed quietly, as to not awaken James. I knew that game was going to taint my daughter as it had tainted me. I knew something had to be done. It had to go. I quietly stepped downstairs as I heard the jingle start over, this time in my daughter's voice. I was livid. I went to the front closet where we kept a bat for safety, in case of intruders or the like. I made my hastily back up the stairs to destroy the growing evil. I stepped quietly into Anna's room, and saw that she was mouthing the words to the jingle in her sleep. I sighed, fearing she was already in the clutches of this curse. I took the game from the shelf and began the timer.


I raised the bat over my head and swung with all my might. It took at least three solid hits before bloody, bloody, pulpy gore began to coat the bat, each swing felt so heavy, but my mind began to feel so light. I heard the telltale **POP** of the game scattering it's pieces, at the same time as I heard a gasp from behind me.


James stood in the doorway, pale as a ghost. He began to speak, "Elizabeth.. What have you... *Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP--*" The jingle coming from his mouth was silenced as I brought the bloody bat across his jaw. The evil of Perfection had gotten him to. He cowered on the ground, holding his shattered jaw and staring at me with utter disbelief. How DARE he not believe me now, he was cursed. I brought the bat down over, and over again. His entire face was destroyed. I felt so calm having saved him from the horrible evil I lived so long with. 


I turned back to look around Anna's room, only one thing left to do to bring peace to my family. I picked up the game off the floor, and calmly walked down to the living room. I lit a fire in the large stone fireplace, and set the timer on the game once more. I smiled as I fit each piece into it's slot, but suddenly the timer ran out. With only two pieces left to place, I had not achieved my goal. I was distraught, but it was still time to do my final task. 


I've thrown the cursed game into the fire, the flames are large and black smoke is curling towards me as I type this. I've warned you all, Perfection is truly a curse. The fire is calling me now, it's singing the jingle with me, "*Put the pieces into the slot, make the right selection! But be quick you're racing the clock! POP! Goes Perfection!*"

	<TEXT> Imagine one of your parents dying, within six months they're replaced by a seemingly perfect parent that you can't help but feel something is off about, though to the outside world everyone thinks they're amazing. Now this new parent comes in and changes your entire lifestyle, your technology use is limited, if you are before college age you are now condemned to your home and taught only by the replacement parent. Everyone in your home that is unrelated to you that helped in your daily lives is suddenly shut out, and the children in your home are now forced to take responsibility for caring for an immaculate and large property, which would occupy an insane amount of the time they could use to learn information about the new parent. The one thing you're amazing at, excel at, and enjoy is sold away. Only because of your status as someone about to leave the home and move far off for school, you have the priveledge of technology use, a priveledge that the new parent should have no real say in, because you are past the age where they can truly parent you, and were not the original giver of said priveledges. Now imagine finding out that new parent had a previous past of getting into relationships with families who lost a parent somehow (divorce/death/etc) and each spouse from the previous relationships has died. Odd right? Kinda makes you worry about your family, this perfect wonderful widow, who never mentioned the fact that he/she was a widow several times over, weird thing to leave out if it was just a stroke of bad luck. And then finally figuring it all out, when you knew something was off the entire time. Imagine finding the proof, and being the cause of your biological parents death because you showed them said proof. Imagine hiding and fearing for your life with two small and terrified children, who have no idea what's going on. Just imagine the perfect replacement being absolutely everything that could have been wrong. And imagine what would happen if you fell for the act like every other family, including the rest of yours did. 

Got a single parent? I know a lovely lady named Charlotte who is just wonderful with families c;

	<TEXT> The Fey/Fae are notoriously cruel beings, and it's under incredibly rare circumstances that a changling child would be switched back, especially considering the Fey child is dead. Though most human children taken are unaware of their misfortune if being switched, and are commonly happy and blissfully forgetful of their lives in the human world. The painting part is odd, I've never heard of a mortal child being able to communicate in any way to the human world once they've been taken. 

Edit to add:
It's unfortunate you/she couldn't learn the true name of the Fey child, I've heard tale that with it you have a form of control, and could have commanded the child be returned, though it may not exactly work the way you wish.

Perhaps the head and spinal cord were required to keep the entity tethered, and the entity kept the man alive enough that he only had brain function, enough to know something was amiss, but unable to communicate what may have happened. 

The case may be that the doctor not only killed the only living part left of the host, but released a dangerous being that could be looking for it's next victim.

Edit: Auto correct goofed the last name  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh God I really felt bad on this one. Crossing the border from Ontario to Michigan my family was brought into a building so they could search our car and question us about our trip. The male border officer was having a bad day, his back hurt, and he also ended up staying late after his shift because of the amount of time he spent questioning us. He started out with asking my parents, then moved on to us "kids" (I was 18 at the time, brothers 10, 5, and newborn). He started questioning me about vague things that any family member could have answered, and because my brother was sitting behind me and I couldn't quite tell who the officer was looking at, I kept hesitating before I finally just said, "I'm sorry, but I can't tell if you're asking me or my brother, I can't tell who you're looking at." And man, did I regret that. He then very aggitatedly told me that he had a lazy eye, and made me feel like a moron. Then he made sure I knew he was addressing me by asking about high school, any drug use, and if I was part of a prostitution ring, and other such things which made my extremely anxiety ridden self want to cry. We ended up being allowed to cross after the extremely uncomfortable questioning, after which my entire family questioned how I was the only one who didn't notice the eye. 
God, I wish I hadn't asked who he was talking to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard before that it's 28 days to be exact, I quit smoking for about three weeks cold turkey, went to visit family and fell right back into the habit. Though for starting a good habit I feel like it's more applicable, especially addictive personality wise. Hard to quit anything when addiction runs in your genes though.  </TEXT>
