	<TITLE> How similar is the 2014 Chicago Bears defense to the 2013 Detroit Lions defense? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-07 18:08:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was thinking about this last night. In 2013 we had an underperforming defensive line which was still probably the best part of our defense. This year Chicago's defensive line is above average and seems to be the best part of their defense. The two secondaries that are being compared are both awful, the difference is that the 2013 lions secondary had bad play from cornerbacks and decent play from one of our safeties (Quin). The 2014 bears defense has average-above average play from their safeties and prior to injury was getting decent play from their cornerbacks. The only large difference that I can see is that we had 2 very good linebackers on our 2013 squad while the 2014 bears squad has had abysmal linebacker play, which I think has been the biggest cause for their problems. Anyways these were some of my thoughts last night and I wondered if anyone wanted to talk about them. </TEXT>

There's this thread going around to sign up in to write a prediction on each team's season, /u/DollFinJesus came up with the idea, they're doing one per day. Currently there's no one signed up to do one for the lions. I was wondering if anyone here was interested in committing to do this or if we would want to do it by committee via submitting one after debating it as a sub, similar to how the mock drafts were done a few months back.

Edit: It looks like /u/Bobby_Marks2 signed up. </TEXT>

Plenty of Bad History in the comments here, including the classic "The Civil War was over States Rights!" for anyone interested

Edit: An example of the classy attitudes in the thread 
Do you really think that it was fought over slavery? Or how about Northerners invading the South? Do you think they would have just let them come into their homes without defending themselves? The South was fighting for states rights. NOT slavery. 

And another one

That statistics looks at families.... 1/3 of Southerns were part of families that own slaves.
The actual percentage of individuals, that owned slaves, was less than 5% in the south.
Obviously, slavery was a huge part of southern life... but really, most slaves were owned by a few people. And when you look at people who own more than 2 slaves... you are talking about the top 3% on the population. And more than 10 slaves... top 1%.

	<DATE> 2014-02-10 13:52:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's the racist's quote "Libertarianism rests on the principle of "ME! ME! ME!". Selfishness, ignorance, and treason run rampant in the "Liberty" Movement if you can even call it that. Libertarians advocate outright slavery to the Jewish banking cartel comprised of the Rothschilds through deregulation. Regulation is meant to keep the greed of the people who have started nearly every war in history in check.

For a Jew, greed is his 2nd nature. Wherever there is human misery there will be a Jew making money. There's a reason these good for nothing rats have been kicked out of 120 countries and counting. There's a reason why he even Stalin wanted to rid his nation of these useless, parasitic rats once and for all. But the Jews killed him before he could finish the job.

The founders of Libertarianism are Jews. Therefore, Libertarianism is fundamentally rooted in avarice, predatory capitalism, war, and famine. It is a foolish notion entirely, and just proves how effective Jewish control of the media has been.

We do not need to limit the power of the state to solve the problems which plague society. We need only to eliminate the Jewish presence within it and kick these good for nothing Jews out of our society. Nationalizing Jewish banks and bank accounts would alleviate not eliminate our national debt but wipe out inequality for Jews are the ones hoarding the wealth of society." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should Nationals Take the Charter Away from Alabama Sororities? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-21 01:20:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ever since I read the story on what is happening at Alabama's greek life I have been wondering what a punishment should be for the sororities. In the opinion of anyone who happens to read this post, do you think nationals should look to take the charter away and if that is too severe what would an acceptable punishment be? I ask because having gone to a private school, I met a number of Chi Omegas and they do not deserve to be associated with such vile practices as were conducted (allegedly) at the "university" of alabama </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Disney supports sun worship? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-09-06 17:54:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I heard this a while ago and rolled my eyes at the stupidity of it. I was curious if anyone on this website has encountered a conspiracy of Disney putting symbols in their movies to get adjust people to the worship of "sun gods" that they are (somehow) going to force on us. Also, I would search this out but I don't hate myself enough at the moment to go through with that. </TEXT>
