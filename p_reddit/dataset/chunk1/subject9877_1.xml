	<TEXT> And no its not a goddamn clown. I swear to God if I hear anything else about these stupid ass clowns I will lose my mind. No, I'm not being stalked by clowns. This stalker has been making my life one filled with paranoia and fear. I'm all jumpy and fidgety because of him, it, whatever. I'm getting ahead of myself. I'm actually struggling to write this as I type. Gotta focus. 

Alright I live with my mom, no, I'm not some 40 year old neck beard. I'm just a 17 year old highschool kid. Mom has this nasty habit of never closing the kitchen window curtain and since my gaming desktop is in the kitchen I constantly have to deal with it.  This is were I first started feeling off. There are some days where I just don't leave my battle station, days where I sink countless hours into league and Blade and Soul. It's on these days where I usually forget to close the curtain. I always feel unnerved when I notice it. I can never shake the feeling that someone's watching me. 

It's a pretty big yard with a big ass lime tree in the middle. But it's not too good at keeping out intruders. There's a pretty long strip of dirt behind my house where all the electrical equipment is located for my neighborhood and it would be pretty easy to get access to my backyard from there. I'm sure that's how this ass hole is managing to sneak in. 

Things had also been going missing from my house for a while. A game disc, a cup,  small stuff y know. We never really paid attention to it since it would always show up within the next few days. It bugged the he'll out of me but mom attributed it to my rowdy younger brothers. I never bought into that.  We never used to lock our doors even after I told her about the stolen stuff. She would always rant and rave about how nice our neighborhood is. What a load of bullshit. Maybe she will listen to me after I show her the picture I found. 

So that entire time I had been feeling uneasy because my paranoid ass was thinking I was constantly being watched. Like I said before I had been catching movement when I looked outside, but wrote it off as the wind or my neighbors cat. I set up my phone up one night around a week or so ago to record a video just to appease my paranoia. My phone was missing when I woke up the next morning. 

I just got it back.

It was just their beside me when I woke up this morning. I could have sworn we had locked and chained the door the night before. I could have sworn I did it. My phones fine, but all of my documents are messed up. 

There were no videos and all my notes and photos were erased except for just this one.
