I am currently going for CompTIA Security+ certification, and am going to keep on certifying myself for the next year or so.  Is a Systems Administrator job obtainable with a degree like mine, plus certifications that I have/am working on?  Does anyone know of such job openings in the Portland area?  Thanks :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Graduating with a BS in Computer Science and Information Systems... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-12 18:02:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> With a concentration on Information Systems.  Come graduation, what kind of entry-level jobs can I expect to get?  Here's some background experience I have from the courses I've taken:
 
    -Programming knowledge (a little bit of Java/VB)

     -Database

     -Systems Analysis and Design 

     -Networking

     -Security (I plan on taking CompTIA Security+ in a month or so)

I don't plan to be a programmer.  It's not my forte, I know I would work better in other areas of IT.  Ideally, I'd like to be a system administrator or Network admin.

I've been working a couple of help desks during my undergraduate studies...  the help desk at University, and a Desktop Support internship (over the summer) that I continue to work at to this day.

What kind of entry-level positions can I expect to find in Network/System administration?  I'm possibly looking to move to the west coast post-graduation...  Portland OR, specifically, and help desk jobs there don't have such great starting salaries.  I need to be making somewhere around $50k-$60k+ for relocation to make sense.

Thanks!

	<TITLE> Looking to get a BRZ! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-08 15:53:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! Looking to buy my own car (BRZ!) and stop driving around the one "mommy and daddy" gave me. I've been saving money all my life (I'm 21 yo) and have close to $20k saved up. Looking to finance a car that's close to $25k, and trade in the current car worth around $7500 now. Is this possible to do? Here's a little more background info:

-I'm a 21 year old about to graduate college. I have $0 of debt and no student loans (very fortunate).

-If I put enough down, including the trade in, I can probably get the costs to (hopefully) less than $250/month.

-I don't think money is too much of an issue here, because once I graduate and get a full-time job with a nice salary (Computer science major, heh), payments shouldn't be all that bad. I already have job offers so I'm not worried. Even if I'm without a job, I have enough savings to not worry about the car for at least two years.
Am I crazy, or is this something that I can fit in my budget?
Thanks!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all- Going to graduate this spring with a BS in Computer Science   Info Systems...  might as well get started on my certs!  I'm looking to do the CompTIA Trio; A+, Net+, and Security+.  
I just took a course last semester called "Information Assurance and Security"...  professor basically just taught straight from the CompTIA Security+ textbook (CompTIA Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals, 5e).  I've been training myself with Professor Messer (taking notes while watching videos), while using the book as a second source of studies.  Typically I'll watch one section of Professor Messer per day (pacing myself).  I plan to take the exam sometime mid-February.
This textbook also gives me access to certblaster.com for practice exams and drills.
I have been taking four years of computer-related courses, which includes Networking, so I have a somewhat decent background there.  My professor told me to take the Security+ ASAP, while the information is fresh in memory.  I agree with him and am going to do so; but I'm just wondering how anyone else fared by taking the Security+ exam first.  Thanks!  </TEXT>

Or another way to tether without paying the ridiculous additional $30/month?  I need internet connectivity to continue work in a remote location without internet access.  Thanks! </TEXT>

What does their interest have to do with this number, and what happens to that interest that was never given to me from the bank? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does a car get better mileage via highway driving as opposed to city driving?  I understand that city driving involves much more "stop and go" but if you're driving at highway speeds (around 55-80mph), aren't you burning more fuel because the engine must work harder to achieve such speed? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some background info... Met this girl last year. We hooked up a couple of times back then but she wanted a relationship, and I just wasn't there. Fast forward to now, we started talking again recently. Her intentions are the same; she wants a relationship. I have no idea why, but just don't feel like I want to date her. There's nothing wrong with her- she's nice and pretty.  All my friends think I should go for it.  On paper, she's probably perfect for me, but theres just some underlying lack of attraction that I can't do anything about.  And I feel like I'm just leading her on if I continue to talk to her, and I don't want to feel bad about it anymore.

Can someone please explain my feelings to me?  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> iPhone 6s Battery Problems (Samsung Chip) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-25 18:43:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let me start out by saying since I got my iPhone 6s (Samsung chip -__- ), the battery life has been poor since day one and the phone gets incredibly hot.  The other day, my iPhone was at a 75% battery level. I put it down to cook some food and came back not 20 minutes later only to find my battery dropped by 23%. The only open app was Spotify, and no music was being played, nor was anything occurring in the background.  Back to the unit getting super hot...  Especially on a phone call, the glass gets too warm to the touch and actually feels uncomfortable on my cheek. Sometimes it's in my pocket doing nothing and my right thigh feels like it's on fire.  

Finally -get this- yesterday, I plugged in my phone to charge it up (using Apple wall adapter and Apple lightning cable) from 55%. Checked back on it not five minutes later and the battery was at 52%.  I finally stopped being lazy and called up Applecare about this.  I was tired of these problems that my previous iPhone 6 never had (not once).  

The representative ran a diagnostic on my phone and it showed that the battery life was in the realm of where it should be.  But something stuck out to her while analyzing the diagnostic- the iPhone was reaching temperatures of 139 F (I knew it felt uncomfortable to use for some reason...).  She then tried to schedule an appointment at the Genius bar for me, but the closest Apple store is in Atlantic City which is a pain to get to.  So she set up an express replacement on my phone and I should be getting a new unit (TSMC PLEASE PLEASE) this week.  
Not trying to rant to this subreddit, but if you have any problems similar to the one(s) I've had, don't hesitate to call Applecare.  They will get you taken care of.  All the best!

	<TEXT> Hi there, I'm looking to join the 86 club!  I'm currently looking at a 2015 BRZ Series.Blue with ~15,000 miles on it, asking price is $26,800.  I understand that this car is rather small, and interior space can get quite crammed.  I'm coming from a Nissan Altima, with plenty of extra space that I feel I don't need.  Only problem is that once I get the BRZ, I feel that I will greatly miss the extra room.  Owners of an 86 (any model of it) that came from a slightly larger car, how do you feel about the lack of space?  Do you regret the purchase, or does the car make up for it with that huge smile it puts on your face?  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, looking to get a BRZ within the upcoming months.  Looked on Subaru's site, and it shows that the 2015 model is actually  $300 more.  Looking at it's fuel economy, it shows that the 2016 model is less fuel efficient than its predecessor (34/25 vs 30/22).  Can someone explain these price and fuel efficiency differences to someone who really doesn't know all that much about cars?  Thanks!

	<TEXT> Been trying to restore my 6s to a backup I made earlier today. First I wiped the phone clean then tried to restore from backup.  iTunes has been stuck at 2 minutes of time remaining, which is slowly increasing.  It is now up to 6 minutes remaining with no signs of progress.  Has this happened to anyone else?  What would you do?  I would think to kill the restore, then restore it to original factory settings again.  Then to try another restore from backup?  I'm not sure.

I'm going to let this sit for another 20 minutes, and if there are no signs of improvement, will try the process over once again. </TEXT>

Gmail1 was linked to this youtube account.  I recently made a new gmail (gmail2) account, with hopes to unlink the original gmail1 and put the new gmail2 on the original youtube channel.
I deleted the gmail1 account through google, but how do I unlink the youtube and gmail1 accounts now so that i can put my new gmail address on it?  I'd be very surprised if you can't do this.

	<TEXT> Hi there.  At uni, one of my good friends is trying to get me to join the Kappa Sigma fraternity.  From what I understand, it is very well-respected in the greek life world.  I just never saw myself as a fraternity brother...  just not my kind of thing I guess.  My friend (who is on the executive council) has been bringing me out to the welcome week events that Kappa Sigma hosts, to get to know the brothers prior to pledging.  I'm still feeling pretty "meh" about it..  I don't have a reason to join but at the same time, I don't have a reason to not join.  I guess I always found people in fraternities/sororities to be a bit pretentious about the whole greek life subject matter...  but who am I to judge.  Being that my friend is an executive, I shouldn't have any problems getting in; it would actually make the process easier as he tells me.  Anyway, I guess what I'm asking here is for opinions?  What has greek life done for YOU?  Why would you recommend it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help me help my father get more business! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-15 01:45:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My father operates a small Ball Bearing shop in NYC.  Over the past 10-15 years, many (approximately 60% of his customers from the 90's) electric motor companies and automotive shops have closed and it has definitely affected the business.  We recently put up a website (for inquiries, not e-commerce) that displays the products and brands we carry, for the end-user to be familiar with our stock.  We also joined an email marketing company to send out product lists to business that might be interested in what we're offering.  
     Long story short, our marketing endeavors really haven't been of much help.  We've received a few inquiries here and there, but most people are marking the mail as spam.  Others have even complained that "we should be fined for the amount of emails we send".  We're just trying to bring in business so we don't have to close our business.  
     We're starting to come to the conclusion that we might be at a loss...  but there's got to be more that we can do.  My mother searches daily for businesses around the tri-state area, as well as the rest of the country that might be interested in what we have to offer, but we have just recently been informed that this sort of soliciting is illegal.  
     I guess I'm here asking for ideas to bring in more business (that seems to be the golden question anyway, right?).  Every night I see my dad come depressed, because it's always the "same old" lack of business that he deals with on a daily basis.  I've stopped asking him how his day was at work because I don't want to upset him any more than his business does, and it kills me on the inside.  

Any advice is appreciated...  Thank you (:


Edit:  Thanks for all your input!  Just a thought, would it be effective to hire a marketing agent to help us out here?  Obviously we're trying all we can to save money, but if this will bring in more business, we're willing to give it a shot. </TEXT>

The vacuum, however, does not.  It might be important to note that the light switch and the power outlet are in the same wall socket.  
We tried plugging in different devices such as a pair of clippers, a lamp, and an external battery, none of which acted the same as the vacuum.  And no, no one is flipping another switch to make this happen.  We're completely dumbfounded.

	<TITLE> MBPr SSD Upgrade? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-05 19:10:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi All, I'm in the market for a new Macbook Pro.  I'm looking at the baseline configuration of the 15" Macbook Pro with Retina Display (2.2GHz, 256GB SSD, 16GB RAM).  However, this configuration doesn't meet my storage criteria.  I'm looking to have 512GB of storage.  I know I can configure this on the checkout page, but the 512GB upgrade costs a whopping $400.  Is there any place to find what I'm looking for?  I understand that the SSD has to be PCI-e based, but I'm not sure about how compatible the ones I'm finding on NewEgg or OWC are with this Macbook.  Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a 15" 2012 MBP (non retina, HRAG) w/ 16GB and a 512GB SSD, running 10.10.5.  I started noticing something weird when connecting it to an external display.  I plug the machine into my TV via HDMI cable and an HDMI-to-thunderbolt adapter.  All goes well, as long as the displays are mirrored.  The second I set the arrangement to extend the display of the laptop, the screen flashes (as normal) and reconfigures itself.  Once the displays are up and running, the color on my MBP's screen gets all out of whack.  The TV displays normal colors, but the Macbook's screen seems to have the Hue settings wrong (all my blues turn to orange).  Change the mode back to mirror, and all is good in the world.  I even messed around with the color calibration, but that did nothing for me.  The profile on my my Mac reads "Color LCD", as it should.

I have reset the PRAM, as well as the SMC.  Any thoughts on what I could be experiencing, and how I can fix it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> New MBPr with Force Touch Trackpad... Mavericks? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-30 20:47:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The company I work for recently ordered a few new MacBook Pros for new users. The only problem is that these machines are running Yosemite. Normally, we would just roll the machine(s) back to Mavericks. We have tried many things- wiping the drive and installing Mavericks via network boot and USB boot, among others. Any time we try to boot these machines into a Mavericks installer, we get the image displayed on the screen (http://imgur.com/c8wV1xn). Could it have to do with the force touch trackpad being only used on Yosemite and above? Would that be an issue? Is it at all possible to roll these back to Mavericks? Thanks!

	<TITLE> Dad dropped the unlimited data on our lines... </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my dad dropped the unlimited data on our lines in favor of the 10gb/month shared data plan.  Needless to say, I'm annoyed because I've been hanging onto my unlimited data for years.  According to Verizon, I have 60 days to change the plan back, but shared data has one thing attractive about it- included personal hotspot.  The only thing I don't like about shared data is that we now all have that dreaded data cap.  Does anyone have experience with switching from unlimited data to shared data?  It would save us about $70/month, but is that worth dropping something you can never get back?  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-06-23 00:32:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here's my situation. I'm a 20-year old Computer Science student (with a concentration in Information Systems). I go to a small liberal arts school in New Jersey, which isn't known for its computer science related degrees. I have a strong technical background, and am the go-to person when people have a problem with their equipment. Come September, I'll be a senior on track to graduate in May. I've also picked up a summer internship working in the corporate offices of a retail store chain. I work in their IT department --Desktop Support, to be specific-- repairing laptops (and other equipment), setting up desktop workstations, deploying software and fixing any issues that associates come across. Although I love this internship, I can't see myself doing this much longer once I graduate... The pay isn't quite where I need it to be (starting salary ~30k... I'm looking to make at least double that once I graduate). I'm not good at coding (it's just not my forte- I know this for a fact), but I want something more technical than what I'm doing right now. What should my next move(s) be? I know I should get myself Cisco certified, among others. Also, come time for graduation, what kind of job position should I be looking for? Preferably something within IT management. Any answers are appreciated, thank you!
