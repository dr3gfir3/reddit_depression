We dream during the so-called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep stage, which is not a deep sleep state. There are virtually no dreams during the deep sleep stages. It is actually quite normal not to remember one's dreams, unless they are somehow abnormal like nightmares or we care about our dreams and train remembering them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He defines exposure as the amount of light falling on the sensor which does not depend on ISO indeed: by raising ISO there won't fall more light on the sensor.

 So why, according to him, would you ever change set the ISO above lowest setting?

That's more tricky. In theory, if we have sensors which are called "ISO-less", raising ISO in the camera and using the slider in Lightroom won't make any difference at all. However, although we can partly do that with Sony sensors of the newest generation as long as we stay below five stops, we are not there yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Abstract**

Epicurus (341-270 BC) was, with Plato and Aristotle, one of the three great philosophers of the ancient world. He developed an integrated system of ethics and natural philosophy that, he claimed and many accepted, showed everyone the way to a life of the greatest happiness. The school that he founded remained open for 798 years after his death. While it lost place during the last 200 of these years, his philosophy held until then a wide and often decisive hold on the ancient mind.

The revival of Epicureanism in the 17th century coincided with the growth of scientific rationalism and classical liberalism. There can be no doubt these facts are connected. It may, indeed, be argued that the first was a leading cause of the second two, and that we are now living in a world shaped, in every worthwhile sense, by the ideas of Epicurus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ludwig von Mises writes in *Human Action*:

 The historical role of the theory of the division of labor as elaborated by British political economy from Hume to Ricardo consisted in the complete demolition of all metaphysical doctrines concerning the origin and the operation of social cooperation. It consummated the spiritual, moral and intellectual emancipation of mankind inaugurated by the philosophy of Epicureanism.

The presentation, which was delivered at the Austrian Scholars Conference organized by the Ludwig von Mises Institute in 2005, explains the reasons for this rather strong statement. </TEXT>

Melvyn Bragg and his guests discuss the Greek poet Sappho. Born in the late seventh century BC, Sappho spent much of her life on the island of Lesbos. In antiquity she was famed as one of the greatest lyric poets, but owing to a series of accidents the bulk of her work was lost to posterity. The fragments that do survive, however, give a tantalising glimpse of a unique voice of Greek literature. Her work has lived on in other languages, too, translated by such major poets as Ovid, Christina Rossetti and Baudelaire.

	<TEXT> As far as I can say, /r/Buddhism seems to be truer to Buddhism as /r/taoism is to Taoism. Buddhism, Taoism, Stoicism and other ancient religions and philosophies have been popularized and adapted and that's visible in the subreddits, too. The Western popularizations and adaptations reflect the Western lifestyle. Wellness and self-fulfilment surely play a big part.

On the other hand, these traditions have been transformed during their expansion in earlier times, too, and we should not be surprised by the fact that adaptations are being done today. In many cases ancient philosophy are untenable without adaptations anyway. At some point, however, Buddhism being adapted that way ends being true to Buddhism and may better be called differently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are similarities, of course, especially as long as one does not look too closely. However, the existence of some similarities is not sufficient for common roots and in this case the similarities are rather superficial. As far as I know there is no reason to assume that the Stoics were influenced by Eastern philosophy in any significant way.

There are also similarities between Pyrrhonian skepticism and Buddhism. Pyrrho of Elis, the founder of Pyrrhonian skepticism, travelled to India with Alexander the Great and was influenced by Eastern philosophy that way. By the way, Anaxarchus (Greek:  *Anaxarchos* - after which I chose my user name) accompanied Alexander the Great to India, too.

That being said, one shouldn't stress the inluence of Eastern philosophy on Pyrrhonian skepticism too much, either, although at least there is some influence worth being mentioned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would start with reading the FAQ carefully. There is a lot of interesting information and you may also follow the links. A good passage about virtue is: [What is Stoicism, considered as a philosophy of life in modern times?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Stoicism/wiki/faq#wiki_what_is_stoicism.2C_considered_as_a_philosophy_of_life_in_modern_times.3F)

You may also read an [article of William O. Stephens about Stoic ethics](http://www.iep.utm.edu/stoiceth/). If you want to read an ancient work, you may read Cicero's *De Officiis* (On Duties), which is said to be highly influenced by the principal work [*On Duties*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panaetius#On_Duties) of the Stoic Panaetius. Cicero's *De Officiis* is the most comprehensive work about that topic I know of. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My personal take on Stoicism is that one must always be content, not happy, as happiness is a fleeting feeling like all the rest of ones feelings.

Stoicism is not about being a statue. Stoicism is about *eudaimonia* and the way how to accomplish it. *Eudaimonia* is the Greek word for *happiness*. Stoicism is about happiness. That's the goal and end of life according to Stoicism.

The Stoic conception of *eudaimonia*, which is the life of moral virtue, differs from the conception of other schools defining *eudaimonia* as goal of life. For example, the Epicureans' conception of *eudaimonia* is the life of pleasures. For Epicureans virtue is highly important, too, because it is necessary for *eudaimonia*. It is not sufficient, though, which distinguish them from the Stoics.

Based on your remarks I interpret your understanding of happiness as being more similar to the Epicurean than to the Stoic conception of happiness. One may apply Stoic techniques to cope with difficulties of life successfully, however, one is no Stoic unless one identifies *happiness* with a *live of moral virtue*. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [**Description**](http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00547bk)

Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss Humanism. On the 3rd January 106 BC Marcus Tullius Cicero, lawyer, politician, Roman philosopher and the founding father of Humanism was born. His academy, the Studia Humanitas taught the art of living well and blessedly through learning and instruction in the fine arts, his version of humanitas put man not God at the centre of the world.Centuries later, Ciceros teachings had been metamorphosed into Classical Humanism, a faith in the soft arts of the Greek world. But how did Ciceros ideas become Renaissance ideals? How did a small Greek curriculum later become a world philosophy? The human centred creed is credited with giving us human rights and democracy but has also been blamed for the most unspeakable horrors of the modern age. Have his ideas been distorted through the centuries for political ends? And why do some contemporary thinkers think the Humanist tradition is responsible for Elitism, Sexism and even Nazism?

**With**

Tony Davies, Professor and Head of the Department of English, University of Birmingham and author of Humanism

	<TEXT>  Begin each day by telling yourself: Today I shall be meeting with interference, ingratitude, insolence, disloyalty, ill-will, and selfishness  all of them due to the offenders ignorance of what is good or evil. But for my part I have long perceived the nature of good and its nobility, the nature of evil and its meanness, and also the nature of the culprit himself, who is my brother (not in the physical sense, but as a fellow creature similarly endowed with reason and a share of the divine); therefore none of those things can injure me, for nobody can implicate me in what is degrading. Neither can I be angry with my brother or fall foul of him; for he and I were born to work together, like a mans two hands, feet or eyelids, or the upper and lower rows of his teeth. To obstruct each other is against Natures law  and what is irritation or aversion but a form of obstruction.

	<TEXT>     The end of the world cannot be reached by traveling.
    Yet, without coming to the end of the world,
    there's no release from unpleasantness.
    Therefore be wise, know the nature of the world.
    Lead the holy life to the end of the world.
    The appeased, know the end of the world.
    And do not wish for, this or the other world.
