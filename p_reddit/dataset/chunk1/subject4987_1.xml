	<TEXT> Okay, so I've tried Googling around and I'm just not seeing it. When I was a kid, around the late 80's, maybe early 90's, me and my dad watched a movie about an Australian salt water crocodile that was reeking havoc on the local area. A group of, I believe, scientists/zoo officials decided to capture it because it was supposed to be super large. The last scene took place in the dark, obviously. Does anyone have any idea what I'm talking about? I think it may have had an aborigine word for the title. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After finishing today's event with my 1st Dino taking out 8 of the 9 and my 2nd Dino not having taken any damage, I thought it be fun if we had some sort of a tiered competition, ie: if you defeat 5 Dino's with a team of 3, you win a common, if you beat 9 with your 3, you gets the rare, etc., maxing out with maybe 15 Dino's to get a Legendary? This way the folks who are newer to the game can participate and get something as well as the ones who have been playing a while get something a better but still need to earn it. I'm sure this will lead nowhere, but I thought it was a good idea. </TEXT>

I'm thinking of visiting the Albuquerque/Santa Fe area sometime in the next month of two. Any suggestions on places to visit/things to do? So far on my list is just the Wild Spirit Sanctuary in Santa Fe. Ideally looking for hiking/biking trail ideas. Anything to do with animals. Are any of the Breaking Bad locations worth a visit? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Alright, so this popped in my head a couple of days ago. Does anyone remember exactly how it went? He was talking about having a woman call him at night to trick his wife into thinking he was a catch, thus tricking her into wanting him more? Was the slogan, "all the headaches of adultery without the benefits"?

If anyone knows when this happened or has the clip, I would much appreciate it. </TEXT>

Was this something they did off the air that they're giving us now, or was it just not on the podcast? Was it a TV exclusive? Thanks, I'll hang up and listen. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! So I just purchased my first Yaris and was wondering what was the best way to maximize my gas MPG. I drive about 70 total miles/day, with about 65 of them being on the highway. Traffic tends to be pretty fluid and not too bad. I don't go to fast when on the highway, I like a cruising speed of 60-65 mph. When on the highway, should I turn off Eco mode? I feel like the car is "clunky" or struggling when I'm on the highway. Any other pointers? It's a 2015 Yaris C. </TEXT>

My top three would be Gilbert, Elliott and probably Stuttering John, with the Elegant one winning by a nose. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So if you could've been a fly on the wall in studio during any bit/interview/roast/saga/whatever in show history, which would it have been?

Scott's anal offer/discussion/negotiation kills me every time I hear it... almost to tears. I don't think I would've survived it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My favorite part of the show is when they do bits where most, if not all, of the staff is involved in some sort of competition. Aside from the following, is there anything I'm missing?

IQ tests
Staff karaoke contest
Revelations (not really a competition, but you get the idea)
Battle of the Blobs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've been listening to some of TP's Scott the Engineer videos and they mentioned having shot an E! video for Brown Fingers. I do faintly remember seeing it. Does anyone know where to find it? I've Google searched it and all I'm able to find is the actual song but not the video. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm listening to some old shows and Howard and the staff are talking about Jeff's post-op pics, and Howard mentioned having them put on his website. I don't know why I'm asking... but does anyone know where to find these? I tried a number of different Google searches and the only one I could find was of him in the bikini when they finally saw the infected tissue. </TEXT>
