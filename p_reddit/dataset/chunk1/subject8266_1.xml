I thought, "I really like William Blake's art...wonder if they have any."  Short answer: [Not really.](http://www.redbubble.com/shop/william+blake+iphone-cases).  

Then I thought, "I bet I could upload that artwork myself...make a pretty penny..."  

Found [this warning](http://www.blakearchive.org/blake/public/about/faq/) on the William Blake Archives FAQ.

How is William Blake's artwork subject to US Copyright law?  Can I upload the work to Redbubble to make some scratch?  I see tons of comic book characters on there...how is this all possible? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lawyers of r/law, I am a law librarian in need of help compiling a booklist </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-15 18:58:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, I am a law librarian in a small, county courthouse law library.  We have two collections in our library, one that circulates to bar-licensed attorneys and circuit court staff and judges, and the other that circulates to the inmates of two local jails.  We're getting ready to apply for a grant to purchase new books for the jail collection.

While we have several NOLO guides in the collection (rep yourself in court, crim law handbook), many of the in-a-nutshell guides, and lots of copies of Black's legal dictionaries, most of the collection consists of statute books, six volume treatises on Crim. Procedure, and discarded books written for practicing lawyers and judges...so they are often targeted beyond their needs or understanding.

And, unfortunately, most-if-not-all of the catalogs we receive are not for the lay reader.  

I need help compiling a list of books and self-help materials that would be useful to the inmates of these jails, books that are easy to read and understand, focused on criminal and family law (a lot of parents in there)...

TIA </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last night I feel pretty deep into a trailer hole.  At some point I saw a trailer for a live action kids movie and the language sounded Scandinavian.  It concerns a redheaded kid with a mop top, the setting seems to be an old or ancient or Norse time, kid has what looks like a giant for a father with a long black beard, and there is an epic ship battle that takes up much of the trailer. The kid has a best friend who's wild and dirty...tried to retrace my steps for a couple of hours today with no luck.

Oh, one more thing to narrow down the era, the film was advertised as coming in 3-D, so...that should narrow it down to the last couple/few years, no?
