	<TEXT> I am also viet and i agree that this is a spring roll, at our restaurant we call fresh rolls "spring rolls" because they're fresh whilst "eggrolls" quite literally contain egg - our restaurant doesn't use different paper as the opaque skins would be more chinese than vietnamese; our eggrolls still use the clear rice paper but our distinction is simply fresh vs fried containing egg. as for summer roll, we don't ever use that term. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the witcher 2 enhanced edition because I've never played an RPG on PC before. I've been a Mac user for the last decade and only gamed on consoles. I've built hundreds of gaming rigs for friends and family over the years but could never afford my own, since my townhome is being foreclosed on I'm finally free of my $1500/mo mortage; last month I finally built my own rig ([the first in 10 years](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/vkp4t/fixed_ive_been_a_mac_user_for_the_last_decade/)) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> there was a little trick i used to use: if they sell it in your state, get a pint of EVERCLEAR liquor and add a few drops of it to your liquid, it's pure grain alcohol at 180 proof, i hear you can use unflavored triple distilled vodka but i've never tried that before. personally I don't like doing it too much because I find that it degradates the flavor but i do still use it to make menthol concentrate. try that out and add more drops as needed, start with a 5ml bottle and keep track of how my drops you put in per ml (eg 5drops in a 5ml bottle would be 1drop per ml and so forth) and remember your preference when you mix up another batch in a higher volume.

alternatively you can start weaning yourself to a lower mg so that your throat gets used to something like 12mg and then every 30ml go up a step e.g. 12mg to 16mg after 30ml then 16mg to 18mg and then 18mg to 24mg, once you hit 24mg start the cycle over - the period where you go back to 12mg will be painful but once you're used to it it'll be satisfying when you start climbing up again. hope that helps, happy vaping! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Help! Looking for a good flatbed plotter cutter </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-08 18:05:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my company does a lot of package design mock-ups and cards so we're constantly having to make very intricate cuts on card-stock and we're having issues with our Graphtech FC2250-150, the blades we get are always breaking and the software doesn't work very well (pressure, speed and quality settings don't translate from the Illustrator plugin to the machine). 

The company is looking to replace the Graphtech and have asked me to find something more reliable. Reddit designers I need your help! I don't really know too much about industrial plotters and the only two names that ever come up in this category are Graphtech and Mimaki, anyone out there have opinion on the matter? We'd like to go with a company with good customer service, we have a Mimaki CJV30-130 which has excellent customer service but are unsure how much better their flatbed cutter would be compared to the Graphtech.

Is there only two big boys out there that make these machines? I'm also assuming that laser cutting paper is out of the question.

We mostly cut paper products for packaging with the occasional cardboard for making display stands but more importantly card-stock, for instance we'll have to cut 5000 cards with custom die-lines and hang holes, the Graphtech just can't handle that much work. 

Any input is appreciated, sorry for writing so much, so in summary I'm looking for an industrial flatbed plotter cutter that can handle cutting through card-stock with reputable customer service in Colorado, the budget is allowing me around $20,000. Thank you Reddit! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Replacement Film for Otterbox Defender? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-04-26 23:12:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A while back I dropped my iPad2 due to a faulty strap on my bag and it cracked my screen; now with my new iPad I decided to avoid the same fate I got myself the new Otterbox Defender case, there's a huge issue with this case, it comes with this built-in screen protector and the film otterbox uses absolutely ruins the iPad's retina display. The screen protector refracts light giving the illusion of enlarged pixels and basically makes the retina display look like the old iPad2 - I'm looking for a film I can buy to replace this garbage stock film, anyone know of any non-adhesive-capacitive-touch material I can buy? 

I want to avoid putting on a screen protector (with adhesive ie invisible shield) on the iPad itself and stick with having a seal between the otterbox's case frame and the iPad so that I can avoid building up gunk between the frame and the iPad. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for a place to live (Trailers Vs Apartment) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-30 18:50:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've owned a place around Colorado and 104th for a while, bought the place before the market crashed and mortgage is outrageous, I wanted to refi a couple years in but the mortgage difference wasn't great enough (it would be if I refi'd now though but I'd have to be current), tried for a home modification loan and failed three times and ended up over 30K behind on mortgage so now I'm forced to short sell the house or face foreclosure - anyhow I've been searching CL, trulia and zillow for months and the only things I can find in my price range ($950/mo) are apartments or trailers. Anyone have experience with the double-wide-type trailers? I really don't want to have any upstairs/downstairs neighbors and a garage would be nice but it seems farfetched at the my rate. The most frustrating thing about this is I could buy a home and easily have all my desired amenities and still be in budget if there wasn't a 2yr waiting period to buy after a short sale. I freaking bought the townhome for 182K, the value now is 110K and I'm short selling it for around 105K, absolutely horrid right? I have a small well-behaved-indoor-only cat and a crap ton of stuff so a townhome or house would be ideal. Wow ok, sorry, I'm realize I'm rambling - the stress has been insane the last few months, I digress and will stop here. 

*TLDR Version* I'm looking for a place to live that is not an apartment where rent does not go above $950/mo preferably in the TWN area. I have a small indoor-only cat and no other pets - any information would be a tremendous help! thank you ahead of time all you lovely redditors! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-01-19 18:45:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know I ran into an infographic a while back that broke down the cost of designing various projects for clients but can't find it for the life of me. Anyhow, I'm an in-house graphic designer that picks up freelance gigs on the side and one of the most frustrating things to deal with is clients that just don't understand design pricing; for example I could say I charge $40/hr but to make a tri-fold brochure but offer a flat rate of $350 (depending on company size) for the entire design and the client will end up resenting the price because they don't believe it'll take almost 9hrs to complete, yes in reality it doesn't take that long but I don't know how to explain the hours that are added for things like overhead, education, talent, skill etc. I don't want to come off as some high-and-mighty douche but I can't come up with a way to explain that it's not necessarily an hourly rate - so many people are fixated on hourly labor rates without giving the education and talent cost a single thought, any suggestions on a simple way to explain 'why the project costs this much' even though it's not exactly the amount of hours put in? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] This is a long shot but I've been trying to figure what the hell this was for years (TV SHOW) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-12-20 20:48:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm from Colorado, when I was younger (I'm 28 now) there was this weird TV show that came on late at night on the public access channel unfortunately I don't remember what channel but if it helps I never had cable, it was all over-the-air.

I stumbled upon it quite a lot (in the 720, 303 and 719 area), the show was in black and white, very grainy and had this guy in an apron wearing a skull-like mask with long dark hair standing behind a table butchering meat, I can't remember what he was talking about but it definitely was not about the meat he was chopping up nor his giant cleaver, I remember his voice was all distorted much like how jigsaw presents himself in the SAW series; i do remember his topics were completely random and always thinking to myself "WTF is this!? and how the hell has it been on all these years?". There were no cuts, the camera just stood still directly across from the table showing the entire table and everything of the host from the waist up.

Anyone have any clue as to what I'm talking about? Was it some sort of pirate show? I've been searching for years just to satisfy my curiosity, I can't be the only person to have come across this show and I'm absolutely sure I didn't imagine it, if anyone could figure it out it'd be the redditors - thanks ahead of time and if you're just baffled from this post: my apologies.

EDIT: when I say "pirate" I didn't mean "arrrggghhh mate-ee" pirate, I meant as in a pirate show like "pirate radio" something more along the lines of unapproved broadcast.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> i'm not looking for any sympathy or upvotes or any responses, i just wanted to post this as a therapeutic exercise.

so i decided to buy a new TV for my dad since he still has a giant CRT in his room and father's day was coming up, i went on craigslist and found a nice 32" and the guy i dealt with only communicated through e-mail (should have been my first clue) but we eventually met up and he was an older caucasian man, looked trust worthy. i inspected the tv, the screen looked fine but i didnt think to turn it on as we were in the middle of a parking lot and there wasn't an outlet available; i gave him $250 and we were both on on way. 

i came home and wouldn't you know it the LCD was broken, the screen was cracked behind the glass (not visible when turned off at all) and when turned on all you could see was a black blob atop of a white screen. i lost $250 on a shoestring budget from attempting a good gesture for my dad. 

lesson here is to always make sure you deal over the phone via text or calling. i live in colorado and this guy's e-mail is msalas4973@gmail.com last i saw him was in a forest green escalade, older guy, do not trust this man! 

the thing that irks me the most is that i always have a power inverter in the car albeit may not be strong enough to power the flat panel but i could have at least tried. god, hindsight has never been more of a bitch. </TEXT>
