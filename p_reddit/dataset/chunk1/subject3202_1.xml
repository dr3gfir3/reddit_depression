	<TEXT> So I just got the translated books and The Witcher 3. Fortunately, I'm very patient so I'm gonna hold off on the game until I'm down with the books. But is it enough? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will this game have a AAA budget? I know I've read the game will likely be $60. The first one was so awesome, I'm excited to see what they'll do with a bigger budget.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A little off topic, but it would blow my mind if I was reading Malazan in public and the book picked someone's interest enough for them to seek out the series. I'm glad you found it. Have fun. The books are amazing. 


As to the books, when I read them I knew I was probably not absorbing everything but honestly that doesn't matter for your first time through. The books themselves are rather easy to read if you just relaxed and let the story flow, it just requires a little more concentration than most mediums. Just imagine it's a movie and don't worry about the rest. From book 2 onwards, every book feels like reading 3 Tolkien novels, with an explosive climax for each and everyone, maybe less so for the last 2 books since they're the same last story. And you'll understand and enjoy, just don't expect to understand *everything*.  </TEXT>
