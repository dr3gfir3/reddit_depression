You'll see this time and time again in conflicts where religious leaders are exempt from harm a lot of the time.

Most famous of all is Father Francis L. Sampson who was ready to be executed by the Germans while giving aid to his soldiers was saved by the fact he was a priest.

During WW2 there were soldiers under fire and one guy kept screaming, so his friend hit him in the head to knock him out but it ended up killing him.



I think they recreated it in Band of Brothers or something like that.

	<TEXT> To keep it up the thought, many sociopaths are in medicine already but it only takes one to act. 

Plus who is better at faking deaths than someone who has trained for years all about the the human body? 


There are many motivations to becoming a doctor. Family pressures, wanting the challenge, a respectable career to push forward another agenda and the list goes on.


At the end of the day doctors are still part of and subject to the human condition.

Having a piece of framed paper on your wall doesn't make you a better human being. Even then morality is subjective to each person at a given time.


Organ donation brings me up to the [Trolley Problem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) thought experiment which one form of question is:

 A brilliant transplant surgeon has five patients, each in need of a different organ, each of whom will die without that organ. Unfortunately, there are no organs available to perform any of these five transplant operations. A healthy young traveler, just passing through the city the doctor works in, comes in for a routine checkup. In the course of doing the checkup, the doctor discovers that his organs are compatible with all five of his dying patients. Suppose further that if the young man were to disappear, no one would suspect the doctor.


Would you kill one to save many?

	<TEXT> I am a hunter. The main people complaining are bear hunters that use dogs because the wolves don't take kindly to trespassing. 

Plus:
Each year wolves attack 15-25 farm animals, affecting less than one percent of livestock farms. But many farmers affected by wolf attacks plan to tackle the issue head on.

Using your head to work around obstacles rather than just bash someone's head in or shoot them as the typical cliche goes.

	<TEXT> Hmm, more than usual in that pack.

In a bowl mix 4 tbs of flour, 1 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp pepper, 1 tsp paprika and mix together dry.

In another bowl crack 2 eggs and slightly beat them with a dab of worcestershire sauce.

Heat up your cast iron pan during the next part with a bit of olive oil in there.

Toss flour on each kitten, roll in the egg and coat with breadcrumbs (I prefer Italian seasoned crumbs but it's up to you).

Toss in skillet and cook roughly 4-5 minutes per side till you get a nice crust going. 

Serve hot. 

You can substitute kittens with pork chops but then you'll have a kitten infestation in your home you'll never get rid of.

	<TEXT> They said they categorized it as healthy or unhealthy. 

Meaning a healthy factor would be lower blood pressure while unhealthy would be a higher blood pressure. A good indicator of their blood pressure is their exercise. 


"Several studies have reported finding a subgroup of obese individuals who have normal metabolic features despite their high adiposity, and the researchers have called this condition "benign obesity" or "metabolically healthy obesity.""

So they can be obese but have good health from eating right, exercising and such to keep those indicators in the normal ranges of the human body but they will still have health problems and an early grave down the road.

Metabolic status was categorized as either healthy or unhealthy, depending on factors such as lipid profile, glucose tolerance, blood pressure, insulin resistance, and waist circumference. 

Meaning even if overweight people work out and keep their blood pressure down and other factors of a healthy lifestyle but are overweight, they will have problems in the future.

To prevent this, they need to lose the weight to get to their recommended bmi while keeping up with the exercise and healthy eating.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> New research finds that even when a person is "metabolically healthy," being obese raises his or her risk for cardiovascular disease and premature death. It just takes a study that tracks subjects for 10 years or more to pick it up, says the study, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

"Increased BMI is not a benign condition, even in the absence of metabolic abnormalities," the authors said.

A small sample of Tombaugh's ashes are aboard New Horizons, the first spacecraft to attempt to pass by and photograph Pluto. This is the first sample of human cremated remains which will escape the solar system to travel among the stars.

	<TEXT> Battlefield 4. Serious disappointment.

The single player is painfully scripted, buggy and feels like you're just pressing the forward key and the game plays it's self. You complete the entire campaign in under 6 hours of total gameplay to. 

Mutliplayer 3 months later is still broken and unplayable. You can go in and try to have fun, assuming you can connect to a server without a d/c or crash, but there are so many bugs that mess with you, it's not fun. Besides the bugs, the huge inbalances in weapons and vehicles have yet to be addressed which makes certain gameplay completely pointless.
