	<TEXT> LMAO yeah. I don't actually smoke very much - it's just kind of a quirky paperweight for me, but I thought the concept was neat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey! I'm looking for folks who are interested in playing through some of Grant Howitt's one-shots (like [Honey Heist](http://i.imgur.com/rAZXBWb.jpg) and [Big Gay Orcs](https://i.imgur.com/n7D0tdl.jpg).) I'd to include some outgoing folks who aren't afraid to get into the zany kind of RP that these little systems seem to facilitate. 

Please send me a PM if you're interested with a little bit of information about yourself. Plans would likely involve meeting online around 6PM CST on Saturday. Each 'game' would likely last a session or two. Depending on interest/how much fun the players are having, I'd be happy to either keep the same group or rotate new people in and out when we swap games. </TEXT>
