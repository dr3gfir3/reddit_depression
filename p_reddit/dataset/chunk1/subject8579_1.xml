	<TEXT> That we will actually never know everything about everything. Such as the universe we will never know everything about it because it stretches beyond the years we live so we will never find out if we are the only living things to exist in the universe. 

I also can't get my head around the fact that we are actually just a small planet in a vast blackness of gas. We don't even know where it came from how space actually happened because it must of started somewhere and what was there before space? Nothing? It's hard to think about and again it being me back to my first point of we will actually never know everything about everything  </TEXT>
