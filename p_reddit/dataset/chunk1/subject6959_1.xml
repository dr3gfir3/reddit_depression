	<TEXT> They're also quite misleading.

Australian cattle and sheep are mostly grass-fed in open pasture, or are used in crop rotation systems to convert grain stubble and nitrogen-fixing legumes into fertiliser and meat. Most of the biomass they eat is inedible to humans, and having them on fallow paddocks increases grain and vegetable yields.

Likewise, the water use claims are based on total consumption, (eg, from farm dams, rainwater etc) not on actually available water that could be used for other purposes, and are also based only on the extremely intensive styles of livestock farming rarely used in Australia. In reality, the water use per kilo of beef is close to parity with many vegetables.

Think about it yourself. How often do you see irrigation running on non-productive pastures? How often do you see cattle, sheep etc in ordinary open grassed paddocks? Which of these is more common?


Google around a bit. The info provided by /u/sixteen_weasels comes verbatim from a vegan site, and is a good wake-up call, but there's plenty of counterpoint data out there too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Turnbull deserves it.

He was well aware that a review and decision on the National Firearms Agreement was required before the sunset clause expired, and failed to make that happen.


Whatever you think about the actual merits of the argument, most of the chaos and dissonance could have been avoided by actually doing the work before the deadline. It's not like he didn't know about the agreement - he was [pontificating about it](https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2016/apr/28/australias-gun-laws-non-negotiable-says-turnbull-on-port-arthur-massacre-anniversary) in April.

All that was needed was a bit of leadership and decisiveness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not really. In theory, it's about the capacity:

The five-shot version of the weapon  which can pump out five bullets before being reloaded  can be legally purchased in Australia and is categorised as a category A gun which has the least restrictions around ownership.

The eight shot version of the lever action shotgun is temporarily banned. But critics say its pointless banning one and not the other as the five shot can be easily  and legally  adjusted to fire 11 slugs, more than the version that is banned.

In practice, it's about avoiding negative publicity, and maintaining the somewhat meaningless ban enacted by Tony Abbott.  </TEXT>

Last week, however, the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that the level of industrial disputes is at near record lows.

The idea was that each worker would buy the machine that replaced him/her and live on the subsequent output of that machine.

As you've noted, the companies wanted no part of it, and preferred to sack the workers and keep the efficiencies for themselves. I have no doubt the result will be the same this time around. </TEXT>

Interestingly though, there have been questions raised about the safety of pairing Quick Charge 3.0 with the USB C port used on the Note.

Since the Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge both have the same SoC as the Note 7 but retain the older MicroUSB port (and do not blow up), that could be a place to look for the battery damage culprit.

	<TEXT> GDP per capita has been flat for the past few years, and disposable income per capita has been falling since 2010.

The largest contributor to GDP growth has been household spending, which is why we now have the highest unconsolidated household debt to GDP in the world.

TLDR, Our GDP is just starting to show we're still spending like we're rich, but starting to realise it's all on credit. When the debt comes due, our GDB will slump like it's been king hit by a giant speed-raging bogan.

	<TEXT> What you're doing is called framing. It's narrowing the focus of discussion to a point where you can gain grudging agreement on one small aspect of the topic, then claim it validates your whole point.


It's a dishonest technique, and you should stop using it. 

In this instance for example, the absence of statistics on the tax-payments of people who are able to hide their taxable income means nothing. </TEXT>

Me, I think they do, and that all of the other non-statistical evidence that's available is far more damning of government and wealthy connivance than a spreadsheet or two.

Here's a few sources to get you started:
