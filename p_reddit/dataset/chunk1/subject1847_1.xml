	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been a software developer, entrepreneur, and CEO. All have pluses and minuses.

Developer - pros: mentally challenging, fun, good pay, work freedom, dress and appearance not too important. cons: you build it and someone makes a mint from it but it's not you. Not a great deal of upward mobility.

Entrepreneur - pros: total control of your work life, exciting, broad painful learning experiences, chance to make a mint. Cons: requires lots of sacrifice (work and personal) to be successful, work for little to no pay for quite a while, hard to get back into the corporate world (mentally) if your venture fails.

CEO - Pros: Good pay. Total control. Cons: Never "off the clock", hard to have life/work balance, immensely stressful as every decision affects the company's success and your employees' futures. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Request] Please please please - help me make a present for my father's 85th birthday! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-02-14 21:09:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My father turns 85 on March 8th. My mother, all of the children (5 of us), 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren are throwing a surprise birthday party for him on Feb 28th. 

We created an album for him of old pictures through his life and each child wrote a personal note to him here's a redacted copy of mine that I posted in response to an Askreddit question about [how old is too old to have children](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1xijy9/how_old_is_too_old_for_having_kids_serious/cfburz8?context=3)

When I was posting this comment it dawned on me that I have seen Reddit do some amazing things and maybe, just maybe, it could help me out with something.

You see, my father has had an amazing life. He grew up in the Great Depression in the heart of the Dust Bowl. His parents both died when he was very young. His siblings were split up. He was raised by his Aunt Mimmee. From that humble beginning he picked himself up, joined the Army, later got a job as a deckhand on a barge, and stayed with that same company his entire life. He has been married to his sweetheart for over 60 years. He succeeded in raising 5 children and sending us all to college. He was my best man at my wedding. 

Several years ago when my oldest boy was getting really deep into music I would write lyrics (I'm a bit challenged musically - but I tried). He would record the songs with his little band and it was kind of fun.
But I wrote one set of lyrics that I never gave to him. It was the story of my father's life. Now seems like the perfect time to see if someone could make it into a song that I could give him a recording of. My father was raised on country music. When I hear these lyrics in my head they are much like a Johnny Cash song. You know how he would not so much sing as he would talk?

So here's the request - does anyone have (or know of someone who has) the musical talent to put these lyrics to music? Maybe just with an acoustic guitar? You can even change some of the lyrics if they don't work (again - I'm kinda challenged musically).

Here are the lyrics if anyone can help. Thanks in advance. It's called "Ode to Billy"

	<TEXT> My father turns 85 on March 8th. My mother, all of the children (5 of us), 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren are throwing a surprise birthday party for him on Feb 28th. We created an album for him of old pictures through his life and each child wrote a personal note to him here's a redacted copy of mine that I posted in response to an Askreddit question about [how old is too old to have children](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1xijy9/how_old_is_too_old_for_having_kids_serious/cfburz8?context=3)

When I was posting this comment it dawned on me that I have seen Reddit do some amazing things and maybe, just maybe, it could help me out with something.

You see, my father has had an amazing life. He grew up in the Great Depression in the heart of the Dust Bowl. His parents both died when he was very young. His siblings were split up. He was raised by his Aunt Mimmee. From that humble beginning he picked himself up, joined the Army, later got a job as a deckhand on a barge, and stayed with that same company his entire life. He has been married to his sweetheart for over 60 years. He succeeded in raising 5 children and sending us all to college. He was my best man at my wedding. Several years ago when my oldest boy was getting really deep into music I would write lyrics (I'm a bit challenged musically - but I tried). He would record the songs with his little band and it was kind of fun. 

But I wrote one set of lyrics that I never gave to him. It was the story of my father's life. Now seems like the perfect time to see if someone could make it into a song that I could give him a recording of.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have had four people that I have known die of cancer.  One died within weeks of being diagnosed with stomach cancer.  The other three however went through the torturous multi-year process of fighting the disease.  In each case, there were times when the person looked literally near death - frail, tired, unresponsive.  Just not themselves.  Then in each case a few weeks before they finally died they suddenly perked up.  Not a little.  A lot.  They got color, energy, and seem excited about the future.  If you didn't know it you would bet these were healthy happy people planning to live a long prosperous life.  And then, the downfall comes fast and furious and in a matter of days they are gone.

	<TEXT> Hi fellow redditors.  I am building a natural swim pond and have no idea how to do it.  I am learning as I go and so far it has been fun.  If it comes out half as good as I have in my head I will be happy.

So far I have put up two other posts [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/1vv2lf/im_building_a_natural_swim_pond_and_was_wondering/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/1wnf1a/building_a_natural_swim_pond_first_update_details/)

Several folks have asked me to provide updates as I go so I think I will just start an Imgur album and add pictures there each time I provide an update so as the project progresses people can see back though each step.  Do you think that makes sense to do?

So the [picture here](http://imgur.com/nNFfq8D) shows the completed excavation.  I have added some text to show the rough design but it is evolving as I go.  I am really interested in making this an interactive learning exercise for all of us if you guys are up for it.  

Please provide design and engineering ideas and tips as I go and I will attempt to incorporate the ones that the supervisor approves (my wife :)) and I'm sure from replies to my prior posts there will be some great engineering tips/ideas to keep me from any big whopper errors.

My next big decision I need some votes on is whether or not to put in a liner.  The three choices are a) no liner b) liner on bottom only or c) full liner up and over the edges of the pond.  See my prior posts.  There is very low seepage as this is deep Georgia red clay.  My personal leaning is toward (b) but please convince me otherwise if you have reason to believe that won't work.  I do want to maintain fairly clear to very clear water and their will be some fish in the pond (a few bass and some bluegill).  I will be seeding the waterfall with crawfish fry and tadpoles in the bio mass shelves.

Let's do this!

Credits for submitted assistance so far:

/u/momma_dukes directed me to some great books to learn the basics

/u/CogitoNM provided great detailed thoughts on liners and biofilter ideas </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is the best way to control water flow rates remotely? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-23 16:38:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am building a natural swim pond and I am planning to have a large waterfall on one end.  It will be circulating water from the pond via a PVC pipe from the other end of the pond using a high-volume pump.

What I want to do is be able to control the waterfall flow rate.  I've found any number of remote controlled water values but they only allow for on/off (really look to be used to remotely turn off the water main to a house when a pipe breaks).

Does anyone know how I could best accomplish this?  Ideally it would operate similar to a dimmer switch on a light fixture allowing me to increase or decrease the water flow remotely.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Reddit military and China (Ming Dynasty) historians - Help please with this cannon please </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-05 19:39:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My father-in-law recently gifted us a Ming dynasty cannon from the Great Wall of China that has been in  his family for many years.  Here is the history as he related it:

"My grandfather (mother's side) Reynolds J Burt (USMA Class 1896) commanded the 15th Infantry Regiment (The Can Do Regiment) in China just before he retired in 1937.  I am guessing that he went to China in 1934.  He traveled and hunted a lot while he was there.  He told me that on one of his trips he visited the Great Wall of China and showed some interest in two identical cannons.  His hosts gave them to him and I first saw them at his retirement home. He subsequently gave them to his son, R J Burt Jr USMA Class 1920.  They  have been passed down in the family until they were given to me.  I gave one of them to the Fort Jackson Military Museum when I was in command there.  The museum showed me pictures of such cannons in China and dated them around the time of construction of the Great Wall.  They could not determine the actual date of the cannon hence the date range on the plaque.  The museum's data showed that the cannons actually had no recoil, in that the powder backed behind the ball when ignited blew the ball out the front and let the force of the blast escape to the rear.  Hence no need for a strong superstructure.  The pictures the museum also indicated that the elevation mechanism could provide almost no height to the shot and the cannon must have been aimed at targets at a lower elevation. The assumption was that they must have been placed on the wall and fired downward at enemies outside. "

[Here are two pictures of the cannon and the plague](http://imgur.com/J4ZZG76,8iJpOWI#0)

I would like to find out any information you guys might have about this cannon.

Thanks in advance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> background: I was in a little fender bender recently and needed a replacement bumper for my truck.  I found one on Craigslist.  I called the guy and he seemed like a nice guy on the phone.  He said he had to take his son to an appointment so if I needed the bumper he would send me his address and leave it on the porch for me and I could put the money under the mat.  He offered this to a random person responding to a Craigslist ad.  I asked him if he had a PayPal and he said he did.  So I sent him the $50 for the bumper.  He told me he had to come into town every week for his son's medical appointments and he would call me the next time so we could arrange to meet for me to get the bumper.  

He called me last night and it turned out his son's appointment was at Children's Hospital about 1 mile from my office.  I met him there for the exchange.  While talking with him he told me with a bit of emotion that his 17-year-old son had cancer.  From some comments he made I could tell that money was tight for him and his family.  As we left, I offered him all of the cash in my pocket.  He refused.  Pride is a dangerous thing.

So I PayPal'ed him when I got back to the office and told him to buy something for his son to keep his spirits up and to pay it forward someday to brighten someone else's day (note in comments)

Think how bright this world would be if we all could just pay-forward just the smallest amounts to brighten other people's days.

	<TITLE> Shake (The Tsunami Song) - Lyrics and my son's version </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-11 16:43:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> my son actually recorded this one and it was by far my favorite he did before he left for college - I called it "Shake" - he called it "Tsunami" and fixed some of my crappy lyrics. See what you can do with it. I've uploaded his version here: (http://picosong.com/FrM2)


Shake it up Shake it up Shake, shake, Shake it up
Now... knock it down!!!
(Kick ass solo or fat bass line here)
Sometimes the world's Gotta change overnight
Shake itself free from This human cancer - that's right
There I said it and you should too We're all rapists its just different victims we do
Some rape the flesh And some rape the mind But we all rape the planet From time to time
So I say
Shake it up Shake it up Shake, shake, Shake it up
Now... Drown it out!!!
(short very drum solo)
Bring the holy water To wash away our sins And with nothing left standing Mother Nature wins (Background yell: water attack, super effective!)
Now Burn what remains Make the world pure
How do you kill a cancer? Use a radiation cure
So I say
Shake it up Shake it up Shake, shake, Shake it up
Now finish the job man... Radiate us all!!!
(Big guitar solo)
Burn baby burn Burn baby burn Burn baby burn Burn baby burn
Hell on Earth baby WE ALL NEED TO BURN! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't want to mach you
But you leave me no choice
You're tearing me down
With your belittling voice

Don't need to reach the speed of light
Just the speed of sound
I'll escape your droning
If I just hold my ground

I can't hear you
I'm already mach+1
Just out of earshot
A man on the run
You lost control of me
at mach+1

Push on that pedal
Ass to the sun
Need to outrun
Your sonic gun

Your words are your weapons
You taunt me for fun
My only defense
Is mach+1

I can't hear you
I'm already mach+1
Just out of earshot
A man on the run
You lost control of me
at mach+1

I hope you heard
My sonic boom
I just passed mach
And I'm running on fumes

	<TEXT> I watch the heavens shining down on me
Held out of reach by this
God damn gravity

I see the stars
Up in the sky
Flashing lights of
dreams gone by 

Oh, Left to right
Oh, Left to right
Left to right
I'll follow these stars tonight

Across the branches
of my life
From deep in my roots
These dreams take flight

Into the night
Up in the sky
Fleeting lights of
dreams gone by 

Oh, Left to right
Oh, Left to right
Left to right
I'll follow these stars tonight 

My tattered dreams
Sit high on your shelve
Still beautiful after
All this pain

But still no closer
Still out of my reach
I can't make them mine
Just this useless rhyme

Now I'm Left to write,
Oh, I'm left to write
I'm left to write
This mournful song
Tonight

It wasn't right
The way that you left
A crushing blow
Your thoughtless theft

My fears they roost
close to home
You stole my dreams
And left me all alone

Oh, Left to right
Oh, Left to right
Left to right
I'll follow these stars tonight

Now I'm Left to write,
Oh, I'm left to write
I'm left to write
This mournful song
Tonight

You left me right
You left me right
You left me right
On the razor's edge 
Tonight

	<TEXT> When I was young, it was a rarity to ever see a person over 300 lbs.  Today, I can't count the number of people I see in one day over 300 lbs using my fingers and toes combined.

Advertising and the internet seem to be enabling obese people to be "okay" with themselves.  

Isn't this ultimately perpetuating the problem and just making it worse? </TEXT>
