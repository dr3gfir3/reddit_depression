	<TEXT> I've climbed Mount Fuji, and it was on a similar sort of day except that it was sheathed in clouds. I had wanted to see a view, of course, but the air was thin, misty and cold even though it was a summer's day. Nothing to see but iron ore outcroppings and impenetrable mist. I got a plastic-wrapped block of cheese that I had brought from "the surface" from my pack. The sealed rectangular plastic sheath had ballooned out into a oblong glob because the cheese had been packed at sea-level pressure.

So I saw no magnificent view of Japan from atop Fuji, but I wouldn't have it any other way. </TEXT>
