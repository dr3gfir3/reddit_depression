	<TEXT> I don't know how man, I just broke an alliance with the UK when France declared war on them. Then Russian Louisiana started their own war with a French colony and I spent 10k gold to get out of it. 

Bohemia is emperor and allied to them, France has a third of the US and all of Iberia and what Aragon colonized. The Ottomans are my rival. There are no other super powers worth a damn.

Someone help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> France, the only rival I could select besides the Ottomans, apparently integrated Aragon. Didn't even realizing they have a PU. 

Not like this... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, something happened when I converted to Protestantism that demoted me to Duchy a long while into the campaign. I thought it was kind of funny, then forgot by the end that I'd never upgraded back up. Thus, the Duchy of Bohemia was born.

EDIT: I actually just read somewhere that becoming Emperor might have had something to do with it. Especially cuz I then lost emperorship and also my elector status thereafter. Due to the whole being Protestant thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ;D

Every few years, Cornwall separatists bounced up to 80-90%. Not even the English rebels cared as much about their independence as you tenacious lads. The name calling was a sign of begrudging respect, I assure you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I feel slightly bad, in other playthroughs for this achievement, France would either refuse to cross the channel when they went to war with England, or they would go too far and claim every single province they took. It was a bittersweet turn of events for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haven't decided, I'm only just now getting a respectable income. I don't really have any powerful allies anymore, because I expended nearly all of them on my conquest of the isles. I'll have to set a new achievement goal and work for that, though I'm not sure what that might be yet. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it may have had something to do with an event that forced the country Protestant or a female heir become Queen. Some point around then I lost half my alliances and my elector status and I didn't really understand what happened. I just assumed was a duchy all game, which in hindsight, yes, makes absolutely no sense.

	<TEXT> From my experience here, yeah, Italian countries look really fun. Florence was great because of how much money I was making at basically all points in my run. Even though I couldn't ever match the might of most big nation armies, I could sure as hell triple my standing army in mercenaries in every war. It you want more of a challenge, though, it might be worthwhile trying some other Italian minor. I've only got like 200hrs logged, so what do I know?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it just happened to be in range, since it was a coastal province and I had already cored Granada and then Asturias (the strange out-of-place green province in northern Castile you might see lingering in one of the images of my post-war spoils from France).  </TEXT>
