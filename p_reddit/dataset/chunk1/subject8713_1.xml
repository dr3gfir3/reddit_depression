	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It is my Son's birthday tomorrow and I am really excited. Last year he had a DC comics superhero party which opened door for themed party. So this year for his 11th Birthday, he is having a Marvel comics themed party and a treasure hunt. In addition to endless pizza and candy. This year only 11 children are coming from his school. We decided to go against the inviting the whole class thing this year, as ultimately my son only wanted the 11 friends he invited at his party. 

When we sent out the birthday invites to the kids, we asked that all attending parents (parents who want to stay for the party) to also dress up. Last year, 2 of 7 attending parents didn't think we were serious about the costumes and boy did they stick out. So I am really excited to see what people will come as.

	<TEXT> Following my [pervious post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/5vs0vg/son_10_refuses_to_open_up_about_incident_at/) my son thankful told us what happened about the incident in his own words. It seems like the teacher was baited by the other child, but its not an excuse to strike a child. This would not have been possible with the advice I received from this community. 

My son has decided that he wants to give a statement/testify and we fully support him. Though I would have supported him even if he didn't or if he decides to stop a later date. 

I am just a little worried now about whether exposing him to he justice system so young is a good idea. Even though we have been assured that all they want is a recorded interview.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Son [10] refuses to open up about incident at school. Please advise. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My son goes to a private school for children with behavioural issues and other special needs. At school he also has an extra secondary language class with 3 other children. During one these extra lesson this week, it's been alleged that the teacher struck another child hard enough to chip a tooth. The vice principal at school asked me if my son could provide a statement which then will be forwarded to the authorities. 

I am all for it, but my son says he doesn't want to. I have tried to explain to him why it's important to help in others by telling the truth. He isn't concerned. Another issue is that his grandfather (my father) had a bad experience with the authorities. So my son has decided not to trust authority figures at all. My father is going behind my back and tell my son that he is doing the right thing. 

We don't know what we can do.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Day 4 after Major relapse </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-21 18:55:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I (28m) have been drinking for 13years, but it's  gotten bad in the the last 3 years. 

5 days ago I had a major relapse. Though I was sober for 24 days before that.  Previously I was hospital for another illness, but I also had some professional help with the detox. Which made the process of stopping much easier. I didn't have any withdrawals symptoms when I did the detox at the hospital. 

I am struggling a little bit today, as the headache and shakes are getting little unbearable. I don't know what I can to ease the symptoms at the moment at home. I pledge that I will not drink today though.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Finding it hard to look after my niece </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-12 01:39:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a bit of a rant but any advice would be really helpful. My SO and I are looking after my 2 y/o (3 in 2 months) niece for a little while. As my brother is still recovering from a horrible car accident, and he is looking after my disabled 2 year old nephew. Additionally the mother of the girl has now gone to prison for 8 months. 

We're finding hard to look after my niece as she always crying for mom. She doesn't really know us as the mother kept the child a secret until social services got involved. Every time we tell the girl to do something she always counters it with "but my mommy says we do it like blahblahblah".  We are trying not to be too firm at the moment because obviously this is a big change for her. 

We have a nearly two y/o of our own. We thought they would get along. They don't. My niece is also being mean to my daughter whose speech is not as developed as her own. My daughter is always snatching back the toys from her cousin. My niece cries over anything. She'll drop her teddy and instead of picking it up, she will cry like she's been pinched. 

It is a nightmare.  </TEXT>
