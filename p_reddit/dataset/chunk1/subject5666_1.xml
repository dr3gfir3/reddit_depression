	<TEXT> People who dismiss the idea that Clinton and others privately encouraged Trump to run because they smartly calculated it would create disarray in the GOP (which has indeed happened) and help the Democrats in the long run, are vastly underestimating the brilliance of the Clintons and their inner circle.

The Clintons invented the modern concept of triangulation in Democratic politics (taking the GOP's strongest policy issues and coopting them) and of turning an opponent's supposed strengths into a perceived negative/weakness and then using it as a bludgeon to beat them over the head with.

Karl Rove does this on the GOP side, but the Clintons were so masterful at it that they did it without it even being obvious they were doing it. How many people reading this truly grasp the importance of the fact Clinton took Ronald Reagan and used him as an example of WEAKNESS and FAILURE in the GOP? Not just in messaging to Democrats, mind you, but to the public at large and (most importantly) to independents. And he did it without ever seeming to bash Reagan personally even though he was repudiating the entirety of Reagan's presidency and everyone who claimed it accomplished anything good.

The point is, the Clintons have a more nuanced and complex an understanding of politics and strategy, and of undermining an opponent, than anyone involved in modern politics. Bill Clinton himself could probably sell a fireplace to the Devil, that's how convincing and charismatic he is. He makes people feel like the most important person in the world, and to someone like Trump that would be a pretty powerful political aphrodisiac. Imagine having a former U.S. president -- and one commonly perceived as being among the smartest and most astute -- tell you you should run for president while he fans your ego (and in this theory, imagine you have possibly the biggest and hungriest ego in the galaxy).

Does someone have to KNOW they are a plant, in order to be one? Do you have to realize you're being used as a tool to dismantle a party machine, in order to function effectively as that tool? I say the answer to that is "no." If the Clintons and others secretly worked behind the scenes to convince Trump to run and fed ideas and encouragement to his worst tendencies in order to derail the already-shaky GOP nominating season, and if Trump listened to them and took their advice to heart, then he is functioning pretty effectively as their intended plant.

It doesn't matter if he realizes their motivations or not. He might indeed have been entirely conscious of how and why the Clintons perceived his campaigning as an advantage for them, but he just doesn't agree or just doesn't care so long as (a) it serves his own purposes of expanding his own brand, and (b) he thinks he might actually be smarter than them and able to actually win regardless of what they think. The bottom line is, if they had a plan and took action to implement it, and if so far it's worked out as they hoped and expected, and if Trump's awareness is irrelevant to their plan's success at this point in time, then he's functioning as a plant exactly the same as he would if he were doing all of this intentionally to help them out.

Now, IS it true? Well, I think it's clear Clinton had private conversations with Trump; it's clear Clinton wants to deny and silence any talk of having played a role in Trump's candidacy; it's clear Trump doesn't want anyone to think the conversations were a factor in his decision to run; and it's clear that Trump's campaign has had exactly the same impact it would have if the Clintons had planned it out and encouraged it. So, the outcome is the same as if the theory were true; we know they did in fact meet, which the theory depends on; and we know they want us to stop thinking about it, which is what they'd do and say if the theory were true. None of which proves the theory is true, but it certainly goes a long way to undermining any strong assertions that the theory is absurd or irrational, or that it lacks at least some basic evidence making it interesting to consider and reasonable to think it's at least possible. Calling it ridiculous etc just seems to demonstrate a lack of appreciation for the fact this sort of thing is extremely common in politics, and is extremely consistent with the sort of maneuvering the Clintons are famously capable of thinking up and pulling off effectively while nobody believes it's possible.

Oh, and if you're doubting it based on the claim that Clinton couldn't keep his sex life secret, then I'd just point out that the fact you're aware of some secrets that they didn't keep quiet doesn't mean you're aware of all of the secrets you don't already know about. The severe flaw in the simplistic "the government can't keep secrets" claim is that it relies on the assumption you already know all of the secrets, when in fact if the government has kept secrets then you by definition aren't aware of them yet. Then there are all of the examples of major secrets the government kept for years and decades. More to the point, though, for those who think this theory can't be true because Clinton/the government/etc can't keep secrets -- we're discussing it right here, right now, so obviously it ISN'T a secret anyway, right? Right.

I'll tell you what I think... I think the Clintons got wind Trump was considering another run, they realized it was probably just a minor ego-boosting idea in Trump's head, so Clinton reached out and encouraged Trump, and then also reached out to other people to get THEM to encourage Trump, with the idea Trump would be such a huge disruption he'd draw most of the media attention from other more "serious" GOP contenders while also (very importantly) drawing attention away from the ongoing controversies surrounding Hillary Clinton. Trump's press coverage is dominating all of the election reporting lately, and has done much to stain the GOP's image with independents, moderates, and the two most important voting demographics for the 2016 election -- Latino voters and women voters.

So I don't for a second believe Clinton was talking with Trump and that those discussions never touched on the election, and that it's a coincidence Trump decided to make a big run for the nomination. Coincidences like this, and the way it's played out, don't just "happen" when the Clintons are involved in an election, folks.

Trump agreeing to run after being influenced by Clinton and others doesn't remotely require him to have the intended purpose of harming the GOP nor of helping the Democrats, by the way. Clinton wouldn't have to approach Trump by asking him outright to derail the GOP, nor would Clinton suggest, "Hey Trump, you'd be so awful you'd make the public hate the GOP, so would you run?" He'd probably point to all of Trump's strengths as a candidate, the way certain policy positions and "plain talk" would rally the GOP base around Trump, how there are no really strong personalities in the GOP field at this time who can compete with Trump's personality, and how the outcome is a huge boon for Trump whether he gets the nomination or not since it will vastly increase Trump's personal brand and put him in a much stronger bargaining position for future TV shows and media deals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A key Hillary Clinton aide at the State Department performed work for the Clinton Foundation, CNN reported Thursday.

Cheryl Mills interviewed job candidates for the Clinton Foundation while working as Clintons chief of staff at State, the report said.


Clinton and her familys charitable foundation agreed to a set of rules once she became secretary of State in 2009. The guidelines were meant to ensure the foundations activities would not create conflicts or the appearance of conflicts for Senator Clinton as secretary of State.
Mills traveled to New York City in June 2012 and interviewed two high-level business executives for a prominent position at the Clinton Foundation, CNN reported. </TEXT>

You are about to read a list of 45 goals that found their way down the halls of our great Capitol back in 1963. As you read this, 39 years later, you should be shocked by the events that have played themselves out. I first ran across this list 3 years ago but was unable to attain a copy and it has bothered me ever since. Recently, Jeff Rense posted it on his site and I would like to thank him for doing so. http://www.rense.com
 
Communist Goals (1963) Congressional Record--Appendix, pp. A34-A35 January 10, 1963
 
Current Communist Goals EXTENSION OF REMARKS OF HON. A. S. HERLONG, JR. OF FLORIDA IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES Thursday, January 10, 1963 .
 
Mr. HERLONG. Mr. Speaker, Mrs. Patricia Nordman of De Land, Fla., is an ardent and articulate opponent of communism, and until recently published the De Land Courier, which she dedicated to the purpose of alerting the public to the dangers of communism in America.
 
At Mrs. Nordman's request, I include in the RECORD, under unanimous consent, the following "Current Communist Goals," which she identifies as an excerpt from "The Naked Communist," by Cleon Skousen:
 
[From "The Naked Communist," by Cleon Skousen]
 
1. U.S. acceptance of coexistence as the only alternative to atomic war.
 
2. U.S. willingness to capitulate in preference to engaging in atomic war.
 
3. Develop the illusion that total disarmament [by] the United States would be a demonstration of moral strength.
 
4. Permit free trade between all nations regardless of Communist affiliation and regardless of whether or not items could be used for war.
 
5. Extension of long-term loans to Russia and Soviet satellites.
 
6. Provide American aid to all nations regardless of Communist domination.
 
7. Grant recognition of Red China. Admission of Red China to the U.N.
 
8. Set up East and West Germany as separate states in spite of Khrushchev's promise in 1955 to settle the German question by free elections under supervision of the U.N.
 
9. Prolong the conferences to ban atomic tests because the United States has agreed to suspend tests as long as negotiations are in progress.
 
10. Allow all Soviet satellites individual representation in the U.N.
 
11. Promote the U.N. as the only hope for mankind. If its charter is rewritten, demand that it be set up as a one-world government with its own independent armed forces. (Some Communist leaders believe the world can be taken over as easily by the U.N. as by Moscow. Sometimes these two centers compete with each other as they are now doing in the Congo.)
 
12. Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist Party.
 
13. Do away with all loyalty oaths.
 
14. Continue giving Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.
 
15. Capture one or both of the political parties in the United States.
 
16. Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken basic American institutions by claiming their activities violate civil rights.
 
17. Get control of the schools. Use them as transmission belts for socialism and current Communist propaganda. Soften the curriculum. Get control of teachers' associations. Put the party line in textbooks.
 
18. Gain control of all student newspapers.
 
19. Use student riots to foment public protests against programs or organizations which are under Communist attack.
 
20. Infiltrate the press. Get control of book-review assignments, editorial writing, policy-making positions.
 
21. Gain control of key positions in radio, TV, and motion pictures.
 
22. Continue discrediting American culture by degrading all forms of artistic expression. An American Communist cell was told to "eliminate all good sculpture from parks and buildings, substitute shapeless, awkward and meaningless forms."
 
23. Control art critics and directors of art museums. "Our plan is to promote ugliness, repulsive, meaningless art."
 
24. Eliminate all laws governing obscenity by calling them "censorship" and a violation of free speech and free press.
 
25. Break down cultural standards of morality by promoting pornography and obscenity in books, magazines, motion pictures, radio, and TV.
 
26. Present homosexuality, degeneracy and promiscuity as "normal, natural, healthy."
 
27. Infiltrate the churches and replace revealed religion with "social" religion. Discredit the Bible and emphasize the need for intellectual maturity, which does not need a "religious crutch."
 
28. Eliminate prayer or any phase of religious expression in the schools on the ground that it violates the principle of "separation of church and state."
 
29. Discredit the American Constitution by calling it inadequate, old-fashioned, out of step with modern needs, a hindrance to cooperation between nations on a worldwide basis.
 
30. Discredit the American Founding Fathers. Present them as selfish aristocrats who had no concern for the "common man."
 
31. Belittle all forms of American culture and discourage the teaching of American history on the ground that it was only a minor part of the "big picture." Give more emphasis to Russian history since the Communists took over.
 
32. Support any socialist movement to give centralized control over any part of the culture--education, social agencies, welfare programs, mental health clinics, etc.
 
33. Eliminate all laws or procedures which interfere with the operation of the Communist apparatus.
 
34. Eliminate the House Committee on Un-American Activities.
 
35. Discredit and eventually dismantle the FBI.
 
36. Infiltrate and gain control of more unions.
 
37. Infiltrate and gain control of big business.
 
38. Transfer some of the powers of arrest from the police to social agencies. Treat all behavioral problems as psychiatric disorders which no one but psychiatrists can understand [or treat].
 
39. Dominate the psychiatric profession and use mental health laws as a means of gaining coercive control over those who oppose Communist goals.
 
40. Discredit the family as an institution. Encourage promiscuity and easy divorce.
 
41. Emphasize the need to raise children away from the negative influence of parents. Attribute prejudices, mental blocks and retarding of children to suppressive influence of parents.
 
42. Create the impression that violence and insurrection are legitimate aspects of the American tradition; that students and special-interest groups should rise up and use ["]united force["] to solve economic, political or social problems.
 
43. Overthrow all colonial governments before native populations are ready for self-government.
 
44. Internationalize the Panama Canal.
 
45. Repeal the Connally reservation so the United States cannot prevent the World Court from seizing jurisdiction [over domestic problems. Give the World Court jurisdiction] over nations and individuals alike.
 
Note by Webmaster: The Congressional Record back this far has not be digitized and posted on the Internet.
 
It will probably be available at your nearest library that is a federal repository. Call them and ask them. Your college library is probably a repository. This is an excellent source of government records. Another source are your Congress Critters. They should be more than happy to help you in this matter. You will find the Ten Planks of the Communist Manifesto interesting at this point.
 
Webmaster Forest Glen Durland found the document in the library. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a avid smoker and former extacy user, I also deal with depression/anxiety . 

I am able to use weed to help with motivation and provoke a self awareness that I would never have achieved otherwise. I belive if you use it in small doses and think of it as a medicine instead of a narcotic you can achieve great results with it. 

I personally will not do extacy again. It amplifies my depression and puts me in a haze for at least a week after dosing it. 

In your case you probably don't want to use any drug to escape feelings that you might not want to deal with. You will have a good chance of getting into harder drugs to escape.  </TEXT>
