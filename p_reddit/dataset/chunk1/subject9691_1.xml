	<TEXT> Edit:  Thank you all so much for your advice, kind words,  and prayers.  I feel so encouraged just to know that there are people out there who have been where we are and are in good places now.  I really appreciate all of you taking the time to comment.  God bless you all!


First off, I've never posted before so hopefully I'm doing this right.  My husband has struggled with depression on and off his entire life.  He has experienced some really crappy things, and depression tends to run in his family.  We've been married for two years, and everything has been really wonderful, but recently he's been extremely depressed to the point where he's developed social anxiety and has a difficult time even going to work.  

It's been really hard on both him and me, and I guess the reason I'm sharing this is because I don't feel like I have anyone to talk to about it.  Part of me is scared that my family will see this as a weakness, and I also feel like sharing it with someone I know would be an invasion of his privacy. 

TLDR: Please pray for the both of us: that he will receive healing and that I will be supportive and loving through it all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time when I was 13 I had to do a white elephant gift for this church group I was in.  Long story short, I ended up with a dust pan. A. Dust. Pan. And no it was not a gag gift. </TEXT>
