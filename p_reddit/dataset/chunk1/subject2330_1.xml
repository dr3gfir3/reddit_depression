	<TEXT> Im still going to mark spoilers just incase you didnt read the fucking title.  


If you've seen the movie you know that [Han Solo](#spoiler) dies. Now [Harrison Ford](#spoiler) famously almost quit the franchise back in the early 80's. He's been so happy on all of his appearances leading up to this movie because he knows he's officially done. I'm sure some where deep down in his black heart he appreciates the franchise(I hope so atleast), but I'm sure he was even more happy to cash one more check. Hell, Alec Guiness also famously hated being Obi-Wan and begged Lucas to kill him off early, to keep his performance minimal. I propose that [this](http://i.imgur.com/PCsOA7M.jpg) is a shit eating grin.

I have no money for this hobby right now, and all equipment was handed down, or pieces left over from years ago. Basically I'm trying to marry a connection to a new sub, and if I can do that I think I'm golden. 


How can I connect [this](http://i.imgur.com/F17gmCx.jpg) to [this](http://i.imgur.com/Ge9GjCq.jpg)? I obviously know I can't plug these two pieces together. I'm curious if I can splice the wires to make this connection.


Right now my laptop only has a headphone jack that I have connected through an old guitar amp and some cheap computer speakers. Is what I'm trying to do even possible? Please don't laugh I feel old, and out of my element! Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm talking big budget and low budget films that may have had a great cast/director/writers, that just ended up terrible in the end. 

I think a great example for me would be The Dark Knight Rises. I'll just say that I did not expect Anne Hathaway to do a great job, but then she blew me away with the bar scene alone. But the rest of the cast/team had previously knocked it out of the park, and it just didn't pan out for me at least.


Another example would be Gangster Squad. Holy shit, the cast list had me hyped when I first saw the trailer, and then it fell flat. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not even mad anymore, I'm impressed. FROM has created the first software that can read your mind. I've made over 15 characters, and every time I want something and farm it, it doesn't show up. 


I'm on NG+ with a particular character at 20mil SM and I can't get Alonne captain armor. Every other character I have as at least one of this chest pieces. I used 4 ascetics last night on a NG character in the DLC to get a certain chicken wing, and nothing. 


I have all of the appropriate gear for item find and occasionally pop the coins, but I truly believe that the game can peer into my brain disable drops that I want. This tinfoil hat is itchy, but I hope it helps!

	<TITLE> TIL the Butcher's knife R2 can be parried. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is probably common knowledge but I feel like a fool. I have several characters I PvP with, by my Butcher has been my favorite for a while now. Whenever someone whips out the old MonScim I always use the slightly unique R2 combo to kill them.

Well today someone parried that attack. They only hit me for very little damage and I still won the fight, but I literally gasped when it happened. I'm assuming because of the slow wind up it's just hard to time a parry on the move and I've been skating on this ice this whole time. 


Like I said, sorry if this is known but I'm amazed that this game can still surprise me. </TEXT>

About an hour ago everything stopped. I've quit and reloaded, reset my router, connections are great. Tried changing region options but, it's taking almost 10 minutes to connect to a fight and I've only seen the same three people. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Fencer Build </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-04 22:18:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've played through hundreds of hours of DS2, beat it on everything from NG-NG+7 with many different builds, and the DLC on NG-NG+6 as of today.


I've never tried a parrying/fencer build ever. What it comes down to is I suck at parrying. I started a new character today and picked up Ricards rapier. I already have the required Dex, and 105 agility. What I'm looking for is some tips on how to make this play through, and possibly some PvP, not torture. Any suggestions are welcome, from equipment and fashion, to stats and strategy. 


Thanks in advance. </TEXT>
