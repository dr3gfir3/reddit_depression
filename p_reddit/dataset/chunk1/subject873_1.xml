	<TEXT> chelsea is a pretty pricey neighborhood. i would suggest finding a place that is close to a convenient subway stop in a more reasonably priced neighborhood. you definitely won't need a car unless you plan on taking a lot of weekend trips to the hamptons. having a car in nyc is a huge pain in the ass.  </TEXT>
