	<TEXT> The main reason I like session view is because you can get ideas down really quickly and have something going in a matter of minutes. I really don't think it is good for writing a proper full track but it is a great way of starting a track. Once I have a good idea down then I usually switch to arrangement view to further improve that idea. Session view is also great for storing MIDI clips that you have bounced to audio. 

Two reasons why you should use arrangement view:

- You can see the waveforms of audio files in arrangement view, not just the clip that is playing. 
- Automation is a lot easier and efficient. 

Just my two cents!

	<TEXT> I think actual stereo widening is when you take something from say, the right channel, and feed it into the left channel, making the sound fuller and livelier. I would warn you not to widen sounds that are in the low to mid frequency range, as that can really fuck up harmonics and other important listening factors. 

Here is why you should not widen sub bass https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/culprate-my-rock-grapes-cheeky

I did the mistake of turning the spread knob in Operator to one hundred percent and you can definitely hear how it fucked up the entire mix when the other elements come in around 27 seconds in. 

You learn from your mistakes I guess! I never got around to fixing it as you can tell! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Using Operator in its most simplest form. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-28 15:33:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am writing this post to hopefully give you guys some inspiration and also to look at Operator in a completely different way for what it is classically known for. Now before you read this post, please consider the fact that I am writing this for producers who create ambient, chill out or experimental. This post probably wont be handy for neuro tech heads.

A large majority of my productions include an instance of Operator in some shape or form. I like to use it because I can open up the initial patch and already have some source of inspiration. A simple sine wave can create the most beautiful leads, given that you have a melody that works with the wave well. The lead in this track is just a sine wave. 

Have a listen ~ https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/drown
And this is what the channel looked like ~ http://imgur.com/QTC4XWn
Notice the little pitch window has been activated and the spread has been increased. I used this to give the sound some space and to widen it up a bit. Try not to over complicate your sounds!

Again, another tune that used just a sine wave as the lead, but this time I added a Camelphat and increased the Bitcrusher and Distortion knobs to give it some luscious grit. https://soundcloud.com/abcdegrapes/tonal-garden

I hope this post gave some producers an insight into how easy Operator can be utilized and woven into your productions. 

TL;DR = The greatest ideas are the simplest! Dont over complicate!

	<TEXT> I was in a similar situation i guess (basically just on holidays with no access to laptop). The best thing you can do in my opinion is to simply listen to new or old music. Listen to it over and over again. Maybe it'll inspire you, maybe it will encourage you to learn something new, because after however long you are away for, you will be wanting to get right back into music making. 

The good thing about this is that you don't necessarily need access to the internet. It could just be an old album you are listening to. Maybe study and listen to the flow of the album and how each separate song works with each other until the end. Or if its just a single song, find a sound or vibe you really like and use your imagination to figure it how it was made. 

Thats just my two cents! Looking forward to other ideas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You definitely need more time practising mate. A week is nothing! If you want to develop your skills and work on your weaknesses, you're going to have to practise a lot more. I used Ableton for nearly 2 years before I started using it properly to write songs. 

With that said,  there is no secret recipe for making complex sounds. This also depends on what kind of music you're making. If its bass-orientated, process your bass sounds so there is lots of movement so it keeps it interesting. I am no expert on bas sounds but this can be done through effects like EQ'ing (notch etc), flanger, phaser, even a grain delay. 
If youre making very melodic and rhythmic tunes, reverb and delay is your best friend. I also use gentle distortion after my reverb to crispen up the tail of the sound. 

That is a very simple explanation but through practise and hard work, these techniques and solutions will come to you naturally! Be patient and have fun. 

Good luck </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once you have your plugins and samples down, don't focus on expanding them. You will end up with this huge collection of samples and vst's that you don't even use and you will spend more time looking through them instead of solid production time. Focus more on "how did they make this" instead of "what did they use to make this". 

With that said, my favourite plugins are: 

Transient Shaper: http://www.schaack-audio.com/transientshaper.html

CamelCrusher: http://www.camelaudio.com/camelcrusher.php

LexHall: http://www.lexiconpro.com/en-US/products/pcm-native-reverb-plug-in-bundle

I don't really use 3rd party VST's very much. Ableton's Operator and Tension are absolutely fine. You just need a few extra layers if creating, for example, a bass sound. 

Samples, in my opinion, are really easy to find and build up. Just google search what ever you are looking for and then add 'samples' at the end. 

If you have the equipment, recording old vinyl samples is a lot of fun and opens you up to new sounds you may have not heard before. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically this producer uploaded a tutorial on how he made his recent 'trap' song. He commented asking why people were disliking the video and I responded saying because there is nothing special in the tune that stands out and your'e just following the trend that is most popular at the moment. Obviously, I received a lot of hate responses.
What are your opinions on this matter? Personally, I hate it. I think producers should try and evolve their productions without taking sharp turns and being influenced by popular trends and culture. </TEXT>
