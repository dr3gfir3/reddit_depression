	<TEXT> But these people just don't vote and then whine.

Take Brexit for example, the areas that were against it had MUCH lower voter participation. Everybody knew it was going to be tight, everyone knew that future of Britain is at stake and yet the young voters, those who had most to lose decided to sit it out.

Not all of them of course, but way too much. And in this case its very similar. There is a party that offers genuinely different policies, party which could change things, maybe for better, maybe for worse, but it could change them. And yet here we are. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but who selects the candidates for that interview?

The HR people do. The interview itself can be conducted with actual developer, but quite often the candidates are of poor quality because of the first selection round. 

And in many companies (my last workplace for example) there is also a time factor. 
If you don't fill the open position in time, someone in the management few levels above you can see that position as wasteful expense and decide to cut it.

So eventually you have to settle for sub-par candidate that was selected by you, but from options provided to you by HR.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People who hire programmers, or at least people who have major impact on the decision, are rarely educated in these matters. Lets face it, what does your average HR worker know about algorithm complexity, memory management, OO paradigm or relational databases?

At best he/she has seen few tutorials/explanations on youtube, and yet much of the responsibility rests on shoulders of these people.

So when your HR Joe sees something like HackerRank he goes: "Wow, that is going to make my job easier. After all it's made by it people, they surely must know what makes a good programmer." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The AI has several constants in game files defining how large portion of its budget it can spend on what. The budget is defined both by income and current status.

When the AI has resources to spare it essentially behaves like Finite State Machine, perhaps with some degree of randomness. The AI has a list of buildings/etc. and picks from it depending on budget, ethos and availability.
All the planning was essentially done before by developers, the AI merely executes the plan with given constraints. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One of the big ones is that the technological and social development is somehow inevitable and at the same time is wholly independent on environmental and material circumstances.


Not only is this provably not true, if embraced it brings series of questions which lead to very dark places.

If advance is inevitable than you need to find reason why societies develop at different rates and in different ways, in other words, you need to account why the development seems to slow down sometimes. 

In other words, my myth is the very source of Graph. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consider following: when German troops arrived in Ukraine they were hailed as heroes, only for locals to be slaughtered. IF, and I hate this kind of WHAT IF history, that didn't happen how many volunteers would Wehrmacht have from local population? Stalin and communists in general were hated by much of the USSRs population.

Next you have the death camps, ghettos, concentration camps etc. not only these tied valuable manpower, guards that could have been deployed at front, they also cost Germany many of its best scientists, engineers, doctors, craftsmen, not to mention healthy young man who could fight. 

And Jewish people were very loyal to Germany, before Nazis decided to slaughter them. 

Last but not least. The holocaust ,or rather the Nazi policies towards conquered people, were crucial rallying cry for world public. Lots of people were quite apathetic before WWII, especially in France, Britain and most of all USA. 
The only reason why many of them decided to support the war effort was the fact that Nazis were complete monsters. 
And even then there were defeatists who wanted to sue peace and pacifists that would happily let Jews, Roma, homosexuals, Slavs and countless others get slaughtered just to stay in their ivory tower. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but sadly that is a nationalism issue. Try telling Slovaks that their language and ours is the same or Czechs that our language and Slovaks is the same and you will be in for a nasty surprise.


Personally I think we were better of in union with Austria, most of us spoke German anyway, we had our national organisations like National Theater, and we even had representation in Vienna. 
Vienna had second biggest Czech population after Prague for crying out loud, to this day there are more people with my name in Austria than in Czech Republic.

Right now we are basically non-entities. Austria, CR, Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, we are so small that we can be essentially bought, our governments have no pull in EU or UN and as far as markets are concerned we are appendages of Germany. </TEXT>

Take my country for example, we have lots of Ukranians and Serbs working construction jobs, some people bitch about them taking those jobs from us, yet at the same time our trade schools have bunch of empty places and half of the Czech workers I see on construction sites are guys int their late fifties.

So its mostly supply and demand problem. There is not enough Czechs to fill the available positions, so they are given to immigrants.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For our semester work we have to deliver an XML Schema with about 60 unique elements, along with XML itself, XSLT, transformation of the XML into HTML and separate HTML documentation.

Now I know how to do this, defining elements is easy, making appropriate XML is simple and HTML documentations is primitive, but I can not fathom how to do it without my brain pouring out of my ears from boredom.

I mean, how can I even come up with so many elements anyway? 
Is there anyway to deal with this, beyond making a database of something like Solar system or ASOIAF characters?

Is there any way to make this interesting? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, the year is 1636, I am playing as Austria and I have been eagerly waiting for religious peace. The thing is something went wrong. The leagues just didn't fire at all. All my electors stayed catholic, except for Brandenburg with which I had excellent relations.
Later on Pomerania annexed Brandenburg and I gave the electorate to Pope. That was in 1562 or so.

The thing is, without peace or catholic dominance I can not convert princes to Catholicism. And so the IA is taking massive hit every month despite having 52 princes.

Is this a bug or do I have to wait for a while? </TEXT>

Can we really trust Kilgraves parents? I mean all we have to confirm their side of the story are their own words. Kilgrave admits that he made his mother burn herself but his disease, them trying to save him or nature and necessity of experiments stands just on their word.

So can we trust them? The first thing his mother does when she sees him is that she tries to kill him. I mean he IS a monster but that seems pretty cold. It almost seems like if she was trying to stop him from talking.  </TEXT>

But thing is, I can't get my Liberty Desire up, Savoy is just too strong and even if I get into near bankruptcy, the culture bonus pretty much cancels it out.
After that they start to annex me.

So the question is: Does anyone have any ideas, how to get Montferrat out of Savoyard overlordship? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Fallout 4 Story - Can we hope? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-05 16:20:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I think I'll get million down votes but here it comes.
Story of Fallout 3 sucked, it sucked big time.
I'm not saying that the world was not amazing but nonetheless the story sucked. 

Just remember: Little Lamplight with annoying brats you couldn't kill, that could miraculously procreate before puberty, room with so much radiation that neither super mutant, ghoul or robot could enter it, Threedog the Jar-Jar of the wastelaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, dozens of unkillable characters, epic battle where Liberty prime did all the work etc.

So the question is: Is there any hope that we will get better story this time? 

Does anyone know who's writing it and if that person has any experience at all? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tattered prince is a very mysterious figure. Valyrian not sharing his name, with no banner, who refused title of Prince of Pentos and instead founded a mercenary band.
What if he is the last Blackfyre?

In the books, Selmy sends envoys to negotiate with him while Dany is riding away on white mare and Drogon. Lets assume that he accepts the offer and switches sides.
This could lead to first peaceful meeting between two branches of house Targaryen in a century. 

Or not...

*The Tattered prince thrust his sword into her chest. Almost gently he pulled he towards himself and whispered in her ear. "The Blackfyres send their regards."* </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What it says in the title.
My college, Czech university of Life sciences, had decided that since students visiting it are second rate anyway there is no reason to waste more time on them then necessary.
So instead of year worth of calculus we have to do with one 12 week semester and are expected to have same results.

A the beginning I knew it was going to be tough but I saw at least some hope. One flu later and its pretty much hopeless.

The first exams are in a week so it's not looking good.
And lets be honest I am not a very good student, if I was I would be going to proper technical school and not what is basically community college.

To make it short. Is there any chance for me to learn calculus properly in time for exams? I can handle derivations, most indefinite and definite integrals but I have almost no knowledge of differential equations.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Reasons you suck speech... for the Doctor </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-24 12:52:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Doctor gives plenty of speeches in the series, describing the faults of his enemies, often in such detail that even most terrifying creature reacts to it.
But it occurred to me that no one ever gives such speech to Doctor himself, well except for Davros but he went light on him.

So after a little consideration I decided to write this speech the Doctor receives in my head-fanfic.

BTW I still love the show.


-----------------------------------------


When I first learned about you I feared you. A man that can topple empires and save worlds with his wit alone. A man that confronted greatest dangers this universe possess and lived to tell about it.
There is nothing wrong about fearing such creature.

Later I begun to admire you. A man of such integrity that he refused power when offered, a man who stood when everyone else fled or fell to insanity. Then I began to loath you...

You call yourself The Doctor, you claim to be healer of all wrongs, saver of sick and protector of weak. But it is all a lie.
You are a doctor who loves bacteria more  than patients, you are a healer afraid of scalpel, a protector so afraid to use his strength that he fails time and time again to protect those he promised to.

You hide behind your morality and always take the easy way out, rather than to stain you hands with blood you walk away from bleeding, rather than to hear patient scream you do not amputate, rather than to kill germs you let the sepsis set in.

Daleks killed immeasurable trillions, Cybermen turned entire galaxies into abominations, Weeping angels sucked life out of solar systems worth of beings. You have and had power to stop it, to make it never happen in first place but you did not. And why?

Because you are coward, you are so afraid of not not being paragon of virtue that you forgot what being a doctor actually means. 

You are not doctor you are a charlatan offering snake oil and cheap anesthetic. How many billions have died because of your fake mercy? How many planets burned so that you wouldn't have to stain your pretty clothes? Every time you think you solved a crises you are just postponing it. And so time and time again you have stop the same menace, the same disease and yet even that is a lie. Earth may be save but what about other worlds, prison camps are filled, stars extinguished and you can stop it but you don't because that would mean that you can no longer stand on pedestal above the rest of us.  

You are not a doctor, but I am. And today I'm going to stain my hands with blood of billions to save trillions, so that you could live an easy life.


*I can't let you do that.*


Oh, my dear Doctor... Do you really think I would talk to you all this time if there was even minimal chance of you stopping me?

It is already done. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are Asari the baddies? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-06 20:01:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What it says on tin. Are Asari the real villains of Mass Effect?

We know that they have the most prominent place in galactic society, they basically control culture, politics and biotic related technology in Citadel space. They had access to Protean beacon yet they violated their own rules and didn't share it with others. Instead they used it to boost their own species at expense of everyone else.

Another thing of note is how is Citadel space stagnant. Have you noticed that even carrier is considered amazing innovation, that all research related to transhumanism, both genetic and cybernetic, is curbstomped by regulation, red tape and even outright banned?

Yet this very research would be of immense benefit in war against the Reapers. Imagine if we could field millions of Shepards to battlefields across galaxy, or if we could send thousands of EDI equipped dreadnoughts to fight reaper fleets. Or if everyone was powerful biotic like Jack?

When you think about it the Asari rarely act in other species interest, in fact most of their policies are meant to enforce their hegemony. Restrictions on genetic engineering mean that everyone else ages faster then them and that no one has as good biotics as them. Restrictions on AI and cybernetics mean that they have advantage in field of diplomacy.


In fact you know who benefits more then anyone from Asari interference? Reapers...

We know Proteans helped Asari a lot, however then there was a large window when reapers could mingle with them freely.
