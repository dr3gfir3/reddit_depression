	<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Sansa's Dismay is Littlefinger's Opportunity -- An Analysis of a Key Scene </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-27 21:55:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **[TL:DR] Sansa isnt happy and LF will try to exploit it.**

[D Ds comments on Inside Episode 10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRTP9SUkHl8) (2:574:58), fit with how I originally interpreted the King in the North scene.  David Benioff notes Sansa is harboring a little bit of anger  a little bit of jealousy, and that [her relationship with John] will be crucial to watch. Later on he says that he and Weiss were consciously trying to evoke the scene where Robb was named KitN, and that because of this we have to be a little worried for Jon.

Ill go through the key parts of the scene with some general analysis at the end in light of D D's comments:

At 0:34 and 1:15, [we see LF looking subtly pleased](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmKkepz_A38) (clip of scene) with the initial disunity and Lord Cerwyn's talk of disbanding the assembled Northern (and Vale) forces.

At 1:23, Lyanna Mormont stands to speak and starts criticizing the houses that didn't support the Starks.  Sansa looks amused (1:59).  Sansa continues to display hints of smile but breaks eye contact and blinks deliberately when Lyanna starts talking about Jon being a bastard (2:08). Although Jon's in the frame at this point, he's out of focus, and we're looking right at Sansa--as if invited to think what she might be thinking. 

Jon is somewhat surprised by Lyanna's passionate declaration of fealty (2:16), there's an uncomfortable stir and silence in the room as Lyanna sits down. The shifting ceases when Lord Manderly stands up and says that Lyanna spoke true.  We see a closeup of Jon with Sansa out of focus in the background (2:40). Manderly then proceeds to admit he was wrong (2:59) and says that Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding (3:06) omitting any mention of Sansa. Sansa is visibly disappointed, and even more out of focus in the background.  As Manderly calls Jon the "White Wolf," she turns her eyes downward and seems to withdraw from the moment into contemplation (3:08-3:10). Jon is intently listening. Manderly unsheathes his sword, calls Jon the King in the North, and falls to his knees. Seeing this turn of events, LF's amusement is totally gone (3:15), his eyes widen and his mouth literally falls open (3:16).  Its noteworthy anytime we see the normally guarded LFs mouth agape. 

Glover then gets up and begins his own speech. He asks for Jon's forgiveness and Jon says there's nothing to forgivejust as he did when Sansa apologized for being awful to Jon during their childhood (query whether this has any significance?). Sansa is still furrowing her brow and not smiling; she averts her eyes again (3:35). Glover continues and eventually ends with an emphatic "The King in the North!!!" (3:55). 
The camera immediately cuts to LF, who seems to recognize that he has no control over how this situation is developing. LF turns his eyes and head turn to Sansa (3:57), who's paying attention to the scene and somewhat more in focus, but still not smiling. Jon seems surprised by the turn of events. But not unpleasantly so.  The whole hall suddenly erupts in shouts of DAKINGINDANORF!  Jon rises to his feet, his face is resolute and starting to indicate that he accepts what's happening. He's certainly not displeased. Sansa remains seated and still frowning (4:19). Jon turns to face her; he seems excited and pleasantly surprised. Sansa continues to stare straight ahead momentarily with the same expression (4:20).  Then she notices Jons gaze and turns her head to look up at him.  She gives Jon a brief smile (4:21) and turns away and averts her eyes. Her smile fades somewhat. Jon looks up at the hall, focused on the responsibility that he's just been given (4:27).  He takes several deep breaths. 

Cut back to Sansa as she surveys the hall (4:33). She has a small smile, but you can see a hint of something else there... disbelief, conflict, resentment.  It's not unalloyed pleasure. Sansa then makes eye contact with LF (4:34), who's wearing an ironic half-smile. He purses his lips slightly, seeming to say say, "see? I told you." (4:38). Sansa's smile vanishes (4:40) and her mouth falls slightly open, as if realizing something (4:42). The video I linked to fades to another scene after this point. 

Overall, LF seemed displeased and caught off guard by the turn of events that led to Jon being named King in the North. He's conspicuously unenthusiastic, and Sansa didn't seem particularly happy about it either. She went from mild amusement with Lyanna's speech to uncertainty and apparent dismay when the Manderlys and Glovers declared for Jon but failed to even mention her or her substantial contributions. When everyone starts chanting " DAKINGINDANORF!" her smile to him seemed feigned. Jon didnt think much of it, but feigning smiles is part of Sansas core skillset.  And the glances Sansa exchanged with LF were highly significantindeed, the idea that she was looking for LF in that moment rather than taking in the moment is itself telling.  I dont think Sansa was prepared for the idea that the North would overlook Jon's bastardy or the fact that she brought the KotV to support Jon's attack (the decisive factor). Theres some genuine internal strife to come between Jon and Sansa. LF won't give up after being rejected once. He will likely continue to try to manipulate Sansa and drive a wedge between her and Jon for his own ends. 

And he may well succeed.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) The Forsaken may have been foreshadowed by Dany's Vision in ACOK </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-23 22:13:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **[TL:DR]** ***The Forsaken*** **may have been foreshadowed in Daenerys' House of the Undying visions.**

Quick stub of a theory that I havent really seen discussed.  

I was recently re-reading Daenerys House of the Undying visions for unrelated reasons, and in the process, I made an association that wouldnt have been possible before reading *The Forsaken* chapter from TWOW.

Heres the specific part of Danys vision that Im talking about:

Then phantoms shivered through the murk, images in indigo. Viserys screamed as the molten gold ran down his cheeks and filled his mouth. A tall lord with copper skin and silver-gold hair stood beneath the banner of a fiery stallion, a burning city behind him. Rubies flew like drops of blood from the chest of a dying prince, and he sank to his knees in the water and with his last breath murmured a womans name.... mother of dragons, daughter of death... Glowing like sunset, a red sword was raised in the hand of a blue-eyed king who cast no shadow. A cloth dragon swayed on poles amidst a cheering crowd. From a smoking tower, a great stone beast took wing, breathing shadow fire.... mother of dragons, slayer of lies... Her silver was trotting through the grass, to a darkling stream beneath a sea of stars. ***A corpse stood at the prow of a ship, eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly.*** A blue flower grew from a chink in a wall of ice, and filled the air with sweetness.... mother of dragons, bride of fire... (ACOK, Daenerys IV)

*AND*

***A dead man in the prow of a ship***, a blue rose, a banquet of blood... what does any of it mean, Khaleesi? A mummers dragon, you said. What is a mummers dragon, pray?  Jorah (ACOK, Daenerys V)

I havent read nearly as much discussion of the "dead man on the prow" bit of Dany's vision as of the "stone dragon" or the "blue-eyed king" parts, for example. So I was wondering if there was a prevailing interpretation of what the dead man on the prow vision means? If not, could it simply have been foreshadowing of *The Foresaken* and the events soon to follow? 

For me, Aeron being strapped to the prow of the *Silence*  immediately came to mind.  In *The Forsaken*, Euron at one point actually says, bind them to the prows, referring to Aeron and the other priests he'd taken prisoner. It's clear that they're going to be sacrificed and may die even sooner. The only part that doesn't quite fit is that Aeron isn't *standing* on the prow (Euron could be), but bound to it. Notably, in discussing the vision with Dany, Jorah says "*in* the prow," rather than standing on the prow. Another commonality between the The Foresaken and the House of the Undying scenes that just occurred to me is that these are the only instances (that I can think of) where characters experienced shade-of-the-evening-induced visions from the first-person POV. (Victarion had a gulp of shade-of-the-evening in AFFC, The Reaver, but he quickly spit it out before feeling any effects.)  

The most interesting part of Dany's original vision was this: 

eyes bright in his dead face, grey lips smiling sadly. 

Smiling sadly seems to rule out Euron. Sadness-tinged happiness doesnt seem like an emotional state hes capable of experiencing. It seems more like something Aeron would feel at the end of a long struggle where he welcomed death as merciful relief and could die with a clean conscience having stayed true to his principles.  Hence, the bright eyesalthough bright eyes in his dead face could alternatively describe a state of undeath. Finally, eye*s* in the plural suggests no eye patchso most likely either Euron wouldn't have had it on, or it wasn't him. 

Grey lips could refer both to the fact that hes dead and that hes a Greyjoy. In fact, doesnt the word Greyjoy fit perfectly with the idea of smiling sadly?  

As for the broader significance, I honestly have no ideaexcept it would tend to show that whatever Euron is planning in TWOW probably matters for Daenerys end-game, since GRRM bothered to foreshadow it almost 20 years before, in ACOK, as part of one of the most scrutinized passages of the whole series. 

[EDIT:  When I originally posted this, I was thinking just about the imagery of the vision on its own, which I still think is remarkably similar to The Forsaken. But if the "bride of fire" bit also applies to and modifies everything after "slayer of lies"and it does seem that waythen there needs to be further interpretation. Thanks to the commenters below for helping to identify and refine the analysis of this key issue.

If Daenerys is to be the bride to the dead corpse *himself,* then I agree it's more likely Victarion. If, on the other hand, "bride applies to the *overall vision*, which is to be understood symbolically (in other words, if the horse, ship, and rose are symbols of Dany's suitors, and the corpse is just a feature on the prow of the ship symbolizing one of the suitors), then it's potentially Euron.  I don't see Dany marrying Aeron and wasn't suggesting that.] </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) Based on an acrobatic jump seen in the Episode 8 preview, someone else must have been stabbed on that bridge. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-07 03:00:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **[TL:DR] If Arya had actually been the one who was stabbed on the bridge in Episode 7, she almost certainly couldn't be the jumper in seen in the Episode 8 preview. But since Arya is, in fact, the likely jumper in Episode 8, either: (1) she wasn't the one stabbed; or (2) her ability to perform the acrobatic running jump will require a substantial in-show explanation (cue tinfoil).** 

I havent seen a dedicated thread on this so I thought Id post one. 

It seems like most of the theorizing about how Arya wasnt really the person stabbed on the bridge relies heavily on inferences about Aryas behavior seeming careless and out of character (e.g., walking around during daytime, letting her guard down, not carrying Needle, confidently brandishing gold, etc.). 

Without passing judgment any of these circulating theories, Id just point out that there is far more concrete evidence suggesting that something is seriously amiss about the bridge scene in Episode 7.  

In the [Episode 8 preview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59lamDqBXvk), we're shown the Waif being surprised to see someone (0:24), followed by a chase sequence where the Waif is tailing someone who then performs a very acrobatic jump (0:290:31). We dont see the jumpers face, but it's not that difficult to figure out who it is. 

Heres a [**composite image**](http://imgur.com/28noXef) of the Waifs reaction, the Waif running, the jumper mid-air.  All of this is from the Episode 8 preview. The part of the composite photo showing Arya's face is from set footage, presumably from during filming of the same scene. 

Clearly, the Waif is not the jumper based on her clothing (different color shirt that fits her form, different color pants). Yet, it seems rather obvious to me, based on the shirt color and flowing cut, that the jumper is Arya. This creates serious plot coherence problems if Arya was the one stabbed in Episode 7. 

Watch the jumper in the Episode 8 preview closely. Someone stabbed multiple times in the abdomen almost certainly wouldnt be able to do an all-out run faster than the Waif followed by that acrobatic jump, which heavily engaged the jumper's abdominal muscles. 

Im not really even basing this observation and conclusion on external knowledge. Rather, just look at what happened to Grey Wormwho was trained to be basically immune to painafter being stabbed *just once* by the Sons of the Harpy.  The stabbing happened in S5E04. In the immediate aftermath , [Grey Worm was weak and bed-ridden](http://imgur.com/sP6Ipza), barely able to move, with Missandei assuring him that hed fight again *one day*. 

Presumably months later, in S5E10, hes still limping and [needs Missandeis help to stabilize him as he walks](http://imgur.com/cUaKRu5).  Remember that when [Danys advisors decided what they were going to do in the aftermath of Daznaks Pit](http://imgur.com/DKlLx2y), Grey Worm couldnt accompany Jorah and Daario because he was too weak.  This is that expectation that *the show itself* has created concerning the recovery process for a stab wound to the torso.  So if the show is going to remain consistent with what we've already seen, it seems completely implausible for Arya to be able to pull off the run and jump after adrenaline from the original attack has worn off (shes had time to get help, clean up, and change clothes, at minimum). As many have pointed out already, besides excruciating pain and blood loss, Arya would likely be battling major inflammation and infection from the puncture of her intestines. 

It follows that there has to be more to this than a face-value interpretation of the bridge scene. Things cant be exactly as they seem. If they are, it would violate the internal consistency of the show.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers Everything) A meteor strike took out Hardhome. The map of Westeros provides surprising clues. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-29 18:03:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **[TL:DR] The description of the unexplained disaster at Hardhome six centuries before the events of ASOIAF hints at an impact by an asteroid or comet; and the [map of Westeros provides some subtle additional clues](http://imgur.com/JlffByv) that support this hypothesis when viewed in light of Earths own history of interplanetary bombardment.**

Re-reading the passage below recently in a thread, I was reminded of a hypothesis that came to mind when I first read ADWD:

Hardhome had been halfway toward becoming a town, the only true town north of the Wall, until the night six hundred years ago when hell had swallowed it. Its people had been carried off into slavery or slaughtered for meat, depending on which version of the tale you believed, **their homes and halls consumed in a conflagration that burned so hot that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north.**

Afterward **ashes rained down on haunted forest and Shivering Sea alike for almost half a year.** Traders reported finding only nightmarish devastation where Hardhome had stood, **a landscape of charred trees and burned bones, waters choked with swollen corpses,** blood-chilling shrieks echoing from the cave mouths that pocked the great cliff that loomed above the settlement. ADWD, Jon VIII (Emphasis added.)

This imagery suggested either a volcanic eruption (I think the Doom of Valyria was an eruption of the Fourteen Flames, a [supervolcano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervolcano)) or an interplanetary impact (e.g., by an asteroid or comet).  A couple of the details, which Ive bolded above, point more toward an impact though.

*First*, when I read that watchers on the Wall far to the south had thought the sun was rising in the north, I thought of [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBvotWfR3j4) (see, e.g., 0:48, 1:20-1:25). Brightness sufficient to light the night sky like the sun fits an impact better than an eruption, since an eruption would look like a red glow, not a sunrise. 

*Second*, "a landscape of charred trees and burned bones" immediately reminded me of [pictures](http://apod.nasa.gov/apod/image/0711/tunguska_kulik.jpg) Id seen of the [Tunguska impact in 1908](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tunguska_event), which coincidentally, also took place in a far northern region dominated by Taiga (coniferous snow forest).  Apart from the [K-T impact]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cretaceous%E2%80%93Paleogene_extinction_event) that famously ended the reign of the dinosaursand possibly the [Meteor Crater]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteor_Crater) in ArizonaTunguska is probably the most famous impact in the popular imagination.  Based on GRRM's description, its also roughly the size of impact, in terms of destructive power, that probably took out Hardhome.  Tunguska was shrouded in mystery for much of the 20th Century, and it's is the sort of thing GRRM might have in mind while trying to write about the effects of an impact while giving his readers a subtle clue.

*Third*, the final clue might be in the map of Westeros itself.  For the reason Ive already mentioned, after thinking about Tunguska, my attention immediately turned back to the K-T impact.  I realized that the bay near Hardhome could easily be an impact crater.  It was then that I first noticed curious similarities in the coastline around Hardhome compared to the Gulf of Mexico and Yucatn peninsulawhich is where the dinosaur-killing asteroid probably impacted. Ive overlaid maps of North America and Westeros with transparency. I have no idea of how the scales of the respective maps compare. I just tried to align them as best I could based on the common geographic features I noted. 

**Here is [the result](http://imgur.com/JlffByv).** 

As you can see in the map above, Hardhome, as well as the site of the possible Hardhome crater, is located on the northwest side of a peninsula protruding into a large gulf or sea at its southern endjust like the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#/media/File:Yucatan_chix_crater.jpg).  I also noted some interesting similarity between the shape of Skagos and Cuba. The Hardhome crater is probably too large as shown on the map to be a Tunguska-sized event. Assuming that Hardhome *really is* the site of an interplanetary impact, this leaves two main possibilities:

1.	Hardhome was a *much* larger impact. Possibly an impact capable of inducing a  nuclear winter from all the debris launched into the atmosphere. It seems unlikely that such a large impact could have taken place in the last 600 years, as claimed in the legend.  But could it have been one of the causesor perhaps *the* causeof the Long Night or subsequent long winters?

2.	Hardhome was a Tunguska-sized impact, but GRRM overestimated the size of the crater that would be produced by such an impact, or deliberately exaggerated its size to give us a clue that we might not otherwise notice.  Unlike maps based on real landscapes, the map of Westeros wasnt determined by geological and other physical forces, but by GRRMs imagination.  So we shouldnt try to deduce causes of certain geographic features using mathematical calculations and physics equations (e.g., figuring out what size asteroid it would take to make a crater of a given size)but we can make inductive inferences based on a more generalized application the underlying concepts. When creating a fictional landscape, we often consciously or subconsciously turn to what's familiar to us for inspiration.

With that said, it's also possible that the bay around Hardhome might not be a crater.  This wouldn't rule out the impact hypothesis though, because an impact can cause tremendous damage even without reaching the ground.  Tunguska *itself* didnt leave a crater.  It was most likely caused by an [airburst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjJuMFQyNyw) of a comet, rather than an asteroid, and generated an explosion in the neighborhood of 15 megatons of TNT (i.e., about the size of the Castle Bravo, a large hydrogen bomb test about 1000 times stronger than the bomb dropped on Hiroshima).  This would certainly [light the sky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4LqqA4GdsY) hundreds of miles away [as if the sun had risen in the North]( http://blog.nuclearsecrecy.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/434-RF-12ITEM1.jpg). Additional Castle Bravo footage [here] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l18dKSlzOlM) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvDvN5oYoZw) (see 0:41-2:24, 3:24-3:35).

None of this is 100% conclusive. But I was intrigued and thought Id share anyway. Asteroids (such as the one from which Dawn was forged) and comets are explicitly mentioned several times in the books.  These could all be subtle clues by GRRM. Hopefully the tin (or should I say iridium) hasnt completely addled my brain. 

[*A preemptive note for the nitpicky*I realize that when an asteroid or comet reaches the ground, it's called a meteor*ite*, not a meteor; but here we don't know if anything actually reached the ground.] </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **[TL:DR] Show HS is a cunning player of the Game who is in an excellent position to engineer the Lannisters' downfall unless Cersei is given an unearned reprieve from her folly.**

This discussion assumes that Cersei **will not** be successful in just locking everybody assembled for her trial up in the Sept of Baelor and burning the whole place down with wildfirea scenario which requires Cersei's opponents to make huge blunders, and lets Cersei off the hook far too easily for her own.  

The Episode descriptions of Episodes 6 and 7 have "Jaime fac[ing] off against the High Sparrow" and "the High Sparrow eye[ing] another target." These descriptions, when read together and taken to their logical conclusion, are big clues about the HS' ultimate plan:

1. Clearly, Jaime doesn't kill or topple the HS in Episode 6, because he wouldn't be in a position to eye *any* target in Episode 7 (being able to target anyone implies some retention of power by the HS). 

2. My guess is that the HS will reveal the Lancel affair, causing Jaimie to leave KL for the Riverlands.  That will leave Cersei and Tommen more exposed to the HS' ultimate plans (see below). 

3. The previews suggest that Tyrells will make their move in Episode 6thereby potentially sparking civil unrest from the HS' many friends and supporters, as Kevan Lannister had predicted. Per Jonathan Pryce's spoiler last week, Cersei possibly will not show up for her trial by combat. The HS might play up the bad optics of her no-show and potential trechery (as well as the interference with Margaerys atonement) to go for checkmate on the false Baratheon dynasty. 

4. Logically, the HS next target will be Tommen Baratheon. Or more specifically, his illegitimate throne. I doubt the HS has anything against Tommen personally.  He's basically a decent kid.  Yet, he's Cersei's enablerand the basis for Lannister power in Kings Landing. The HS surely knows by now that Tommen is an incestuous bastard.  Cersei didnt admit to her incest with Jaime prior to her walk of shame.  But the HS has not simply let that accusation slide. Rather, its one of the very crimes for which Cersei still faces trial (along with high treason and Roberts murder). And, by proving her guilty of incest, the HS lays the foundation to then directly attack Tommen's legitimacy.  

5. Although Tommen may not be a bad person in the HS eyes, the HS still thinks everyone's a sinner. He won't have any compunctions against attacking Tommen Baratheon's legitimacy to undermine Lannister (and Tyrell) rule. The HS most likely wouldnt punish Tommen *Waters* simply for being an incestuous bastard. But exposing Tommens illegitimate birth and using it to strip away Tommens kingship is another matter. What's more, he'd likely see it as doing Tommen a spiritual favor, given his views concerning the corrupting effects of wealth and the benefits of laying the truth bare for all to see (think of the HS extended conversation with Margaery about abandoning his profession as a fine cobbler to become a wandering monk).

6. The HS has shown himself to be extremely intelligent and an adept player of the game. He almost certainly manipulated Tommen into telling Cersei about Margaerys walk of shame.  He anticipated that Cersei would try to use this information to get the Tyrells to intervene to save Margaery.  So it stands to reason that the Tyrell intervention is likely part of the HS overall scheme.  As an added bonus, when the intervention goes badly or has unintended consequences (i.e., in accordance with the HS plan), Tommen may blame Cersei for betraying his confidence.  I think the HS may even have a replacement for Tommen in waiting.

Remember the HS verbal sparring match with the Queen of Thorns?

"Have you ever sown a field, Lady Olenna? Have you ever reaped the grain? Has anyone in House Tyrell? A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye. **You are the few, we are the many. And when the many stop fearing the few...."**

Similarly, when he confronted Jaime next to Myrcella's body, he said:
"We have no names, no family. Every one of us is poor and powerless. And yet together, **we can overthrow an empire."**

What "empire" do you suppose the HS is talking about here? 

Most immediately, the ruling "Baratheon" (Lannister) dynasty. And possibly even the whole system of hereditary nobility and landed privilege in the 7K. 

**Here's how I think the coming confrontation between HS and Cersei may go:**

1. Cersei doesn't show up for trialpossibly she sends unGregor instead.

2. The much-hyped Cleganebowl happens or it doesn't. In either case, Robert Strong is revealed as an undead monstrocity and Cersei, by extension, is shown to be cheating her trial by combat. Possibly, a plot to incinerate the Sept of Baelor with everyone inside is exposed. 

3. The HS holds a public trial for Cersei *in absentia*. This trial would be a wonderful cathartic juxtaposition to the play that Arya (and the audience) witnessed in Episode 5, which represents history as written by the Lannister victors.  Recall that Cersei is accused of incest and high treason (including in the death of King Robert). Theres no shortage of evidence of her guilt. The HS could bring witnesses who saw Cersei publicly destroy the letter from Robert on his deathbead appointing Ned Stark Regent and Lord Protector of the Realm.  Remember that Ser Barristan attested that the letter was written in Robert's own hand and bore his unbroken seal (maybe the HS even has the letter?) The HS could then offer evidence of Tommen's illegitimacyincluding possibly the genealogy studies that led Ned to conclude that Joffrey was a bastard.  Maybe he's obtained one of the hundreds of letters the famously-earnest Stannis sent to lords throughout the 7K? Possibly he produces witnesses or a paper trail of Cersei/Joffrey's order to kill Robert's bastards? To cap it off, for maximum dramatic effect, maybe he then produces Gendrythe lone survivor of that massacre. At the end of the trial, Cersei is found guilty based on this mountain of evidence, and is condemned to death. The HS further condemns Cersei of sacrilege for profaning Baelor's Sept with Ned's innocent blood to cover her own capital crimes against the Realm.

4. The smallfolk back the HS. The Lannisters aren't popular to begin with and exposure of their *coup dtat* won't go over well, to say the least. Recall the scene at the beginning of this season, where Cersei has unGregor bash in the head of that guy who was spreading rumors about her in the city. (Also recall the positive reception to the play in AFFC where the lions get devoured at the end by the dragon.) Foremost, think of Cersei's walk of shame and the hatred she inspired among the smallfolk. The HS has been playing a long game to discredit her, and this public trial would basically complete the job. The only thing left to do then would be to capture Cersei to impose the sentence.

5. To facilitate Cersei's capture, maybe the HS approaches the Tyrells and offers to annul Margaery's marriage to the bastard Tommen and pardon her brother? Since the Tyrells would have Margaery back (but not Loras) and Tommen's rule would be in jeopardy, the Tyrells would have strong incentives to switch sides before Cersei and Tommen's fall.  I could see losing Margaery being the thing that pushes Tommen over the edge to kill himself and/or murder Cersei in [fullfillment of the prophesy]( https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/4k1rgb/spoilers_extended_theory_throwback_thursday/d3cfa57).

6. Riots errupt and quickly escalate into an all out civil war.  Maybe the HS intends to abolish the monarchy altogether and supplant it with theocracy. Possibly he's covertly allied with Danyherself a champion of the common peoplein the background (I see this as less likely since Dany will probably end up adopting the official religion of the R'hllor)? Or perhaps the HS produces Gendry, if he didn't already do so during Cersei's trial.  The HS could invoke the authority of the Faith to legitimize himor possibly he could convince Tommen to do it and then abdicate; there are all sorts of intriguing possibilities. The key is that a legitimization sanctioned by the Faith would likely carry weight, especially if the HS can deliver peace and an end to the popular revolt.  Gendry would be sold as someone who came from and would rule in the best interests of the smallfolk, but who is still of Robert Baratheon's blood.  This might be acceptable to the lords as a compromise less radical than a complete abolition of the monarchy and nobilitywhich the HS may be in a position to credibly threaten. The HS' revolution and "overthrow [of the] empire" would be basically complete. 

7. Having lost everything she holds dear, Cersei then incinerates (or attempts to incinerate) King's Landing with wildfire. But in the process, she's strangled by Tommen (whether living or undead) or by Jaime, and realizes she's fulfilled the prophesy.   </TEXT>

"You have Castle Black. My watch has ended."  Jon Snow 

=========================

Jon's mic drop was perhaps my favorite part of "Oathbreaker." What struck me was the definitiveness and resolve in Jon's declaration, which I think is justified. 

It's fairly clear to me that Jons death discharges his obligations to the Night's Watch. There's a colorable argument that it doesn't, of course.  But I think it relies on a strained "gotcha" interpretation of the words of Jon's vow.

First, a few comments regarding the analysis to follow. 

To me, the words of the Black are the most important factor in determining the duration and scope of the obligations Jon assumed. 

The Black is a solemn and time-honored oath that has been handed down for generations.  It receives considerable focus in the books.  Indeed, when it's sworn, it's prefaced with the statement, "**[h]ear my words**, and bear witness to my vow." (AGOT, Jon VI.) (Emphasis added.)  So I presumereasonably, I thinkthat the actual language of the Black matters.  

To interpret the Black, above all, I look at the objective and ordinary meaning of the words, and consider them in the context of the full vow rather than in isolation.  I also look at what people said about the vow in the books.  And if theres a latent ambiguity, I consider what the person saying the words understood them to mean at the time the vow was given, especially if their internal monologue is captured in the books. 

**Here are the operative provisions of the Black:**

**1. Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death.**

(This is the key language defining the term of the commitment, including its specific beginning and end points. Note that it says until my death not until I am dead, while I live, it shall never end, or something like and now my eternal watch begins.)

**2. I shall live and die at my post.**

(This specifies that the commitment is continuous. Your watch is not a work shift. There are no vacations. Rather, you live where youre stationed and the Watch becomes your permanent new home.  Youre a full-time nightwatchman until you die.)

**3. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come.**

(Thistogether with the renunciation of all other lands, titles, and other rights that define a persons identity in Westerosdefines the scope of the commitment. The nightwatchman has no higher loyalties than to the Watch, and promises to lay down his life in the performance of his duties if necessary.  The subordinate clause of provision no. 3 (after the comma) reinforces that this obligation continues for the full term of the persons watch.  Notably, this clause expressly incorporates provision no. 1 into its meaning by referring to **this** night and all **the** nights to come. The referent of the this is the specific night on which the person swearing the vows watch begins. Likewise, note that the clause says all **the** nights to come not all nights to come.  Use of the definite article the strongly implies an earlier referent.   Disegarding the context of this subordinate clause is one of the key interpretative mistakes Ive seen made by people who think Jons watch lasts forever.)

Heres an annotated version of the above provisions that substitutes in the referents of the words it, this, and the":

1.	Night gathers, and now my watch begins. [*My watch*] shall not end until my death.

2.	I shall live and die at my post.

3.	I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night [*on which my night begins*] and all the nights to come [*until my death*].

**Further observations and analysis:**

	Recall that, as LC Mormont explained, the Black is said [a]t evenfall, as the sun sets and [while] fac[ing] the gathering night and that [f]rom that moment, [the person taking the oath] will be a Sworn Brother of the Night's Watch. (AGOT, Jon VI.) Thus, Night gathers, and now my watch begins indicates a specific and definite commencement of the obligations under the vow. (AGOT, Jon VI.)

	The phrase and now his watch is ended, which is typically said ceremonially at the funeral of a nightwatchman, parallels the phrase and now my watch begins.  This further suggests a definite end date upon death.

	The Black is a promise to be on watch until ones death. By the objective meaning of the word "death"i.e., what a typical person in Westeros taking the Black would understand death to meanJon has factually fulfilled the condition of his oath. The Black asks the swearer of the oath to lay down his life for the Watch. Jon did that.  Keep in mind that one life is all the vast majority people ever get. Death is their end, so this issue never arises. Here though, it appears that death wont be end of Jon. But it's not like Jon just took a little nap and then woke up refreshed. Moreover, he didnt engineer his death or permit it to happen in order to avoid his obligations.  He was murdered by his own sworn brothers and subordinates. 

	Jon was (presumably will be in the books) brought back from death by extraordinary magical means. Resurrection was almost certainly not in Jons or anyone else's contemplation at the time the vow was originally sworn. So to the extent Jon played no intentional part in causing the fulfillment of the condition that terminated his oath, and his resurrection was itself not a deliberate pretext to avoid that oath, his oath shouldn't be given a meaning to cover that situation unless it is already unambiguously encompassed by the original words of the vowwhich it isn't here.

All of these circumstances matter, because when taken together, they tend to show that were not dealing with a technicality or loophole, but instead a straightforward application of the letter and spirit of the vow to an extraordinary situation.  If anything, stretching the Black to cover a person's unexpected life after death would be the real technicality or catch-22. Jon already paid the ultimate price for the Watch. Although he is free to re-affirm his vows in this new life, his original vow demands no more of him.
