	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This was way back when I was younger, probably around 10-12 at the time. 

I was attending a camp for the blind (oddly enough I had the most vision out of 90% of people there..go figure)

One night me and my cabin mates had been left alone as our cabin leaders had to go to a meeting. The one leader Dave (I'm pretty sure thats his name) told us not to leave and left a cup with water in it by the door so it spilled if open. Well my one mate had to use the facilities, so naturaly he waited until they were back. 

Then when he could no longer wait he left and knocked over the water. Dave was not happy about this. He got mad at all of us. Very unhappy guy. 

So the next day me and my mate are out walking around when we get called into our cabi for a meeting. I can't remember what happened but I rememer a cup smashing on the ground, nearly missing us. 

Needless to say he was fired the next uear and never returned. It was great.  </TEXT>

I tried getting diagnosed a few months back, last summer or maybe a year ago..can't remember, yet my doctor saw that I smiled as I told him I may have depression, and he brushed me off because "depressed people don't smile." So I am just really nervous and anxious about going to him again, what if he doesn't diagnose me, or what if I can't explain correctly?

Help me..

I will update in the comments after my appointment how it went. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I am in an open relationship with a guy from America. We have dated on and off for a few years and I've always ended up leaving him because of being ignored and feeling second place to his boyfriend he lives with. So here's whats going on, we talk on facebook and sometimes on skype. But the problem is he often goes a day or half a day without talking to me, and he always has a reason (excuse) why.

So with him ignoring me I'm not sure if I can carry on. I mean I don't care that he is dating someone else, just wih he could talk to me. I feel like I am second place to his other boyfriend. 

What do I do about this? Could use some advice on how to go about this, if I should continue it, or just end it right here. 

 TL;DR: Ignored and feeling second place to my boyfriend </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wondering why everyone here started vaping. 

Now I wasn't a hard smoker like most people who start vaping, I'd go through 3 smokes daily for about a week, then quit for a month, then startup again. So with that in mind, I was selling a windows 8 tablet on a local classified site, and ended up finding someone who was swilling to trade it for a vape kit, so I figured why not? 

After getting home and trying to put juice in the closed tank (yes, I was very much new to this) I looked online, and figured out I had to open it up and pour the liquid inside the tank. So after that the rest is history. 

Looking to move down from my 18mg and 12mg juices to 3mg and 6mg, thankfully mixing a few together has helped cut it back quite a bit.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've decided that after all these years of me being depressed, I need some help.
I have been depressed for a few years now, 5 I think, its affecting my memory and my energy, i just stay in bed and don't leave for a day sometimes. I was happy dating my boyfriend, but being in a LDR has made it harder for me, and both him. And with him going in to a hospital for his mental health and other personal issues I just feel like I am going to lose him.

I have made it 2 months and 4 weeks self harm free as of today. I will be 3 months on Monday, yet I just can't shake the thought that I should just throw it all away. I find when I do it, I am able to think for a few minutes and have a clear head, so maybe it's the right thing to do?

Take yesterday as an example, I went in and asked about mixing liquids and they explained it, and gave me a new coil for free and filled up my tank. 
Last week they gave me an exchange on my old coils (were opened, and only had 3 of them) 

Their shop is clean and the staff are friendly, and it doesn't get busy there, at most a minute wait for someone to help me. Also nice that they have a juice bar for testing. I Would recommend it to anyone in the Winnipeg or Brandon area just to pop in and check it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not sure if this is the right place, but it's a start. I have depression, and with my sister and her kids living here, it's gotten worse. She moved in 2 months ago, and was only supposed to live here for a week, then go back to live in her apartment out of the city, but she delightfully told us that she is staying. And the following saturday went out and packed up her stuff with my dad and moved in. She hasn't left since and it is just terrible, for all of us. 

She constantly yells and threatens her one kid, while leving us to watch him, then she just goes out with her other kid and does whatever she wants. 

Her being here hasn't helped my depression, and she has made all of us cry and she's not happy until everyone around her is miserable. 

Take tonight as an example, I was helping her with a dresser from Ikea, then she yelled at her one kid and took away his tablet so he was crying so I didn't want to be in the same room as her screaming and threatening him. I walked away, to which she followed me to my room and threatened me saying "mom and dad will yell at you when they come home" (they wont) 

She went as far as calling my mother at work and picking a fight with her, in the end she hung up angrily and came to my room and told me this "You better help me build this dresser or I am going to tell mom that your oils and pipes, then im going to smash them." She was talking about my vape, and juices, and I really hope she doesn't touch them, as I do not have the money right now to afford to replace them. 

So I am writing this in hopes someone can help me with what to do, her being here is making me depressed and scared..help me please Reddit..

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just post below why you got into vping, im curious as to why everyone is here. 

A bit of a back story, I use to smoke 3 cigarettes on my way to church and at youth i would leave to go smoke one or two every time i was there. And after getting violently ill from nicotine, i quit, and just by chance got introduced to vaping by a local guy who made his own e juice and he gave me a kit whim after doing an online deal through local BST site. I ended up trading a tablet for a vape kit, and it worked well, got me off cigarettes that night and havent looked back. Was the simple pen styl, i think a 320mah vape with variable voltage, which i ended up breaking on accident and have since been stuck with the vision spinners and vapros stylish pen vapes. Looking forward to upgrading to a evic mini sometime in february hopefully **fingers crossed** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all, i'm back here with the same issues as before. My one tank is an aspire k1 and it keeps gurgling, spitting juice at me and is just terrible to use. 

I have it on a vision vapros stylish pen style vape. The coil is 1.6ohm running at 3.8v (the device doesn't have vw)

I have even gone as for as running the coil outside of the tank and waiting for it to dry out, then putting it back in the tank, but alas that didn't solve my issues. 

Anything you guys suggest I will try, thanks CECR. </TEXT>

The coils were traded for an open package with one missing, so maybe they were faulty and someone returned them?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i have been using the vision vapros pen style vape, and just have some questions about it. 

So, it goes from 3.3v up to 4.8v, should I run it at full volts or is that usually a bad idea? (its not temp control)

How long do they last in terms of battery life before they are dead completely? Months or no?

Is it bad for the device to charge it when it isnt dead, e.g. at 40%?

Are there any things I should know in terms of using it safely, so I don't break it or anything. </TEXT>

Darkness covers the room. In the corner a flickering candle stands. 

The clock slowly ticking away, as his heartbeat slows.

In the distance a siren, probably another break in.

A bottle hits the floor and breaks, time stops. 

Eyes closed, skin pale

The news says he was so young, how could he.

Friends are mourning,

The streetlights go out, and out slips a whisper

Behind closed doors.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just feel like I am walking my life in a tunnel, and sure everyone says "Oh, there's always a light at the end of the tunnel." Of course, there is. It just keeps moving further and further away.

See, I went on a youth retreat this past weekend, I thought it would be good for me, and that I could focus on the joys of the weekend and spend some time with my fellow youth and just have a good time. Well, I was wrong. Around 11 a.m of the second day of being there, my depression came back, and I just felt so horrible. I decided to eat lunch and felt a bit better. 

Then later on in the evening we had youth group time, and I just went numb. Just emotionally numb, it started when K told the youth she had a new bf and was having trust issues. I guess that just set me off. She and I dated on and off for two years, maybe three...can't remember now. I just know last time I was at the youth retreat me and her got back together, so that was on my mind the whole week, and I couldn't handle it. 

 From that day up until Monday evening when I got home I just felt horribly numb and just couldn't bring myself out of it. 

On the 8-hour bus ride home, I fell asleep, but was woken by my thoughts, and found myself just depressed, so I spent the last 2 hours in silence staring out the window wishing I were dead. 

And about an hour ago I tried to kill myself, but decided it wasn't worth it, but now I'm scared I may try again.  </TEXT>

Am I eligible to take it back for a exchange or not since it is broken so much? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everyone, so I am debating about buying the hp stream 7. Its a $120 tablet here in Caanda.
I would like it for its price, portability, and also I will be using it for playing older games (san andreas, half life 2, and if possible LoL)
What games, if any can it play besides older ones? 
I havent used windows in probably just over a year now, as I have been a linux user, how hard is windows 8 to get into? 
Is the hp stream 7 a good buy for the price?

Edit: Bought the hp stream 7, it's a good tablet for its price.

Edit 2: Sold it, the stream 7 is a piece of junk.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [TOMT] [Android Game] Point and click adventure where you are alone in a town </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-06 01:16:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It was an android game that came out in 2012 I think. You started out in a town and had to figure out different puzzles to advance to the next place. I believe it was 2D and a top down type game.  In the end you ended up in a church and talked to the priest who told you everyone was raptured. I believe you could go into houses and if you found items you could explore them a bit and find out about the people that lived there. Kind of like flashback sequences. 
I remember the first level had to do with trying to make it across a bridge, and you coudl retrieve parts from a broken down car, and a house nearby.
No it wasnt silent hill, or any popular game like that. It was made by one person I think, and he was very christian so at the end of the game you could email him and discuss anything you wanted. Also he had a website setup with forums to help if you got stuck.  </TEXT>
