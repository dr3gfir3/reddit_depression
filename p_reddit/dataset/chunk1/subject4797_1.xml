	<DATE> 2012-12-06 04:11:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Probably around 1995 but i'm not sure. All i can remember is it was an animated film, hand drawn i believe and the scene that i remember took place in the rain with a boar. Wild boar i assume may have been chasing somebody/something, there may have been a river boat and bears involved as well. I'm not sure if the animals were anthropomorphic but assuming it's a 90's Disney-esque children's film it's not out of the question.

I also know for a fact it is not Disney's Robin Hood film </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just watched the two part mini-series. Overall I really enjoyed it from both an audience standpoint and filmmaker stand point. The story and characters were cool and interesting and Eddie Izzard plays a great pirate.

I also enjoyed the look of the show, with the odd visual effects/camera movements/focusing etc. It very a great breath of fresh air from other programing. But, I very much like the premium television shows/tv mini-series.

I would suggest to anybody with a weekend to spare to watch The Kennedy's or for longer invest of time, Deadwood, The Borgias, Hatfields/McCoys.

Back to Treasure Island, I would suggest it to everybody its a total of 3 3 hours, split into two 1 1/2 hours episodes, with a bunch of great actors/acting and a high quality production that looks really good.

	<TEXT> Well, if you could name any 3 warriors from A Game of Thrones to A Dance With Dragons whom would you choose?

This exludes anybody talked about or seen in only flashbacks to events prior to Game of Thrones, such as Rhaegar Targaryan, Arthur Dayne, etc, etc.

Let's try to keep this as spoiler free as possible for those who haven't read the books. So let's try not to say blatant spoilers such as "I choose X because he killed Y and therefore he's better."  Get creative with your reasoning!


At the end let's tally up who are the most popular and create a Kingsguard for the subreddit, or just see who the three most popular warriors you guys chose for your Kingsguard! :D

I'll go with:

**Sandor Clegane**

**Tywin Lannister**

**Oberyn Martell** </TEXT>

I would suggest it to anybody who likes psychological thrillers as it gets very tense and does a damn good job at it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I say "friends" because I understand that the system isn't really for creating two way communication between two people but rather as a notification or flagging system when a friend posts. But still, i'd think it would be interesting to know who if not how many people "friend" you on Reddit.

I imagine the reasoning for some people adding others as friends after good interactions with them or after the person posts something interesting and they continually provide good content to the community.

	<DATE> 2012-02-19 17:56:57 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, Reddit.
To give you some background information I'm going to be part of a summer program at my university where they send us out to Los Angeles for internships. Anyway, because of what the program entails I would really want to drive across country for a couple reasons.
1)The experience of driving across country
2)So I can have a car out there and I don't have to relie on borrowing somebody else's car in the program.

(I'd be leaving from either Philadelphia or New York)

My concerns are that my university is on the quarter system and there is 1 week between the end of spring term and the start of summer term.  

My concern is whether or not I will have enough time to drive out there in a week. I would not turn this into a vacation stopping everywhere as much as I may like to. Logically, I would want to drive out there with more than just myself so that we could spend more time on the road by switching drivers. If I couldn't get anybody from the program to drive with me I would try to convince my father to drive out with me and i'd fly him back just so I could have a passenger to share the drive with.

I hope I've made my concerns clear for you to read, if not just ask.
P.S. - Some of the professors have said the university may be able to get a deal with a car rental place in L.A but considering 99% of us are under 21 the rates for a rental car driver being under 21 would still be a lot. I am 20yo.

If you have any other suggestions please do tell :)

**TL;DR Is driving to L.A. feasible within a week?
What would be the best route to get there?
Would flying out and renting a car be better?** </TEXT>

Anybody hear anything else/different? </TEXT>

upgrade? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-15 23:03:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey r/Photography, I'm looking to upgrade my DSLR. I have a Nikon D5000 with some additional equipment but I'm looking to leave Nikon to go to Canon. For one I got this Nikon back in high school before I was aware of what I wanted to do in college (which is being a Film major). Since then I haven't really stayed up with any new DSLR news and things of that nature aside from the Canon 60D/7D/T3i. I currently have a Panasonic HVX200 which is a digital video camera I purchased recently and quite enjoy it. The reason I'm looking into the Canons 
-is primarily as an all aronud upgrade from my Nikon
-i can tell you i'm leaning toward the 60D, as the 7D as alot of nice features but really features i don't need such as the FPS. I won't be shooting any baseball games or anything like that so the FPS on the 60D would be suffient.
-Lastly I would use the Canon as another HD Video camera as the DSLR for video is a trend that is picking up and some clients do like that style and it does fit certain applications.

-So I'm hoping for some input to just "reassure" me that the 60D is what I'm looking for, which after speaking with my local camera shops back home in NY (in school in Philadelphia) I'm feeling strongly towards that. Or is the 7D worth the extra however much exact money it is for the additional features/upgrades that the 7D has compared to the 60D

Much appreaticed if you take your time to respond.
