	<TEXT> I can't listen to anything with lyrics while I write, so it's instrumental music for me. Mogwai and Arbouretum are personal favorites, along with symphonic film soundtracks.

I have a [feature on my website](http://www.subject8496.com/blog/archive/book_notes_2012/) where authors create and discuss a playlist for their book. Many choose to talk about the music they listened to either while actually writing their book or during the time they wrote it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I moved to Brooklyn, I decided to downsize my book collection (which occupied over 100 banker's boxes on our previous move).

I decided to keep only books that were truly special to me, books I planned to read, and a majority of cookbooks. Then, I invited friends over to take what they wanted and gave the rest to an assortment of thrift shops and libraries. </TEXT>

Here in Brooklyn, I accumulate books pretty quickly (I have a book   music blog and receive a lot of review copies). About once a month I contact a local thrift store to come by and pick up a couple of boxes of books. </TEXT>

Both those stores are active in social media (Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr) and engage there directly with their communities.

One other thing my favorite indies do is host exciting events, these often bring new customers into the store. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I moved to Brooklyn just over two years ago and plan to live here a long time.

We're in Green-Wood Heights/Windsor Terrace/South Slope (depending on who you talk to), and love it. Neither of us are hipsters, my wife is a physical therapist and I am a writer   blogger (okay, maybe I'm a hipster by profession). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I moved from Birmingham, Alabama to Brooklyn two years ago.

We sold our car six months after moving here, we found we usually used it only to change sides of the street when street sweeping was scheduled.

We love the city, and have adapted very well to the faster-paced lifestyle. The entertainment options are almost infinite, the food is great, and the people have been incredibly welcoming at both work and in our neighborhood (South Slope).

Taxes are much higher than Alabama, as is the cost of living in general. </TEXT>

I'd start with All hail West Texas, work your way chronologically through his releases from there, then work backwards once you have made it to the new Extra Lens album (his collaboration with Franki]lin Bruno).

Here is a collection of rarities that might whet your appetite a bit further:

We'd just come to the end of a period of silence and ill will--a year I'd spent in love with and in the same apartment as an odd, fagile girl whom he had loathed, on sight, with a frankness and a fury that were not at all like him. But Claire had moved out the month before. Neither my father nor I knew what to do with our new freedom." Michael Chabon in The Mysteries of Pittsburgh </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to feel the same way about CDs, vinyl, and DVDs, but digitized everything and am increasingly streaming content online (through Rdio.com, Netflis, Hulu) instead of even accessing my music   movies stored locally.

Having just bought an e-reader myself, I find it a great way to read books (especially comics), and see myself going as digital as possible in the coming year. I thought I would never give up my books, but have been giving everything I have already read away to lighten my load   prepare for a move at the end of the year. Something about sharing the books with people who want to read them (instead of hoarding yhem) just feels right. </TEXT>
