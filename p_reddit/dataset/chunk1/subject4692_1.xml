	<TEXT> You are very lucky! I'm new to Pokemon... so this may be a silly question. I am playing heart gold and I saved right in front of the machine with the 3 starter pokeballs. I then click the button so I am able to scroll through the 3 starters to check for shinys. If they aren't, I SR and try again. Am I doing it right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree. Female gendered insults (e.g., bitch, douchebag) simply equate feminity with badness. Same thing with male-gendered insults like "dicks". People should just use neutral swears... like asshole, or jerk, I think. The other terms are too heavy ("Mother fucker" presents an interesting case, though, it kind of insults both genders...) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No... truthfully I didn't realize that. I just assumed that all creatures have some ability to sense and detect unpleasant stimuli. I just spent some time Googling it, and it seems like the jury is still out on whether or not this is the case. I am trying to access the paper "Defining and assessing animal pain" by Lynne U. Sneddon, Robert W. Elwood, Shelley A. Adamo and Matthew C. Leach, but it is new (Nov. 2014) and isn't yet available via my school database. Thanks for getting me to look into this. I would still rather err on the side of caution and not go out of my way to creatively kill insects, though :/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is objectively more cruel than squashing it (which would kill it immediately). I have to agree with the girl; no one should ever take delight in the death of another creature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know... I think that it has a great deal of significance to the movement. Every social media post/comment about those stories is: "Those damn meddling feminazis are making a fuss again!". The stories are about women and women's issues... ergo.... feminist. I personally hate how feminism has become such a bad thing with the worst connotations when it is so inherently good. The concept of feminism, the theory, all the history and evolution of the movement... all the different facets... is so misunderstood and lost on the average Jill and Joe. And that isn't entirely their fault. Without going to college or university, where do people learn about feminism (this is an actual question)? Should feminists do a better job of explaining feminism to the masses? Like Emma Watson did? Feminism shouldn't be so threatening to people... but it is. People have this knee-jerk reaction to it. Despite this connotation, I will never stop calling myself a feminist. I don't know where to go from here. Honestly. :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For what it's worth, I was one of these overly attached children and turned out okay. But, the behaviour stems from insecurity. You should Google "attachment styles" - the child is exhibiting classic insecure attachment patterns and you should figure out where it is coming from. The best thing you and your girlfriend can do is provide a stable, nurturing environment for the child with a lot of routine. It is equally important for the parents to be regarded by the child as secure and stable themselves. This means no drama, excessive drinking/ drug use/ partying/ etc. Parents need to be parents. The child needs to learn that when they go to the sitter, it is only for a little while, and mom will be there at the end of the day. Be specific, firm - but loving - and make it a routine. The child will eventually get the hang of it. </TEXT>
