	<TITLE> Need help fast. Serious problems after HDD death. Windows won't install on a brad new HDD. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so here's the story.
Yesterday the HDD in my dad's laptop died, the system hanged and wouldn't come back up after restarting. After a couple of quick moves (AKA trying to hook up the HDD to a different laptop and starting it up), I determined that the HDD died. There was a lot of important files on it and the HDD's gone to a recovery service but that's not the point.

We bought a new drive to get the computer up and working ASAP. And I quickly encountered numerous problems.

The laptop is a Samsung Q330, bought with Win7 64bit pre-installed. Turns out the "recovery CD" that you have to make is completely useless in an event like that, because it's designed to communicate with the recovery software installed on the computer. And that cannot be accessed. There's no OS on it, the computer does not recognize it as a bootable CD.

Anyway, I decided to install the OS from my own original Win7 CD. Here's the fun part. At first the laptop refuses to read the CD and returns "Operating system not found" message. After restarting, it actually loads up the CD and opens the Windows installation. However, the installation hangs at file extraction (0%) and after 5 or so minutes returns an error. Re-trying, same thing.

Now... after restarting yet again, it completely refuses to read the CD. Fasfasf.

Is it possible that literally everything went fubar aside from the HDD? What should I do? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, first of all: http://i.imgur.com/rLRIm8Z.jpg

52 ground kills. Yep, what the hell. It was a bit of a curious round, because I was only attacked by a single fighter and as you can see, I've taken care of that.

I didn't even take any damage from the attacker, so after dropping all my bombs I continued to fly around and kill the soft targets with my gunners, having decided that after that I would go and rearm to be able to finish off the remaining pillboxes.

And there's the point. As of right now, gunners have access to pretty much unlimited ammunition, with short pauses for reloading - and when you have your gunners maxed out, it takes just a couple of seconds. Pulling something like this off with a plane armed with actual offensive weaponry would require at least 3 landings. And that is, provided if the round doesn't end before that. Now, this still requires a lot of luck. The players on the opposing team weren't much on the smart side, so they were quickly down to two planes - one of them who died to another G8N1 by sticking to its tail (managed to make it crash in the end though), and another in a Yer-2, who then crashed as I was about to bomb the final pillboxes.

To be honest, I don't think that this is alright. I'm not sure how much ammo was there for gunner's disposal, but I'm pretty damn sure that it wouldn't be THAT much. Seeing as sometimes I had to fire off quite a bit of rounds before walking them on target, I must've spent over 7000 rounds there. That's a little over twice the amount of ammo the P-47 carries, and no other plane in the game gets to carry more than the Jug.

Basically, limiting the amount of ammo that gunners have to more realistic amounts would be one way of nerfing bombers and I do actually believe that something like this would need to happen. </TEXT>

I have keys binded to sight distance control, but this doesn't seem to do anything to me. How do.

	<TITLE> Njal Stormcaller and his psychic powers VS 6th Ed - spammity spam? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-10 15:49:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've recently gotten my first Psyker, Njal Stormcaller of the Space Wolves. And now I'm thoroughly confused by the unclear rules, as far as 6th edition goes. 6th Ed corebook speaks of Mastery Levels, Warp Charges and whatnot... Well, I was told to look for SW 6th ed FAQ and surely this explained a lot to me, but not everything.

http://www.games-workshop.com/MEDIA_CustomProductCatalog/m2420319a_Space_Wolves_6th_Ed_V1.pdf

Basically, it states that Njal has Mastery Level 2 and he can either stay with his original SW codex powers, or generate two powers from the corebook. 7 powers vs 2? Obvious choice for me.

See, the way his powers work seems a bit... well, overpowered. Njal Stormcaller knows all of the Rune Priest psychic powers - 7 of them, compared to the Rune Priests which have to pick just two of them. Furthermore, Nijal can use TWO psychic powers each round. While 6'th ed powers have a requirement of Warp Charges, Njal's powers have no requirements set whatsoever.

The Mastery Level of 2 seems to be set just for the requirements of rules for resisting psychic powers ("Deny the Witch" I believe it was called)

It's all pretty unclear and hard to believe. I know 245 points must mean SOMETHING but come on. The question is, can the same power be used twice in one round, or do they have to be two different powers? If the first statement  would be true... then it'd be Jaws of The World Wolf all over the place. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: Bots are Stupid. Be a good sport about it and relay their position to the opposite team if there are no living players left. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-09 21:06:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We all know how much pain in the ass the AI's can be. The entire enemy team is dead, and there's only this one frickin' AI left. Too bad the clouds are at 1000 meters and you can't see crap - in the meantime, the bot decides that it's a good time to start some AI Space Program, climbing to 11 kilometers and taking a massive stinky turd on your time.

Most people just land and leave the game at this point, waiting either roughly 45 minutes for the round to end. Sure, you can also use this to grind ground targets in peace - well, not every map has soft targets and not everyone carries bombs.

I understand how annoying this is and I made my decision - If I happen to be the last player alive, after my death I will stick around and tell the other team where the pesky AI's hide. I already did this once, saving other player hours of looking for Alex hiding his peshka in clouds, way over the sea on Krymsk. I could feel his appreciation blowing from my screen.

I consider this to be a fair thing to do. We don't have to be assholes to the winning team by condemning them to eternal search for a space AI. So please, if you happen to be the last one alive on your team - after your death, be a kind person and tell the others where the AI's are. Thank you for reading.

	<TEXT> So, this just happened to me right now. Zhengzhou (or whatever you spell it), I'm the last one alive in my Yer-2 against four japs. Russian server. My plane is barely flying, and suddenly these guys start talking to me in russian. I obviously couldn't understand what they were saying, so I said "No Russian" and then, with very broken english, this guy tells me that they won't kill me so everyone can farm ground targets while the game lasts. I couldn't believe it with my own eyes.

And it actually happened. After landing and re-arming (GOD THE YER-2 IS A PAIN TO TAKE OFF WITH) I was passing them while everyone was joyfully farming ground targets, me included. There was only one guy whom I killed because he attacked me, the remaining guys said that he was an idiot.

Unfortunately I died due do bad AAA dicerolls. And I was actually prepared to let them kill me after I'm done with bombing.

Faith in Russian WT players = restored. </TEXT>
