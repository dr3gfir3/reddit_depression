I have a bunch of RARs that can't be read by a playback program because the images are stored in an extra file branch.

Example:

This problem is with many files and prevent's playback on my iPad eComic reader.

So far I am just unraring them manually then moving the pictures manually to the root folder and raring them again and changing the file ext back to cbr. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does using a type table count as cheating?

Does fishing on a route count as my one pokemon? 

If i can fish within the city, then i can catch that monster without it counting as my catch from the route leading to the city, right?

I am doing a nuzlocke playthrough on y with 2 subrules:

Faint = i have to wondertrade it (must keep it if it is -10/+5 of the one that fainted, my call on the pokemon if it is lower than 10 below)

If a passerby wants the trade, i offer what i want, if they take the tradei can keep the one they traded me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Also looking for someone to supply a Electirizer but not for a Ditto.

I have 2 Dittos to trade (I will probably keep the KOR and trade the JPN and FRE).


FRE: Above average overall, G: Sp.D, def got some good stats. Quirky.

JPN: Above average overall, G: Def, fantastic stats, but Attack is terrible, no great shakes with Sp. D. Hasty

KOR: Relatively superior potential overall, G: Def=Sp.Atk, they can't be beat. Lax.

Do not need:

suicune

entei

mew

phione

zygarde

xerneas

Tornadus

Thundurus

Landorus

Dialga

Palkia

Giratina

Ho-Oh

Lugia

Mewtwo </TEXT>
