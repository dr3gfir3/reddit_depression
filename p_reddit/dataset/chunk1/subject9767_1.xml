	<TITLE> Venus traps   Pitcher plant </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-05 04:30:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello, I got my venus fly traps and pitchers from Lowe's. I'm currently using all the soil which was included in original packaging for all plants. They were doing fine at first, and now, it looks wilted and some of the traps have gone black. Some of them are still green though. This is my setup. This is the light I purchased: http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B001P05V6M/ref=mp_s_a_1_1?qid=1407204716 sr=1-1 pi=SY200_QL40

I have the plants a few inches from the light. I give the plants of at least 8+ hours of artificial light with about 4+ hours of filtered sunlight in a windowsill then put them back under the light I bought. I give them nothing but distilled water and only that type of water. I never let the soil get too dry, I usually water every 2-3 days watering them in a plate so they can soak up from the bottom. The first photo I have a question about. This is one mentioned about going black. I also have a smaller venus fly trap in with this one planted next to it (don't know if that matters) Is this one healthy? Also, how often do you water the traps and pitchers? Can also anyone tell me what type of pitcher I have? (Both pictures) Also, do I need to repot any of these? Do I need to do anything to keep them healthy or are they fine?
First plant: http://imgur.com/Yuqt90q
Second venus: http://imgur.com/pm5r5wx
Third plant beside wilted one: http://imgur.com/DVbEjXy
My other pitcher I started from a baby: http://imgur.com/Hm7wmxv (what type of pitcher is this?)
