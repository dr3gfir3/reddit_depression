	<TEXT> The information embargo for American Truck Simulator lifts on 22 Jan at 11:00 UTC. Each tester is allowed to release a short video and so here's mine showing off the customization options for the Peterbilt 579! I hope you guys are as excited as I am for the release of ATS!

	<TITLE> First time overclocking </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-16 11:14:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I've recently noticed that the automatic overclocking feature on my PC's motherboard has been causing quite a bit of instability. I have turned it off and I'm trying to overclock it manually now. It's running an i7-4790K and I've got it running at 4.5GHz on all cores and up turbo boost to 5GHz at 1.205V. It's stable enough for video encoding, Realbench and Cinebench but not Prime95. I'm wondering if I should tinker with the Ring Ratio and Ring Voltage? They are still set to Auto. I will be happy with 4.6GHz at around the same voltages as the CPU's maxing out at 75C now.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I guess I should get a new proper adapter. It seems like the adapter's the culprit. One time it disabled the speedo and rev counter, erroneously told me that there was a brake system failure and put the car into limp mode. I couldn't turn the engine off or put on the electronic parking brake until I pulled out the adapter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha I had a great time. Traffic's a bit boring on the autoroutes but I thought the country roads were quite fun. Not needing to care much about being polite in Paris was fun too, especially when zipping around other cars. What surprised me the most was the number of very elderly drivers. I witnessed so many of them nearly get into accidents at the local Carrefour. What worries me is if they ever get on the autoroutes... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi I would just like to share my experience of driving for the first time in Europe. It's been a really stressful and scary experience. Kudos to all you guys out there who have no qualms going at 130km/h in absolute darkness (or even faster if you're driving a BMW). Where I'm from there's not a single road without street lamps and experiencing country roads at 90km/h at 10pm is really something. 

I think I've learnt my lesson to not rent a tiny city car again and expect to cruise at 130km/h. Hearing the engine screaming at 3800rpm wasn't something I wanted to do on long journeys. It could do 170km/h on a downhill though. 

I wonder what kind of MPGs and revs your car does at that speed?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talking about UberX, it seems that the minimum requirements for cars here are very low. The first time I took an Uber it was a BMW 3 series but the subsequent 3 times I took were crappy old Corollas with obvious mechanical problems. 

I've taken Uber in Vienna and London and it's always a relatively new Prius V or a Skoda Superb. 

After my recent experiences with Uber here, I'd rather pay slightly more to take a Hyundai cab than fearing for my life when going 70km/h in a Corolla feels like going above 120.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm amazed at how they're holding up for more than 20 years in some cases. There's this bus I used to take everyday, a brand new Scania, and the driver revs it till 2500rpm (the limiter) before changing gears. In 2 months he has ruined the gearbox, and now he just skips 3rd gear. Poor engine has to do this for another 20 years. Companies here should buy automatics to save on fuel and maintenance costs. I don't think driving at above 2000rpm is going to be fuel efficient for a diesel at all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Was that a bait? 

My topic post does suggest that my theory might be influenced by confirmation bias, as you've suggested as all I've got is anecdotal evidence. I'm quite interested in finding this out, especially for GE2015, but I don't think I'll have the necessary time, resources, energy to coordinate an in-depth research on this. Maybe if I was doing a PhD in sociology or political science, but it's a shame that I'm doing something entirely unrelated. So all I can really do is try to read something compelling enough to change my mind on the topic.

Well I like arguing with strangers on the internet, because I have no friends in real-life to do that with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I do not have an agenda. Maybe I do feel like the WP and other opposition parties are alienating the middle-upper and upper classes. I think you can tell that I'm not an advocate for welfare schemes, for Singapore remains one of the few developed nations without too many social safety nets and I would like to keep it at that. I do agree with you on free university education, but there's too many debates on minimum income to really say whether it helps society in the long run. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes that I agree. The middle income seems particularly vocal in support of the opposition on social media too. 

I'm very surprised that CSJ's public image could be changed in such a short time when he spent the last few decades ruining his own reputation by bitching about Singapore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> thewetilon posted the same survey. I find the survey quite biased due to the under-representation of those earning 7k+ as they have been lumped together as a sort of middle+upper class. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm I don't quite agree with the segmentation of income levels. $7k and below seem to consist entirely of the lower and lower-middle classes since the median monthly household income in 2011 was $7037. The representation here for the middle-upper and upper classes seem to be unfairly lumped together in the survey. I'm quite sure there's quite a difference between $7k, $15k and $30k/month.

It's interesting how you mentioned Cheo Chai Chen and CSJ. It seems like social media did in fact play a large role in the elections, contrary to what the media analysts have agreed on.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't agree entirely with 'regardless'. I think one's income does shape attitudes and beliefs. I have friends from the lower income level and it's quite obvious from their sentiments that they felt that more help can be provided to them and the PAP isn't doing enough for them. Upper class individuals however, lament the rising income taxes and are worried that the opposition's welfare policies are going to translate into even higher taxes in the future. They simply don't care about GST Vouchers, HDB grants, increased income limits for HDBs, better public transport and other types of social spending because they are unable to enjoy many of these schemes. So I would say income levels may not translate to a 'YES' for PAP, but do play a large part in translating to a 'NO' for the opposition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like the opposition should work on not alienating the middle-upper and upper classes of society. All the talk about minimum wage, nationalizing public transport, and changes to the education system are things that the above-mentioned classes don't really care about. They don't stand to gain from the minimum wage schemes, they don't take public transport to care about nationalizing it and they can afford to send their children wherever they want.

On the other hand, things like increasing the income taxes to drive more welfare measures, grants and rebates are just some of the things this group of people don't want to hear. One reason why I think many amongst the middle-upper classes voted for the PAP is because they are worried about the increased tax rates if the opposition's welfare plans were implemented. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does income level correlate with votes for the PAP </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not very sure if this is just a result of confirmation bias or if this effect is actually true. It seems to me that areas with a higher median income level means a larger proportion of votes for the PAP. Holland-Bukit Timah, for example, seems to indicate a strong correlation between income and percentage of PAP votes. Aljunied, with a generally lower income level because of the number of retirees in Bedok, led to higher percentage of votes for the WP. I can't explain MacPherson though; it isn't a high income area but vote percentage for PAP was quite high. Maybe this has to do with the strength of the opposition there too. 

Personally, as a non-HDB dweller in Aljunied, I sided with PAP as I did not identify with WP's policies on minimum wage and increased social security. To me, I wouldn't stand to benefit from any of those handouts or minimum wage policies, although the same can be said about the GST vouchers or U-Save rebates from PAP. I wonder if the same sentiment is shared with other middle-upper class voters? </TEXT>

Edit: Just to add, I think the number of new condos around the Bedok Reservoir has got to do with a higher percentage of votes for PAP.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't vote because I was born 2 months too late but let me share why my parents voted for the PAP. We didn't like the idea of implementing a minimum wage. We ARE affected by the AHPETC saga. We didn't identify with the more socialist policies that the WP is trying to push for. We didn't agree with giving out money to people unnecessarily as we personally never ever qualify for any of them. We don't like LTK because he doesn't speak well in Parliament and honestly seems like a random taxi driver who rambles on about the government's policies without suggesting any good alternatives. These are just some of the reasons. </TEXT>

I wonder if there's a direct correlation between income groups and voting preferences. It seems to me, without any real statistical analyses, that lower income areas would result in higher opposition votes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, I've just completed my SG$3000 desktop built for gaming and here are some pictures:

These are the specs:

Type|Item
:----|:----
Case | Fractal Design Define R5
PSU | Seasonic X Series 850W
Motherboard | MSI Z97 Gaming 5
CPU | Intel i7-4790K
GPU | 2x MSI GTX970 4GB Gaming GDDR5
CPU Cooler | CORSAIR H110 Hydro Series
Additional Case Fan | Corsair AF120 Quiet Edition
SSD | Samsung 840 EVO 500GB
HDD | Western Digital Red 1TB 7200 RPM
RAM | CORSAIR Vengence Pro DDR3-2400 16GB
ODD | LG Blu-Ray Read/Write
OS | Windows 8.1 Home Premium x64
Monitor | Dell U2713HM 27" 1440p
Speakers | Bose Companion 2 Series III

The ODD is currently just cable-tied in place because the H110's too large and made it impossible to fit the 5.25" bay cradle properly. I'm going to try swapping out the rear 140mm fan for a 120mm fan, moving the H110 slightly further back and see if I can fix the issue with the ODD. Stay tuned for more updates!

***(29/01) Edit***: I've installed a Corsair AF120 Quiet Edition to replace the rear 140mm fan and moved the latter to the front and everything fits properly now! The H110 has been moved backwards and I can now install the 5.25" cage! Yay! See the new pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/yqStl  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi reddit, I'm building my first desktop and would appreciate some help. I have a budget of about SG$3000 (US$2400) and I've come up with the parts listed below. Please give me some advice on whether the choice of parts is good or I should purchase something else instead.

I'm also wondering if I have to buy CPU thermal paste separately and whether I should get an extra sound card like the Creative Audigy RX as I'm occasionally doing music recording.

Type|Item
:----|:----
Case | Fractal Design Define R4
PSU | Seasonic X Series 850W
Motherboard | ASUS Z97-PRO
CPU | Intel i7-4790K
GPU | 2x MSI GTX970 4GB Gaming GDDR5
CPU Cooler | CORSAIR H105 Hydro Series
SSD | Samsung 840 EVO 500GB (Don't need to buy this, already own one)
HDD | Seagate 1TB 7200R 64M SATA3
RAM | CORSAIR Vengence Pro 12800/1600Mhz CL9 KIT of 2 (16GB)
ODD | LG Blu-Ray reader
OS | Windows 7 Home Premium x64

Thanks!

Edit: Changed case to Fractal Design Define R4 due to rarity of the CM Silencio 652S and changed CPU Cooler to Corsair H105 instead of H110 as the H110 won't fit in the case (Max 240mm). </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Have SG$100,000 university fund, what should I do? (SG) </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi, I'm from Singapore. I'm 20 and will be attending a 3-year university course next year. I have been awarded SG$100,000 as a sort of 'scholarship fund' from my grandparents and was wondering how I should manage that. The course fees will total to $24,000 for the entire course which leaves me $76,000. 

I currently live with my parents and have no plans to move out anytime soon (Asian society). My university's quite far away (about 80+km round trip) and I was wondering if I should get a car as taking public transport will take up at least 3 hours each day. However, for those who aren't familiar with this tiny country that I live in, cars are ridiculously expensive and getting a half-decent car like a 5 year old VW Golf will cost around $70,000. In addition to that, getting a 5-year old car will mean only 5 more years of usage as 10-year usage rights come with each car, and this can only be renewed for another 10-years at a price of around $70,000. I'm thinking this isn't really wise as we have another spare car at home but using that would mean depriving my mum of using it. 

Another alternative is to save the money in a bank. But interest rates are ridiculously low now, meaning that with inflation, I'm losing money as long as I leave it in a bank. Should I invest the money? Fixed deposits or low-risk investments which have been returning quite a stable 10% over the years? I'm worried of investing as the market could crash anytime, just as how Gold prices fell sharply (I was planning on investing in that). 

Reddit, can you give me any good advice? </TEXT>
