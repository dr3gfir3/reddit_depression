Do you think in some of these circumstances that these groups idolise women and not God? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello all! I have told my Church that would perform some spoken word at Church in December. I have wanted to write spoken word for a while and never got around to it this at least has given me a deadline.

I was wondering if there are any tips etc, or structure I need to know? For me listening and writing are two different things.

If stuck for an answer follow this guideline..

Does it have to rhyme? How long does it have to be? Any other genrael advice?

Thanks so much! And have a great day! </TEXT>

His drug intake of course clouded his judgement and the paranoia didnt help. Week after week I got death threats and eventually so did the whole church family. After he threatened a child he was asked to leave. Even though this happened months ago I am still shook up and dont feel I can go anywhere without bumping into him.

I am terrified, keep having nightmares and he is always on my mind. Please pray for peace. I was the one he had the most trouble with. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Change my view - When Jesus died he didn't stop being the Son of God. But he did go to "Hell" </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-10 18:06:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For a while now I have believed this but after doing some research in this sub it doesn't seem a popular view point. I will explain why I believe this first so you can see where I am coming from.

The penalty of sin was death. Jesus had mankind's sin put on his shoulders. Meaning on that cross he was sinful, he took what we should have. Which is death, death not being a earthly death but a separation from God. (AKA Hell) That's what we deserve. Everyone dies. He didn't die to stop us from dying on earth, he died to not allow us to be separated from God but someone needed to... Namely Jesus.

New Living Translation
For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.

The heart of the earth could just be the ground, but I see it as Sin. The heart of our world since the fall is separation from God.


The idea of Christ being separated from God is more beautiful to me than him dying an earthly death. It should never have happened.

Now go tell me where I am wrong.

	<TITLE> [Serious] in the UK do apprenticeships at charities have to pay? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-01 16:41:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all! I applied for an apprenticeship recently for a charity and didn't even think about it. I read the job description, and there was nothing about pay there. Its definatley and apprentice role and not volunteer. Is there some law that companies have to abide by? Even if its for a charity. If you dont know would it be an appropriate thing to ask at my interview next week?

Sorry its a silly question but its my first interview. Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I bet this has been asked alot on this sub but because #EverySimpsonsEver is a thing I think its a great time to go through our favourite episodes and jokes from the show. The joke doesn't have to be from the episode you chose.

**Episode** Homers Triple Bypass - So many great jokes and a great excecution for such a serious ep.

**Joke** - (While watching a glowing Homer behind an X-ray)
Dr. Hibbert: Now Mrs. Simpson, what you see here is the radioactive dye we injected into your husband's bloodstream.
Nurse: But doctor! I haven't injected the dye yet!
Dr. Hibbert: Good Lord! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw the movie Gods Not Dead the other day and I hated it! However alot of my friends loved the film and it helped encourage them, I write a blog and want to put my thoughts into a blog. Not to be angry or demeaning but I admit it will be slightly tongue in cheek. I dont want to offend anyone but equally I dont see how the film can encourage. Does Christs death permit me to be critical and harsh to something that God may have ordained to happen? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Hangover Trilogy - What do you think? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-28 23:48:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've just watched the 3rd Hangover film, and I have a lot of thoughts running through my head so thought I'd share here what I thought about all the films in arguably one of the most mixed film series I've ever seen.

The Hangover : Probably one of my favorite comedies of all time or its at least definatley up there. I thought the whole film was fantastic, the idea of a mystery combined with comedy was great and of course the characters were probably theglue that kept it all together.

Part 2: The same exact film. Is that bad? Depends. I enjoyed it but the films ending was less satisfying than the first as it is the same thing as before.

Part 3: I have no idea how I feel about it... When did they turn into action heroes? It just seems really out of place most of the time, oh and I didn't laugh really. It was a great set up but this really felt flat I think. Doesn't really feel like a Hangover film...

I'm sure my opinions may change after rewatches though :)

What are your opinions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In these two episodes Arin tells Ross not to care what we think as "its a videogame not a test". Seems all those times we told him to push B in sunshine has angered him. Thoughts? How do you react to Arins mentality?

I personally agree with him.

Edit: and shit, looks like I can't tell my demon souls from my dark ones. Sorry guys! </TEXT>

I dont feel Steam Train can make a boring game interesting like Game Grumps can. I dont know always seems the lesser show to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As stated in Part 1 of Journey to Sillius when Dan asks if Ross' proposal is too personal even though Arin said it was up to Ross it seemed that before starting Grumps Arin told both Dan and Ross to not speak of their personal lives as thatd be the only reason Dan would really ask. So lovelies good or bad thing? The reason I loved Grumps before was how personal Jon and Arin got but now its a different sort of show I dont mind.

	<TEXT> So I have been questioning the existence of the Christian God, but there are a few things that are hard for me to look over. Such as about a year ago a elderly man came up to me and told me God told him what was going on in my life and sure enough he told me every detail. However he told me things I hadnt told people such as self harming etc. God told him to tell me that God loves me and I should stop doing it. How would you explain that without faith? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a 18 year old Christian and I think I'll still call myself that for a while.. However my faith is dwindling I feel controlled by the church so much that I dont even care if God exists anymore I just want MY life back. Anyhoo for some reason its decided I should get baptised after 4 years of going to church, part of that is a testimoney in front of the church saying all the great things God has done and the other is to accept Jesus into my life. I dont feel like lying to all these people, or really telling them i dont want to do it as they need 3 people to do it and Im the third... should I just go along with it or what?

Also its in 5 days... </TEXT>
