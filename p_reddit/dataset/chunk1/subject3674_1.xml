	<TEXT> I was adopted at a young age and have been doing a lot of research before I commit to a type of DNA test, but have found conflicting information on which test would be best. At this point, I'm leaning towards Ancestry.com's DNA test, but would like to know your recommendations for someone who is adopted? I am mostly interested in learning about my ethnicity but would also be open to using a DNA test to potentially find family members.
