	<TITLE> Looking for a Windows 8 Tablet </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-04-24 02:54:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Any help would be lovely.
I'm looking for a windows 8 tablet that's got more than 1 full size USB port, and a full size HDMI out port on the tablet, not with a keyboard. 64GB+ drive with expandable SD would be great. I would like to be able to hook up a keyboard as well but I won't be using the keyboard a lot thus I need USB ports for peripherals, and I think I'd like to use a bluetooth keyboard. I will be hooking it up to external displays so screen size doesn't matter.
I played with the Surface and did not like it so I'm looking for a different manufacturer.

I have searched and searched and found tablets with some but not all of my specifications. Please help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> TIL "Burghoff's left hand is withered and misshapen with the fingers being very shortno cause is known for it, though it is presumed to be a birth defect known as a localized dysmelia. In M*A*S*H, he is often seen carrying a clipboard or other object to conceal the defect, though there are scenes where it can be seen very well, especially in the pilot episode of M*A*S*H*."

	<TEXT> Super Smash Bros. has amazing replay value. I've been playing for 10 years with all sorts of people through the years. Unfortunately, its the  multiplier that makes the game, so without friends it gets old. Goldeneye is an amazing game but Perfect Dark is like Goldeneye Plus. If you want single player I'd go with Super Mario 64 and Ocarina of Time. I also enjoyed Conkers:Bad Fur Day. It's a little rude but I was 15 when I started playing it.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best Remote Desktop Tool? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-21 08:21:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've looked around for a MS developed RDP tool for my Nokia Lumia 900. I figured Windows 7 and WP7.5 should work well together and with the upcoming releases of Windows 8 and WP8 there would be something good AND free in the marketplace. There is a Remote Desktop App that cost about $15, but I don't want to drop money on an App that sucks.
Advice? </TEXT>
