	<TEXT> I haven't personally known anyone myself, but my uncle is a prison guard in my state in Australia. Most of you would have heard of the Port Arthur Massacre in Tasmania, Australia, conducted by Martin Bryant. It was the reason Australia has ridiculously strict gun laws also. (which I think are excellent, sorry to you Americans but I don't think just anybody should be able to walk around with a gun.) He killed 35 people and injured 23 others.... some of these were parents... husband and wife.... children even..... My uncle met this sadistic son of a b***h and has claimed he has never met such an evil person in his whole entire time working at the prison..... He is so evil and unstable he has his own building and is locked in a padded room with a straight jacket. This event has changed Australian history forever, and living in the same state as someone who killed almost 40 people is pretty intimidating. if you look into it enough, you'll find the wiki leaks page with real footage of the aftermath which was used as a police training video..... although, beware, it is extremely graphic and NSFW.  </TEXT>
