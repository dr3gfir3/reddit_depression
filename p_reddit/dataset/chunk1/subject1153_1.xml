[Obama literally admitted that Alex Jones and the "fake news" reports of a few other domestic "partisan news venues" discredited the entire political/media Establishment](http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2016/12/16/obama_foreign_fake_news_doesnt_seem_so_far-fetched_compared_to_some_domestic_propagandists.html) which was relying so heavily on the [nonstop domestic propaganda that said Trump stood zero chance of winning the election and that hell would freeze over if he somehow managed to win.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=YZ46I3kMOr0)

And now that he is President, all we hear from these same discredited sources is "the Russians" this, "the Russians" that. It's so pathetic it's become comical, because these same discredited sources are still claiming that they have credibility. They're like deluded substance abusers who don't realize they need an intervention. They still don't realize that all their credibility went out the window when Trump became President. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty sure she knows it. It's her high IQ and the area of law she specialises in that leave me with little doubt that she's consciously evil, even though she may very well be a pleasant and likeable person.

She excels in representing institutions and individuals in matters involving allegations of cartel, fraud, money laundering, insider trading, bribery, tax avoidance, and market manipulation and other anti-competitive activity.

There was a high profile case she was working not too long ago involving a bunch of the power elites and their Swiss bank accounts, and how they were not paying taxes. Clearly the law had been broken and any commoner committing the same crime would be dead to rights in prison. But she and another high powered Jewish lawyer convinced a federal jury to acquit because the guy on trial knew where all the skeletons were buried. Some people are too powerful to prosecute apparently.

This is how the world works and they all know it. That's why there's this revolving door culture that sees the top Washington insiders get high paying jobs within the very top law firms tasked with defending the white collar criminals who routinely get away with murder, so to speak.

Take former US AG Eric Holder, for example. When he was done with his criminal ventures in government, this gun grabbing crook took on a lucrative job as partner at her old lawfirm.

The DOJ prosecutor leading the investigation into the LIBOR and FOREX scandals just happened to score a lucrative job at her CURRENT law firm. In order for the privileged power elite to continue hoarding the world's wealth and operating above the law they need an army of highly trained, highly paid lawyers working tirelessly to that end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the dog and pony show they put on. DOJ, CFTC will investigate the big banks knowing they will hire top law firms to get the charges dropped or thrown out altogether.

These lawyers are almost always Ivy League educated, "progressive" leftists, and Jewish. I'm not anti-Semitic. I've made plenty of Jewish friends and growing up my best friend was Jewish. 

I also happen to know one of the high-powered Jewish lawyers who represented several of the big banks under investigation (think HSBC, BoE) for the LIBOR scandal, and is likely still involved in some of the LIBOR investigations that are ongoing. We worked in the same building back when she was fresh out of law school clerking for a federal judge, which really wasn't that long ago. She was a really nice, attractive girl known for her great stamina and leftist progressive ideology.

Turns out she's been very busy representing elitist interests since then, which I find especially disturbing given how genuinely sweet of a person she seemed to be back when she was clerking. I mean, her resume literally reads like she's been working exclusively for the Illuminati since then. I guess evil has many faces. </TEXT>

Ok so it seems you didn't like being censored on that sub. I still don't see how that's even relevant in any way to the content of this article.

Wtf? Why are you people so preoccupied with lecturing other people on how to communicate, when most of you folks have a tendency of not knowing what you're talking about or complaining about. 

Get this clear: *Nobody's preventing you from entering a challenge.* You're simply tired of losing the argument repeatedly because your credibility is shot. The problem you people are having is that you're terrible at honest debate which is why you want the government to intervene and censor free speech.

	<TEXT> So going back to what Obama said:

"If fake news that's being released by some foreign government is almost identical to reports that are being issued through partisan news venues, then it's not surprising that that foreign propaganda will have a greater effect," 
 "It doesn't seem that farfetched compared to some of the other stuff folks are hearing from domestic propagandists."
"if that's the story that is being put out there, then when a foreign government introduces that same argument, the facts are made up, voters who have been listening to that stuff for years, who have been getting that stuff every day from talk radio or other venues, they're going to believe it

The implication is clear that Putin and "domestic propagandists" like Alex Jones put Trump in the White House. How else could it have played out that way were it not for Trump repeating the same talking points which resonated with the American public? Were Trump voters merely unwitting agents of Putin as well? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But that doesn't answer the question. Why would POTUS along with the entire political Establishment and mainstream media be in literal panic mode concerning Alex Jones - the figurehead of the conspiracy/alternative media movement? The work of James O'keefe and Julian Assange are regularly covered on his show, in fact I believe they may even be regular guests. So why don't their own batshit crazy views discredit them? They don't even have a real presence in social media, as sites like reddit make sure to marginalize them. You don't see links to infowars making it to the top of r/news or r/politics or even r/the_donald, which btw is also prevented from making it to the front page of reddit thanks to new site rules. So what gives? Something is amiss.

I mean, they're actually calling for Congress to get involved to silence these supposed discredited tinfoil wearing whackjobs. Why such a seemingly disproportionate response? It's literally as though they're claiming that Alex Jones and the alternative media put Trump in the White House, which on its face is preposterous. That's the sort of drivel that should be at the top of r/conspiratard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It wasn't just protestants hating Jesuits, but catholics as well. Once upon a time, even the Pope himself was compelled to abolish the Jesuit order for its political intrigues throughout Europe and the destabilization and chaos which ensued. 

[This bit of history goes right to the crux of the Jesuit Pope's obvious animosity towards a "free press,"](http://ieg-ego.eu/en/threads/european-media/european-media-events/christine-vogel-suppression-of-the-society-of-jesus-1758-1773) which is in keeping with church history. 

Remember, this is a Pope who publicly stated that there are limits to free speech (with regards to a terrorist attack committed by Muslim fundamentalists in France who were similarly offended by it.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know for certain that he's damned. I simply stated that his fate is sealed upon death. And based on what we know about his extremely sinful and unrepentant life, he's likely to be judged harshly when he receives his just reward.

We can also deduce that Pope Francis never really cared much about Fidel's salvation, for if he did, he would've publicly grieved for his sinful state while he was still alive. That's what a real Christian would've done, knowing that reasoning with sinners and praying for their conversion *while they're still alive* is what Jesus commissioned His followers to do. He never taught us to wait until they're dead to convert them. That idea comes from Catholic tradition borrowed from pagans and the apocrypha, not from His Word.

Instead, pope Francis squandered his golden opportunity to reason with Fidel, to pray and call for repentance by completely ignoring the many sins that have been committed by his communist regime. [Pope Francis, being the lukewarm Christian that he clearly is, actually pretended as if no grievous sins had been commited against the Cuban people.](https://www.firstthings.com/web-exclusives/2015/09/when-francis-came-to-cuba) Evidently, Pope Francis is a politician first, "Vicar of Christ" second. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Classic denial on your part. You dare not address the highly pertinent points I brought up with regards to traditional journalism's fading relevance, and you want to pretend as though my opinion isn't shared by a majority of the public.

Well run along then, and try to enjoy the rest of your holiday weekend as best you can. May I suggest some mindless consumerism as a useful distraction from your troubles? </TEXT>

Maybe you should try something new, like not insulting their intelligence with your [mind-numbingly stupid propaganda.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=W26aqd35LUU) </TEXT>
