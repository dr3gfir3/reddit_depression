	<TEXT> I could see how it would be. I don't really know what the answer is. I'm sure everyone can understand why guys wouldn't want to treat female coworkers as "just one of the guys." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We've all experienced advertising and most of us don't seem to agree that advertising is analogous to being force-fed there's not much more to be said. Also, I don't feel like getting into an argument on the internet with someone who seems very invested in his opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's weird, because he didn't address any of the points and instead used sort of an ad hominem to discredit the other guy. Not exactly what I would consider intelligent, even in this thread. Why don't you just say that you were looking ~~with~~ for someone who agreed with you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You may have experienced different things and be completely new in terms of cell makeup but there is continuity between the old you and the new you. 

If "you" cease to exist and then something with the same genetic structure is created a few kalpa later, it won't be you. It won't have your experiences. If by some magical coincidence it has the same genetic structure and all the same experiences as you it won't matter because there is no continuity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just an incredibly shitty novice but some tips would be:

Use a tripod

Use a very low shutterspeed/bulb mode

Get a lens with a low aperture number like f2.8 or lower (I've taken some decent pictures with just f3.5)

Oh and one of those remotes for your camera so you don't actually have to press the button (I don't own one so I can't tell you much about it)

Learn a little bit about iso, aperture and shutterspeed then experiment.
