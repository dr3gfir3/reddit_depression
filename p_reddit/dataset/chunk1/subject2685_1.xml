	<TEXT> I didn't experience it, but I read about it.  Mindblowing.

"In 1975, while riding a moped in Bermuda, a man was accidentally struck and killed by a taxi. One year later, this man's bother was killed in the very same way. In fact, he was riding the very same moped. And to stretch the odds even further, he was struck by the very same taxi driven by the same driver - and even carrying the very same passenger!

was an odd young adult.

He was not odd in the extraordinary sense,

In many simple sentences

he said what needed to be said.

And when it came time

he said the first animal that popped

	<TEXT> Hey everyone, now I know this is a kinda broad question, and probably not the best approach to fitness, but I have been pondering it so I thought I'd ask.

If I wanted to just be able to eat whatever I want and a quite a bit of it, and i'm not talking like crazy amounts or like eat-nothing-but-donuts, but how much would I have to run daily to do this?  I know it's kind of hard to tell because of genetics and every body being different, but if someone ran 6 miles every day, for the most part, would they be slim? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> wow, didn't want to pester you again so I made a new post, but thank you!
one issue though, if you look at the list in the beginning of each line there is a number, period, and a bunch of spaces.  I think the code takes that and the final url looks like this

"https://www.zooamerica.com/1. horse/2.           mammal"

how do I make it ignore this?  can't figure it out with this code because i've never really encountered scan.file usage before you in my learning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This seems to greatly work!  Thank you!  Basically what I was trying to do was clean up a file cause it is output from an API filled with a ton of junk x 1000.  
What would actually be a real goal for me is to make it look through each line, and if somewhere in that line it says "MEOW" then I want it to go back and search the last 20 lines before it for a line that says "PUPPY" and then paste the rest of that line into a new file.  And so forth for the rest of the file.

Any way you can modify the above code for that?  Seems like a tiny bit of work but I have reddit credits and can gift you more reddit gold for that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey everyone.  Recently i'm looking to creating a curation bot on tumblr using node.js  I have never coded before, and since I am really interested, I am hoping it would be a great first project.  Is it too ambitious for a first project?
What I'm asking is general advice.  What coding language should I learn to do this, where should I look, and any direction to where I could learn this sort of thing.  Any help at all is GREATLY appreciated.  Hope i'm not asking too much. Have a great day Reddit!! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "Bruce had me up to three miles a day, really at a good pace. Wed run the three miles in twenty-one or twenty-two minutes. Just under eight minutes a mile [Note: when running on his own in 1968, Lee would get his time down to six-and-a half minutes per mile]. So this morning he said to me Were going to go five. I said, Bruce, I cant go five. Im a helluva lot older than you are, and I cant do five. He said, When we get to three, well shift gears and its only two more and youll do it. I said Okay, hell, Ill go for it. So we get to three, we go into the fourth mile and Im okay for three or four minutes, and then I really begin to give out. Im tired, my hearts pounding, I cant go any more and so I say to him, Bruce if I run any more, and were still running-if I run any more Im liable to have a heart attack and die. He said, Then die. It made me so mad that I went the full five miles. Afterward I went to the shower and then I wanted to talk to him about it. I said, you know, Why did you say that? He said, Because you might as well be dead. Seriously, if you always put limits on what you can do, physical or anything else, itll spread over into the rest of your life. Itll spread into your work, into your morality, into your entire being. There are no limits. There are plateaus, but you must not stay there, you must go beyond them. If it kills you, it kills you. A man must constantly exceed his level. "
