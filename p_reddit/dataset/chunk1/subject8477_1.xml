	<TEXT> Thank you for the feedback and the links. I was attempting to imply that the people who have the most to lose, i.e. the people in power and the people capable of influencing the people in power by monetary means, are the people who would stifle progress at the peril of the general population.  Looking at it this way bring to me the thought that Hollywood is acting as the  propaganda arm for the government. 

I understand that the web as a whole is not the most disciplined entity, but when given more thought, the web populace is made up of people like you, me and people smarter than both of us. It's those people to whom I'm referring when I talk about the internet community. You only have to remember as far back as the SOPA/PIPA legislation to get a feel for what I mean.

I've been lurking on reddit for about a year now, so I'm familiar with some of the oddities around here. Sometimes the memes can be a bit much, but I do find a worthwhile amount of insight when it comes down to it. I visited the likes you suggested before writing this and I think it will be a great addition to my learning about well, anything. I do appreciate your words of caution though. Off to reddit for a bit. Who am I kidding? I'll be on reddit all day. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What if at this point in history... </TITLE>

	<TEXT> My thoughts tend to be a bit murky coming out so please bear with me. Input Welcome :D 
   
There's a thought that has been on my mind a lot recently. It has to do with this great unity of the informed. I'm referring to the protests against governments and massive political involvement from my and younger generations .  Now, I've always viewed the web as a physical manifestation of the human psyche. From the most perverse fantasies, to the desire to help others. I can't say this with any definitive certainty, I just compare from my own thoughts alongside what I observe online. Back to my failing attempt to make a point. 
   
Governments, like any like-minded group of people, are, from what I can tell, subject to group think. This would be a non-issue in any other case, but it is an issue here because they are capable of great destruction and great corruption, which in turn affects the lives of the governed. 
   
So here we have the government with its enforcers (LE), abusing their positions. Now because of  these abuses, as is normally the case, the governed get upset. The difference between past anger and modern anger is that we, the web collective, are able to reach a global consensus as to how we should approach a given situation. For the first time in history, we are able to be everywhere and nowhere all the time. This seems to be what scares them. 
   
These latest pieces of legislation are not about piracy or money. They're about maintaining power. Governments see how angry the middle east protests were, but that's not what bothered them. It was the effectiveness with which the people were able to organize and subsequently overthrow governments that were so confident in their power over their citizens. Keep the people dumb and ignorant and you wont have to hear from them. That used to be the way, but it's not entirely possible now. In some places maybe, but not the vast majority of the world. 
   
It seems as though this kind of community moderated environment could someday make a move to the real world. While it is evident that we as a species have much to improve upon, it does seem as though the roots of what could be a beautiful future are starting here, on this fledgling internet. The free sharing of information, helping those in dire need, free thought, a society where an individual can truly write their own ticket, a community moderated world. In a place like that, why would you need a government?
   
This, it seems, is what the recent attacks on the web have been about. Not piracy or money, but adhering to a system that is clear unable/unwilling to keep up a forward-thinking social mindset. 

   I hope someone has been able to understand what I was trying to say here....

Edit:i no make sense. icebirds orders. thnx for the feedback. </TEXT>
