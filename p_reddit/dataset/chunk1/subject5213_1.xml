	<TEXT> This sounds like slander.  I would consider taking some legal advice, as this is very extreme.  And absolutely not, you were right to charge her your "friend" rate.  She seems like a psychotic self-entitled monster.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can feel for your situation, as me and my current SO started off long distance.  Is there a reason you think he likes everything she posts?  I can understand separating on good terms, but that is usually not a normal thing to do. Until he or she crosses some clear boundaries, like flirtatious/too-friendly comments, I don't see many outcomes where bringing it up to him would benefit anyone. 

Ultimately, I think this is just a case of where ignorance could've been blissful. 

The best you can do is trust your boyfriend and know right now all those nice things he says and does for you aren't any less genuine and heartfelt just because they've happened with someone else previously.  Him and his ex chose to break up, and right now he wants to be with YOU. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It just seems like it isn't a part of his personality to be romantic like you want him to be.  He can try saying nicer, romantic words to please you, but even then they might feel just as forced as the flowers he buys.  

Also, there is certainly a difference between being romantic, and showing someone you love them.  If you feel like he doesn't love you, I would try having a more serious conversation with him and maybe suggesting counseling so he might learn to communicate his feelings that lets you feel cared for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is one hard pill to swallow and I'm sorry this has happened to you.  You certainly have a big choice to make.  If you decide to stay, not divorce, and work things out you need to be prepared to forgive her and let her work her way into gaining back your trust.  If you feel like you can never trust her again, or forgive her (I wouldn't blame you) from this terrible thing she has done, it might be better for divorce.  You just wouldn't ever be happy being with someone you distrust and resent.  

It might have happened a decade ago, but each day it passed was another day your wife kept something that you deserved to know.  Almost like a marriage based on a lie that you could trust her.  

Also, your friend is a piece of shit.  Close contact with him forever, and thank his wife for being a decent human being, unlike the other 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your response, a lot of it makes sense to me.  Both my SO and his brother are attractive but in different ways.  I'm not sure if he feels the same way towards me, but I know he's had some relationship troubles in the past and I've wondered if maybe he wants something similar to what Will and I have.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will say your room mate acted very immaturely, it seems like he took it all way too personally.  


But while I believe you're fully within your right to say no, I believe it's a fairly normal request to make between room mates, and it wasn't rude to just ask considering it was only 2 blocks away and if you two know each other fairly well.  I'm not sure there was any reason to "tense up" and wonder "why the hell" he would ask such a thing.  Based on those things, I wonder if you acted a bit too agitated by it and offended your room mate.  Maybe treating his request with respect and just calmly explaining why you're not comfortable loaning your car to him or anyone else would have helped the outcome. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a gay man who's done this exact thing, I am almost positive he's doing it to avoid someone he's not comfortable with seeing his phone.  People are snoopy, and seems like it's just human nature to glance at someone else's phone.  I worked temporarily at a job in a red state with macho good ole boys who would be less than pleased to know a gay guy was working beside them, using their restrooms, etc.  (it was a bad situation but I was desperate for a job-- thankfully I left soon after) I changed my boyfriends name on my phone because it kept things easier and I knew it would mean an uncomfortable experience had everyone known.  

Just ask him about it.  Be understanding.  Tell him you want him to confide in you, instead of him feeling he needs to make excuses.

	<TEXT> If you don't take him back for cruelly killing snails, don't take him back for shit-talking to your friends about you behind your back.  

For some perspective, I grew up in a household who didn't feel the same way to creatures.  Granted, we didn't take pleasure in killing bugs or anything, but if there was a cockroach or ants inside the house we would just bring out a can of bug spray and be done with it.  But now my current SO loves all animals just as you do.  To spare his feelings, I just changed certain things about how I interact to bugs to spare his feelings.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe your fianc didn't tell you because you have a history of not keeping a secret.  I mean you told his mom right when he told you not to, and then you also went off and told your sisters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your fiance (as others have said) is really turning into a Groomzilla.  Maybe he feels like, because you never dreamed of a wedding or previously cared to have one and he has, that he should be able to make all the decisions.  I think you should really put your foot down and tell him the wedding is about the both of you, not just him or anyone else.  Honestly, most decisions should be agreed or at least compromised together.  And the wedding dress should be the bride's decision.  For him to not even allow you THAT just seems controlling.

Tell him if he's okay with you getting anxiety and being uncomfortable on YOUR wedding day, then you should reconsider having a wedding at all.  Say a wedding doesn't have to be so conventional and it can and should reflect who you are and be just as memorable and joyous.  He seems more concerned about what "others" will think of the wedding than how you feel.   </TEXT>
