	<TEXT> What other Rookie did better though? There were a couple of them who had a couple of really good games here and there but I think Move did shine for a good portion of the season and when he *did* his team was number one. He did fall off (hard, mind you) towards the end but he definitely has the potential to play really well and showcased it more than other Rookies this split. In his prime he was fun to watch, I hope he manages to regain his form. Hoping this was maybe just a bad meta for him/inexperience choking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kinda works both ways; if Malz can time and place his silence right neither Zed nor Fizz can follow up their burst. It's a skill matchup in these cases though. </TEXT>
