	<TEXT> A few times a day, my brain will make these momentary excursions, which is nothing I can help until I can wake up. It recedes into memory and returns to that place. This never happens when I'm asleep. I don't dream. I wake from these momentary lapses and feel the sweat beading along my forehead. I remind myself, "you're not there", repeating it, until I understand. The words should bring me comfort, because my greatest fear is alive in that distant world. I can't stop thinking about a return, because, despite experiencing what would be my greatest terror, my memory goes back to the times of overwhelming joy. I knew and loved greater than I thought possible. Afghanistan meant something to me, before time came to corrupt it. The horrors we experienced in my last few days in that world are something I never thought I'd be able to discuss.

I was a journalist who took on a free-lance operation to learn about 'the conditions of the people living in Afghanistan'. I wasn't part of any military operations, but more of a humanitarian aid (although I'm certain most of our research was done to help the military). The world wanted to know about the people of Afghanistan and our study meant broadening their perceived notions of a part of a world that everyone thinks they know. The scope was meant to cover the entirety of what is known as 'The Middle East', although my expertise was Afghanistan. I thought I knew a lot about the country, but it was only in living with its people, being accepted as an equal and offering the same to them, that I truly understood these proud, noble people. 

Military operations had taken off in most of the country. Locals didn't think much of it at the time, although they understood that the 'western presence' would expand, most possessed an impossible optimism that things were about to get better. Everyone operated under an assumed certainty that their towns would last through the occupation and that those in power would be brought to justice. The increased military presence meant an end to a theocratic regime that had proven brutal and calculating. The locals were happy to see them uprooted and removed from power and even welcomed the foreign armies in establishing what they would believe to be a 'democracy unlike any other'. 

We dealt with the military on several levels. Most of this story remains classified. Specific names or regions have been changed or otherwise removed, as I'm no longer certain what's still being told to the public, which stories are lies and which have to be seen to be believed. When the military presence expanded they told us we're taking on several risks remaining in these enclaves. They told us that if anything happened, we could try to contact a few outposts that'd been there since before the war, but never the embassies. I assumed these were 'black-list' sites for whatever secretive operations they had in mind. 

The occupation came on slowly, before the real invasion. It wasn't long before I noticed these allegedly covert 'black-list' sites hiding in plain sight. The most obvious tell, and one of the great blunders in military intelligence, was a building along the edge of town. They made it into, not necessarily a bar, but a cafe where foreigners could find a limited source of alcohol. Bars are rare in the area, but only because they're not meant for the locals. Foreigners hide out in the bars for hours on end. There were more of them coming in, as the operation took on full-force. Other outsiders appeared out of nowhere, claiming to be from all over the country, yet the people of our city couldn't identify the person or their 'so-called' lineage.

For the most part, especially before the invasion, Afghanistan greeted me with open arms. All I ever wanted in learning about these people was to shape minds around the idea that we're all equals, hoping to live our lives in relative peace, for as long as we can. I just wanted to help, but nothing is ever so simple. People make it difficult to help them. There were a few who spoke out against my presence, as they saw me as an extension of the military. They became much more vocal with the coming occupation. 

I remember one man, upon seeing me, muttered a few words in his native tongue that I later learned translated to 'white wet dog', which I assumed he called me because at the time I was covered in sweat. My hair, which is long and curly, along with my beard, was matted to my head. In his defense, a 'white wet dog' is also how I'd describe myself. He yelled and spit at the ground, shaking his hands with such anger. I'm not a religious man, but I took it as a curse. He cursed my color, creed and most likely my nationality. 

On a few occasions, some locals showed hostility to my presence, but I always thought it had more to do with the expanding militarism of foreign governments in their country. For the most part, I knew plenty of the locals and was greeted as an equal. Afghanistan will remain a blessing to me, no matter what it is now. One family and a man by the name of Khasir were polite enough to show me more about their culture than I'll ever remember. They provided me with food and water and told me all about their family. A discussion about family takes hours for most people from this town, as they have to go back generations, combing through the fine details of their great ancestors and performing an amazing 'grand-standing' ceremony, as they make their way to their own children. 

I

The company I worked for paid Khasir and his family. In return, he showed me around and allowed me a room to rent. Khasir introduced me to his circle of friends and they all greeted me with the same surprising warmth. It isn't most outsiders that are greeted in this way, but because of who I was with, Khasir being a man of great standing in this town, they accepted me with open arms. The world was changing and the locals weren't greeting people they didn't know. They saw the times changing. Everyone went on the defensive, while I hid in plain sight, able to walk freely through the town, because of my good friend, Khasir. 

He had a group of four friends who visited one of the friend's homes. The owner of the house was Yinzani and, to me, he was an interesting character. He loved what he called 'American culture' and displayed three posters in his basement. The posters were 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' (Arnold was his favorite action star), 'Blazing Saddles' and (my personal favorite), 'Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?' I loved all of these movies and Yinzani's obvious affection for 'American culture' made it much easier for me to fit in. Yinzani possessed at least the same level of respect as Khasir. He was the loudest member of the group, yet whenever he'd get too passionate over one of their discussions, people would still observe the rules of his home and would never raise their voices. 

They'd get together in his home once a week and discuss politics. Politics for them revolved around happenings in and around the city, while, of course, they couldn't help but discuss the 'foreign occupation'. They didn't care as much for world politics (except for that which they were forced to understand). They cared about each other's families and friends, as well as the upholding of their traditions. History and bloodlines meant a lot to them, especially in a town of between twenty-thousand and forty-five thousand. The way they talked you'd think everyone knew everyone, because their histories were intricately knotted together.

World history and politics took on new life, as I immersed myself in their culture, but it was nothing compared to the folklore and traditions of these modern people. Something I always enjoyed is mythology and, in particular, the folk traditions of common, everyday people. Folklore has always been different to me from mythology. Mythology is something dead people believed. Folklore is alive. It's the breath and wisdom of the world around us. Folklore is what we told ourselves, because we 'couldn't step on a crack or we'd break our mother's back'. It was a stupid, amusing anecdote when we were children, imagining that an old man would steal our souls if we ventured over his impossibly tall fence to retrieve a baseball. Folklore took on the necessity for an explanation, when we hadn't the tools or the desire to do so.

I had a feeling that the traditions of Khasir and his friends hadn't changed too much over the past few hundred years. One of the things they discussed was a myth about a wild dog that hunted children in the night. They claimed one had taken a few children over several years, until it was finally caught. Others claimed that the dogs were massive and could walk upright, even going so far as to run and attack like a man. They claimed the dogs had an insatiable lust for their women, but especially loved tearing their men apart, piece by piece.

The military, between the Afghan Guard, International Police and the U.S. Armed Forces, never spoke directly to me. They did, however, recommend a few things to people that I worked for, involving me and where I should operate in order to stay out of their way. There were no real 'safe havens' left in the country, especially as the foreign presence multiplied, but the town was far from what would be called a 'hot zone' for militant Islamic terrorists. I didn't go into these hot zones often, as we were under strict orders from the military, as well as our bosses, that we were only allowed in this area because we wouldn't be reporting on their work in Afghanistan. They didn't want too much information leaking out. All media had to be controlled, which I understood, not as a journalist, but as a man who thought he was doing a good thing for the 'real people of Afghanistan'.

One of the things the military warned my superiors, who, in turn, warned me against, was a man within Khasir's inner circle by the name of Ruftali. He was a well known associate to some individuals who operated against the Afghani military, not the U.S., but a specific sect of militant Arabs that wanted a return to 'The First Tribe'. He belonged to a cult under the guise of Islam that worshipped a demon, Abunnan, known in English as 'the crow eater'. Abunnan was a dog that learned to walk upright and loved to consume human flesh. When I say he loved eating flesh, I mean it. He cut off people's skin and let it dry and would use it to make different sets of armor. Abunnan wanted our blood, because he believed it to be a 'sacrament from the divine' and would use it in dark rituals to pay homage to his mischievous gods. 

The overall consensus from those of us that worked as journalists in Afghanistan, which is not to say all of the Middle East, is that most media outlets took it upon themselves to run with an 'us vs. them' mentality. It was easy enough to mold a few million followers out of 'America at War', when people weren't sure what that meant. We weren't thinking about Al Qaeda one minute before what occurred on 9/11. In truth, we looked to the Middle East as a world of lunatics that was too complicated for our involvement. Now, although I think this is still partly true, I think of it all as organized chaos. It's presented as an archetype for insanity. The media paints the simple portrait of total madness and everyone floats around it, like those little fish that follow around the Great White Shark. The image is irresistible for its simplicity. People are much more eager to ingest a simple narrative. We take what little we can, what our media decides to bless us with, which is usually piece-meal, much like the Pilot Fish.

My town came into conflict with the U.S. military, because they viewed it as what is called a 'Sanctuary City'. A lot of Afghani guardsmen deserted their posts and tried to hide out with us, although, after a few days, they usually returned. If they didn't leave of their own volition, someone came for them. It was but a few occasions that a man would be dragged off, kicking and screaming, while most of us turned a blind eye. On the other side of that, we also saw plenty of former Islamic militants. Most locals ignored them, as they would only come here so that they might find safe passage out of the country. The locals thought they were doing a good thing, helping get rid of the radicalized element that helped bring this hell upon our country. The foreign militaries, however, were annoyed by our 'hands-off approach' to what they saw as 'consorting with the enemy'. Most of these Islamic militants, although the locals didn't know them, were known in some way. They had family ties through relatives and friends, for which the people of our city couldn't turn away. Our leniency annoyed several military officials, who claimed that some locals were providing weapons and food. Although, I can't speak for that, I do know that nobody knew what to do. They were damned by their traditions, while they did their best to maintain 'international law'. It wasn't in their tradition to turn away a fellow 'keeper of the faith', which had seen me welcomed into Khasir's home, as well as Yinzani's.

One day, a man came into one of the cafes along the outskirts of the city, which was an assumed military outpost. He slunk down into his chest and into the stool, with his elbows resting on a counter that looked out toward miles of desert. At one point, he started crying and a local came over to console him. Not long into their discussion, something changed and both men started yelling. The outsider kicked over the stool, yelling about demons roaming the desert that would descend upon the city and gut them in front of their loved ones. A group dressed in black, showing only their eyes dragged the man away. The locals turned the other way, as the man was forcefully brought out of the bar, thrown into the middle of the street and mercilessly beaten. One of the men held him down, while the others kicked and punched. They yelled something I couldn't understand at the time, which I learned after was a great insult. They called him 'shit dog', before knocking him senseless and dragging him away.

I had to ask who that man was and who had taken him away. Khasir reluctantly told me that the man, Benazir, had run away a few months back to join the fight against the American Insurgency. Hed packed up and left, but now claimed that devils hunted him in the desert. He claimed to have abandoned his post and while he tried to make his way home, a pack of wild dogs found him. They chased after him for a while, until they climbed up on two feet. They cackled and howled, as he ran for his life. 

Benazir claimed to have come back to warn them. He claimed he knew that hed be taken, but he had to warn his family. He begged for someone to get his family out of here. He begged and screamed, before being beaten and dragged away.

About a week later, I had my first experience with the international police. They drove to the city and established a perimeter, before their commander walked into our town, like a conquering hero. People hid in their homes, while those on the streets tried to become invisible. A town official walked up and shook his hand. They walked towards the perimeter of the city. They spoke far enough away that we couldn't hear. There was a lot of nodding, each man making points, to which the other countered, still in agreement, before the commander put out his hand. They shook and made as if everything would be fine. The commander and the rest of his entourage drove off. Our assumptions became far too optimistic. 

The official, Ahmud Kazan, walked back to the town, where he was immediately bombarded with questions. He said 'the United States military is evacuating the area' and that 'we were to leave immediately and take what we could'. Apparently a private company bought the town and needed them out so they could establish a base of operation to aid in the war on terror. They said there was a specific mandate from the United States government brought to the United Nations that gave them eminent domain over all territories they would defend. 

The locals didnt take it well, but they were left with no other options. A group of them banded together and said they would kill anyone who threatened their ancestry, including foreign invaders. The official said that the international police wouldn't stop and that if they didnt leave they faced certain death. People remained stubborn, even spitting at their own official and claiming him to be a white wet dog. He left us with the warning and disappeared. 

A few of us tried to convince everyone that leaving was the only option, but the stubbornness of the Afghani people cannot be overstated. I tried to tell Khasir we should follow the official and disappear, but the town meant so much to him. Yinzani was also reluctant. Hed made quite a collection of 'Western memorabilia' and refused to leave it behind. Everyone tried to explain that both he and the memorabilia wouldnt survive, but he remained stubborn. 

A few towns had received the same mandate weeks before and had refused to leave. There was a common belief that it was a tactic of foreign governments and businesses to scare indigenous people into voluntarily relinquishing the rights to their land. They could use a specific clause, claiming they'd 'abandoned their personal property' (homes and, in most cases, entire towns), so they could then claim that the property belonged to them.

One week later, local administrators found Ruftali dead. Hed been dragged out to the desert and torn to pieces. They followed a trail of blood, starting in front of a cafe, with a pool of crimson and leading through the town. Whatever attacked him cut deep enough for the blood to be mixed with something green and black, which I took as bile. There was never a chance of escape. The creature dragged him by his throat into the desert. It tore him apart. His innards had been ripped out and all evidence pointed to the creature(s) playing, chewing, twisting into knots and making toys out of his insides. Bite marks lined what was left of his legs, which were torn from his body and tossed aside. His eyes had been sucked out of their sockets and his tongue was missing. The look from his empty facial cavities is something I'll never forget.

People speculated for hours on what couldve done this to Ruftali. The rumors came back around about him having ties to known terrorist organizations and everyone concluded that some outsiders had gone to the trouble of making an example of him.

One of the city's officials tried contacting the authorities to assist in an investigation for the murder of Ruftali, but the only comment they offered on the matter was that 'it is not the place of the international policing community to involve foreign militaries in domestic affairs'. The local officials had been cut off. Those in charge refused to accept our invitations for town meetings and had their spokesman explain their position, over and over again.

Life continued like normal for about a day and a half, but night brought the lurking menace of fate, as well as the inevitable. We awoke to screams. People ran out of their homes and were greeted by men in black robes waving torches and swinging machetes. They chanted in some language that nobody knew, while some swung long sticks that rattled with every shake. They hissed and whispered curses of death and damnation on the world. Nobody moved, as they marched into our town and pummeled anyone who walked into the street. 

Most of us kept our distance and they left us alone. Those who walked off their property were attacked. They leapt like wild apes, grabbing people by their ears and throwing them to the ground, where they kicked and clawed, as the victims cried out for mercy. They grabbed a few of the women away from their partners, but when they did, everyone tried to stop them. The violence erupted, as the invading army collapsed over us and everyone scattered. They made several sounds that echoed over the night sky, hissing and chanting mixed with a nefarious cackle, like hyenas finding a fresh carcass. 

They fought their way out of our town, kidnapping a few of the women and leaving their husbands crying, pleading for their return. Some of the people, having lost someone they loved more than life itself, followed them out into the desert, where they would die. Others followed along by some warped hypnosis and would forever be their slaves.

VI

Written in blood on a wall at the edge of town were the words 'The night belongs to us' (translated). They branded our town, as if it belonged to them. It was enough to inflict terror and, at the same time, inspire an overwhelming rage. The next night, we enacted a plan to prevent them from taking our homes. We hid between four houses that were close enough to each other that they might be easier to defend. We decided that all women and children had to go. It would be easier to defend the city without putting them in danger. We gathered all the weapons from around the city, which wasnt much for our plan, but enough to mount a resistance and, hopefully, scare them away.

Khasir made his case for staying, while everyone told him to leave with his family. He was a man of great standing in the community, who didn't understand that his 'community' no longer existed. He wouldnt leave if others were staying. He was a testament to the stubbornness and tenacity of the Afghani people, as well as most of the men of the 'Middle East'. After kissing his wife and children goodbye, Khasir joined our militia. 

Yinzani was also far too stubborn. Everyone understood or at least recognized the imminent danger, but he couldnt be coerced into parting with his belongings. He built something around himself, beyond his home and possessions, which belonged to the community, as well as his reputation. It meant something to him to exist at this moment in time, in this place and to have been born around these people.

Nobody wants to believe their world can disappear in a flash. I believe it all the more, as I read through history and see the inevitable manifesting through the impossible. Nobody wants to believe that the worst form of evil can be done unto them. Nobody thinks like that. Even when it's at your front door, you hold onto what hope is there and pray for the best.

We were able to make his home into a defensive perimeter, while doing the same in three other houses around it. We contacted each other every half an hour, while we occupied our minds telling stories and playing cards. Nobody could pay attention to the stories. Our eyes were anywhere but here. It was a desperate notion that we'd be able to see them and not be in danger. More than anything, we wondered if it would happen as easily as it had the night before. The demons would walk into our town, taking whatever they wanted and escaping into the night with their loot and almost no resistance.

A voice echoed from outside and everyone froze. We broke down and hid. They spoke, but used their guttural language. I asked what they said, but nobody knew. They claimed to have never heard the dialect and claimed that the person had to be from a foreign army. It wasnt English, that much I knew, but within their fragmented sentences I heard them grunting. Theyd hiss after some sentences. When the words they spoke were an affront to their beliefs they bit at each other and would snort to show disdain. 

They muttered these words that sounded familiar, because I'd been called the exact same thing. It took me a minute, but I realized they spoke the same words as the man who spit at me wet white dog. They were breathing me in and chasing down my scent. They said it over and over, as they circled the block, before coming right back. After a moment to be sure, the soldiers came to Yinzanis house and knocked on the door. 

Yinzani refused to answer. The soldiers knocked again. Khasir buckled and started towards the door, but everyone held him back. He thought twice and contained himself, pushing through the crowd and stepping to the back of the room. 

Yinzani, one of the soldiers said and then knocked on the door. He repeated the name with his voice getting deeper. 

Yinzani got up and, with a look of uncertainty, opened the door. Looking from a crowd of people thatd gathered in Yinzanis home, I saw five soldiers with the faces of disgusting mongrels. Their snouts had well-pronounced scars and bumps, as well as sores that glistened in a bright red that appeared ready to pop at any moment. Their eyes were sharp and fierce. They sniffed at the air and repeated the words, wet white dog, before ordering Yinzani out of the apartment and closing the door. 

They spoke for several minutes, before Yinzani returned. Everyone charged Yinzani and demanded that he tell them what they said. He said that they were the army of god and we had fifteen minutes to escape before they killed us all. He said they would honor their gods with our blood and burn our village to the ground. They offered no hope for sanctuary, as theirs was the wrath of god, which could not be denied. 

VII

After making this overwhelming announcement, Yinzani walked to his room. He couldve collapsed right there, as the certainty of his fate became all too clear. Everyone panicked and fled for their lives. Khasir and I followed Yinzani to his room. He stood at the window, staring over the city, which now sat in almost total darkness. The night sky was made all the more beautiful by the lack of electricity. Several of the buildings have some form of electricity, but the invaders must have disabled it moments before they assaulted our town. Shadowy figures stirred from the unassuming black that shrouded the desert in mystery. The rattling of their wooden canes echoed against the backdrop of stars, as they cackled like hyenas and invaded with every intention of erasing our existence from history. 

It took much more effort than it should to get Yinzani to abandon his home, but the sight of the dark figures creeping into the city was made all the more jarring by the rattling of their sticks twisting in the night. It drove us all a little crazy and made us wish to abandon everything we held sacred. We pulled Yinzani together and headed for the roof. We went from rooftop to rooftop for as long as we could, which brought us five houses down from where wed started. 

We stopped when we heard the rattles. They followed a simple rhythm, until they were close enough to attack, in which case they spun faster. It felt only natural to stop and listen, as the rattle hit a manic pitch and the beasts chomped down on an unsuspecting victim. Their cries resounded over the darkness. We covered our ears, but I'll never forget, as the nightmares from the desert hunted everyone like animals. 

We have to get out of town! Khasir ordered. We can't hide forever!

There was nowhere to go. We reached the end of the row of buildings, finding a door on the last roof. Khasir put his shoulder into it, but the door wouldnt budge. The wild beasts found the house and in no time were on the other side, hissing and chanting in their indecipherable language. They demanded the flesh of the wet white dog, as their maniacal laugher filled the air with a sense of inescapable defeat.

Yinzani made for the edge of the roof and told us to jump. I was the first to tell him that wouldnt be happening, but he didnt listen and made the leap. He landed with a painful thud and then tried to walk it off. In no time at all, the mongrels surrounded. They were a pack of wild dogs in military uniforms. They pounced on our friend and dragged him by his throat, eviscerating him in front of the building, as he screamed through the pain. He begged for god to end his life, as the soldiers ran on two feet and then, as they approached Yinzani, crept on all four limbs. They growled and feasted on his body, while we looked on.

I couldnt watch, but the sounds of their chewing, teeth ripping into sinew and then drinking, sucking down his blood, echoed over the cascade of houses. They broke down the door to the roof, cackling like hyenas and crying out for the wet white dog. We leapt like mad towards Yinzanis home, but could only make it two houses over, before they made a terrific leap and took out our legs. They tied us up and dragged us along the row of buildings, where we heard a rumor of the bloodshed. Our brethren cried out for mercy, pleading for a righteous god, not to put an end to their suffering, but to erase this plague of vile dog-men from the planet.

They allowed us to stare off into the black city, as it descended into obscene violence and died without even a whimper. After that, they took us away.

VIII

We awoke with cold water splashing over our faces, suspended upside-down with our hands tied behind our backs. They demanded we renounce our gods. I screamed for mercy and relinquished whatever beliefs I had. I believed in nothing most of my life, but I wouldve renounced the name of my father to escape. I heard the knife going into Khasir, but couldnt see, as the blade jabbed into his flesh over and over. The beast cackled and laughed in Khasir's face, as his life faded into oblivion. 

The dog-men kept repeating the words wet white dog, as they eviscerated Khasir and smeared his blood over their faces. They challenged each other with savagery, each seeming to enjoy the bloodshed more than the last. My heart skipped a beat. The weight of my skull was cumbersome, as the darkness entered my vision. It didnt take me, mind you, but offered an escape. I thought Id never wake up again, so I fought it. The mongrel twisted his face around so that we were at the same level. He repeated the term 'wet white dog', as they tore me from the restraints and took me away.

I awoke blindfolded in the back of a van. Nobody said anything. Twisting against the ropes holding my wrists did nothing to deter them. The car came to a stop and they took me out, dragged me to a building and tied me to a chair. I was bound and gagged and left in total darkness for about an hour, when I heard them return. They came down without a word, before undoing my restraints and removing the blindfold. 

The commander greeted me, along with a few other soldiers or at least mercenaries of one of the companies that worked in the area. They took me away and it was the last I saw of the monsters. They moved back into the shadows and, as the years go by my mind pushes them further away. The commander brought me to an undisclosed location far from the city. It was my assumption that I would never make it out of this place. 

They told me, quite to the contrary, that I could continue my work until its completion and the expiration of my work visa. I asked if anything like whatd happened would ever happen again. He looked to me with a smile and said, We cant make any such promise. 

What happened? 

He crept in closer. "Nothing happened. You're to remain and finish the rest of your work. End of discussion." His smile revealed too many teeth. 

I'm still not sure what happened. The thought that I might've been the reward of a bunch of 'military grade hunting dogs' crossed my mind. They were animals that saw me as something to hunt. They needed to find the 'wet white dog' so they could earn their reward. It's the only thing that makes sense, despite being impossible and insane. It's what we experienced. They loved to hunt and were loyal to the hand that fed them. They were given a task, sniff out the wet white dog and bring him to us'. Nothing about the city mattered to them, except for their prize, 'the wet white dog'. 

He told me the area wouldn't be the same that I'd known and warned me about returning. I knew what was coming. The war was only going to make things worse. There were no more sanctuary cities. We either ran for our lives or died like dogs. </TEXT>
