	<TEXT> Hey, i appreciate your response. [All of the passages are from this book](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up) and i posted the page numbers above.

  the Ahmaddiya movement is a sect of Islam

 why thank you

Yeah, i didn't know what to call it without offending anyone.

 It's fairly common knowledge that Satan loves bid'aa/innovation because it makes people do evil whilst deceiving themselves by thinking that they're actually doing good. With Trinitarian Christianity (the one referred to by the quote), this is also the case. 

I understand what your saying, but the "perfect manifestation of Satan"?  There are **many** religious groups that associate partners with Allah, some only worship the creation.   How are Christians the "perfect manifestation of Satan"? Especially when the Quran says: *"and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians."*

 Every single tafseer in history by every single scholar portrays surah al-Fatiha as specifically asking Allah (swt) to not let us go astray as the Jews and Christians did. To remain on "the straight path."

Exactly! Then why does Mirza Ghulam Ahmad say "prescribes supplication for refuge against the evil of the Christians."? -this is wrong.

 Since the dajjal is "human" in one sense or another, this is what this is referring to. The one that will peddle evil into the breasts of mankind from amongst other humans.

Okay, so what is the definition of "Dajjal" as you understand it? Because according to the context of the Surah along with your explanation, dajjal is referring to someone who encourages others to do wrong. This seems way to broad of a definition.

 And this is obviously true since Allah (swt) is Merciful, for example, and Muhammad (pbuh) was also merciful. Of course, their mercy is not comparable in quantity since Allah's (swt) Mercy is infinite

Agreed. However that's Not what the text implies. If your understanding of the text was correct, then the sentence: "They are demonstrated only by Prophets" indicates that only prophets can show mercy.  And this we know is not true.

 Christianity is the largest religion in the world and the strongest nation in the world is also predominantly Christian. It has been this way since the British empire, too.

Altough barely, yes, Christianity is the largest religion in the world.  But we live in a largely secular world today if you haven't noticed. The Bible hardly plays a role in the lives of many Christians, most don't even go to church every Sunday anymore. 
I would also like to know where the Quran says that Christians will dominate the Earth in the last days. And also your response to the other quotes.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [I am not trying to insult or attack anyone, i just have some questions.  I am asking here because i know there are several Ahmadi members who visit this subreddit and whenever i post on [r/ahmadiyya](http://www.reddit.com/r/ahmadiyya/), my comments keep getting removed.]

For those that don't know, the Ahmaddiya movement is a group that believes that a 19th century man from India named [Mirza Ghulam Ahmad](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirza_Ghulam_Ahmad) is the promised Messiah of Islam. Along with this, they hold onto several other beliefs that may be controversial to mainstream Muslims. 

I was encouraged to learn about their faith and go through some of their books, including one book called: ["The Essence of Islam" (Vol 3)](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up) by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad.  A good portion of the information appears to be regurgitated sufism, including some interesting passages that I don't have much knowledge about, but some passages were completely bizarre and stood out to me and I just don't understand how a prophet of God can say these things.  I would like to hear what the Ahmadiyya community thinks of the following passages:

 * **"As Christianity is the perfect manifestation of Satan" (p. 279)** -I understand Christians have different beliefs, but perfect manifestation of Satan??

 * **"Surah Al-Fatihah makes no mention of Dajjal, but prescribes supplication for refuge against the evil of the Christians." (p. 279)** -But surah Al-Fatiha doesn't do this at all. Al-Fatiha is asking to not follow the path of the believers of the past who went astray. 

 * **Regarding the last word of the Quran "the word Nas [People] refers to the Dajjal" (p. 286)** - I was really surprised at this, if An-Nas could mean dajjal, then what other words refer to Dajjal?

 * **"Divine attributes are eternal and ever-lasting. They are demonstrated only by Prophets." (p. 119)** -No, prophets are just human beings who are not eternal and are not comparable to Allah.

 * **"Women are the root of idol worship, for they are naturally devoted to decoration and ornaments. This is why idolatry started with women. They are also less courageous. Under the slightest stress of hardship, they begin to cringe before their fellow creatures" (p.324)** -Can someone please explain how idolatry started with women? I never heard this before.

 * **"Then He says that at the time of Dhulqarnain (Promised Messiah) all people will rise up in support of their own religion and will attack each other like the waves of the sea." (p. 301)** -But this didn't even come close to happening.

 * **"Women are influenced by their husbands. To the extent that a husband excels in piety and righteousness, his wife will also partake of it. Similarly, if the husband is wicked, the wife too will share his evil." (p. 324)** -This could sometimes happen, but isn't necessarily true.

 * **"The Holy Quran then specifies that in the latter days the Christians will dominate the earth, and they shall be the cause of all kinds of mischief running rampant." (p. 283)** -Where does the Quran say this? And i don't see how Christians are dominating the earth today.

 * **"I admit the possibility of another Messiah son of Mary coming after me" (p. 289)** -this seems contradictory to everything he mentioned before about himself being the promised Messiah.



Again I'm not trying to ridicule anyone, I am just asking Ahmadis how they deal with passages like these.   No, i didn't copy these from anti-ahmadiyya sites and please don't say "out of context" when the context clearly does not change the passage i have posted.  Thanks for any replies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the response. 

 It means this in the sense that it's the perfect manifestation of Satan, or Satanic influences, in that it misleads people in thinking that they're doing good things while doing bad things, which would be associating partners with Allah (swt.) This doesn't mean all Christianity is bad or that all Christianity is like this. It's just an indictment of the forms of it that do that.

My main problem is the wording "perfect manifestation". Yes they associate partners, but many other groups also associated partners. 
It's hard to believe a prophet would say that Christianity is the "perfect manifestation of Satan", especially when the Quran says: "and you will find the nearest of them in affection to the believers those who say, "We are Christians." That is because among them are priests and monks and because they are not arrogant."

 he is the mercy to mankind, after all.

Muhammad (pbuh) is **a** mercy to mankind. 

 No, you're wrong, yes it does: http://quran.com/1/6-7
 Almost every single tafsir in history interprets those two verses are a prayer to ask Allah (swt) to not let the Muslims go down the path of the Jews or Christians.

Your explanation is closer to the truth in that We are asking to not follow the path of the believers (of the past) who went astray.  However Mirza Ghulam ahmad's words saying that we are asking for "refuge against the evil of the Christians" is just plain wrong.

 The last two verses are talking about those who whisper evil into the breasts of mankind from among the jinn and mankind. The people who do that from among mankind would, of course, be the dajjal.

I understand Mirza Ghulam ahmad uses the word 'dajjal' very very loosely, but dajjal Does Not refer to all human beings who tell lies or all human beings who do evil. 

 Your denial of this part comes across as incredibly stupid and just grasping at straws, with respect.

I guess you believe that dajjal means any wrongdoer? Besides the believers who isn't a dajjal according to mirza ghulam ahmad? </TEXT>

So I've been continuing my research and going through the book: ["The essence of Islam".](http://www.alislam.org/library/browse/book/The_Essence_of_Islam/?p=3#page/279/mode/1up)  A good portion of the information in this book is already known to Sufi Muslims, including some interesting passages that I don't have much knowledge about, but some passages were completely bizarre and stood out to me and I just don't understand how a prophet of God can say these things.

	<TEXT>  The Qur'an itself mandates the mubahala and to invoke the "curse of Allah" on the liar.  

This is different to the instance mentioned in the Quran. Where both parties pray together and have the wrong one cursed. In other words, you can actually see a group being cursed or blessed while some or all of them are still alive. This does Not have a win-win nature to it.

 it could theoretically be convenient for him, but if you really think that, it means that you have no faith in Allah and His ability.

It's not theoretically convenient; it is convenient.  It's like a man betting money that he will stay alive for the next 3 years. He doesn't have to worry taking account for it.

 If a false prophet ever invoked Allah's name to spread his treachery and lies, Allah, the Only Power, would surely annihilate him and make an example of him very quickly

This is NOT true at all.  There have been numerous false prophets making prophecies of their own emerging from Muslim and Christian communities.   

 the 4th Caliph of the Movement), himself an incredibly awe-inspiring man, won a prayer duel and is recorded to have had a True Dream from Allah in which he correctly predicted that Zia would not escape his terrible death 5 days before it happened.

You do realize that dream interpretation (to understand the future) is well known throughout Islamic history?

 Communities founded by liars are not allowed by Allah to flourish in this manner. 

Again, this isn't true at all. I suggest you look into the history of various sects founded by false prophets.  Some of these false prophets gained a strong following, like the Mormons or the Nation of Islam.  [Here is a bunch of new religious movements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_new_religious_movements). Some of them are older and more popular than the ahmadiyya community. </TEXT>

I can see how such a duel would be convenient for a false prophet due to the win-win nature of such a challenge.

	<TEXT> The Quran speaks out against disobedient Jews, Christians and Muslims and favors obedient Jews, Christians and Muslims.  

Part of the wisdom why the tribe of Israel is criticized early in the Quran is because they resemble closest to the newly formed group of prophet Muhammad (pbuh) and so it is admonition for the new generation of believers.  

If any part of the Quran in particular appears strange or offensive to you in some way, please ask about it here. 

----------

Also bonus: take a look back at the 1st chapter. There are 3 groups of people mentioned: 

1) Those who are favored by God

2) Those who earned the wrath of God

3) Those who went astray

The Jews and Christians were favored in particular ways, but some Jews (who were disobedient) earned the wrath of God, while some Christians (who were disobedient) went astray (in their beliefs).  

We should all desire to be like the obedient believers of the past. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay fine, just show me where i can find a good amount of his sayings.  Any books he wrote? Any speeches?

 There is no clear description of what the Dajjal is.. what it looks like.. etc, you need to interpret the hadith in a manner that fits the current times.

So the definition of Dajjal changes overtime? Or is it only supposed to fit the 21st century?  So how do You understand who the Dajjal is. </TEXT>

3) what happened to Dajjal?

4) Do Ahmadis believe that there will be more prophets? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Throughout history most people didn't know or believe this, modern muslims and people on this sub have toned it down to "it's ok to be gay but not to do gay things"

I understand that you aren't Muslim but still lurk this sub, and that's fine, but please don't give wrong answers on this subreddit when people are genuinely asking about Islam. 

There is no proof whatsoever that having sexual desires for the same gender is a sin.  There has never been any proof for this historically either.

**A person is not to be blamed for his nature. Rather, he is to be blamed if he acts according to his nature. -Al-Junayd in Hilyat al-Awliya**

Yes, some Muslims lash out at people who have homosexual desires, but that is due to ignorance. Ignorance has always been there.  Our community needs to understand that No One is condemned to Hell simply because they have a desire that is not permissible to engage in.  In fact, all of us have desires that aren't permissible to engage in.

	<TEXT>  You would say that there is ultimately one GOD and we as Christians, Jews, Muslims just view that ONE GOD differently?

Yes. And not only the Abrahamic faiths, but other people throughout History, like those who question "Why am i here?", "What is the purpose of my life?" will sometimes recognize that there must exist a higher power, The Creator.  They may not use terms like God, Allah or Yahweh which are known to us.

Sorry, my intention was not to offend, i just wanted to clarify the differences.

 Can I ask what you thought of Reza Aslan's book?

Haven't read it. From what i have heard about him, it looks like he looks at religion from a historical-critical method rather than a more spiritual perspective which can be good sometimes regarding controversial topics.

	<TEXT>  The whirling dervishers are simply trying to enter a trance like state to get closer to God. Comparable to Native Americans use of a sweat lodge?

Yes from what i was told, they have different practices in attempts to get closer to God.

 The first time I heard of a Sufi was in the movie Jewel of the Nile. Are they seen as outsiders that are full of life and act like those guys?

I haven't seen the movie.  But Sufi's are sometimes compared to Christian Monks for their amount of devotional practices. Some Sufis are considered heretics for going too far over the top in their worshiping and inventing practices that are more detrimental than helpful. 

 By the way, I teach that today's radical Islamists have in many ways bastardized the religion for political purposes, just as has been done with Christianity in many instances. Sound legit?

Yes, there have definitely been certain segments of Muslims recently who have made political pushes. Sometimes for just reasons (for unity) or sometimes for satanic reasons (personal gain and power). 

Your questions are good, but i can only give brief answers due to my lack of knowledge, if you have any other questions, i would encourage you to ask at [r/islam](http://www.reddit.com/r/islam/)

And i don't know about the practices of Native Americans, although i did want to learn very much about their knowledge of the Creator or as they would say: The Great Spirit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, they seem to understand God differently.  Christians view God as a human figure. Muslims reject this and say that God cannot be compared to the creation, but may have been referred to as "the father" but not in a literal sense. Muslims obviously reject trinity and hold that God has no partners similar to Jews. 

Also today, I've noticed that some modern Christians seem more distant with their understanding of God, sometimes saying "god of the Bible".  I found this very strange, and i don't think Christian figures of the past like Thomas Aquinas held this kind of view.

 Yes, i'm a Muslim. </TEXT>

Regarding Kafir: it just means disbeliever.

 verses in the both the hadith and al Qur'an all extoll the virtues of genocide and exploitation propagated against religious minorities.

Which verse are you talking about?


 Look at the first page of any Pakistani passport (a casual perusal of Pakistani policies in and of themselves, which come from scripture are on indictment of Islam's treatment of minorities) would reveal that one is only eligible for a passport if they accept the shahadah and then, simultaneously, indict the Ahmadiyyas as nonbelievers.

Your going to die within a few years, as you already know, but perhaps have not truly comprehended that death is inevitable.  All human beings want happiness in this transitory life. This is what we all share.  We all pursue different means to this happiness and seem to come up short too often. 

Fapping, as you know, is very enjoyable, but only momentarily and is never fulfilling. man wants to live eternally, but very soon, without his leave, death arrives and puts an end to his life. He harbours an ocean of desires in his heart, but these desires are never fulfilled. He houses a life of dreams in his mind, but these dreams are never realized. 

What is the purpose of life, alternist? why do you exist?

With a better grasp of reality and understanding the eternal goal, you can break your 15 day mark very easily. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The video doesn't mean that all guys who are friends with girls are going to eventually have sex with them. 

But that eventually in a close guy-girl friend relationship, there is sexual tension from them having a similar relationship as a guy-guy or a girl-girl relationship. 

You may be an abnormal case, since your already have sexual relations with multiple women. 

Think about it. How come the American Army separates men and women?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you think this video is biased: check out the [other videos](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=women+men+friends oq=women+men+friends gs_l=youtube.3...0.0.0.186838.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0...0.0...1ac..11.youtube.) on YouTube about this topic.

Although there are some who say "yes they can be friends".  this appears to be the minority. and the people who have this minority opinion are not always talking about close friends.

And it's harder to come out and say "no they can't be friends", if they already have friends of the opposite gender. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure, the video is not talking about friends that you see like once a month, but about day-to-day friends. 

The fact is that men (most men at least) see women very differently then how women see men.

	<TEXT> Not to be rude, but that's pretty much what every lady who has an opposite gender friend thinks at first.  (until they end up being asked out on a date by their "friend" lol).  </TEXT>
