Hey r/AndroidGaming, I am an indie developer trying to make a living creating web and mobile games. I just released my latest game Hex FRVR to both Google Play and iTunes App Store. However due to Google's much better approval system it's already live on Android while I am still waiting for Apple...

Hex FRVR is a small hexagon puzzle game, where the goal is simply to survive as long as possible. I did my very best to make the game as polished and fun to play as possible.

I would really appreciate r/AndroidGaming feedback. I will stick around for the rest of today to answer any questions and collect feedback!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey puzzlers, I recently released my first game in quite a while. It's a simple solitaire game that can be played right in the browser on both web and mobile.

As of now the game only supports the very classical windows flip 3 game but I am looking to turn it into something better. 

**So what features is a most have and what would you like to see in a good Solitaire game?**

Play it here [http://solitaire.frvr.com/](http://solitaire.frvr.com/?rppz)

On a side note the game has now been live for a few days and my analytics show that only 3.7% of people who play wins a game. (Not for the lack of trying, they play 3.42 games on average). According to the [internet](http://webpages.charter.net/jstefan/solitaire.htm) the chance of winning is about 1 in 5.4 or 18.5%. 

With that in mind, I look very much forward to seeing how well this subreddit does. </TEXT>

So, what is your favorite experiane in the Bay Area? What is the one thing I absolutely should see/do/experience while here?

Edits: 

* I have a car, so getting around is not an issue. 
* Free experiences are welcome, but it's not a big problem if there is a fee.
