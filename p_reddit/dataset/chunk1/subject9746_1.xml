	<TEXT> When I was a sophomore in high school, school was not a priority for me. It seemed more important to fit in and goof off while putting my grades in the backseat. I started seeing a tutor, an old friend of my family's, and I realized that I fucked up pretty bad at this point because I was just wasting my potential. 

One night, he turned to me after I had this realization and said "Sometimes the only way to go up is to hit rock bottom." 

After hearing those words everything changed for the better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Something I catch myself doing a lot (because I try pretty hard to not look at my phone in public) is looking around and taking in my surroundings while simultaneously recalling quotes from different books that apply to this situation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cicadas..... When they all emerged in my hometown back in 2007 I had never really seen them. Well, when I saw the copious amount of cicadas that summer I was terrified of them. It's kind of bizarre because I'm not really scared of bugs either.  </TEXT>
