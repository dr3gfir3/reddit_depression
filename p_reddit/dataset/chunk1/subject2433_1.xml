	<TEXT> Thanks.

I also think I just don't like the way my life is going. Right now I'm on summer break, and because I made all my friends in college they live far away and I can't really see them much.

So basically everyday is spent mostly in my room, except for the hour or 2 I spend at the gym, or the days I have work, which is just me by myself in a small warehouse. So everyday feels like I'm not living life, and lonely. That's a big reason why I want people to like me too is so I have people to do awesome things with and its not so lonely and everyday not the same. And it also offers another reason for the jealousy too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks man, really appreciate it.

Have you also had experience with jealousy and friends? One thing that really got me down yesterday was when I stumbled across a photo of one of my friends having a great time on vacation somewhere. Not only was I jealous that he was having a good time, but I was extremely jealous that I couldn't go with. And I know this guy is a good friend as he has proved it many times

I just get so jealous when friends do awesome things without me, I get jealous that I miss out on those experiences. I even get jealous of random strangers which I see having a good time with other people.

Maybe this also ties into not liking being alone </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had a feeling I don't like myself, but I'm not really sure how to like myself or why I do t like myself. Maybe its because of my appearance, but losing weight and stuff takes time

I guess I just want friends and don't want to be lonely too, and I'm willing to do everything to do that, even change who I really am, for friends. Most of my summer has been spent by myself and I don't like it because I don't have any friends nearby and I'm lonely

Fear of rejection I guess, which is odd because I've been rejected before, and even hated, and I would think I would be used to it or something </TEXT>

	<TEXT> College right now. But I'm on summer break and lonely because I'm having trouble making friends at home. I never made any friends in highschool, and it was much easier to make friends in college because of clubs and stuff. my college friends also don't live nearby. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it possible to stop being introverted and turn into an extrovert? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I realized the reason I'm unhappy is because I don't spend much time with people. however I'm too introverted and anxious to make new friends. not only that, but from what I've been told being introverted in looked down upon in western society in my experience. not only that but everyone I've seen who is extroverted seems so happy and full of energy, and I wish I felt that way

has anyone been able to turn themselves around and stop being introverted? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> hi, Im posting this on a few subreddits because I really think this is the source of my problems. self-pity.

I recently then read something along the lines of misery is comfort, thought about it a bit, and felt maybe that's the way I feel.I pity myself. it seems to explain a lot of the way i feel in life, and how I act around my friends. it explains why I give up so easily and why it seems so hard for me to follow through with advice people give

I saw a link to a video on the wiki in the decidingtobebetter subreddit about someone talking about self pity, but unfortunately it did not say what to do about it. searching reddit did not come up with anything either

so what can be done about self pity? how do I stop it? how do I get out of this negative cycle? </TEXT>
