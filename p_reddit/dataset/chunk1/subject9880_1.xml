Also, no body = no murder. You should definitely go to the police, right now it's a missing persons case.

Also, there would be no contractual agreement that prevents you from uploading work that isn't suitable for use. You could even just upload the cropped image, showing only the demon. </TEXT>

However, it doesn't explain the creatures or how those bodies are still moving around after 100+ years.
The symbol in the room is also significant, was it a cult site or were there demons etc.
Regardless, it's not a good idea to go back there.

You could call the police, but if the military boarded it up you might just get in trouble.

Another thing, you run the risk of having disturbed whatever forces exist there. Because you've taken one of it's victims away. So be careful. </TEXT>

Like, we are free to pick and choose what to believe in. But you picked to harrass people on the street about their personal beliefs.

Also, god / the devil will know that you've only picked up the bible to try and save yourself. That is not true belief, and doesn't really help.
