I felt more pressure on my arms when holding the stand on those parallel bars. Although this guy wasn't successful, I've got to give props to the dude for trying, nonetheless. Even if you're performing an exercise incorrectly, it's good to film yourself, so you could see how you're messing up your form, and apply the appropriate corrections. One thing he could do is release one arm first, so he could drop towards the same side and land on his feet, while he's practicing this.  </TEXT>

In those memories we generate the ideas that will make us better at preventing some thing like this to happen again. Although it seems like a insurmountable task; we should never stop working to live better and safer lives. The human race has had to overcome seemingly overwhelming tasks, and eventually the chips have fallen into place, and we have survived and thrived. Sooner or later this issue will be resolved. 

Rest in Peace to all those lost, and don't let anybody steal your joy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With all due respect, Meepster23, I have not fabricated anything I've written. I told you, I have at times deleted my submissions to edit a title; and reposted it afterwards. However, I have never done it to circumvent your systems or for any other reasons that violate the r/videos or Reddit guidelines. 

And again, the only reason I created a new channel was because I want to start uploading my videos about my fictitious character that I've had in my hard drive and thought was funny. You could clearly see, the video is fictitious story about a guy who hogs up the TV and gets beat down by his kids for 18 months. I even titled the channel Couch Potato. Nothing in my original channel is fictitious; where do you see any reference to a couch potato in my original channel? I didn't do it to bypass any system; otherwise, I would have uploaded today's video to this other channel which didn't get removed. 

This is the first time a mod told me that my channel was not being accepted or "spammed," which I believe is incorrect because submissions to my channel constitute a very small proportion of the entire body of my Reddit submission history. So what's the motive behind me creating a channel to bypass the system?

The bottom line is that submissions to any of my channels (cross posted or not) constitute far less than 10 percent of my submissions to Reddit.com. So how am I not participating "beyond what is necessary?" Further, why is the gap so relevant? I have been very busy the past few years with work and have finally found time to do some of the things I like such as contributing to Reddit with content from all corners of the web, and sometimes uploading a video I do with the wife and kids. Look at how much time I have spent on Reddit submitting content from a WIDE variety of sources. I feel so satisfied that I am able to serve the people of Reddit with information that truly matters to our lives and the planet's progress; not only created by me but by the every other content creator I could find.

Again, I sincerely appreciate your responsiveness with this issue, Meepster23. Thank you for checking it out.

	<TEXT> Thank you for taking the time to review this issue, Meepster23.

I created that channel because there is a different theme to it. It was a crazy idea that I had about featuring the adventures of a couch potato. I didn't see it as being relevant to my primary channel (a channel I primarily use for the real adventures I go through with my family - Couch Potato is a fictitious character), which is why I published it on Couch Potato; I have more videos with that theme, I just haven't had time to upload them all. How am I gaming the system? Is it illegal or against the terms of service to have another YouTube channel? Further, I cross post multiple links most of which are not my own; and so do many Redditors. 

I have deleted submissions in the past because Reddit doesn't allow me to edit my titles; but I always repost the content with a corrected title. I even originally deleted this one because my title was grammatically incorrect, and I didn't want attention to be directed to that unimportant detail. Is deleting a submission such a crime or is it against the terms of service? If I am not allowed to delete submissions, why do we even get that option as users? Am I only supposed to delete a submission with moderator approval?

Thank you again for your time.

	<TEXT> I've heard of people going through that, but I'm not sure it would work for everybody. My brother-n-law and I went to this slide that explicitly required participants to be strong swimmers, for you would be diving into about 20 feet of water. My brother-n-law couldn't swim, and he told me he wasn't going. I told him to wait for me by the exit. I slide down, swim to the edge. 

As I'm walking to the exit, I hear whistles blowing and lifeguards diving into the water. My brother-n-law, probably feeling challenged that (a guy who's like 16 years older), got in the slide after he said he wouldn't. After frantically crashing his arms on the water and unable to get afloat, the lifeguards had to pull him out half-passed out. You could see his arms straightened and stiff as they draped his right armpit on a life preserver. He took a knee for a few minutes, spitting and blowing out water from his nostrils and mouth. Not sure if he would have made it, if they would have left him in there.  </TEXT>

When I got Robin Williams rider, I was very surprised by what I found, he writes. He actually had a requirement that, for every single event or film he did, the company hiring him also had to hire a certain number of homeless people and put them to work.

I never watched a Robin Williams movie the same way after that. Im sure that on his own time and with his own money, he was working with these people in need, but hed also decided to use his clout as an entertainer to make sure that production companies and event planners also learned the value of giving people a chance to work their way back.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DNA sense-and-respond protein modules for mammalian cells

We generated synthetic protein components that can detect specific DNA sequences and subsequently trigger a desired intracellular response. These modular sensors exploit the programmability of zinc-finger DNA recognition to drive the intein-mediated splicing of an artificial trans-activator that signals to a genetic circuit containing a given reporter or response gene. We used the sensors to mediate sequence recognitioninduced apoptosis as well as to detect and report a viral infection. This work establishes a synthetic biology framework for endowing mammalian cells with sentinel capabilities, which provides a programmable means to cull infected cells. It may also be used to identify positively transduced or transfected cells, isolate recipients of intentional genomic edits and increase the repertoire of inducible parts in synthetic biology.

	<TEXT> This day I had taken a job delivering produce in Long Island, and I saw the news broadcasting the smoke rising out of the hole in the first building that was hit in a pizza shop as I was delivering tomatoes. I told the pizza shop worker that it was probably an accident, and that it would be fixed right away. He told me that the reporters were already speculating that it was terrorism. 

Once I returned to the warehouse, the radio broadcaster said that the World Trade Center is no more, and that a plane crashed in the Pentagon and in Pennsylvania. The owner of the warehouse lent us a delivery van to drive back to Queens, for the train service was shut down, and I didn't bring my car. It took me and two or three fellow employees several hours to get to Queens (a ride which typically takes only 20 minutes or so). There was traffic on practically every street we drove on. People were driving up the opposite way out of the entrance ramp to exit the highway. Squad cars and ambulances struggled to make their way through bumper to bumper stuck traffic. 

Once I returned to Queens, I spoke to a few people in my old neighborhood on Jamaica, and traffic was just as bad. I walked home, about a mile away, showered and picked up my friends in my Mitsubishi. We drove straight to Brooklyn. We wanted to walk over the bridge to see what happened, but it was blocked. People were only allowed to exit. 

So from Dumbo, Brooklyn here are the images I managed to capture on the afternoon of September 11, 2001. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Prions are proteins that assume alternate shapes that become self-propagating, and while some prions perform normal physiological functions, others cause disease. Prions were discovered while studying the cause of rare neurodegenerative diseases of animals and humans called scrapie and CreutzfeldtJakob disease, respectively. We report here the discovery of -synuclein prions that cause a more common neurodegenerative disease in humans called multiple system atrophy (MSA). In contrast to MSA, brain extracts from Parkinsons disease (PD) patients were not transmissible to genetically engineered cells or mice, although much evidence argues that PD is also caused by -synuclein, suggesting that this strain (or variant) is different from those that cause MSA.

	<TEXT> Four years ago, Seitz and his then teammates at Real Salt Lake -- along with hundreds of others in the tightly-knit MLS family -- registered to become bone marrow donors. It was a show of solidarity for Salt Lake midfielder Andy Williams' wife, Marcia, who was battling a rare form of leukemia.

In the years since, Seitz would receive a monthly newsletter from DKMS, the bone marrow center where he registered, and would delete it. But this email was different. This email involved a total stranger who needed help.

The email had come from DKMS, the largest bone marrow donor center in the world.

The email explained that Seitz's name had appeared in the center's database as a potential match for a dying patient. It asked him to contact them as soon as possible if he wanted to help. 

In 2008, Seitz had been in his second year with Real Salt Lake when he watched the wife of popular teammate Andy Williams struggle with her own leukemia fight. The disease is the second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. Marcia was the reason Seitz had agreed to have one of his cheeks swabbed to join the registry. She was the reason he had once worn a faded green "Soccer Unites Utah" wristband.

Now he found himself on the phone with a DKMS representative, listening to the woman explain that, if he was interested, he might have the opportunity to help save someone like Uncle John or Marcia.

DKMS told Seitz that because of the type of cancer his recipient had, the less invasive donation procedure his dad went through wasn't an option. Instead, Seitz would require surgery in which doctors would poke two holes in his lower back, then fish 32 needles through each of those holes to remove fresh marrow from the core of Seitz's bones. Doctors would then inject that marrow into the recipient.

For an average 25-year-old, the procedure might mean a few days of discomfort and a week or two of decreased activity. For a professional goalkeeper, who makes a living diving on the exact bones where the marrow would be extracted, the situation was far more precarious.

As Seitz sat in recovery eating crushed ice and sipping apple juice, his nurses explained that everything had gone according to plan. The doctors had successfully poked the 64 holes in the bones in his lower back and harvested ample amounts of bone marrow to give to his recipient. Although the two incisions looked no larger than the tip of a pen cap, his body was exhausted. It was a struggle to move himself from the stretcher to a permanent hospital bed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By the summer of 1885 the Statue of Liberty was in New York in pieces, awaiting assembly.

Designed by French sculptor Frederic Auguste Bartholdi and paid for by the government of France, the statue was a diplomatic gift to the US. However, the US had been unable to raise $250,000 for a granite plinth for the statue - around $6.3m (4.1m) at today's prices.

A group called the American Committee of the Statue of Liberty was tasked with raising the money but fell short by more than a third.

New York Governor Grover Cleveland rejected the use of city funds to pay for 
it, and Congress could not agree on a funding package.

Amid the uncertainty, Baltimore, Boston, San Francisco and Philadelphia offered to pay for the pedestal in return for the statue's relocation.

It seemed as though New York had run out of options when renowned publisher Joseph Pulitzer decided to launch a fundraising campaign in his newspaper The New York World.

Image of the Statue of Liberty printed in The New York World newspaper
The campaign was given front-page treatment in The World

The campaign eventually raised money from more than 160,000 donors, including young children, businessmen, street cleaners and politicians, with more than three-quarters of the donations amounting to less than a dollar.

It was a triumphant rescue effort: in just five months The World raised $101,091 - enough to cover the last $100,000 to complete the pedestal and have money leftover for a gift for the sculptor

A successful crowdfunding campaign before the term was coined.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  My uncle and I built a kite on which Reddit's Snoo finally flew. Here's the story. When I was about 7 or 8 years old, my mother bought me a kite from a supermarket for a couple of bucks. I didn't know how to fly it that well, and it got caught up with something and ripped. My grandfather had just immigrated from Colombia, where building and flying kites is like learning to ride a bike: everybody does it. He patched up the kite, and flew it so high that I could barely see it; he used up all of the line to which it was attached. 

His son, my uncle, and I built a few kites almost 20 years ago; the last one we built was shaped into a Mickey Mouse. It was too heavy and did not fly. We took it apart and pasted Mickey flat on the kite. That one flew. This year we built one with Reddit's Snoo pasted on it and got a license from Reddit to use it. We ran into some issues making it fly, but we finally got it up. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thousands of Facebook users banded together in recent weeks to hijack a contest in which the grand prize was a live concert by the Grammy-winning country singer.

 But with the fix appearing to be in, contest organizers eventually removed Horace Mann from consideration.

While Taylor Swift wont be playing a concert there, the singer has offered to personally donate $10,000 to the school  a donation which was quickly matched by contest sponsors Papa Johns and Chegg, a textbook company. American Greetings and Cover Girl got in on the act, upping the schools windfall to $50,000; VH1s Save the Music program added an additional $10,000 worth of instruments.

For those students disappointed they wont get a Swift concert at their campus, Taylor has offered free tickets to any Horace Mann student for her next Boston concert. </TEXT>

 In 1888 alternating current systems gained further viability with introduction of a functional AC motor, something these systems had lacked up till then. The design, an induction motor, was independently invented by Galileo Ferraris and Nikola Tesla (with Tesla's design being licensed by Westinghouse in the US). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  However, in most instances, the machines appeared to have been able to distinguish the fake bills from the real ones, and separate them. A Chase bank official said that the canisters designed to snare bogus bills for this purpose in the A.T.M.s were full of them.

Shouldn't the ATM's shut themselves down when they are unable to identify any more fake bills? Good thing these were bad counterfeits. 

 The bills were made from ordinary paper stock and were blank on one side.

Otherwise, they may have walked away with the fakes and put them into circulation or encountered problems trying to change the money for real bills.

It's funny, sometimes I question whether to count my money before I leave an ATM. What makes me do it, nonetheless, is that I used to work at a bank, and every once in a while people would step to the teller complaining that the ATM dispensed the wrong amount of money.

I told him that there's a guy named Clinton who's running for the following reasons. And he laughed. Right now, I'm very concernedWomen would not want to be involved for you. Hispanics, majority of them do not want to vote for you.


Wasn't this audience member questioning the idea of supporting Romney because women and Hispanics don't support him? Wouldn't the audience member or any practical business person for that matter think that a Romney contribution be a bad investment if this was so? Read on...


Romney's remarks after the response in the article:
 We have some greatwe have some great Hispanic leaders in our party who will help communicate what our party stands for, and what I think, frankly, what I need you to do is to raise millions of dollars...


Isn't Romney trying to convince the audience members that he is aligned with Hispanic GOP leaders who will better identify with Hispanics and communicate the *existing* GOP platform? He wants money by any means. Where does he allude to lack of change to the platform as the national threat? 


Further, why do the leaders have to be Hispanic? Shouldn't the GOP platform stand on it's own merits without having be be communicated by a member of the Hispanic community to cater to Hispanics? Doesn't this logic show that he theorizes that he can get the Hispanic vote by showing off his "Hispanic leaders?" Does he think that that the audience members share his belief that the reason that Blacks and Hispanics don't identify with him is because he is white? He doesn't give one specific reason why Hispanics or blacks should support him other than saying he'll get their vote by showing off his ethnic allies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If 85%+ Hispanics vote for Democrats, wouldn't that persuade the GOP to structure their platform in a way that better addresses this community's needs and the country's as a whole? If the GOP restructure their platform to cater to what is the fastest growing population in the country, then wouldn't the Democrats also be forced to do a better job campaigning and running this country? How would this outcome be a threat to the nation? 

It's kind of like saying, if Usain Bolt keeps beating our runners in the Olympics, that's a threat to the nation. No! It forces United States runners to get faster, and beat or get closer to beating him.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How is it bad for the country if certain communities vote for the party and candidate that addresses their issues? This is a free democracy. The whole point of voting is to support positions for which you stand. The idea is to elect leadership that will institute policy that can *help* solve your problems. If members of your community voted for the GOP because they clearly addressed the issues of your community, and you shared your community's views, would you vote for Democrats just so you could give the other candidate an unmerited chance of winning? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many African Americans and Hispanics are committed to the Democrats because Democrats address the issues involving those communities, like Obama's support of the Dream Act. Romney clearly stated that he would veto the Dream Act if he were president, while stating that he would offer the same provisions, such as permanent residency to illegal immigrants who honorably served in the military. Would Romney veto the Dream Act just because the Democratic nominee supports it?

How is it a threat to a nation if minority communities are voting for the party that addresses their issues? Would you vote for somebody if they stand against what you believe, just so you could give the other guy an unmerited chance? 

Democratic leadership is not uncontested. Obama didn't win and will not win 100% of the vote. He won and will win because a majority of the country thinks that he is the best man for the job. Romney and the GOP have brought this on themselves.  </TEXT>

When you get the list, you find out that you need a composition book. Or if you buy a college ruled composition book, there were times when you needed a wide-ruled composition book, so the teacher didn't have to strain his eyes. There are countless more examples that I could cite.

As noted previously, your best bet is not to guess what supplies you need. Grab a small note pad and a pencil for your first day; then either write down what you need or wait for a list of required supplies or syllabus.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i'm not sure if that has to do with matriarchal vs. patriarchal business models; however, what I can write is that Latin American countries, in some cases provide more off days than the U.S. Some employees get a few days off for festivities during carnivals. There is also a holy week that allows for days off or early dismissals for some. For instance, in the Colombian city of Barranquilla, the day after the city's soccer team won the national championship, they declared the day a citywide holiday, and many people were given the day off. Almost the same level of leave was afforded when one of their biggest singers died last year.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> indeed; however, I'm not sure Batman could actually win that match; at least not in a hand-to-hand engagement. Captain America was injected with Super Serum, which made him a baby Hulk. Batman would have had to pull some serious strength debilitating biological warfare out of his utility belt to counteract the serum. Unless that's was the filmmaker's intent when Batman let loose that plume of smoke.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Limited down to both of your choices, I think the hatred of losing is more powerful. The desire to overcome fear, nonetheless, is a powerful driving force. You can say that I don't want fear to conquer me; and that's another way of avoiding a loss; so I still agree with you. And you're right; sometimes a win is like "woo hoo," without the exclamation; and we're out on the hunt for the next win. 

But it does feel good to win! My eyes well up with tears sometimes when a win is hard fought or a long time in the making. So it's hard to say.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> maybe it was the time when that Brazilian stripper i picked up (no, i didn't pay her) in miami was undulating her torso and grinding her vagina against my groin while my penis was in her. I could typically hold my ejaculation well when a woman rode me. however, she was better than any body with whom I had been. She reached behind her butt and gently massaged my scrotum as she rode. That did it for me. I got that quick ticklish feeling rise up my penis prior to ejac, and, at age 21 or 22, I didn't know every one of my holding tricks I know now, so I splashed. I've had a few more nice ones; like this girl that made me shake performing oral on her futon; and another who bought me a sausage and pepper hero and went down on me in the bathroom before many reps of behind the back standing thrusting in the shower. I think I enjoyed a few favorites.  </TEXT>

"a study conducted by the University of New York in Albany reported that semen acts as a natural antidepressant (for both men and women). The semen acts like an injection of antidepressant that gets absorbed by the vaginal tissue and goes directly into the bloodstream, thus reducing depression. Semen may also lower blood pressure in women."
