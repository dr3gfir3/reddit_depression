	<TEXT> Okay, but I'm from south Texas and you'd be surprised on the variations you hear. Some swear on marinating in lime juice overnight, while others hit it with lime after grilling and let it sit. I get it, you're from Washington and you know what asada translates to in English. Congrats! I asked for the recipe because it looked homemade.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The .243 is great all around gun, and especially forgiving of beginners. There is low recoil, but just as much "oomph" and knock-down power to handle almost all North-American game including deer, pigs, varmints, and anything in between. Unless you are in the Canadian/Alaskan bush chasing predators such as bears, or hunting elk, the .243 is a great gun. I recommend a single shot by a reputable brand like CVA with bull barrel that has been shortened for youth.  </TEXT>
