	<TEXT> I struggle with this. To me, "I" am my subjective consciousness. "I" am the thing that is aware of being aware. If the thing that is reincarnated is not aware of being reincarnated (has no memories of being me), how is it me?

Or to put it another way, identity is not the same thing as material. The recycled toilet paper I used just now is not the Complete Works of Shakespeare in which the fibres were previously a component. </TEXT>

b) IMHO, "loopholes" in religious law - or, more accurately, looking for them and then exploiting them - kind of make a mockery of the whole thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a newbie to SGI too - about six months of practicing - and its good to hear someone else has the same reservations that I do. The person who introduced me took me to visit SGI UK headquarters at Taplow recently and, while everyone I met there was very nice, I couldn't help but find it a little "cultish" and therefore unsettling.

Perhaps I should expand. I'm a former Christian with a degree in Biblical Studies who toured with a Christian rock band in my youth. I really walked the walk. About fourteen years ago I lost my faith and became an atheist, but I still respect others' right to practice religion as they see fit; I'm just not in the market for a new religion myself. I find the practice of Nichiren Buddhism has very tangible benefits for me, some of which I can find rational reasons for, some of which I am currently filing under "selection bias" or in some cases "beyond me right now but I can see myself reaching a point where I understand it". The doctrine that I find irrational or superstitious, I file under "well you're free to believe that, but it's not for me." I'm open to there being a "yet" on the end of that.

But having been brought up a Methodist, I have a very highly attuned cult detection faculty (it's a big part of Methodism). When people tell me to think, believe or do something and worry about understanding it later, I smile, nod politely, and back off. This skepticism is maybe counter-productive in some cases - for example, I refused to chant until I understood in English what I was being encouraged to repeat, and even something as basic as the "nam" part of "nam myoho renge kyo" wasn't something I was comfortable with in my first meeting - in the same way I don't sing hymns or recite the prayers when I attend a Christian wedding for example.

My take on this is that I am on my own personal journey. The sutras and other teachings - and the insight of my friends in my local district - represent a fabulous wealth of wisdom for me to draw on, but they have no meaning for me until I can internalise and understand. I recognise that my understanding will grow with time, and my attitude to particular aspects might even reverse completely - like my attitude to the central doctrines of Christianity did. But for now, I don't internalise what I see as some of the more superstitious aspects. I am very grateful that in my local district I feel very free to do that and to discuss it openly - the polar opposite of my experience as a Christian.

So I think the bottom line is that I identify as a Buddhist on the basis that I am practicing Buddhism, not because I am a member of an organisation. I certainly don't accept any responsibility for, or identification with, ALL of Buddhism. And I don't share many of the views of some of my Buddhist friends.

Perhaps it is relevant that I haven't so far felt ready to accept the Gohonzon, so maybe I'm just a "tourist" or not "really" a Buddhist at all in some people's eyes. But again, there's probably a "yet" on there. I'm cool with that and in my district they are too. But at SGI Taplow and with the quite zealous lady that first introduced me... well I didn't feel that expressing my reservations would be accepted quite so readily. My reaction to that is, "whatever" and a shrug. Maybe some would argue that I'm holding myself back on the path to enlightenment, but it's a journey not a destination and I'm in no hurry.

Anyway, I hope you continue to find benefit from your practice and I hope you can feel free to reject or at least not identify with what doesn't resonate for you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to derail this too much, but I kind of like the psychedelic crap. It's a visual metaphor. How else to convey to the average audience what's going on?

	<TEXT> That makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. You're confusing producers and consumers. Producers aren't freetards; consumers who believe they have a right to consume the product of other people while denying those people the right to make a living are freetards. 

Many people choose to give their work away for free, and that's great. But it's their choice to give it to you without expecting anything in return.  You have no right to take something that is not offered to you free. How dare you make that decision for someone else?

If you choose to live outside the monetary system, then good for you. But if you think you can take my work - which I put my heart, soul, blood, sweat and tears into - and then tell me that I have no right to expect you to pay for it  just because it happens to be digitally transmitted ... well that's not a moral position. That's bullshit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you honestly believe that everything that can be digitally communicated is nothing more than "information" and that "information" should not have a price, then go ahead and spend your entire career - 80 hours a week plus, for the rest of your life - creating content and giving it away for free. I'm not talking about Creative Commons, I mean literally giving it away for free and refusing all donations or offers of tangible support. Then I'll listen to you. 

I'll listen politely when you talk about the value of art being zero and how all creators should be destitute and penniless. And then I will laugh in your face.

But I bet you're not doing that. You're just bleating about having to pay for your video games, music and movies, and that makes you a freetard. And as we all know, freetards fuck it up for the rest of us.

The ONLY moral position on this issue in a society based on exchange is very simple: IF YOU ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY THE PRICE ASKED, DO NOT CONSUME THE PRODUCT. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hard sci-fi, as in being largely about the science? Try "Primer" and "The Andromeda Strain".

"Contact" deals with alien contact from first principles, but ends up being largely about Jodie Foster reconciling with her dad.

"Red Planet" and "Mission to Mars" deal with space flight in a semi-realistic fashion. So does "Sunshine". If you have any interest in philosophy or religion, watch "Sunshine" as an exploration of Spiritual Atheism vs. hardcore Monotheism.

And then there's the grand-daddy. 2001. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Monsters (2010) . Don't be misled by the title or the marketing. It's a very smart movie about human relationships against a background of alien creatures in the Mexican jungle.
Primer (2004). A very cerebral film about a tech startup in a guy's garage that stumbles on something extraordinary and trippy.
Ink (2009). More fantasy than sci-fi, but one of the most visually creative films I've ever seen. I bet you you'll live it if you loved Moon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where it takes place matters not at all. I did my dissertation on "The role of memory in Psycho and The Shining" and my thesis on "Narrative Analysis and Auteur Theory applied to the Alien Trilogy" (peaked to soon - this was pre- Alien Resurrection and I've got a feeling Prometheus might change my conclusions) at Sheffield University, if that means anything to you.

I agree that there are some thematic (eg. sublimation of sexuality, and rape) and even structural similarities between Alien and Psycho, but no more than between Alien and, say, Home Alone. And to call that a "reference" or a "subtle connection" is, IMHO, unjustified.

If you are interested in close-reading Alien, a good place to start is "Alien Zone: Cultural Theory and Contemporary Science Fiction Cinema" ed. Kuhn, Annette; Verso, 1990. I don't have a copy to hand so I can't give you specific essay titles. There's also "Working Girls: Gender and Sexuality in Popular Cinema" Tasker, Yvonne; Routledge, 1998 and "Spectacular Bodies: Gender, Genre and the Action Cinema" Tasker, Yvonne; Routledge, 1993. I'm not such an expert on Psycho, but I'm sure you can find relevant material in any good analysis of Hitchcock. Your library will be able to help.

Anyway, good luck with your course, sincerely. Unless you're recalling from a while ago, in which case, hope it went well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mmmmmmm, no.  The Alien is faceless (the lack of eyes forces us to look it in the teeth) and is a force of Nature, yes; but Norman Bates is a sick young man and in the final shot, a victim who wears his mother's face. The crew of the Nostromo are motivated by survival; Arbogast et al are motivated by solving the mystery and finding the missing girl. Alien uses a mix of cinema verite  (unscripted dialogue etc) and B-movie (cat-scare) techniques; Psycho uses noire (lighting/cinematography and detective tropes) and pure Hitchcockian ones (eg. the red-herring of the stolen money, shadowing in the shots of taxidermy etc). There is a Freudian aspect to both, but it is body-horror fear of (male) rape and impregnation in Alien and some form of Oedipal arrested development in Psycho.

I suppose you could argue that they're are both Haunted House narratives, but that's more a common genre than any direct connection. </TEXT>
