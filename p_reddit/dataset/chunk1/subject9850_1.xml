	<TEXT> "The American record is particularly disgraceful. Senior officials of the Clinton administration on background even bad-mouthed the Chechens and made elaborate excuses for their Russian killers.

Some spun an elaborate theory of justification, comparing the Russian genocide of the Chechens to the American civil war - ignoring the fact that a civil war is fought by people of the same nation whereas the Chechens are not Russians and Chechnya is not Russia. Even President Clinton was brainwashed into mouthing similarly inappropriate excuses for Mr. Yeltsin and his fellow killers." </TEXT>

So for 90-99% of visitors it is not a problem.  And that 1-10% advanced users of that advanced privacy list has probably already become accustomed to this issue, so they know how to turn this filter off for a specific website if they want to do so. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks good, thanks. Your script makes this screenshot for an logged in user, and the web service - makes one "universal" screenshot for everyone.
BTW, this is the main advantage of desktop screenshot tools compared to online tools.

Here is the reason why online screenshot tools not allowed to log in to parse such content - it is mostly because of legal issues: https://www.reddit.com/r/ShrinkTheWeb/comments/4dc9dc/is_it_legal_to_display_screenshots_of_web_pages/

	<TEXT> Chair of the U.S. Commission, Jesuit Father Thomas Reese, said: "Neither these measures nor the currently existing anti-extremism law meet international human rights and religious freedom standards."

When asked how such an extreme law could emerge in the 21st century, Boyd replied: "This law is an attempt to prevent radicalization within homes and the spread of extremism," but, he explained, the law essentially equates religion to extremism and religious people to terrorists.

Boyd seemed hopeful that there is action that can be undertaken to overturn this new law, but warned against the "Bigger concern" which is the mood in Russia from which a law like this was able to arise. </TEXT>

The footage can be seen as a group of about 25-30 people, a large part of them - the children, literally crawling in mud and water on the river bank. It should be noted that the air temperature in Surgut on this day was +5 degrees. It is obvious that many participants "March - throw" what is happening is clearly not a pleasure. Behind the scenes distinctly heard children crying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regarding the first question:
Section 80 says:
"audio recording medium for **the private use** of the person who makes the copy does not constitute an infringement" So it all depends on the purposes which this copy will be used for.

Regarding the second question:
Section 29 says:
"Fair dealing for the purpose of research, private study, education, **parody or satire** does not infringe copyright"
So Canada, as well as the United States considers parody as "fair dealing" (~"fair use").

This picture is 100% parody. I do not know about the specific lawsuits in Canada but in the US a parody - it is one of the most winning tactics to prove that the defendant's content actually corresponds to "fair use" and does not violate plaintiff's copyright, the most typical example is Campbell vs Acuff-Rose case

By RACHEL EMMA SILVERMAN March 15, 2015 5:55 p.m. ET

A pair of court rulings involving Lyft Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. may have far-reaching consequences for the ride-sharing firms, and may help to bring clarity to a murky but increasingly important area of employment law.
Two San Francisco judges separately ruled last week that suits filed by drivers of the ride-sharing services should go before juries. At issue in both cases is whether drivers, who are employed as independent contractors, should be considered employees of those firms, and thus entitled to the protections afforded most full-time workers.

A verdict that required Lyft or Uber to reclassify their drivers as employees would throw a wrench in business models that have commanded large investments and valuations. Last week, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten led a $ 530 million round of funding for Lyft, helping to boost its valuation to more than $ 2.5 billion. Uber, which is much larger, has raised more than $ 5 billion in funding and is valued at more than $ 41 billion.

Should the cases proceed to trial, the resulting verdicts could also set a legal precedent about how many workers should be classified in the so-called on-demand economy. That could come as welcome news for employment lawyers and others charged with figuring out whether the workers who fulfill Instacart orders, drive UberX passengers, clean homes for Handy clients and perform other tasks assigned by apps should be considered independent contractors or actual employees.

Plaintiffs in both cases argue that drivers should be considered employees, not independents, and should thereby be protected by the same wage and labor rules as employees. The drivers also argue that they should be reimbursed for expenses such as gas and car maintenance that they currently pay out of pocket.

The plaintiffs suing Uber say they should be treated as employees because the company allegedly exerts significant control over their work, sets compensation and vehicle standards, and can terminate drivers at will. As part of the case, Uber was forced to release a series of internal emails on driver termination to the court, showing that drivers could be "deactivated" for passenger ratings that fall below 4.5 on a five-point scale.

In the Uber case, heard in San Francisco, US District Judge Edward Chen denied the company's motion for summary judgment, concluding that the plaintiffs "perform services for the benefit of Uber," and that the question of their employment status "presents a mixed question of law and fact that must typically be resolved by a jury."

Similarly, in the courtroom next door to Judge Chen's, US District Judge Vince Chhabria, presiding over the Lyft case, ruled that because California's "outmoded" test for classifying workers "provides nothing remotely close to a clear answer, it will often be for juries to decide." </TEXT>

A pair of court rulings involving Lyft Inc. and Uber Technologies Inc. may have far-reaching consequences for the ride-sharing firms, and may help to bring clarity to a murky but increasingly important area of employment law.

Two San Francisco judges separately ruled last week that suits filed by drivers of the ride-sharing services should go before juries. At issue in both cases is whether drivers, who are employed as independent contractors, should be considered employees of those firms, and thus entitled to the protections afforded most full-time workers.

A verdict that required Lyft or Uber to reclassify their drivers as employees would throw a wrench in business models that have commanded large investments and valuations. Last week, Japanese e-commerce giant Rakuten led a $ 530 million round of funding for Lyft, helping to boost its valuation to more than $ 2.5 billion. Uber, which is much larger, has raised more than $ 5 billion in funding and is valued at more than $ 41 billion.

Should the cases proceed to trial, the resulting verdicts could also set a legal precedent about how many workers should be classified in the so-called on-demand economy.
