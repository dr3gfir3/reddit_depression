	<TEXT> Where do I even begin?
Firstly: Thank god, reddit truly has something for everyone. I almost jumped up and down when I saw there was an AC subreddit. 

This is going to get SUPER sappy, and most of you ACI kids probably don't give a f*** about what I'm going to talk about, but some of you old aces will know exactly my feels.

My parents bought me a Playstation when I was 6. It was the first really nice thing I ever had. My dad picked out the games, so naturally he bought stuff based on the things that I loved: NASCAR and airplanes. NASCAR 99 was my first foray into the EA s***show and never was much more fun than driving the wrong way around the track and smashing into other cars head on. 
The airplane game, however, turned out to probably be the best thing my Dad has ever done for me. It was Ace Combat 2. He probably went to a game store and asked the guy at the counter, "what's the best airplane game you've got?", and walked out with AC2 in hand. 
I remember having absolutely no idea what to do when I first played it because I didn't read the instruction manual, and there was no tutorial phase; the game just dumped you into GAMB IT and said "hey, see those bombers? yeah, shoot those". But holy hell did it feel amazing the first time I figured out how to catch up, lock on to, and nail that first B-52. And then the word BINGO flashed across the screen and I was hooked from then on. 
I remember when the first named ace popped up in the game and my 6 year old brain thinking "why is that one different?". I think right then was when I developed my desire for games to be deeper than just pressing X or A and seeing bright flashing lights on the screen. 

Jump forward 4 years and I'm 10 getting AC4 for Christmas. I didn't get a real chance to experience Electrosphere because the US release was absolutely dumbed down to the point of vomit, like we all know, and I think I demo'd it at Blockbuster (if you know what that is, congrats, we're old) and was not impressed. 
But yeah, AC4 gets popped in and, again, holy hell there's a story now? A narrator experiencing all this action from below and making it a real, human tale of survival and growth? The game itself also probably spawned my preference for games with a lot of communication; all the radio chatter, briefings, and narration really made it more of an interactive movie than a game, at least to me. 

Then there's AC5: the game that ruined all other games for me.

I guess 5 came out like 3 years after 4 and I think in that interim period I sort of, again, lost interest in the series, although I played 4 regularly with my older brother when my parents would let me stay at his house. I think the first time I saw that 5 was coming out was probably in some sort of gaming magazine, and it had a website link to the official game site. Once I saw there was another AC game coming out AND that it had a Tomcat on the cover art, I probably checked the website every day to find out the release date and if they'd post any pictures of game content or whatever. 

The weekend it came out, I walked 3 and a half miles from my house to gamestop to go buy the game. I got home, put it in tray of the PS2, and was promptly spoiled to the point of ruination by easily the best game ever produced for that console. Forgive my fan-boying here, but what other flight-based, large-scale war game can, at once, tell a story that is equal parts dramatic, intriguing, fascinating, and engaging, AND be backed up by state-of-the-art game play and graphics. Not only that, but the campaign was easily the longest I'd played of ANY game (and I survived the original Spyro) thus far in my gaming experience. 
The campaign is almost 30 missions right? I think the other AC games up to that point (US only) had probably had a max of 16-20, so AC5 definitely felt like a damn saga. Plus the CG animation and all that made it pretty cool. To this day, I still feel like a badass when people ask me to do something and I reply with, "Sure thing" in that sly, I-know-something-you-don't 8492 way. 

All that, and then they paint the damn airplanes black and start calling you a ghost and suddenly you're the hottest thing with two wings. 

Throughout all this, I never met a single person who played the games, much less anybody who enjoyed them as much as I did. Up until about 2 years ago, I was firmly convinced that I was probably one of only a VERY few people who dove into the AC world the way I had. 

I don't remember buying ACZ, but it was equally engaging and is most likely the reason why I enjoy documentary-based war stories. To me, there is nothing better than a story told from the perspective of those who were there. 
ACZ introduced me to the idea that war isn't this glorious thing. I guess at that time the US was pretty caught up in all the Iraq stuff and I think I learned the lesson that the guys in the pilot seats, and the guys behind all those big guns weren't necessarily super excited to have to do that kind of job. ACZ was short, but I think the World With No Boundaries thing really proved a big point in the series and in real life as well, at least for me. 

By the way, Galm 1 is the baddest dude to ever fly the StrangeReal skies. You're free to believe what you want though, as to who's the best. Just remember the plaque for the alternates is in the ladies' room. 

AC6 was a blessing in disguise at a point where the Xbox 360 almost became a bookend. It is SERIOUSLY inferior to the other games, but 
I was very glad to see a next gen console installment of my favorite series. Even to this day I'm not sure I've ever fully sat through the horrifically boring cutscenes in 6, but the gameplay was always a lot of fun and it's the easiest game I've ever gotten 100% completion on. Plus, that almost inaudible tidbit of enemy chatter during Chandelier- you know the one..."Galm 1, shoot down the enemy ace..."- just cements my opinion of this series being the best EVER. I mean you don't even see him- there's not a Strike Eagle-C to be found on that map- but damn if hearing that name didn't make you go, "Oh s***, not him!". And all of that because some writer somewhere at Namco had the brilliant insight to write in one little snippet of easter egg dialogue. 

I bought AH because I was under the impression that it would be like any other game in the series. Boy was I wrong about that. Won't even go into how disappointing it is to see Strangereal thrown by the wayside in favor of marketing the game to CoD and BF audiences who will never fully appreciate the original series games. 


As for ACI, I can't stay connected to the game for more than about 10 minutes and it seems to be overrun with high level users who hang out in low level matches and just wreck dick on everyone. Makes it really un-fun. Plus, free-to-play, shouldn't mean that you have to pay to be able to enjoy the game. That's a whole other can of beans though. 

I guess what I'm saying is, thank you to the people who created this game series and thanks to all those Aces out there who taught me what it means to truly love something. 

I stand by what Project Aces says about these games:

	<TEXT> I remember when AC5 came out in '04. I was in 7th grade and waited all summer for the game to come out after having waited 4 years since AC4. 
Shattered Skies was SO great, especially since I had played the mostly-silent AC2 and not been able to play (or even understand) the foreign version of AC3. When AC5 was announced and the release date revealed, I probably checked the game website every day to see new pictures and game content; It was the first thing I ever fully "nerded out" over. Plus, I grew up on Top Gun and when I saw the cover art was a Tomcat with a carrier and an exploding ship behind it, well, shit, that did it for me.
The day the game released was in the middle of the week so I had to wait til the weekend, and when saturday rolled around I walked like 3 and a half miles to gamestop to go buy it. 
Playing it was THE MOST fulfilling thing I'd ever experienced. Not only was it a huge step up in gameplay with new features and graphics, but it was LONG; the campaign is almost 30 missions right? AC5 was my first ever truly satisfying gaming experience and it absolutely spoiled me with so many things: depth of universe, diversity of storytelling, imagination, etc. 
I am SO glad to have been a fan of this franchise for the past 20 years.

	<TEXT> Whoever you are, I want more of the stories you're telling. I don't think I've met anyone thus far in my life who seems to have the same predilection toward getting TOTALLY immersed in these games. I've been playing this series since I was 6 years old; I'm 24 now and still get the same satisfaction and pride out of assuming the roles of each protagonist. I've lived whole lives through these games that I'll never even begin to replicate in the real world. It pains me deeply that Namco/Bandai chose to move away from StrangeReal in favor of capturing the CoD/BF audiences' attention, and I sincerely hope that some programmer, somewhere deep within the bowels of Namco, steps up to his bosses and asks to resurrect the world I loved so much. 
For me, Ace Combat is it, and fully lives up to the Project Aces moniker: Nothing Else Comes Close.  </TEXT>

****

I ran.

I dropped my car keys and ran.

Theres a lot to be said for the strength of the flight option when faced with a fight/flight scenario; I dont think Ive ever run so fast in my life.

Wheeling on the spot, I booked it out of the church parking lot and into the dark two lane street. There wasnt a light, a car, a person, to be seen or heard in any direction. As fast as my feet and adrenaline could carry me, I pounded ground in the direction of home. Logic now screams at me that I probably couldnt have been safe from this thing anywhere that I went, but at the time home seemed the most safe and secure locale I could think of.

Then everything got weird.

Have you ever heard a battery operated cassette player run out of charge in the middle of a tape? Or maybe heard a turntable play a record at too slow of RPM? Those examples are the only way I can describe what happened as I beat feet away from the roaring monstrosity that I was sure had to have taken up in pursuit of me. As I ran, the echo of my footsteps, the ragged noise of my breathing, and the hum of the power lines over head all seem to slow down and drop in pitch. Sounds became deep, rumbling and prolonged, as if stretched and pulled like so much dough.

I then became aware that this aural curiosity applied itself physically to my surroundings; the wind appeared to be rustling the trees in slow motion and the clouds traveling across the night sky suddenly froze in their place. I was still running, still exerting myself against the horror that I was sure was at my heels, but I wasnt getting anywhere. I swear I sprinted for a good 20 seconds before realizing that I hadnt made any progress further up the street.

It was at this point that I felt sure I was finished. The dark figure with the horrific voice had spilled the wind from my sheets by denying me the opportunity to flee. It hadnt cornered me, and, in fact, had allowed me to put some distance between us when it sprang its trap. With the world pinned in place, I had nowhere to go. My exhaustion and terror caught up with me simultaneously and I collapsed to my knees in the middle of the road.

The steady THUD THUD THUD of footsteps behind me spoke to the close presence of my pursuer. Whether it had actually chased me this far I wasnt sure, but I could again feel malice like breaking waves across my back.

I mentioned before the exchange student who surprised me with his vocal ability to produce multiple pitches at once. The thing standing over me spoke with at least 7 different, distinct voices in varying registers. And the sound, the overall texture of its speechlike shattering glass and bomb blasts and screaming and the ripping of flesh and molten hate all piped through the same tube.

You hear well, it hissed.

Yes, I replied.

Be my ears, it commanded.

No.

Do you value your existence?, it asked.

Yes.

Be. My. Ears.

No.

Look at me.

I looked up from where I had been staring straight into the asphalt pavement.

Theres no easy way to put this. I looked up into a mouth. Crouching before me was a beast of muscle and brawn with nothing but a mouth for a face. No eyes or nose, just a massive mouth filled with sharpened teeth.

Again it spoke, and I watched as the oversized, forked tongue carefully crafted each syllable inside its horrible, cavernous jaw.

There are others who have pledged to be my eyes. You will be my ears.

It began to circle me as it talked, every step like a sledgehammer falling against the earth.

Your ears will seek out what I want to know.

No, I wont, I spat.

If you will not, then I WILL MAKE YOU BLEED.

The threat was supported in its viciousness by a blast of rotten wind that slammed me on my face against the rough pavement.

With no hope for escape, no chance of ever being free from this evil, I urged it do to the only thing I knew it would gladly enjoy.

Kill me.

In the most loathsome, foul, chuckling whisper, it said, Oh noyou will bleed. And I will have my ears.

Pain seared through my left forearm as I felt the monster hoist me up. I stared into the void of its mouth as it dragged a single claw-like finger nail the length of my arm. Blood began to pour from the wound, and the bubbling chuckle returned.

Your kind is so predisposed to bleeding. Its what you do naturally. You will all bleed. In time.
****

I woke up in the ER. Someone found me laying in the middle of the street half a block from my house, bleeding from a deep gash in my arm. I told them I was depressed and drank too much and must have wandered outside. I said I guessed I cut myself on some broken glass and then passed out when I saw the blood.

None of those things are true. Im not squeamish. Im not depressed. I cant stand the taste of alcohol for more than a few drinks, and I never walk the streets alone at night in this city. Or at least I damn sure wont anymore.

The stitches wont hold in my arm. Every time the doctor puts more in, they melt. The raw wound stinks and burns, but thats not what Im most concerned about.

There is something with us, right here, right now.

It calls with bells in the night.

And it wants to see us bleed. </TEXT>

I said already that Little Rock can get country quiet at night. Another of its charming, albeit unsettling, qualities is that it can also get unnaturally dark for a typical urban hub. As I pulled into the church parking lot, I couldnt help but feel like the light was not going to be my friend this night. 

The church was an old one-building affair with a columned entranceway, a steeply angled roof, and a tall, imposing bell tower attached to its side. In the dark it looked like a wide mouthed beast with one arm stretched toward the sky. 

Up until the point where I exited my car, I could hear the bells screeching their uncharacteristic moans as I drove nearer the church. As soon as I opened my door, they abruptly ceased. Uneasy silence and darkness stabbed my senses like a hot poker and put me on an animalistic instinctive edge; I hate saying this because I know it comes off as total cheese, but believe me when I say that nothing good comes from the dark and quiet (except food from the refrigerator). 

I wont mince words here or do anything but state the next thing that happened: I saw someone standing on the front steps of the church in front of the open, gaping, pitch black entry way. 

The Army combat guys I work with talk all the time about their spider senses tingling in the moments just before a dangerous situation springs up; the person standing in that doorway physically made my flesh crawl. From the split second I locked onto that figure in front of the church, I knew instinctively that it was going to hurt me. 

It stood about 6 foot 5 inches tall and had the build of a stout man with chin length hair. Menace dripped from it and seemed to roll over me in waves. I imagined (?) that I could smell its hungry longing to shred me. In my life Ive been in like two definite situations where I knew, if I didnt do something proactive to ensure my safety, I was going to die. This was one of those times. 

A sibilant hiss issued from the bell tower above us as whatever-it-was and I stared one another down. Then it opened its mouth. 

****
Forgive me for digressing away from the timeline of events here, but I feel that I need to preface the last portion of what Im going to tell you. 

When something large, menacing, dark, threatening, etc., locks onto you, its typically not a good idea to stay around to find out whats going to happen. But fuck me if I didnt, for who knows what reason, stay firmly locked into my spot next to my car. Thisthing bore into me with such an intensity that I could not rip myself away from its gaze. And as it opened its mouth, I found myself almost eager to experience its voice

In my experiences with music, tonality, synesthesia, and absolute pitch, never have I once been confused or blanked by anything Ive heard. Sure, Ive listened to some avant garde shit that jumped around the tonal spectrum like someone dropped a ping pong ball inside a piano (three guesses as to which composer), and Ive heard some voicings in compositions that sounded like someone took a bucket of poorly mixed paint and threw it at a wall, but never once was I truly confounded by, and surely was I never afraid of, any sound Ive ever heard. 

Until this fucking thing. 
****

I cant even begin to describe the noise this god damned thing made. There isnt a name for what came out of its mouth. And the only color to describe its quality is whatever color the void is. Deepest black. Black of the infinite. I dont fucking know. 

This thing, this monstrosity, this amalgam of every nightmare had by every person in the history of humanity, roared with its full might as I stood helpless against its tirade. 

Just when I thought I could bear no more and would surely crumble to dust under the assault of its voice, the sound cut off. Silence like a vacuum enveloped us. 

And then, suddenly, as if to shatter the earth, it bellowed one word:

	<TEXT> I have a rare, unusual, and mostly useless gift: Absolute pitch. 

What this means is that I can identify the note name of any given pitch I hear or audiate. For example, if you were to sing me any pitch of your choosing, I could tell you its note name and how out of tune (sharp/flat) it is. I could go into a ton of detail about pitch referencing, memorization, the way music is considered in tune, etcetera, but then this would post would turn into a college thesis paper and Ive already fucking done that enough for a lifetime. 

Because of my condition, I observe the world in a slightly different manner. My hearing ability is in no way super or over powered; all my ability allows me to do is put a definite label on any pitched sounds I may hear on a daily basis. Its a really sweet trick to pull out at boring parties, and, for some reason, people get a huge kick out of thinking they can stump me by singing as high, low, or out of tune as they possibly can. I can assure you, 10 times out of 10, I will correctly identify any pitch I hear, man-made, or electronic in nature. 

The only time anyone has ever caught me by surprise was a foreign-exchange student from Australia who had spent time in Bhutan and learned the art of throat-singing whereby he could produce multiple pitches simultaneously. I wasnt shocked at hearing something incorrectly as much as I was caught off guard because he didnt tell me what he was going to do. Hearing essentially three voices come out of a person is sort of a kick in the nuts for someone like me. 

I wish I could say that was the last time I experienced something like that. 

I live in Little Rock, Arkansas. No matter if this place feels like a big city, it still gets country-quiet at night. Quiet enough to hear church bells and chimes for miles, some nights. 

The Episcopal church a mile from my house has a super distinct set of bells that they love to set off for any number of occasions. Saturdays in Summer are extremely popular for weddings and as the happy couple exits the church on the way to the rest of their lives, those bells scream joy and good tidings for the whole neighborhood to hear. 
The bells produce a beautiful, yellowish tone (I also associate sounds with colors due to a condition called Synesthesia), and are keyed in C Major. C Major is viewed traditionally as the purest in music, in that it is a completely natural key; there are no sharps or flats in its key signature. 

Last night I was coming home from a late night Sonic breakfast burrito run when I pulled into my driveway. As I fumbled for my keys, trying to find the tattered one that unlocks my even-more tattered duplex, I heard the bells ring out from Hillcrest Episcopal down the road. As soon as the first tones hit my ears, the equivalent of an air raid siren went off in my mind; something about those tones was horribly awry. 

Instead of the yellow purity of C Major echoing off the houses in my hilly neighborhood, the bells belched in a grinding, soul wrenching Gb (read: G flat) that was as out of tune as it was out of character. Almost a quarter-tone sharp, and an augmented 4th above their normal tonal center, the bells may as well have been a bomb blast to my psyche. An augmented 4th or diminished 5th is known colloquially in Western music as the Tri Tone and, even to the untrained ear, is one of the most jarring musical intervals that exists in the scalar form. Older composers from the renaissance period commonly referred to the tri tone as the devils interval. Sounds like old superstition and religious fervor right?  

Im not so sure anymore.

Thoroughly unnerved, I did exactly the opposite of what, in hindsight, I should have done: I got in my car and backed out of the driveway, intent on finding out what was wrong with those bells.  </TEXT>

He's seen some stuff out in the desert out there, undetermined if man-made, military, or "something else", that he hasn't quite been able to explain. He's called me a few nights and asked stuff like "what's shaped like a slanted parallelogram, 2 miles wide, and can maintain sustained flight at less than 50 mph?"
I've always thought he might be messing with me or hinting at something he knows they have out there, but I think he's genuinely asking me what I think these things could be. 
Whether we (i.e. human beings) are building these things or "something else" is, I certainly believe there are air and space craft that travel our skies on a regular basis that we are not meant to know about.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My older brother, Rob, had an exceedingly rough life. From the time he was born until the day he died I would not hesitate to say that he lived "the struggle". At the time of his death, he had only been living with my family for around 3 months. He had previously been serving a 3+ year prison sentence for third-strike DUI (it was actually more like his fifth, but whatever). 
Since returning to our house, he had participated in family events much more frequently, attended church with us regularly, and begun making new friends in a support group. His death that night was totally unexpected and almost uncharacteristic of him; he had not used "hard" drugs for almost ten years. 
Whatever he was going through, it happened in silence and secrecy. </TEXT>

I think my main point here is that my family was lied to about the way my brothers experienced their deaths. 
The pain, terror, and sadness I felt on those nights were, I think, what they were going through at the time. 
It's something I'll keep with me until it's my turn to go.
I'm glad there's not another brother left to experience whatever I will go through.

	<TEXT> I have two half-brothers. Well, I had two half-brothers. Their names were Robert and James. Robert was born 20 years before me, when my mother was 21 years old. I was born when she was 41, and James was born 3 years later. You could consider James and me to be pretty lucky to exist at all; pregnancies at such a late age can be extremely high-risk and often don't end with a healthy or viable birth.

Anyway, we all had different Dads and thus didn't spend a lot of time with one another growing up. Imagine having two brothers and still living like an only child. It made for odd relationships with one another, but we still loved each other as brothers do. In other words, we were tight despite our circumstances.


Now I'm the only one left.

On the night Rob died, I had been out with friends to see a movie and then spent the night away from home. I was 16 at the time and had just started dating a girl name Stephanie who was a year older than me and very pretty. She had a gigantic friend group and for some reason, they accepted me immediately as if they had known me for years. She was also gorgeous. A dark movie theater with a hot girl and a bunch of new friends? The night seemed like it would be one of the best I'd ever had. 

Until 10:45 pm. 

Right as the movie was getting to its most climatic point, I suddenly felt an intense feeling of terror wash over me. Unexplainable, pure, agonizing terror. I felt like I was in a car stuck on train tracks, watching the locomotive come around the bend. The feeling of joy and contentment was replaced with the sensation that someone had just hit me full-force in the chest with a baseball bat. I felt like I wanted to die. 

I slept poorly that night.

The next morning I awoke to a phone call from my Dad who was working overseas in Saudi Arabia. My brother, Robert, was dead. 
At some point in the night, Rob had either asphyxiated himself, or aspirated his own vomit and died. My Mom found him in my old room, face up on the floor, gone. 

For as long as I can remember, that room was a source of fear for me. On dark nights I always got the strong sense that something was watching from inside the room. I had nightmares of a gigantic black hand reaching out from the doorway to grab at me as I walked by. The double closet doors in the room would sometimes stick tightly closed, and other times (often at night) swing open and loudly crash against the walls. But, more than anything else, there was always an overwhelming sense of dread whenever I was alone in that room. Like it hated me for being there. 
Needless to say, I slept on the couch a lot. I think it was the worst place my brother could have been that night.

Rob Mason was declared DOA at Baylor Dallas hospital on the morning of January 16th, 2007. The coroners said my brother overdosed on heroin, which caused him to pass out and vomit. Because he passed out face up, he aspirated the vomit into his lungs and drowned in his own fluids. They said he never felt a thing from the time he passed out. 


I don't believe them.

On the night of June 21st, 2013, I was on CQ duty at Ft. Jackson, South Carolina. With me that night was my buddy Logan. The soldiers in Bravo Company, 2/13th Infantry, were all asleep in their bunks after a hard day of training. Logan and I, alone, were the only ones up and active in the building. We had armed all the door alarms, checked all the latrines for late night snackers (soldiers think if they eat in the dark, they won't get caught), and done our headcounts of each platoon. Everyone was where they were supposed to be. Some guys were still awake, dicking around with flashlights and whispering quiet, immature jokes to one another, but everybody in that company was under their covers in bed. 

At 3 AM the door between 1st and 2nd platoons slammed open but the alarm didn't go off. I was sitting in a chair at the CQ desk and leaned back to look down the hall toward the door, thinking our CO or an NCO from one of the other companies was trying to catch us sleeping on duty. 

What I saw was something I wasn't properly trained to handle. 

Standing at the threshold of the door between the two platoon areas was a combat soldier in full kit (we call it battle-rattle in the Army). His helmet was on, his rifle slung across his chest, and his head hung low so I couldn't make out his face. 
His FLC and vest were neatly squared-away; everything taped up and orderly, unlike most BCT privates who generally always look like they got hit by a bus. 

He just stood there. 

He looked tired. At this point in our training, we were eight weeks in, with four left to go. We'd been sweating in the Carolina heat for months and were only just now starting to get some privileges back. 

Now here was this yahoo who was NOT one of my company-mates, obviously kitted up as some kind of punishment for fucking up at something-or-other, and he's walking into my company area like a damned zombie. 

I had started to get up from the desk to walk over to this kid. Patrol of the battalion area in full battle-rattle wasn't an uncommon punishment, so I figured he was somebody from another company and just making his rounds before heading back to bed in one of the other barracks. 

"Hey dude, what company are you from?", I asked.

The guy in the door didn't answer my question.

Now Logan was beside me, "Yo, fuckin' wake up, soldier. What do you need?"

The whole time we stood there in the hallway, this guy had been looking down at his feet, kinda with that mopey, sleepy, "aw shucks" feel about him. 

Now he looked up at us.

In the dim light of the emergency floods at either end of the corridor, I still couldn't make out his face. Try as I might, it was just too dark to read out a name tape or see who this dude could be. He wasn't locked and loaded or anything (no magazine in his rifle and no live ammo in barracks, anyway) so I wasn't too concerned, but this guy was either sleep-walking in full kit (seen it happen) or was in some kind of real distress.

I started walking toward him, asking again, "Hey, what company are you from? Do you need help or something?"

As I got to within about 10 yards of him, he slowly shook his head twice and backed out of the door, which closed as he stepped through.

Before I could reach it, the door clicked fully shut and I heard the miniature **BEEP** of the alarm re-setting itself. If I opened it now, the whole system would go off as an unauthorized door trigger alert and someone at Battalion CQ would see it and send a runner over to chew my ass up about it. On top of that, the door alarm would set off the PA system in the platoon barracks and wake everybody's ass up. Then I'd be really fucked. 

Nobody wants to be *that* guy, right?

I sat down back at the desk. Logan looked a little concerned. 
I tried to ease his mind, saying, "Don't worry about it, dude. That was probably someone from Echo company who fucked up and didn't give an Officer the greeting of the day or something. I wish I could learn to sleepwalk on patrol like that." 

CQ means you're up 24 hours straight, just watching the barracks, answering the phones, signing in visitors and generally being responsible for the fuckery associated with the Army on a given day. When my shift ended at 0700, I went to do my laundry. It was a Sunday and the NCO's and Officers never really checked in on those days so, naturally, I fell asleep on a pile of towels and sheets in the laundry room. 

I woke up two hours later with SFC Jones standing over me. Nearly made me shit my newly-washed pants.

"Get up, I gotta talk to you."

At approximately 2:30 AM on the night of June 21st, police and EMS had responded to a call of a motorcyclist down in the street just off post near Ft. Bragg, North Carolina. 

James had been riding home on his GSRX from an off-post Bible study group. His bike had been found almost a block away, and an employee from a 24 hour restaurant found him laying in the bushes next to the sidewalk. His left side was crushed and when the restaurant employee tried to take his helmet off, she likely exacerbated a spinal-column injury that sent him into cardiac and respiratory arrest. 

My 19 year old brother, James, an active duty Infantryman stationed with the 82nd Airborne, was DOA at Cape Fear Valley Medical Center. 

The Medical Examiners once again told my Mom that another of her sons likely didn't suffer and never felt a thing after he lost consciousness. 


I don't believe a word of it. 


I felt Rob's fear. The agony in my chest on that night was unlike anything I had experienced, nor have I ever felt that sensation since. Abject terror is an experience one never forgets. I remember telling my best friend that night, "Dude, I feel like I want to die."

And as for James, I can't tell you that I felt his pain while he laid there on the concrete for who knows how long. Nobody heard a crash, a squeal of tires leaving the scene. There were no cries for help. 

But I know it was him in that doorway that night. Everything about that soldier in the dark door shouted "I had my shit together." 
But the sadness, the dejection I felt rolling off him said, "I'm so sorry."
And then the door closed, and I never saw him again.


Now I'm the only one left.

	<TITLE> In the Cameras. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I worked at a fairly large arts and crafts retailer for about six months. The work experience there is fairly standard; customer service, employee interaction, store maintenance, etc. 
During my time with the company I moved from the second highest profit generating store in the company to one of the least productive stores in a completely different city. Normally, I worked with at least 10 other employees in the store at a given time but now, at the new location, I was faced with being one of usually four workers in the store and almost always the only male employee on shift. Of course, any kind of heavy lifting, truck unloading, and, especially, store security fell to me to take care of.


About two months ago I'm in the office going through my manager's checklist of tasks for the day when I glance at the security video feed on the television monitor. It's your basic four screen monitor so you can watch four camera feeds simultaneously. I go back to my reading my checklist when I realize that something was off about the video feed. I look back to the screen and there's this guy standing at the end of aisle six (clay, craft glues   adhesives, stencils) just staring up at the camera. The video feed cycles to a different camera somewhere else in the store and I shrug it off thinking that it's probably some kid interested in the big black spheres on the ceiling that house the cameras and sound system speakers. 
The feed cycles back around to the first camera and the kid is gone, probably called back to his mother and walking around the store again. 
But then I look and there he is again, in a completely different part of the store, staring in that same sideways look as before. This time he's over in aisle 30 (yarn, stitchery) and  fairly close to the warehouse/receiving area of the store which is off-limits to customers. 
It's a straight shot from the office back to the receiving area down the side aisle of the store so I walk back to take a look and see if this kid's still over there. He's not. In fact, there's nobody in this corner of the store. 
With better things to do than hunt for some weird kid in a store full of things to be fixed, moved or re-stocked, I go back to work.


Fast-forward a couple days and I'm closing the store on the 4-9:30 PM shift. We generally close on the dot at 9:00 and have the store cleaned, recovered and ready for the next day by 9:30 (everyone works harder at closing time because we're all so ready to go home). Generally, people are out of the store by about 5-10 minutes before we close, but on this particular night I'm back in the office putting away RF guns and radios when I notice the security camera feeds again. 


There's this same kid, now over in the aisle 17 or 18 (art supplies, canvas) pulling his same game again. 
I call on the radio to my coworker, Ashley, who is two aisles away at the framing desk, "Ashley, go look on 17 or 18 and let this guy know that we're closing in five minutes. And let me know if he seems 'off' to you."
About 45 seconds later Ashley calls back, "Nobody over here, I bet he went up to the front to leave or check out."
Not convinced, I look at the video screen again in time to see him standing in front of the sliding entrance door staring at camera #1. The door is motion activated and he's standing close enough that it should either be sliding open or be standing wide open if he'd been standing there long enough. The door is firmly closed. 
I call BJ, the cashier, and ask her to make "the announcement"; this is the call that goes over the Public Address system to let customers know the store is now closed and that they need to exit the store or finish up at the checkout counter. BJ makes the announcement and we do our rounds, checking the store for stray customers or children who may not have heard or paid attention to the PA system. Nobody is left in the store but employees. 


A call comes over the radio. It's the manager and she sounds pissed.
"Someone go back to receiving and get that person out of there. Let them know we. are. closed."
Apparently the manager is seeing someone in the security camera feed from the camera back in receiving.
I'm closest to receiving so I head back to look. 
The first sign that something is wrong is that receiving is dark; the lights are on an automatic timer once the store closes, the receiving area's timer is shorter because generally there's nothing to do back there when shutting down the store. There aren't any windows or ambient light back there so when it's dark, it's dark. All the camera should be seeing is a blacked out void. 
I call the manager on the radio and ask, "Are you sure someone's back there? The lights are off and I don't think the camera can see in the dark."
Annoyed, she radios back, "The camera is showing the lights on and bright and there's someone back there staring up at the camera in the corner. Go ask them to leave."


Just to be clear, I am 6'1" and 180 pounds. I would consider myself to be of medium build, but I'm also in the Army and know how to "throw my weight around", if you will. At this point, I'm thoroughly unnerved by the situation. I therefore make the decision that I'm going to breach this room in the most obvious and forceful way possible so as to make as much noise as I can and sound like more than one person doing it. 

I stack up beside the door, back off a few feet and kick it.
The left side of the double door smashes open and collides with a metal display behind it, making a clattering sound that echoes through the receiving area.
The right side of the door swings outward with a big WHOOSH of air from the pressure differential I've created between the two rooms. 
I shout into the empty receiving area, "I'm sorry but we're closed! It's time to leave, please!" (Because even in the weirdest circumstances, customer service always comes first).
The manager calls me on the radio again, "Hey, quit tearing stuff up back there. And I don't see that person anymore. The lights shut off and the camera's blacked out. Come back to the front and finish up."
It is at this point that the main lights of the store begin to go out. As I walk back up the main aisle running the length of the store, the lights go out as I pass under them. For every four lights that extinguish themselves, one emergency light takes their place, bathing the store in what can best be described as "indoor moonlight".
As the closing crew finishes up, we head back to the office to clock out and turn in our radios. It's company policy for all employees to leave the store together in order to avoid accidents, keep accountability, counter theft, and to ensure that absolutely no one is left in the store. 


We're all in the office when BJ blurts out, "Are you kidding me? Look at the video screen."
There in the monitor, standing in front of the entrance door again, is the person, staring in that sideways manner up at the camera. As we watch, the light goes out at the front, sending the camera into darkness. 
As that camera goes dark, the system cycles to the next nearest working feed. And there he is. 


This time we're fixated, studying this guy. He's average height with dark, curly hair that covers his eyebrows, making it hard to see his eyes. He's wearing brown pants and a hoodie with the hood pulled up. He looks completely normal but for the strange angle of his head and the intensity of his gaze directed at the camera. He's not so much looking at the camera as looking straight at us through the screen. 
Camera after camera cycles across the screen, most are totally dark, but some are still picking up the faint twilight of the emergency lights nearby. And there he is. In every feed. 
It's then that we realize the dark cameras are seeing him too, it's almost as if there's a blacker blackness in their unintelligible images.


There's a clattering from behind the group of us huddled in the office. In her unease Ashley has backed into the file cabinet behind her, knocking an inner shelf loose. It crashes down to the bottom of the cabinet, echoing terribly through the now silent retail store.
He hears it. 
Suddenly every camera feed is blank. He's been looking for us.
Through the plate glass window on the office door our view outside is distorted by the differential of light between the office and the emergency lights in the aisle. It's very hard to tell who or what is out there.
BJ gasps. Even with the glare from the office lights its clear there is someone standing about a quarter of the way down the aisle from the door. Standing. Staring.
The light in the office suddenly clicks out. 
There's another WHOOSH sound followed by what can only be described as a grotesque splattering, sucking and gurgling sound.
Just as suddenly, every light in the store blazes to life. It's blinding fireworks show of burning xenon, neon and fluorescent lighting. 
As our eyes all adjust we're met with a grizzly sight. 


The window on the office door is slick with bright scarlet blood. It sticks to the window in clots and runs down the edges in thin rivulets, wending its way down to the floor where it begins to pool.
As an Army Medic, my 68W training kicks in and I immediately identify this as the kind of blood that spurts, pours and oozes from the most serious and painful injuries; this is the blood of certain death. 

Two weeks later I put in my notice. The man hasn't been seen in the store, nor does he appear in the video recordings from that night.


Upper management doesn't believe a word of it. They've begun making "cutbacks" to our staff and replacing floor managers with promoted employees from other stores. Of the group of us, only the manager has any kind of intention of staying in that store. 


Maybe she's made of tougher stuff.


Maybe she knows the guy.
