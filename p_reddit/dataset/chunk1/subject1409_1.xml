	<TEXT> Around 700 years ago, German monks in the town of Einbeck developed a specific style of malty, dark, high alcohol beer to help sustain them during intense periods of fasting. This beer became known as Bock, a corruption of the name Einbeck. Later, discontent with the strength of Bock style beer, monks developed an even stronger variant known as Doppelbock, meaning double Bock. This beer was so laden with nutrition that some dubbed it liquid bread.

Now, these beers were so delicious that the monks began to wonder if they were contrary to the spirit of Lenten penance. Being faithful sons of the Church, they decided to consult the pope. On the journey to Rome, however, the beer was subjected to extreme weather conditions, causing it to spoil and turn sour. When the pope tasted it, he was so appalled by the spoiled beer that he immediately deemed it an excellent Lenten penance. </TEXT>

Oh, and you might recognize it from the James Bond film Skyfall, in which Hashima Island served as the lair of the films villain.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Lest ye think Nixon wasn't an equal opportunity offender...**

From a May 13, 1971, conversation among President Richard Nixon, John D. Ehrlichman, and H. R. Haldeman. On October 5, 1999, the National Archives made available to the public 445 hours of previously unreleased Oval Office tapes. The following dialogue was transcribed by Chicago Tribune reporter James Warren.

RICHARD NIXON: We're going to [put] more of these little Negro bastards on the welfare rolls at $2,400 a family--let people like Pat Moynihan and [special consultant] Leonard Garment and others believe in all that crap. But I don't believe in it. Work, work--throw 'em off the rolls. That's the key.

JOHN D. EHRLICHMAN: The key is Reagan's neutrality. If Reagan blasts this thing and says it's not strong enough on the work-requirement end, that will be very bad.

NIXON: I have the greatest affection for them [blacks], but I know they're not going to make it for 500 years. They aren't. You know it, too. The Mexicans are a different cup of tea. They have a heritage. At the present time they steal, they're dishonest, but they do have some concept of family life. They don't live like a bunch of dogs, which the Negroes do live like.

EHRLICHMAN: The Mexican American is not as good as the Mexican. You go down to Mexico--they're clean, they're honest, they're moral.

NIXON: Mexico is a much more moral country.

EHRLICHMAN: Monterrey, Cuernavaca. Go into slum areas, and by God they come out with clean shirts on a Sunday morning.

NIXON: The church. You find a helluva lot less marijuana use in Mexico than the United States.

EHRLICHMAN: The unions are actually a stronger force down there than the church.

NIXON: For what?

EHRLICHMAN: For conduct and social policy.

NIXON: ... CBS ... glorifying homosexuality.

EHRLICHMAN: A panel show?

H. R. HALDEMAN: No, it's a regular show. It's on every week. It's usually just done in the guy's home. It's usually just that guy, who's a hard hat.

NIXON: That's right; he's a hard hat.

EHRLICHMAN: He always looks like a slob.

NIXON: Looks like Jackie Gleason.

HALDEMAN: He has this hippie son-in-law, and usually the general trend is to downgrade him and upgrade the son-in-law--make the square hard hat out to be bad. But a few weeks ago, they had one in which the guy, the son-in-law, wrote a letter to you, President Nixon, to raise hell about something. And the guy said, "You will not write that letter from my home!" Then said, "I'm going to write President Nixon," took off all those sloppy clothes, shaved, and went to his desk and got ready to write his letter to President Nixon. And apparently it was a good episode.

EHRLICHMAN: What's it called?

NIXON: "Archie's Guys." Archie is sitting here with his hippie son-in-law, married to the screwball daughter. The son-in-law apparently goes both ways. This guy. He's obviously queer--wears an ascot--but not offensively so. Very clever. Uses nice language. Shows pictures of his parents. And so Arch goes down to the bar. Sees his best friend, who used to play professional football. Virile, strong, this and that. Then the fairy comes into the bar.

I don't mind the homosexuality. I understand it. Nevertheless, goddamn, I don't think you glorify it on public television, homosexuality, even more than you glorify whores. We all know we have weaknesses. But, goddammit, what do you think that does to kids? You know what happened to the Greeks! Homosexuality destroyed them. Sure, Aristotle was a homo. We all know that. So was Socrates.

EHRLICHMAN: But he never had the influence television had.

NIXON: You know what happened to the Romans? The last six Roman emperors were fags. Neither in a public way. You know what happened to the popes? They were layin' the nuns; that's been goin' on for years, centuries. But the Catholic Church went to hell three or four centuries ago. It was homosexual, and it had to be cleaned out. That's what's happened to Britain. It happened earlier to France.

Let's look at the strong societies. The Russians. Goddamn, they root 'em out. They don't let 'em around at all. I don't know what they do with them. Look at this country. You think the Russians allow dope? Homosexuality, dope, immorality, are the enemies of strong societies. That's why the Communists and left-wingers are clinging to one another. They're trying to destroy us. I know Moynihan will disagree with this, [Attorney General John] Mitchell will, and Garment will. But, goddamn, we have to stand up to this.

EHRLICHMAN: It's fatal liberality.

NIXON: Huh?

EHRLICHMAN: It's fatal liberality. And with its use on television, it has such leverage.

NIXON: You know what's happened [in northern California]?

EHRLICHMAN: San Francisco has just gone clear over.

NIXON: But it's not just the ratty part of town. The upper class in San Francisco is that way. The Bohemian Grove, which I attend from time to time--it is the most faggy goddamned thing you could ever imagine, with that San Francisco crowd. I can't shake hands with anybody from San Francisco.

Decorators. They got to do something. But we don't have to glorify it. You know one of the reasons fashions have made women look so terrible is because the goddamned designers hate women. Designers taking it out on the women. Now they're trying to get some more sexy things coming on again.

EHRLICHMAN: Hot pants.

NIXON: Jesus Christ. </TEXT>

If the flesh disturbs you, then the reality behind the issue would disturb you far more if we opened our eyes long enough to see it. We live in a culture disconnected from what it is doing to itself and others, we choose to ignore rather than deal with the reality we have created for ourselves.

In 2007, French engineer Pascal Cotte announced that his ultra-high resolution scans of the painting provide evidence that Mona Lisa was originally painted with eyelashes and with visible eyebrows, but that these had gradually disappeared over time, perhaps as a result of overcleaning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After Buddha was cremated, his left canine tooth was found in the ashes by his disciple Khema, who gave it to King Brahmadatte so that it may be venerated. Legends began to circulate, the most prominent of which was that whoever possessed it had the divine right to rule Brahmadattes kingdom. Many wars were fought for no other reason than to own it. The tooth was said to be responsible for converting many Indian Kings to Buddhism, performing miracles each time it was threatened with destruction. It is now placed within several golden caskets and displayed only for special ceremonies.

	<TEXT> This greeting dates back at least as far as Ancient Greece. In the Pergamon Museum in Berlin, a funeral stone from the 5th century BC depicts two soldiers shaking hands. The base of a column at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, meanwhile, shows Hera [the wife and sister of Zeus in the Olympian pantheon of Greek mythology and religion] shaking hands with Athena [the goddess of wisdom, courage and inspiration in ancient Greek mythology and religion]. By shaking hands, rather than bowing or curtsying, both parties proved they were equals and that they felt sufficiently comfortable in each others presence not to bring weapons. </TEXT>

Already serving a one-year suspension for violating the NFL Policy and Program for Substances of Abuse, Smith appeared to deny that it was him in the video, tweeting, "Good try, not me." The NFL is investigating the video.

The incident was just the latest in a string of controversies involving Smith. The promising pass rusher was involved in an August 2015 arrest after which he was charged with hit and run, DUI and vandalism.

	<TEXT> Bulgarian rakia is similar to Albanian raki and equivalent in many Balkan nations w/similar names.  They are strong spirits most often made of plums or grapes but without any additional essence added.  Drunk straight and room temperature.  The name is originally from Turkish and spread via Ottoman occupation of the Balkan peninsula.

Turkish raki is strong spirits as well but is distilled with anise for a very distinct flavor similar to Greek ouzo.  It is served mixed 1/2 raki 1/2 water with ice.  But be advised.  It will fuck you up before you realize what happened. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Erdogan haters are mostly mis-informed. The source of their hate stems from anti-Erdogan/imperialist propaganda that has been pumped out since the ~2011 conflict in Syria. Before then, he was a Western heart-throb, and anonymous to the Western plebes. Now he is demonized, perhaps not because he stopped taking orders from NATO/the West, but because the Gulenists were seen as a far more effective project to bring Turkey to its knees.

I am not defending Erdogan, but FETO is 100 times worse.

Those are the only two choices?  I have a lot of family in Turkey who would disagree with that, and know many more non-religious Turks who resent being forced to live in a society that is becoming more and more conservative all the time.  They are free thinking, tolerant folks who appreciate the diversity of the nation they live in.  They are in no way being brainwashed by imperialist propaganda, but they also want to be able to smoke a cigarette on the street during Ramadan without being punched in the face.

By the way, is this imperialist propaganda? -- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFoIvcHdHI0 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Question regarding the point about Erdogan being able to pass laws under the state of emergency.  This is potentially huge.  The article says "it will go to Parliament for a simple yes or no vote."  Does that mean a simple majority of 51% or does approving laws require like a 2/3 or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone who is involved with Gulen's groups in public sector is being cleaned out as it's classified as a quasi-terrorist organization which now (here's the "wait until this moment" part) openly encourages treason via last Friday's coup.  Not saying I feel that way (as a former teacher in Turkey), but that's the justification.  Goal is to ensure that education, judiciary, military, etc all belong to people who will say yes to Erdogan at every point. </TEXT>
