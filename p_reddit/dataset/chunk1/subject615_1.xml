	<TEXT> Couldn't feel this post any harder. I'm Platinum 1 Div 3 currently in 1s so it's not like I can't carry or fend for myself but it says something when I can't get out of the silver ranks on solo standard. It's cliche to say but right nowI say now because hopefully the monstrosity will be tweaked or solve itselfyou pretty much have to carry and hope you hit a streak to get that MMR up.

Keep grinding bro cause we're all in the same boat lol. Good looks and good luck from one struggling solo queuer to another </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not bad at all, keep working on all the mechanical stuff 

My biggest piece of advice would be to utilize the air roll key binding. It's truly a life saver. 

Keep grinding through the ranks mate </TEXT>
