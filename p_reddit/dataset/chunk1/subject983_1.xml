	<TEXT> I think it all boils down to one word: Emotion.  Many people get very into arguing/defending their point that they stop thinking with logic and let their emotions take over.  I have had many great political discussions with my friends, because we talk about everything at a logical level.  I'm afraid to even mention politics while around my mother, because she always speaks with her emotions right off the bat. Note that I am an independent, my mom is a very liberal democrat, and my friends range all over the spectrum.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I find it very interesting that a school would teach creationism as a theory, because it isn't a true account of what happened.  The short version is that when the Bible was translated over the years from Hebrew eventually to English, the original use of the Hebrew language and the context from which it was used dissipated.  It was never meant to be an account of what happened, but merely an explanation.  I went to a Catholic high school and me and my religion teacher from sophomore year had a great discussion about this.  If you guys want me to go into detail on the actual context of the creation story in genesis(There are four creation stories in the bible) just let me know, but it is a pretty decent chunk of text so I wont post it unless you guys want it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Its fascinating that they estimate that the top 20% control just under 60% of the wealth, and would like to see them control about 33% of the wealth, but in fact the top 20% control over 80% of the wealth, and that's not looking like its going to change for the better anytime soon. 

What about all the hard work that people had to go through to get there? I am not arguing the the very rich shouldn't be taxed more, but more-so for the upper-middle class. These people are usually some of the hardest working people doing demanding jobs (Engineering, Information Technology, Business/Market analysts, etc).  The level and quality of their work is much higher then the people working at Micky D's or bagging groceries at your local supermarket.  Why should the profits of their hard work be siphoned off and given to those who haven't done much to deserve it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the robbery example I used may have been out of context, I still support the judges decision.  My reasoning for that is two-fold. One, via the 10th amendment it is the states right to regulate education in a way they deem fit.  While it may seem bogus to us living in other states, it is the state's (In this case Texas) to make its own call on the issue.  Second is because not punishing her for her truancy would have elevated her above the other students in regards to how they were regulated by the rules.  If another student had missed that much school they would have received the same punishment as well; it was not an exclusive punishment for her.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing is that in this case, as I currently understand it, is that excessive truancy is punishable by the courts.  While it may not make any sense to us not living in Texas, we need to respect the sovereignty of the states in regard to education ad let them make their own decisions.  Also I never mentioned armed robbery, simply robbery such as shoplifting.   I should have been more clear in my main post. The reason that I believe the punishment is justified is that all students are subject to these current rules, and breaking them when they actually need to be applied ruins the point of Bing them in the first place.

Personal choices should be free from govt regulation unless it affects others. So to use weed as an example, the govt should legalize weed, because it is a personal choice and only affects you as an individual, but the govt should be able to say you cant smoke weed inside because the second hand smoke will interfere with the personal choice of the other people inside who chose not to smoke.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Lucky

2) A

3) D (My reason for D is that if they are legal they will help, but illegal they will hurt.  Illegals may drive prices down but their working conditions are very substandard and they are often treated inhumanely).

4) A

5) A (As long as they are paid minimum wage)

6) A (As long as they pass a simple background test showing no major criminal offense/affiliation with drug cartels/mafias/mobs).

7) No 

8) Depends on the conditions: If a general you are now here legally was implemented, no.  If they had to do some form of restitution proportional to the time they spent here illegally as well as pay back taxes, yes.  (When I say restitution I mean community service or something along those lines to help better the community's from which they detracted.)

9)B

10) C

11) C

12) It is a combo of the US gov, Mexican Gov and employers.  The US government does not do anything to punish illegals or the companies that hire them, the employers knowingly violate the law to make more profit, and the Mexican government has done nothing to try to make it's country a better place so that people dont leave.

13) No chance

14) Absolutely, provided they simply detain the illegals and take them to the police to be deported, and dont exercise excessive violence unless in retaliation to violence received from the illegals.  The federal government is doing a terrible job and policing immigration, and so states and citizens are trying to protect their communities from being overrun with criminals.

	<TEXT> I think I should elaborate on my point a little.  I am a big believer in the worthy and unworthy poor idea.  I do not disagree with welfare in general, just with the idea of welfare for the lazy.  Here is an example of what I mean by worthy verses unworthy.  Let us say for example there was a family of four, and the mom was going to be a stay at home mom while the dad worked a 100,000k a year job, but the father suddenly passed away.  The mother has no college education, because the families plan was to have her stay at home, and she cant work because she has to take care of the kids.  I personally have no problem having some of my money put toward helping her out since she was not put into this situation through a fault of her own.  Contrast that, on the other hand, of say a man who is the kind of person you could starve if you hid his welfare check under his work boots.  Under no circumstance would I want my money to be going to help that person.  In a counterargument to your above point: 
"Second, if others are educated, healthy and fed that isn't just in their interests, it's in the interest of all society, and therefore yours. I realise many people think of welfare as handing free money to lazy people, but I think about it as investing in the future of society: those without jobs could get jobs in the future, and contribute wealth to society; if we just allow them to die, we have lost that wealth."

I think that argument is flawed when looking at lazy people, or as I like to call them, the unworthy poor.  The only reason those people aren't working is because they are lazy.  Take away that guaranteed income and then they have to go work to stay alive.  By giving the lazy free money, all they are doing is spending it on themselves so they don't have to work as much or at all, which in my opinion detracts from society.  
Also you mention how if we invest in them, they might get jobs in the future.  I would be more inclined to see welfare as helping them get jobs if they had to attend jobs training programs or attend local or community colleges at subsidized rates in order to receive welfare, and maybe be required to show that they are attempting to find a job and provide for themselves so that eventually they may move off welfare (Again we are dealing with the unworthy poor in this scenario). If they are being actively trained and seeking jobs, then that shows me that they want to become better people and I would not have any problem supporting that.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it has to do with the size of the bass drum head, if i am interpreting this correctly.  Because the bass drum head is so large i think it has a longer amplitude, if you think of it in terms of a wave, whereas the snare drum will have a much shorter resonance period.  Correct me if I'm interpreting this wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do agree, and I believe that the right to the social or legal contract of "Marriage" is a right for every person.  The problem comes from the fact that the word used to describe this word legally is also used to describe a relationship between one man and one woman in many religions. The US government is a secular body, which is why I don't think they should use Marriage in the first place. However, in its current state since that is the word for a legal contract I would support "Marriage" for gays, but I just think that the word "Marriage" is a bad choice of diction in this case.  My main opposition is not to Gays rights, just the word used to describe the rights. And to your above point, no, I do not believe that Christians created reproduction and the family.  Ill leave that belief to the extreme evangelicals.  And to another one of your points about marriage being a union of even non-religious straight couples, I believe that is what makes this such of a challenge.  It has become engrained in our society as a symbol of love, along side of being a religious ceremony, and moving forward with defining this is going to be one of the big issues of this generation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is a right to get married, straight or gay.  There are two problems with unions in our society.  One, people are not open to change and hence don't want gay people disrupting their old way of life.  The second is that because of the way they are defined, government and religion clash.   I think we need to separate those two aspects and then we will be golden. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The governments role would be exactly same as it is now, its just that the word "Marriage" would be taken out of all legal proceedings in the US and replaced with "Civil Union".  All couples, no matter what sexual preference, would receive the the full legal rights all straight married couples now receive.  The governments role would also be to make sure no people are discriminated on by the basis of their sexuality. 

Many people say that it would be such a hassle to do that, but in my view, if we could break the eons of discrimination of blacks in the south and give them full equal rights, we can change a few legal proceedings to say "Civil Union" instead of "Marriage". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The problem comes from calling the contract "Marriage".  The christian faiths have been using that term to describe the relationship between a man and a women for centuries.  I believe that "Marriage" should be a religious term and that all unions(hetero or homo) should be civil unions in the eyes of the law.  Marriage, in my view, is a contract between God, yourself and your partner.  So gay people could get Married in a church that supports gay rights because only religious recognition of marriage would be required. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would like to start this off by saying that I personally think that gay couples deserve the full and equal benefit that heterosexual couples receive under the first amendment. That being said though, I personally think "marriage" has no place in the US legal system. Many people have claimed, and correctly stated that in the US marriage is a legal contract of union.  However, my view is that marriage should not be mentioned in the legal system at all for the reason of violating the first amendment.  The reason that I say this is that the christian faith has prior claim to the term.  They have been using the term for centuries, while the US has used it for less than 225 years.  Because the church has been using the term for so long and most states conform with the Christian way of thinking of marriage between a man and a woman, I think that the first amendment rights of Gay couples are violated, specifically the establishment clause.  By conforming to the christian ideology of marriage the church, in my opinion, is establishing a religion.  However, I don't support a gay union being called a marriage because the Church has prior claim to the usage of the word.  If a christian denomination were to spring up that supported gay marriage, in the religious sense, become a recognized religion, and then marry the couple I would recognize it as a religion.

tl;dr Marriage should be a church dealing and all "marriages" should be civil unions in the eye of the law </TEXT>
