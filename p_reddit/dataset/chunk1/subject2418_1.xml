I went to Paris/Barcelona last year, leaving the country for the first time and I went to the West Coast earlier this year, so thought a trip East would be great-- get both sides of the story. I had the benefit of friends in New York, and a friend who was a ranger in Acadia this summer. This was also my first time with a traveling companion, previously I've only gone solo and made my own way. I'm not sure where to next... was thinking taking a little drive around Italy might be nice....

	<DATE> 2015-01-09 12:26:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Click here to get to the webplayer version](https://play.spotify.com/user/1236835890/playlist/1tQ2pv2vOvydj3YmRJ7pqB)  

[For those without Spotify here is a doc with the tracklist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1uqe9HAlUFiFwPG5ZwvpGR5211krCLirmyVSx9Sa45EE)
  
To find it in the app, search "wicks" or my name "Brennan McDowell"  
  
/u/MentalSewage was cool enough to recreate the list in [Google Music linked here](https://play.google.com/music/playlist/AMaBXyn-ij88eTAPIjm2_9lJ1X7_GjDHCeM14_cm1HBBt5l52_U8mfdX7r9wS5qgA-taYQsXcU_aD8Pnv7qDHvMW4dLc71GaqQ==)  
  
/u/akx somehow scripted out [the songs to matching YouTube videos](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/1094010/Reddit/wicks.html)  
  
/u/k1nkyk0ng made it into a [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLknuiOt8_GfYGqnvvYV4lMQ7BDTC_eTfd)

/u/meomix made a Streamus version of it, his chrome extension that lets you use youtube like a playlist [here for the link](https://share.streamus.com/playlist/2603b7b2312f/fifty_hours_of_beautiful_music)
  
I posted this about a year ago, but I've since retooled it greatly. My goal is to cover every genre, as long as a song make one move. I really feel that people who pocket themselves into one genre are missing how much all comes from the same notes, and anything can move you.
  
Would love to hear recommendations, playlist recs, or playlist discussion too--  
  
Thanks and happy Friday!
