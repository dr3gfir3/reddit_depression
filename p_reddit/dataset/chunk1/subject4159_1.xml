	<TITLE> What should be done about true damage? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-19 20:51:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was talking to my cousin a little while ago and we were having a debate about what should be done with true damage.


**Create item to have a chance to build against it**

Too long has a Vayne destroyed tanks with silver bolts despite the heavy armor builds.

The Darius true damage, the Garen true damage, the Fiora true damage is honestly too much. Olaf does a measly 200ish true damage with his e, but you have a Darius that can 100-0 a tank with 1 combo and penta the rest of the team with a full tank build... ya... okay.

**[Enter item name]**

*Reduce damage taken from true damage by 30%. +400Health*

This way, you lose an item slot if you are itemizing against true damage so that ADC's have a better chance of doing damage mid-game. Only health should be included because if it were a first buy and didn't have health, you would still get rekt.


This can clean up some of the frustration some people have with ADC's as well as fix some problems with the increasing true damage problem.


*What do you guys think?*

**Edit:** Keep an open mind about it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright. So im guessing that you're silver-bronze elo? No offense. I'm a plat 4 player, and there is advice i can give. So basically, you don't "have" to buy a pink ward, but you do need to help the team out with vision control. It depends on where you are on the map, where you think the enemy is going to be and controlling areas like dragon and baron as well as when you're laning, it's important to ward your lane. As far as positioning, you need to know where you are supposed to be this comes with practice. If you're confident you can 2-3 shot someone as an adc then do it and front line and be fearless but, you need to know what the capabilities are of the enemy team which just boils down to knowing what each champion does. However if you're not super fed and cant kite out then you need to stay behind your front line. If you're a tank you need to initiate or peel for your carry's. Also you need to realize that every pick that you make needs to fit in with what you're team is doing if you want to group and team fight but split pushing is also effective. You need to know that when you're low hp, it depends on if you should go back or not. When you're low in laning phase for instance after your jungler came to your lane and killed the enemy laner and the jungler and you have vision of the rest of the enemy team, you should really shove your lane, take turret or whatever objective is available or near that is possible to take. Killing the enemy team isnt all that will get you ahead, but taking the wave of farm that's in front of you, maybe proxy a bit and deny him the farm by the tower killing it. It's about having a larger margin of everything which will result in you spiraling out of control and harder for them to deal with.

	<TEXT> Hello, I just got platinum 5 as of yesterday and felt I needed to post this. I was playing vayne a game ago. It was pretty close, I tried to do what i could, but in the end my team didn't have the composition to engage and when i tried poking I got charmed by the enemy Ahri and we lost. Game before that enemy jinx penta killed us when we dove her (which was very impressive) and we lost (which was a well deserved win by the jinx). Then this last game I just played I decided to play Vayne again because my friend who just got Diamond said that he pretty much spammed her for 40+ games to climb. I was pretty mad the other game and on edge because of how close those games were, and the last one we lost was due to a lack of engage. However, my support just sat in lane all game, hardly doing anything. When he had a chance to ult tristana in lane which would have been an easy kill, he just walked up to get targon passives and walk back. Then when he does engage and I commit off of it and die and he tells me i'm bad. Our team is very far behind at this point because the enemy Viktor killed our Yasuo 5 times 1v1 in lane and then they grouped and took our tower. Their lead was very large, I felt like I needed to try to make a play and tried to take down the Tristana but I failed at it. Then when I failed again, I get called bad by my support for a second time. My whole team is doing horribly, there were so many chances for Braum to jump on our lane and snowball, so many time the jungler could have ganked for us but it never happened. I was finally fed up with being called bad for trying and quit. I really hate this game some times. Does anyone else do this from time to time? Keep in mind I have over 1k games this season and don't do this at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This Riot Lyte guy has just been a stick in everyones asses trying to punish every thing. It's like we live in communist Russia and the only thing you'll be able to do anymore in game is play exactly a certain way, and only tell your teammates, "gj" or tell the enemy team, "gg" and no more because if you do, you get banned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm an addict for sure. Sadly, I have no life. I don't have a job and I find it hard to leave my house because i've almost given up on getting one and I can't seem to find one. Now I feel like i'm almost waisting my time filling out applications because I don't hear back from 80% of the things I apply for. How that pertains to league is almost a straight line because I live in a small town and don't have any real friends so I spend most of my time playing League of Legends and not doing anything else because if i'm not playing League then i'm doing nothing since there IS nothing to do. That's just my situation. Hopefully though it will change and i'll go back to working 70+ hours a week or what ever I can get. But of this moment, and for the time I wasn't working while going to school, I was, and am an addict. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So i'm currently level 19 leveling up my account, my main is only gold 2. Anyways, i've heard that by winning a lot in normals, you start to play with people that do the same, almost like a hidden ranked system in normals. The better W/L ratio someone has, the probability of that person being a smurf would be increased. So right now i have 51W/24L and my queue time is 6 minutes long. What hidden rank is this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. Whole reason i started playing ranked in the first place was to show my friends that i got a good rank. I tried really hard to get gold last season but fell short. Now that i'm almost platinum and they want to not give me anything cause i got suspended for defending myself against people that blame me and tell me to kill myself and don't want to listen or be reasonable. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would have liked to know which champions scaled off of armor/health/ap/ad or had true damage and what it was. What champions were viable in certain rolls (when i started i took lux top lane). Also i would have liked to know what the meta was (tank/fighter top - assasin/tank/mage jungle - mage/ad assasin mid - marskman adc (i literally thought that adc meant the person that was going to carry the team, so i claimed my ap sona was adc) - tank/mage support and what champions were the support. Also i would have liked to know that you needed to ward when playing support and what the responsabilities are of each roll. I would have liked to know what counter jungling was. Thats basically the basics of what would have saved me a lot of time and a lot of verbal abuse from others but at the same time when i was first starting out the game i thought it was fun to experiment with all of the cool items and champions. But at the same time, it would help others to know this stuff so that other people don't get punished while playing with a very new player. My brother never played the game again after two games because he got reported for being an unskilled player which he was and people expected more. </TEXT>

EDIT: Yeah i mean i'm unranked. My level is 18 at the moment. I heard that depending on your w/l ratio you'll be put with people of equal skill which are smurfs. </TEXT>
