	<TEXT> The "keystone of our religion" thing bothered me a lot even before my faith transition started. I could never figure out what the Book of Mormon had to do with modern Mormonism, and there was always the contradiction that "this is Christ's original church restored" even though Christ's original church obviously didn't have the Book of Mormon. If it's the keystone, why didn't God's children have it until the 1800s? Never made sense to me. </TEXT>

I love Overwatch. I've played it every day since it came out. It's far and away the best of these three games, and it's the only one I've really gotten invested in. I suck at FPS games and I don't like them very much in general, but for whatever reason, Overwatch has been the exception. It's a blast. </TEXT>

"I've actually never gained a spiritual witness that the BoA is true, but I still KNOW it's true" (how doesn't he have a witness after devoting so many years to it?) and "I'm not here to prove that it's true; I don't think you CAN prove that it's true; the only way to know for sure is through spiritual witness." A spiritual witness that he doesn't have, apparently. Way to convince us of the authenticity. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To a certain extent, I feel your pain with over-reactive parents. I've been out of the church for about two months now and my dad has made every attempt to get me back. He sends me a lot of emails linking to FairMormon pages and Hugh Nibley talks and lots of other useless apologist crap. The other day I sent him an email refuting many of his claims, and at the end I politely asked him to stop sending me those emails because they're a waste of time for both of us.

Today I found out from my sister that my parents were very offended by the email and they said this would be reason enough to kick me out if I wasn't moving out in two weeks already.

Obviously nowhere near as terrible as your parents, but similar in some ways, I think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Swiss Army Pickups** - *Multipurpose drops*

Passive item that permanently turns coins, bombs, and keys into "pickup credits" - a multipurpose pickup that can be all three. This combines your current amounts into one. So if you have 12 coins, 8 bombs, and 2 keys, you would have 22 pickup credits and now it's as if you have 22 coins OR 22 bombs OR 22 keys. Performing actions such as spending money, using bombs, and opening locked doors drains your credit count. Collecting any of the three pickups will add to the credit count in their specific value (1+1 bombs/coins add 2, nickels and dimes add 5 and 10 respectively, etc.) Max credit count is 300. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The power of prayer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-05 05:07:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Our family recently decided to buy a dog, and we've spent a couple weeks looking at various options. Today we decided on an online transaction that looked very appealing in many ways. But before we officially decided to go through with it, my parents, being the TBMs they are, made sure to pray about it. They were both adamant about how important that was and they repeated multiple times that they both felt very good about it after praying. So we told the person we were interested and the payment process began.

Turns out it was a scam. I discovered that the video she had posted of the available puppies was actually uploaded to YouTube over five years ago and this seller had stolen the video and claimed that they had taken it. We even asked specifically (our communication was exclusively over text) if the video was of the exact dogs she was selling, and she said yes and that she had filmed it three weeks ago. I called her out on her bullshit and she got angry and took down the online ad so we couldn't report her. (Luckily this happened before we actually paid her, so everything is fine.)

Just goes to show how useless and wrong spiritual confirmation actually is. Funny thing is, if I was still out on my mission right now like I was supposed to be, I wouldn't have been here to find the video and expose the seller, and my family would have figured it out the hard way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A golden investigator is someone who is very accepting of the Church right from the start; someone who basically fits the Mormon mold already but just has to be taught the doctrine and they'll be immediately baptized.

I learned a lot of very disappointing things about the Church on my mission. One of them is that a lot of missionaries care more about baptisms as numbers on their reports and/or bragging rights to their family and other missionaries far more than as actual people being cleansed from sin. Similarly, a lot of members like it when new members show up, but only because it increases the size of the congregation or the overall Church membership; they often want nothing to do with the new convert as a person.

If you're still investigating, I'd recommend getting out ASAP. The Church is an absolute hellhole and I can promise that you and your kids will be far better off learning the truth now rather than 20 years down the road or even not at all. And if you don't want to research Church history, just read some (or all) of the CES Letter (www.cesletter.com, download the PDF), in which the research has already been done for you and laid out very clearly and irrefutably. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Elder Bednar - Discouraging missionaries from the honest seeking of truth since 2016 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-16 10:09:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One of my best friends is on his mission right now and this came as part of his weekly email on Monday. Considering that I've just barely been exposed to the truth about the Church and that I'm just now starting to see the manipulation and brainwashing present, this made me pretty upset:

Elder Bednar came to our mission. That was pretty freaking amazing. 
It would be hard to condense all the things he said into one email, so I won't try (although he did prophesy, and that was awesome; there's something cool about an actual prophet prophesying right in front of you) but I wanted to share one cool insight.
He told us one time that he was meeting with a group of inactive RM's in a stake somewhere in the US. He walked in and stood at the pulpit and asked how he could help. He opened it up to questions and made it a discussion format (which was how he taught us; SUPER cool). One brother stood up and told Elder Bednar that he had come across this anti-Mormon stuff that had shaken his testimony. Elder Bednar asked him how straight he would like his answer. The young man said he'd like it straight. Elder Bednar said "I've known about all of that stuff since I was 12 years old. Where have you been? Do you think the church has time to argue with all of that nonsense? Don't you think it has trust in its returned missionaries to study about it and find out for themselves that it's all bologna?"
He went on to say that the issue this man had was not the anti-Mormon material. It was lack of studying the Book of Mormon. He said to us "It's like we're in a dark room, and the Lord gives us a flashlight, we turn it off and complain when we start bumping into the walls!" Then he said something that really stuck with me, in connection with that analogy: "If sometime when you're home from your mission, you are really tired one night and you think to yourself 'oh, I'll just read tomorrow,' I hope my voice right now comes back and haunts you and says to you 'You idiot!'" (yes, he did say idiot) "'You're turning off the flashlight! DON'T turn off the flashlight!'"

I just love the fact that the Church is apparently putting so much trust in its returned missionaries. Jeremy Runnells, anyone? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I were to show this to my family, I guarantee you my dad would go off on some bullshit rant about "the Lord's timing" and how all the people who died in the Great Potato Famine did so because it was God's will and the families of the deceased needed those trials and plural marriage was truly a commandment given to Joseph and what President Hinckley said about condemning the practice is not the Church contradicting itself and he "knows" all these things because of his feelings and personal experiences that I have chosen not to understand.

	<TEXT> Avoid statements such as "let me know if there's anything I can do to help" and instead rephrase them as direct questions like "what can I do today that would help you?" It's important to be there for them rather than just saying you will be and then blatantly prioritizing other things. Probably the most important thing, though, is to make sure they know that you're not disappointed in them for having to come home early and that it isn't their fault. It's really easy to feel inadequate and somehow worth less than other missionaries when your attempt to serve the Lord is ruined by something not under your control. Becoming an ERM is a very emotionally taxing and stressful experience--I did it less than a month ago, and even though coming home was exactly what I wanted, it was still hard, and I HATED my mission. Can't imagine how awful it feels for somebody much more invested than I was. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I'm a returned missionary who has discovered that the Church isn't true, and when I tell my parents, my entire life will be destroyed. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I live in a family of extremely devout Mormons. And so, of course, it was drilled into my head from a very young age that it was God's will for me to serve a mission, and if I didn't I was a bad Church member and loved myself more than God. I never truly wanted to go on a mission--the very concept was repulsive to me--but I always told my parents that I did so they would be proud of me. I guess I hoped that if I kept telling myself I wanted to go, it would one day be the truth. Unfortunately, that day never came.

After graduating high school in 2015,  I still wanted to live up to the Mormon Boy expectation that had been shoved down my throat my whole life, because what else was I going to do? And so despite having absolutely no idea whether or not the Church was true (I had read the Book of Mormon cover-to-cover three times, prayed every time, and felt absolutely nothing--everybody told me that I just needed to exercise more faith and the answer would eventually come), I wasted six months of my life trying to get my mission papers submitted and ultimately getting into the mission field. It took longer than I anticipated because I've had severe depression for a lot of years and the mission office initially rejected my submission, requesting that I receive counseling for said depression and that I could re-submit in a few months. Long story short, my counselor and medical doctor decided that the depression was not severe enough to warrant medication, and I was sent out into the field with nothing but prayer and "the Spirit" to keep me afloat. And since God apparently decided that the commandments are different if you're a missionary, all my coping mechanisms such as movies, video games, music, secular books, etc. were no longer available to me. I had nothing but the gospel. So, with my depression and lack of solid testimony in tow, I trudged out into the field and lasted no more than seven weeks--the hardest, longest, most painful seven weeks of my life.

The more time I spent being around the Church and really REALLY thinking about it, the more it began to fall apart in my mind. So much of it just didn't make sense or hold up to scrutiny. I could go into detail on all the inconsistencies and contradictions I found within the gospel, but I would be here for days just trying to remember all of them, and everyone here has already heard them or discovered them already. The most important thing is that I read the Book of Mormon for at least an hour every day, prayed every single time afterwards to receive the witness promised in Moroni 10, and I never felt a thing. So much for God loving all his children and desiring them to gain witness of the truth...

It wasn't too long before I realized that whether or not the gospel was true, I absolutely refused to devote myself to preaching it for two years. But despite my severely weakened testimony (not to mention my unbearable depression), going back home to good ol' Happy Valley Utah on purpose wasn't an option to me, because I knew it would bring shame worse than death and it would destroy everything I had ever lived for.

So I chose death.

Fortunately I chickened out at the last second and didn't go through with it, and even more fortunately, my attempted suicide was enough to get me an honorable medical release for depression. I've been home for about a month now and I cannot describe how relieved I am to be free of the hell of serving a mission, especially without the accompanying guilt and shame that I initially feared.

So ever since I got home, I've been spending my days doing whatever I want, and everybody's okay with it because they figure I'm just dealing with my depression and they see that I'm doing better. What they don't know is that I immediately stopped reading the scriptures and saying prayers when I got home. And I feel so much happier. It's also worth mentioning that my low point of every single week is attending church, which is pretty much the only gospel-related thing I still do. So now there's just way too much evidence that the gospel doesn't make me happy.

Two days ago I decided to lay this nightmare to rest and decide whether or not I'm staying in the Church. And I knew I wasn't getting any reasonable or reliable answers from Church material (Moroni's promise, anyone?) so I searched Google for "why I left the Mormon church" and found loads of accounts of people who had once loved the Church but left for various reasons. By the time I was done watching this video [ www.youtube.com/watch?v=nj9uLK-Z1MM ], I knew I was leaving too, and by the time I was done reading the CES Letter, I was absolutely furious. The sheer amount of lies hiding right under my nose for so many years is baffling to me and I'm almost more angry at myself than I am at the Church just because I didn't notice these things sooner in my life. Naturally, I didn't go to church or participate in family scripture study today, and my family has no idea why, but my dad is already mad at me and thinks I'm going inactive because of my depression. He doesn't know the half of it...

My decision to leave has become even more solidified by my experience tonight of having dinner with some very close family friends of mine. It just so happened that they had the missionaries over for dinner as well, and partway through the dinner conversation, I casually asked these missionaries how they dealt with situations in which people read the Book of Mormon, prayed continually and earnestly, but never received the spiritual witness promised by Moroni. "I've heard of this happening before," I said, "and I just wonder how you deal with that from a missionary perspective." (These guys had no idea that I was ever a missionary.)

The senior companion, who had been out for 23 months, said, "If they haven't gotten the spiritual witness, it means that they aren't keeping the commitments we give them."

"How do you know they aren't keeping commitments?" I asked him. "Do you ask them directly? Or do they admit it, maybe?"

His response was, "No, no. I can just tell."

"How can you tell?"

"Well... uh, because they haven't received the witness yet. That's how I know. Like, I can tell it's always something they're doing wrong, like with their faith or devotion or something."

Well, Mr. Shining Golden Example, I'm sorry that the seven weeks I spent on a mission for a Church I didn't know was true praying for a witness I never got and ultimately trying to end my life to avoid going home early wasn't enough "faith or devotion or something" for God.


So now I'm in a very rough situation. The Church isn't true, and I'm more sure of that after two days of research than I was about the Church being true after 19 years of doing what the Church says to do to find out. In a sense, I'm very excited, because I finally get to be free of this manipulative, brainwashing, fraudulent cult that I've been trapped in for almost one-quarter of my expected life. But at the same time, I'm more scared than I ever have been--not because I suddenly don't know if there's a God or a next life or who I am or what my purpose is, but actually because of a much more immediate threat: my family.

My family is not the type to literally disown me and kick me out because I choose to leave the Church. But they are the type to despise me for the choice and refuse to listen to anything I have to say. For the rest of my life they will see me as nothing but the evil, fallen child who is the cause of the empty chair in our reserved family circle in the Celestial Kingdom, and by the time I'm finally able to move out, I guarantee you that I will not come up in conversation without mention of my terrible apostasy. My uncle left the Church many years ago and my mom never talks about him unless she wants to gossip about his lack of faith. It's like she doesn't even consider him a brother anymore. It's disgusting and inhuman. I don't want to become that son.

Also, I've been planning my whole life to go to BYU, but now I refuse to because I would never be able to get married and I wouldn't be able to restrain myself from giving a copy of the CES Letter to everyone I see. I also just don't want to attend a university with Brigham Young's name plastered on it, or with the Church involved at all, for that matter. But how will I get the money to go somewhere else if my dad withdraws financial support as a result of my decision? And up until I somehow manage to move out and I've found somewhere else to go to college (which, considering admission deadlines and whatnot, will probably take a long time) and I'm still living at home, how do I deal with my family who will treat me like a lost sheep and see me as absolutely nothing else for every second of every day? I have to leave the Church, that much is certain, but I just have no idea how I'm going to deal with it. It's making my head hurt and honestly the suicidal thoughts are coming back as I realize what my life will be like after this comes out. I guess my chances of going through with it are pretty low this time, though, considering that I probably don't have an afterlife to look forward to anymore.

TL;DR - I'm leaving the Church but I have no idea how to deal with the repercussions that will come as a result of it in regards to my family, my education, and basically just my entire life situation.

How do I tell my parents and siblings? What's the ideal setting and how much should I explain about what I've learned? Should I invite them to read the CES Letter so they might see what I now see? Where's a good place for an ex-Mormon to go to college in Utah? How can I possibly afford it without the help of my parents? How do I stay strong when I've already had suicidal tendencies and now my entire life has crumbled to bits and it will be pretty much destroyed completely once my parents find out about this decision?

Any advice you guys can give me is absolutely needed and appreciated. This is probably the second-most difficult situation I've ever been in (second only to the hellhole that was my mission) and I'm in severe need of help.

Thanks in advance.

EDIT: Wow, I seriously cannot put into words how grateful I am for all the support I've received on this thread in just 24 hours. I expected some good responses but this exceeded my hopes and expectations. Thank you all for your amazing advice and sincere love. (More sincere love than I ever felt from the Church, that's for sure.)

I haven't told my parents yet, and I'm still trying to decide whether to do a slow fade like most of you have suggested or to just tell them straight up, along with the decision of moving out or not before doing the latter. There certainly seem to be pros and cons to all scenarios, so I will give it some time and careful consideration. Thank you all for your experiences and suggestions on this. I'm leaning toward giving them a slightly edited copy of this post so they can see my true feelings and my hesitations in being a disappointment to them. But, like I said, I'll give it time and thought before doing anything like that.

I'm feeling a lot more confident now in regards to my future, and I can see now that I have a great support system under me. The people on this sub are marvelous, I have a few VERY close friends who left or are in the process of leaving the Church, and I now suddenly realize that BYU isn't the only college in the state. USU is looking pretty appealing--the closest friend I had in my ward growing up is currently attending there and left the Church several months ago. Immediate connection. I also have relatives up there who I could fall back on if things get rough, or even if I don't want to pay for housing. The downside is that they're LDS. Oh well, things to consider.

I'll continue taking all of these comments into thoughtful consideration, and I'll continue coming to the realization that my life doesn't have to suck right now. I can't thank you all enough. </TEXT>
