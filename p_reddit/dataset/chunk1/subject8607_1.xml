http://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/02/politics/02REAG.html

 WASHINGTON, March 1  President Reagan said today that the rebels seeking to overthrow the Nicaraguan Government were the ''moral equal of our Founding Fathers.''

 In a speech to the annual conference of the Conservative Political Action Conference here, he renewed his call for Congressional approval of $14 million in aid for the rebels.

 Mr. Reagan also strongly appealed for support of the proposed research program on a space-based defense system against nuclear weapons and said conservative ideology was now the mainstream of American public thought. </TEXT>

He also said:

 "You have an expansionist Islam and you have an expansionist China. Right? They are motivated. Theyre arrogant. Theyre on the march. And they think the Judeo-Christian west is on the retreat."

and

 "The one thing the Chinese fear more than America...they fear Christianity more than anything."

and

	<TEXT> The U.S. passenger port at San Ysidro is the busiest in the Western Hemisphere, and the cargo crossing point in Otay Mesa is the second busiest on the U.S.-Mexico border, processing more than 6,000 trucks a day. Including non-cargo traffic, it's over 130,000 vehicles - a large portion of which are commuters as well as tourists and travelers. 

The large cross-border traffic generates billions of dollars in taxable business income for San Diego, and delays in cross-border traffic are estimated to cost millions in opportunity losses, as well as costing thousands of jobs. Traffic demand is so high, 60% of cross-border travelers say they'd be willing to pay a toll to use a faster entry port. </TEXT>
