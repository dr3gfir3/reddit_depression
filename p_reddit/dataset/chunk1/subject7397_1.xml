	<TEXT> So I'm sure you all know that the vocal sample at the beginning of "Champion" is Steely Dan's "Kid Charlemagne" but I just noticed something, [look at the album art for Steely Dan's *A Decade of Steely Dan.*](http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/lyricwiki/images/0/04/Steely_Dan_-_A_Decade_Of_Steely_Dan.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090526205429) Look familiar? Lol                                       
I'm sure this doesn't really mean anything but I thought it was an interesting coincidence </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I just cried watching an episode of The Simpsons </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-11 01:34:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The episode is S01E06 "Moaning Lisa", and in the episode Lisa is going through a bout of depression and it does a great job at portraying what its like having these feelings and the importance of other people accepting and legitimizing them. [This scene in particular made me cry.](http://youtu.be/RPtsTt5yWwM)                                                       
That scene hit me hard because I've recently been very depressed and my mother refuses to acknowledge that it's a real problem and brushes it off as just a "lack of God" in my life. Basically she is Marge in the first half of that scene, before she realizes how wrong she is. Anyways, that's a whole other can of worms. I recommend this episode to everyone here.  </TEXT>

This song is so fucking good, it is definitely one of Kanye's most down-to-earth and "real" songs. How the fuck can all these people bash him as an asshole when he puts out stuff like this and Hey Mama?                                                         
Anyways, I really really love this song and I feel that it needs to be appreciated more. What are your thoughts on this song? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This song is really striking a chord with me lately. The feeling of emptiness and isolation is so spot-on....I think I've listened to this song about twenty times this month.                                                    
Aside from my personal connection with it, it's just an all-around beautiful song. The piano, the horns, the drums, John's delivery of the lines, it's all fucking *perfect.* The way the horn section crescendos at certain parts sends chills down my spine every time.                                           
*In old movies people scream               
Choking on their fists when they see shadows like these                               
But no one screams cuz it's just me                                   
Locked up in myself                                      
Never gonna get free*                                                

This song is PERFECTION.  </TEXT>

*This Year* by Old 97s                                     
*Lion's Teeth* by Father John Misty                              
And honestly, I don't think anyone could do a cover of *Pale Green Things* that would do the original justice.  </TEXT>
