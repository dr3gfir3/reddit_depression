	<TEXT> It's true that its not over until all 5 FCC commissioners sing. And even then it's not actually over until we defend this victory in Congress and in court. BUT-- the little guys (and gals, and everyone else) of the Internet definitely do deserve to celebrate right now.

Even the fact that the FCC is going to vote on Title II rules on Thursday is literally something that people thought was impossible just a year ago. The internet has changed what is and isn't possible in washington, DC and that transformative power is exactly what the net neutrality fight is all about preserving.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah no, that's not what they mean at all. "Regulated like a utility" just means that they'll be using Title II "common carrier" rules, basically simple, bright line rules that ban Cable companies from abusing their gatekeeper power. 

This won't change the way you pay for your Internet, or make your ISP more like your water company, or anything like that. 

The Internet has flourished with net neutrality as a guiding principle since its beginnings. Comcast and Verizon et al want to break that principle so they can extract more profits -- the FCC was more than ready to do that until tons and tons of people spoke out and rose up.

This is a huge win for the public, don't get fooled by partisan nonsense in Congress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When the media says the FCC is going to "regulate the Internet like water and electricity," they just mean that the legal mechanism that they will use to prevent discrimination is similar to the ones used to prevent water or electric companies from abusing their often near-monopoly status. 

Net neutrality protections will actually prevent the exact thing you are afraid of: it's just basic rules that prevent ISP's from charging websites and apps more for access to internet users. 

None of this is going to make your Internet company more like your water company, or anything like that -- the internet has flourished with net neutrality as a guiding principle since its beginnings, the FCC's move toward Title II is just enshrining that principle and making it illegal for monopolistic companies to break it and abuse their power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for posting this. For me as an activist, it drove me freakin nuts when all the media came out with headlines about "Obama's plan for the Internet."

We had to fight tooth and nail to get the White House to endorse Title II reclassification and real net neutrality. Obama appointed FCC chairman (and former Cable company lobbyist) Tom Wheeler. We moved heaven and earth to get that guy to cave in to the public pressure finally get to where things are today.

This was not "Obama's plan for the Internet" -- it's what leading academics, Internet companies, free speech advocates, journalists, and millions of people have been calling for for years. Obama just happened to be President when we demanded it most loudly, and finally came through on his campaign promises around it.

I'm not really much into either political party, but one thing is for sure: we should not allow partisan nonsense in DC derail the biggest victory for the Internet since SOPA -- [we have to keep Congress from screwing this up.](https://battleforthenet.com/countdown) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No it's actually the opposite -- reclassifying under Title II would lead to *more* competition. It's separate from the issue of municipalities creating their own ISPs, but related, because Comcast et al have been lobbying hard for years and literally writing local and state laws that prevent that from happening, to keep themselves as the only choice.

I totally agree with you that the government screws all of us over. I just know that they work hand in hand with entrenched institutions like Comcast and Verizon to do it. That's why I support net neutrality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We decided to meet the lobbyists head on by building tools that make it super easy for people to contact their government officials en masse. That's been the secret to the success of the net neutrality movement so far. Lobbyists from AT T and comcast are always down at the fcc whispering in their ear, so we built www.callthefcc.com to make it easy for people to flood them with phone calls. Same goes for Congress so we built this scoreboard so people can tweet and call their reps with a few clicks https://battleforthenet.com/scoreboard

Lobbying money can buy a lot of influence in DC, but in the end, politicians are worried about votes, and if we can build enough of a grassroots movement to make an issue politically toxic (like SOPA for example) we can win big victories for the public interest even with our totally broken political system.

	<TEXT> Some problems with this argument:

-The market we have is anything but free, thanks to the influence that large monopolies have in Washington, DC

-The relationship between giant corporations like Comcast and the U.S. government is cozier than I think any of us are comfortable with. Net neutrality is a basic principle that's been around since the beginning of the Internet. Cable companies want to break it so that they can REGULATE THE INTERNET for their own profit. But once there is a system in place for regulating internet traffic, slowing down (or even blocking) some sites and speeding up others, don't think that the government won't call in their favors to Comcast when they want to censor something or control the flow of information.

-Net neutrality is not a "government takeover of the Internet" -- it's common sense rules that are based on how the Internet was built. It prevents Cable companies --who have been using their government connections to become local monopolies -- from abusing their gatekeeper power.

-Net neutrality / Title II doesn't give the government ANY power to "regulate the Internet" or "regulate Internet content" -- it is a set of rules saying that Internet Service Providers like Comcast and Verizon can't discriminate.

	<TEXT> Hey everyone,

I'm Evan. I work for Fight for the Future, one of the groups helping organize the [Internet Countdown](https://battleforthenet.com/countdown). 

It's awesome that this conversation is taking off and people are excited to talk about net neutrality and what it means for all of us Internet users. 

I just wanted to put a few helpful links all in one place in this thread, cuz links are good.

1) Email and call your reps: https://battleforthenet.com

2) Join the Internet Countdown with your website, blog, tumblr, or twitter: https://battleforthenet.com/countdown

	<TEXT> Technically, Verizon successfully sued the FCC to strike down the existing net neutrality protections we had last year.

But fortunately, everything we are hearing says the new net neutrality protections we are about to get thanks to massive public outcry, are way stronger than the ones Verizon sued to strike down.

So much so that they have actually been advocating for basically the regs that they sued to strike down, since they've lost so much ground in this debate.

So... go internet? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this is technically a U.S. policy fight, but it actually will affect every internet user in the world. If the U.S. loses net neutrality protections, the Internet ecosystem fundamentally changes. The next iteration of apps, websites, ideas, etc. that would have / could have come out of the U.S. might not be able to get off the ground if there is no longer a level playing field. The Internet doesn't really know borders. People all over the world read blogs, use apps, or check out content that originates in the U.S. Whenever any government or corporation limits Internet freedom anywhere, it affects Internet users everywhere.

Finally, other countries are looking closely at how the U.S. deals with this. We need to get it right. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Start following some of the organizations working on this issue. This is going to be a longterm fight, and there will be more fights after this one, so get involved for the long haul!

2) Call your reps right now using the tool at https://battleforthenet.com -- i know this seems really small, but this is one of those moments where public pressure on lawmakers really does make all the difference. Tell them you're a law student, explain why net neutrality matters to you. 

3) Get some other students together at your school and organize a panel, protest, or other event about net neutrality to help spread the word and get more people involved. you can contact me at evan@fightforthefuture.org if you want some advice on that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Evan here from Fight for the Future. I am our campaigns guru and probably the least technical person on our team to answer this question. But here's my thoughts.

Basically, we at FFTF generally think that we should fight to make the Internet a better place with whatever tools we have available. For most issues, this involves a two-prong approach of fighting with policy and fighting with technology.

My personal hope is that advances in technology will lead to more decentralization that makes the gatekeeper power that Comcast et al have right now obsolete. But in the meantime, I think it's super crucial that we fight with everything we have to make sure that we have strong rules that protect the Internet from abuse by Cable companies that have a near monopoly on so many people's access to information. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I have male privilege even though I am not a man </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-01 22:16:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I posted this on my FB this morning and thought people here might be interested in reading it. xo

This may be too heavy for New Years day, but...

I have male privilege even though I am not a man.

This is something I've been thinking about a lot and talking to a few people about so I thought I'd write something about it here. Most of you probably already know that I identify as transgender and genderqueer. I made a transition a few years ago from presenting my gender in a more masculine way to generally presenting it in a much more feminine way, with lots of daily fluctuation that feels good to me.

I don't identify as a man, and I haven't in quite some time. But I do identify as a person with male privilege. I don't speak for any other trans or transfeminine person, just myself. But I'd really like for there to be a conversation amongst transfeminine people about male privilege and if/how we have/experience it. I know for a fact I have it and that it has benefited me in many (unjust) ways. I also know trans women who do not feel like they have male privilege, and feel like they never had it and never identified as a man. I affirm their experiences while starting this conversation. I also should say outright that "Trans-Exclusive Radical Feminism" is total BS and this conversation should not in any way feed that vile nonsense.

Here are some ways that I feel like I experience male privilege:

First and foremost, when I am out and about in the world, many people perceive me as a man. That's a funny kind of privilege, because it also means that many people misgender me, contributing to the oppression that I experience as a trans and gender nonconforming person. Being misgendered hurts, but it also means that I often don't experience sexism the way that other feminine-identified people do. That's a very real privilege that benefits me in often unseen ways. Within activist groups, when I speak on a panel or give a TV interview, and in other public settings, while people may be confused or annoyingly intrigued by my gender deviance, I am often afforded a speaking status that I can only describe as relating to my male privilege. People listen to me and consider my opinions to be authoritative in a way that they do not respect the opinions of many people who consistently present more feminine than me.

It's worth highlighting the way I phrased that last point: this has nothing to do with biology or genitalia. This is about how people identify and present throughout their lives, and how socialization impacts all of us.

Moving on, the second way that I experience male privilege is, I think, the more significant one. I was socialized as a boy. Along with my white privilege and class privilege, being socialized as male meant that I was encouraged to pursue my dreams and afforded opportunities that many people are not. Probably the most obvious example of this is my music "career." As a young boy, I was encouraged to play guitar and sing, I was bombarded with copious media representations of men playing music. I could easily imagine myself being them, or at least aspiring to be them. When I started performing, I was a boy and identified as such and I did not face traditional sexism while touring, booking shows, dealing with sound engineers, etc. etc.

Being raised as a boy means that I was essentially taught, both directly and subconsciously, that I was superior to women and other feminine people, for a huge portion of my formative years. In the same way that I experience the class privilege I benefited from growing up even though I am now relatively poor, I continue to benefit, unjustly, from the male privilege that I have had all my life, even though I no longer identify as male.

There are many flavors of trans experience. Mine is that I didn't really question my gender too much until I was in my twenties. I experienced a lot of bullying and social punishment growing up that I can now understand as relating to gender-deviance, but it wasn't something that I thought about through that lens at the time the way that many trans youth experience it. I definitely don't feel like my life experiences, even as a kid, were the same as most cis-men, but they also weren't the same as cis-women or the same as many trans women. So, I acknowledge that It's possible my experience of male privilege is not widely shared among other transfeminine people. But my guess is there are definitely some (maybe a bunch?) of other transfeminine people out there who experience male privilege in some of the same ways that I do. I think it'd be cool for us to get tea together sometime and talk about it.

In conclusion (don't they tell you not to use that in high school writing class?)  Let's end sexism. It will be awesome. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Okay listen I know we're not supposed to have petitions and stuff here but there are less than 3 hours left to submit comments to the FCC about net neutrality. Everyone needs to do this -- be heard. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> This is the thing -- there won't be any video of his speech, [according to a tweet from RSA.](https://twitter.com/RSAConference/status/413340531302072320) -- so if he roasts them, no one will hear it. He can draw a lot more attention by backing out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One really important thing to note. RSA has said [in a tweet](https://twitter.com/RSAConference/status/413340531302072320) that there will be NO video of Colbert's speech. So if he roasts them, no one will hear it. He'll do a lot more good by backing out and joining the organized boycott of the conference. </TEXT>
