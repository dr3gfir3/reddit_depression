	<TEXT> It could keep be anything at this point. You not being able to boot to safe mod. It can be a motherbord problem, hard drive dying. Ram not working well. It could even be your power supply or your graphics card dying. So what happens, does your computer goes black and restart? 
Does it freeze and you have to restart manually? 
Try removing 1 ram slot. 
Try another gpu without drivers. 
Install Windows in another hard drive. 
Best of luck mate  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pre alphas or so called Pre released games are becoming more more frequent. 
You have to understand that when games are doing that they need a majority of players. 
To even see if they game has no hype flaws , be tweaked or maybe change its course. 
Look at killing floor 2 when they announced micro transactions. 
Dayz when it's hasn't seen the light of the word beta. 
H1z1 "said no micro transactions" which they lied about. 
And people stay pay for it. 
Waiting for that sweet sweet release. 
Trust me on this. If they don't have a official date and yet released the game as early access. 
It's legal scam. Who ever thinks it's ok to have unfinished games needs to be slap with a wet fish. 
Stop following this trend  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am leaving the game or Cuz heart of thorns was a huge disappointment for me. 
No new dungeons 
Meta huge grind events. 
Raids. Not even sure why they called Raids. 
1 new map for pvp. 
People defending this content is what hurting the game. 
Not even get me started on pvp. 
Disable new traits for f2p and non heart of thorns players it's a huge Wtf.
That's disabling the base core of a game. 
It's just forcing you to buy the expansion.
