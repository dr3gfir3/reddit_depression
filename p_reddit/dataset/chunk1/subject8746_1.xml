	<TEXT> The Wrath and The Dawn by Renee Ahdieh is a popular one now, though I haven't read it. I have read Don Quixote by Miguel de Cervantes, and it's similar in the sense of stories within the story. I highly recommend it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do understand. From what I remember I did. By changing my story it looked suspicious. I realize that. When you told me it wasn't plausible I realized my memory of that exact detail isn't right, so I changed it to make more sense. I did look on some site and it did condemn that house for some crime from what I remember. I'm not sure how to explain it for you to understand. If you want me to admit that what I first put was false then it is, but it wasn't false in my mind. Sorry for upsetting you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His favorite meal? Check. Sexy new dress? Check. He won't be able to help himself you think to yourself. Smiling you fix your hair once more. A clatter downstairs signals his return. You rush downstairs before he has a chance to escape to his room. He glances up at the sound of your approaching footsteps. He immediately notices the dress, and grimaces. 

He reminds you again why being together will lead only to heartache. You ignore his tired diatribe. Placing your hand on his bicep you try to lead him to the prepared meal. He doesn't budge. Sometimes super strength isn't as handy as you would think. You try your heat vision on his feet. This only angers him further. You've reluctantly left him to stew in his bedroom. The danger notification alarm goes off, and you hurriedly get into costume. He is waiting for you in the vehicle.

It is your arch nemesis Lady Electric, she's siphoning all the energy from the city. He tries to restrain her with his rubber arms, but she gets free. She directs her attack on you. The electricity courses through your veins as she relentlessly tries to end your life. He manages to restrain her once again while you are on the floor trying to remain conscious. With a sudden burst of energy he knocks her unconscious. While the police deal with her he carries you away. 

Three days later after you have fully recovered he comes home with your favorite flowers, and your favorite takeout meal. You are overjoyed with the surprise. He smiles, and tells you he doesn't want to waste another second ignoring your advances. He has realized life without you is meaningless. You embrace him tightly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Already the sun was setting behind the circus tent. Bears balancing on their balls were lead away by their trainers. Cougars were brought in as the next act. Damian cracked his whip to get them in line. Electricity seemed to fell the tent as the cougars drew closer to him. Five of them leaped at once. Giving way to a slight of hand Damian produced a wand which in turn made the cougars freeze mid air. Hysterics broke out in the audience. It never failed to impress me as well. Jaunting forward he takes a bow. 

Kneeling behind the bleachers has grown painful. Lifting up one leg at a time I shake the sleep from them. Mariam waves me over from behind the curtain. Of course she chastises me about being careful not to dirty my new dress. Phoenixes adorn the hem and bodice of it. Quickly, grabbing my hand she leads me further back stage. Refraining from yelping I try to keep up. Stopping in front of Damian's dressing room she lets go of my hand and pushes me in closing the door behind me. Turning around the room I slowly inspect the familiar surrounding. 

Underneath one of the top hats I find a ring box. Velvet graze my shaking fingers. Whirling around I drop the box when I hear the door open. Xylophone players accompany Damian's entrance. "Yes? Is your answer yes?" His voice full of earnest. Zealous cheers follow our kiss.  </TEXT>

My best friend sighs and shakes her head when she discovers a part of my paperwork. She doesn't understand. She wasn't the klutz who tripped and fell in front of her crush. The humiliation is still fresh, and now he would never see me as a potential mate. Just three more days until it is in effect. 

*Five Days Later*

I'm walking with him, and I'm certain he is going to ask me out. His proposition is about to leave his lips, but I'm now on the floor having tripped over my own foot. He offers his hand-his face full of concern. I refuse the help, and hurriedly run away. I again have to avoid him for a month in order to have all the paperwork done once more.  </TEXT>

You hurry to stop the commotion. No one answers to you pounding at the door. The noises continue so you use the master key to open the door. When you try to push it open it won't budge. Thus, you continue pounding at the door in addition to screaming at them to open up. 

A few minutes later the noises stop, and the door is opened ajar. Your tenant looks battered with bruises and cuts. He is apologizing profusely for the commotion. You are resigned to give him one more chance since you've never had any problems with him before. 

Three weeks later you are watching the news, "Our beloved superhero Captain Magnus is still missing. If you have any information concerning his whereabouts please contact your local authori-." You hurry upstairs.

	<TEXT> He gave me a dozen long stemmed red roses (he seems so happy, so I don't tell him I'm allergic) today to celebrate our three months together fighting as a team, and to congratulate me on a job well done apprehending the five would be bank robbers alone. I won't tell him I stole a thousand dollars from the money bags before the police got there in order to help Tina down the street win the Girl Scout cookie selling competition. 

He told me to put on dressy civilian clothes today to go to dinner to celebrate our five months of fighting crime together. I don't tell him I stole the expensive watch from the rich lady who didn't give any change to the homeless man in front of the restaurant. The homeless man's smile and repeated gratitude is confirmation enough that I did the right thing.

It's been a year now, today he gives me a silver heart shaped locket in addition to the dozen long stemmed red roses. The crime alert siren ends our kiss abruptly. We save all the orphans from the burning building. I don't tell him I commit insurance fraud in order to have the orphanage rebuilt. 

Today marks a year and 2 months. We just finished stopping The Great Magotine from completing his death ray. It was weird seeing my old boss again. At least he didn't recognize me. That would have been an awkward reunion. "Captain Razor!" "Lady Flora!" "Over here, please! Smile big for the camera!" I sigh loudly. He restrains me from taking the camera from the reporter. That's fine. I don't tell him I let my brother escape. 

It's a year and ten months today. He gives me the diamond ring, and a dozen long stemmed red roses at our favorite restaurant. I say yes to his proposal. I resign myself to tell him I'm allergic to red roses, but I don't tell him I'm hiding my brother in our basement.
