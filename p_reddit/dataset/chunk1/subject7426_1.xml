	<TEXT> So I'm relatively new to this subreddit and new to the series (started it in Feb and just started HoC today) but I wanted to give a shout out to how awesome this community is. While this could have easily been an elitist subreddit filled with spoiler-dropping jerks, everyone is super aware of newcomers to the series (thanks in a large part to the great spoiler tagging system here).  This subreddit has also been great for venting/letting loose with each emotional catharsis the series throws at us. With no one to turn to in real life (I try to explain the plot and they are like "dinosaurs with swords for hands? whaaat?") this community has been great.

TL;DR - You get an upvote! You get an upvote! Everyone gets an upvote! [Spoiler DG](/s " (Except for you, Rallick Nom. No upvote for you.) EDITED: Fuck you Mallick Rel. Rallick Nom, you're swell.") </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll carry over advice from another thread - binge the last 100ish pages of MoI in one sitting. With some comfort food. And something for snuggles. In the quiet dignity of your own private space.

In other words, so goooood! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh god - I'm still sorting through all the death and destruction. I think one thing that struck me was [MoI Spoiler](/s "the transition from Lady Envy being a fun character to her being frustratingly cold and indifferent to all but her affairs. Her reunion with Picker's forces really tore me up. I hadn't thought I'd connected with Detoran as much as I did and her death was the worst...you know, after all the other major character deaths up to this point.")

Looking back at DG, the end of that book was also pretty traumatic, but Kalam's bits provided a little bit of relief from the Chain of Dogs arc. I never really worry for Kalam, he's just too bad ass. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm reading the series for the first time and just finished MoI on my lunch break today. I am rekt. The conclusion to this book just finished me - fatality. Here's a pro tip for those starting MoI - let yourself binge the last 100 pages all at once in a place where breaking down into uncontrollable sobs and dry heaves is acceptable.

Now, to go reclaim my dignity... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hahah I got a good laugh out of this post. I think I was so emotionally drained by the end of DG that this betrayal and Pormqual's general douchbaginess werejust one more notch on the totem pole of shock. Fuck Mallick Rell indeed though. Can't hate the puppet (too much) when the master's hand is so far up its ass... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a popular hang-up with a live-action adaptation is the sheer volume of casting and the fact that, as the show goes on, it would be hard to hide the aging of the actors. With how dense each book is (and if this hypothetical series is as faithful as we'd like it to be), I think the actors would age far more rapidly than their characters. Additionally, many roles would be put on hold for long periods of time (i.e. Whiskyjack during all of DG) and keeping actors on a retainer like that can be costly and unrealistic.

But don't get me wrong, a live action of this universe (we can dream!) would be bad ass! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently (well, about three months ago) picked the series up and am about 100 pages from the end of MoI. GotM was a good, albeit tough read even for someone used to gluttonously devouring fantasy. I would reckon that NOT having a large familiarity with typical fantasy tropes might be a bonus for this series - you don't become preoccupied in trying to find some form of familiarity to cling to.

If you decided to pick up GotM again, power through. It started to be really rewarding at the halfway point when all the main characters of that book had been introduced and the world started to settle for me. If you make it through to DG, there's a bit of culture shock similar to starting GotM, but to a lesser extent. I found DG, while longer, better written and more focused. MoI only improves this and brings back all the characters you loved from GotM.  If you make it through MoI and still aren't into it, I would probably take a (hard) pass on the series. I know a lot of folks say try to make it through MT, but even three books is a large commitment, much less five.

One additional tip for GotM - much of the beginning of the book takes place in different regions of the world than are provided on the maps. If you are careful to avoid spoilers, there are wikis with maps that can help you at least get your geographic bearings. That was a huge hang-up for me right off the bat - I love my maps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd check out the wikis; Fextralife has some good/decent/passable art up now. It's mostly in the form of screenshots but if you ended up drawing the cards, they would be a useful reference. The official guide also has a lot of really awesome art in it - if you own it or can get your hands on one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So some thoughts on the minor arcana, because who doesn't love the minor arcana?  I don't have much reasoning to back these up except my ability to use Wikipedia and I bought a deck of tarot cards once that came with a book. Aka I'm *probably* an expert....

[...so take this with a grain of salt.](#spoiler)

*I'm also going to assume that since the main post was tagged with spoilers and that this tread is discussing tarot in relation to game themes and characters, my post may contain spoilers. So cover your eyes if you're not into that sort of thing!*

**Wands/Clubs/Fire**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the peasantry, and also of creativity and will. 
In divination, the suit of wands represents the element of fire and gives information relating to the traits of the fire element in astrology. Additionally it represents the peasant or farmer class of feudal society (the Latin suit is commonly called Staves or Rods), and relates to simplicity and to nature, as well as to poverty and submission.

I feel the beastly hunting Yharnamites are well represented by this suit. They are of the lowest rung in Bloodborne and bear the burdens and effects of the major player's actions. If not for the Church and College's quest for eldritch truth, perhaps the Yharnamites would not be in so much pain and suffering.

**Coins/Diamonds/Earth**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the merchants, and also of material body or possessions. 
In occult and divinatory usage the suit is connected with the classical element of Earth, the physical body and possessions or wealth. Coins as a Latin suit represent the feudal class of traders, and therefore to worldly matters in general. Associated physical characteristics include dark hair and eyes, dark complexion, and sturdy build.

I'm going to go with the nobility of Cainhurst here, though I'm not entirely certain why. Call it a gut feeling/my love for ~~Castlevania~~ this area of Bloodborne. Plus, Queen Annalise and Logharius are both tied to this world for eternity (well, until you kill the Martyr and/or don't revive Annalise after Alfred goes Barry the Butcher on her).

**Cups/Hearts/Water**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the clergy, and also of emotions and love.
 In tarot, the element of cups is water, and the suit of cups pertains to situations and events of an emotional nature. As such, when the tarot is used in divination, many cups signify an emotional issue or love situation, or some event that affects the querent emotionally. The watery astrological signs are Cancer, Scorpio and Pisces. Additionally, cups were the symbol of the clergy in feudal times, and thus cup cards can also be interpreted as having to do with spiritual or religious matters.

I'm going to go with the obvious interpretation here and have this suit representative of the Healing Church. While we only see the aftermath of the Church's mission in Bloodborne, we have to remember that their quest for Truth and the healing blood started with good intentions. Vicar Amelia reminds me of this each time I fight her - she still prays for the souls of Yharnam up until her ultimate corruption and transformation.

I could also see tying the Byrgenwerth College and Scholars into this because of how intertwined the two factions are. Though they may have split after the schism, it remains clear that both groups sought enlightenment for the greater good.

**Swords/Spades/Air**

Wikipedia tells me this suit is representative of the nobility and military, and also of reason. 
In tarot, swords correspond to the element of Air, and as such signifies freedom but also quick change. The Swords suit also traditionally represented the military, which implies strength, power and authority, but also responsibility, violence and suffering.

The Hunters, the Workshop, and the Powderkegs. Who has the power to cheat death? Who can dodge, dash and dismember like it's going out of style? Who bears the immediate and painful consequences of their actions? Who suffers in the solitude of self-reliance and isolation?  

----------

Anyway, these are my two cents. Feel free to run with them!
