	<TEXT> I'm moving out in a few months and this is all gonna go away but I feel like someone needs to know. I've been reading NoSleep stories for a while, but I've never had the courage to tell mine. I'm terrified, and I really need advice.

I'm going to University in September, which means I'm moving out of my parents house. I'm alone in the house a lot, but I tend to avoid staying alone overnight. Something about going to bed alone and there being no one about to help you if something sinister startles you in the night unsettled me; so I tend to stay with friends or have them stay over.

My house is in a small village in England, and when I say small I'm not exaggerating. There's a population of about 1,000 and it feels like the houses are invading on the property of nature, rather than the other way round. My house backs onto seemingly endless fields, separated from my back garden with a flimsy wooden fence. My parents moved here because it was quiet and there's never any problems with crime or anything. It seems perfect. And I cannot let the eerie goings on here eradicate the beauty of this little village. Rolling fields and forests of such beauty are difficult to find anywhere else other than here, and up until a few years ago they were just that.

Our road is a short dead end road with about 9 or 10 average sized houses. My neighbours on the left are old but still work. They have a fat dog who has seizures sometimes and the wife has cancer. They are irrelevant to my story. The other neighbours are the problem. They are a small family; two parents and a 8-year-old daughter called Ella Hughes. The parents, Nancy Hughes and Tom Hughes, are nice enough. They always contribute flapjacks to our annual road party and they are active members of the local church, which they attend every Sunday. 
They moved in shortly after us and we welcomed them kindly. My sister used to play with Ella when they were younger, until she decided she was more like 19 than 9. She stopped going around when I was about 15, and my sister was 10.

I always found it strange that we could see into their garden. In England, almost every house has fenced off gardens. We have a conservatory (a glass room) on the side of our house, and then a small path around it to our back gate. The Hughes fence is strangely low at one point, which they told us was because they didn't have enough wood. This was normal enough; they had high hedges that blocked off the rest of the garden. But there was still a good 5ft of low fencing that meant that from inside the conservatory I could see their back garden. 

It was an average back garden, with the typical derelict British trampoline due to the bad weather, and a small gardening patch where Nancy grew strawberries and sometimes potatoes.

Sometimes I'd go downstairs at night, and I'd hear noise from next door. Looking out, I'd see Tom walking around the garden in a weird fashion. He looked as if he was searching for something. I just assumed he'd lost something; they used their garden a lot.

The first big event was during the winter. I'd be studying hard for the mock exams I had the next day. It was around 1am and I'd just finished atomic structure, and I was fucking thirsty. I headed downstairs as quietly as I could to ensure no one else woke up. 

Half asleep, I watched the water pour into my glass, listening to the clock tick repeatedly. My boredom caused me to turn to the left, and my stomach dropped. I saw Tom standing by the short fence looking over. As our eyes locked he walked backwards, produced a torch and began looking around his garden and calling 'Milo', as if he was calling a dog, apart from the Hughes didn't have a dog. I was frozen, my glass overflowing, as I stood watching Tom. Every so often, the torch would come over the fence as he swept over the garden, and it'd linger for a second, catching me in its light.
I clutched my glass and ran upstairs. I couldn't turn off the lights, and my parents were so angry at me for leaving them on. 

The event shook me for a while or so. I couldn't go downstairs at night in fear I might see Tom. I began drinking water from our upstairs bathroom, which wasn't supposed to be drank. It made me sick sometimes, but it was better than facing the man downstairs.

My parents decided that on their anniversary in May, the year after this happened, they wanted to go away for a weekend. My sister headed off to her friends. I was too sick with the flu to go to a friend's house or have a friend over so I decided to brave it alone. 

I was 3 seasons into Criminal Minds, when I realised it was 2am. I realised I hadn't turned the lights off downstairs or locked any of the doors. Walking downstairs, suddenly the memories of Tom and his torch washed over me and I froze. I knew I had to lock the doors. He could come in. He knew I was home alone; my parents had asked Nancy to keep an eye on our flowers in the front yard and let me know if they needed watering. She might've told him. Shit.

I raced downstairs and locked the front door first. I ran towards the conservatory and then froze. There was Tom, slightly suspended over the fence. We made eye contact, and I felt my eyes prick with tears. He looked calm, ready. He locked eyes with me for a painfully long time. Well, I don't know how long it was. It felt like hours he stared at me. He then landed back in the other side of the fence, still keeping his eyes locked to mine. He produced a torch, began to sweep the guardian, and call for 'Milo'. Crying, I locked the back door. Tom froze as he heard the door lock, and he turned off the torch and stormed inside. 

It's like he knows. He knows when I'm vulnerable, and that's when he acts. Or maybe every night he comes over the fence, and I'm catching him whenever I'm there. 

I haven't gone downstairs a lot. And when I do, I keep my eyes away from the fence and turn every light on as I go. I'm afraid that me not noticing him has caused something else.

Later that year in September, I was day at my desk doing work late one night when I saw torch flashes out my blinds. 

As I began to shake, I stood up and peered out my blinds. Tom was walking across our garden with his torch in hand towards the our shed. The shed is big, more like a summer house (a small one room cabin). When we were younger, we'd have friends round in there and it'd be our house in roleplay games and bases in It or Tag. But now, it was full of rejected furniture and family pictures that we didn't want in the house but were too sentimental to throw away.

Tom, opened the unlocked door and walked in. I called out to my parents, who did not react. He was invading private property; at this point I had to tell someone. I called out repeatedly; desperate for someone to wake up. He heard me. He bolted out of the summer house with his arms full of something and back over to the fence. I screamed out again.

My dad came in, bleary eyed and hardly awake. "What's wrong?"

"Fuck, Tom from next door just went across our back garden into the shed." I said. My dad laughed.
"You really need to get to bed early, love." He hugged me, because by this point I was shaking and crying. It was the first time in months I'd seen him, and the memories of him climbing the fence and looking at me made me shudder. I pleaded for my dad to listen but he just laughed. It was no use.
Every night, when I'm awake, I see the flash of a torch in my back garden. And every night when I go downstairs, I see him in the corner of my eye getting ready to come over, or maybe just sauntering about his garden on his way.

I don't know what to do. Please help me.
