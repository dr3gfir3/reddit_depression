	<TEXT> Hello everyone, I asked this question in a different sub, but it's probably better for this sub Reddit. Recently I have been invited to a LAN party. I'm able to go but I'm currently having issues with my hardware. Unfortunately I can only play a selected amount of games. My question is which would you rather choose, Dragon's Dogma: Dark Arisen or Rise of the Tomb Raider? Thanks for the reading and possibly replying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's fun, but I wouldn't say emotional. It's really enjoyable though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would really love to get GTA 5, I want to because I have only recently gotten a PC and I would love to experience this game with mods. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this is a reload since I accidentally broke a rule. 

For the past while my friends have been loaning me their old Cards I finally was able to get my own and I couldn't be happier. </TEXT>
