	<TITLE> My 4 y/o niece's grandpa is telling her she won't be loved unless she's pretty. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-17 14:40:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The more I think about this, the more it absolutely disgusts me. 

About a week ago, my niece got into her mother's makeup and gave herself thick, black eyebrows with eye shadow. It was hilarious and adorable, but she said something along the lines of "I just wanted to be pretty". Fast forward to Sunday. I'm talking to my niece and she says something about being pretty, and proceeds to say, "if you're pretty everyone loves you. No one will love you if you're not pretty. I have to be pretty so everyone will love me". I asked her who told her that and she said it was her grandpa, which is 100% believable because he has apparently told her this garbage before. My niece's mother has already talked to her dad/my niece's grandpa about this in the past (more than a few months ago) and apparently he hasn't stopped because it has just gotten worse. 

No fucking wonder girls grow up obsessing over their looks.  </TEXT>

I've written a dozen emails now and no one will tell me exactly what part of that I've violated. They just keep saying " yes I've confirmed your account is suspended ". My account was suspended right after Payments said they all of a sudden couldn't verify my info. My payments account is good now but apparently mturk doesn't care. </TEXT>

I know some people just get stuck at the "verify your SSN" part, but this is way beyond that and no one at Amazon will explain why. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I fucking haven't. Fuck these generic "sorry but fuck you" emails.

Things I've tried:

Calling

Emailing

Sending a screenshot of my verified Mturk tax info

Asking for a fax # to send a copy of my drivers license/bill/bank statement to

Sending a raven

Praying to St. Anthony, the patron saint of lost things, like my goddamn mturk and amazon payments accounts. 

**Edit:**

I just got this email:
"We have verified your identity information. Your Amazon Payments account has now been activated.
Please be aware that this verification does not affect any remaining verification that must be completed, such as bank account, credit card or email verifications.
Thank you for using Amazon Payments.
- The Amazon Payments Team"

followed by this email: 

"Thank you for registering with Amazon Payments and Mechanical Turk. We appreciate your interest in our product. 
Unfortunately, at this time, we are not able to approve your request for an Amazon Payments account. 
You have a current MTurk earnings balance of $26.13, which will be automatically disbursed to your Payments account once all of your submitted HITs have been approved or rejected. This process can take up to 30 days to complete. Once your earnings have been transferred to your Payments account, please initiate an immediate withdrawal of your funds. Once your funds have been withdrawn, your account will be blocked. While we appreciate your interest, the blocking of your account is a permanent action. 
Please feel free to write to us for any questions that you may have."

What the fuck? Surely if they can verify my bank information to let me withdraw my mturk money, they can verify the rest of my fucking information, right? Has anyone else gotten this sort of response?


**Edit2:**

Tried to log into Mturk, was greeted by this:

"Your request was not completed successfully.

This account has been suspended by the Amazon Mechanical Turk team."

What the fuck is going on?

**Edit3**:

I called and asked why, if everything was now verified on my Payments account, is my Mturk account now suspended entirely. I was told that my Payments account "looks in golden condition to Mturk" and that the rep I was talking to would add notes to my file and send an email to Mturk saying that everything with Payments checks out. I was then told if Mturk decided to completely get rid of my account, I would also lose my Payments account and would have to completely start everything over. If I wanted to Mturk again and get another Payments account, I'd have to use a new email address. I have zero access to my Mturk account (other than being greeted by the message above) so I can't see what my current balance is or how many HITs are still pending/rejected. I have full access to my Payments account now though after everything with my bank was verified.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I ordered a few things from WhiskeyInkandLace for my boyfriend and was excited when the tracking link confirmed it was delivered. Checked the porch - no package. Asked the downstairs neighbors - no package. USPS said they delivered it to the right place so I had to assume it was stolen off the porch before I could get to it. I was super bummed but left a 5 star review on the sellers page saying that even though my bf couldn't use the products because the package was stolen, the seller was super helpful when I was first placing the order and had really quick shipping. Within five minutes of writing that review, the seller messaged me and offered to replace the order this week. I'm so thankful (and so is my boyfriend!) for great sellers like her. 

Stores like that really make the Etsy community great. Just wanted to share because I'm so blown away by how great they are and how they handled it even though they weren't at fault in the slightest. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone have experience with selling homemade candy? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-10 16:15:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like I'm going in circles. I'm looking into selling the homemade fudge that I make from my grandma's recipe. Originally I thought I could sell in small shops in my area, but (understandably) each shop is requiring a food license. I looked into the Illinois Cottage Food Law to sell at farmers markets and saw that the closest thing to fudge that falls under that law is baked candy (though fudge is technically not baked).

Ive begun looking into the idea of shared kitchens along with the licenses and permits that are needed, but honestly this is so out of my budget. People have been suggesting that I start by selling online, though I don't know the legality of selling something like that through sites like Etsy. 

Anyone have any experience with this sort of thing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'll be visiting next week and have been doing tons of research (including previous posts in this sub) on the best breweries in the city. I'm looking to buy beer to take home and I'd really like if the beer could only be found in Toronto, but I'm not sure if there are many places like that. I'm leaning towards visiting Bellwoods and would like to hear a local's opinion.  </TEXT>

I found a laptop on a morning metra train on the rock island line, gave it to the conductor. I figured I would post this here just in case it belongs to anyone here or you might know someone who stupidly left a laptop on the train.

	<TEXT> Hi all, 

Because there seemed to be an interest (if upvotes count) in the [Batman outlet plate](http://www.reddit.com/r/batman/comments/17do2v/thought_you_guys_might_like_this_order_i_just/) I posted yesterday, I decided to do a giveaway of a couple things I make for my Etsy shop, ComicBookCollages. The first item is an 8x10 Batman comic book collage similar to [this](http://imgur.com/FZuwx51) that will be made to order. The second includes a Batman outlet plate similar to the one above, as well as a Batman light switch plate similar to [this](https://img3.etsystatic.com/016/0/7543924/il_570xN.414359167_o10w.jpg). 

The winners will be chosen completely at random and ~~the only entry fee is your soul~~ you just need to enter by commenting below saying that you're interested in participating, and which item(s) you'd like to win. After the winners are chosen, I'll make the items and ship to the addresses given to me by the 2 winners. I cannot afford international shipping, so US only. :( Sorry. 

TL;DR: Free Batman stuff. Group A: 8x10 Batman collage. Group B: Batman outlet cover and light switch plate. One winner per group. Winners will be picked at random on Thursday. 

Questions? Comments? Concerns?

**EDIT:** The winners have been randomly selected by the Internet gods. The winner of group A is **LazerMcBlazer** and the winner of group B is **ProfChaos712**. Thanks to everyone who took an interest! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi fellow Redditors. 

After Joplin was devastated by a tornado quite some time ago, I ran a large donation drive and was able to send 7 boxes of canned goods, household cleaners and necessities, etc, down to a donation distribution area in Joplin. 

I would love to do the same thing for the victims of Hurricane Sandy who need the most assistance right now. The problem is that I have no idea where to start. I can't find any information yet as to where to send physical donations nor to information regarding the hardest hit areas. 

Anyone have suggestions for where to send the donations, towns and distribution areas in them? It would be great to collaborate with a couple Redditors who are experiencing this first hand so we can really figure out what we need to send. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [OFFER] Coupons for free Auntie Anne's Pretzels </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-08 05:10:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello fellow redditors! I recently came into possession of 3 coupons that entitle the owner to a free pretzel at Auntie Anne's and 3 fifty cents off a purchase coupons. I have no use for these as I am going away to school and there isn't an Auntie Anne's location close by. So I figure someone on Random Kindness could use some free/discounted food. I'll give one free coupon and one 50 cents off coupon to 3 people, if that sentence makes sense. Not sure if there are international locations, but if someone outside the US is interested I'll see what I can do. 

EDIT: As of right meow I have 2 of each coupon left!

EDIT: I'm out of coupons! It's possible that I may come into possession of a few more, in which case I may make another thread.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Request] Anyone care to create a simple logo? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-06-26 05:38:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I need a logo for my company Gamer Decor. Think of it as ThinkGeek meets HomeGoods meets Etsy. (Video game themed home decor sold online) I'm just starting it up and haven't been successful in creating a logo I like after trying for 3 days. I'm hoping for the website to be up soon, within the next month or so. 

For the logo, I'd like simplicity. Just the words and an image depicting something that symbolizes the company name but please stray things like Xbox controllers/symbols, etc. I'm a fan of ThinkGeek's logo (www.thinkgeek.com)

For the payment: This is where I feel pretty douchey. I'm a 19 year old college student that can't afford to actually pay someone with money. I can, however, provide the artist with 2 $10 gift cards to Steak and Shake (I'm a vegetarian -__-, but I can ship them to wherever) or 50% off an item when my website is actually up and running. (We can work that out via email, PM, whatever works for you)

Thank you (:
