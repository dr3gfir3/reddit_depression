	<TEXT>  This has happened to her before when she broke the law previously and was charged and found guilty back then too.

It's simple, indeed and you are plainly lying and here it is for the ones that upvoted you for telling a lie: 

# [Marine Le Pen was NOT found guilty inciting religious hatred before.](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/15/marine-le-pen-not-guilty-inciting-religious-hatred-lyon-french-front-national) 

So, let's see how sweet undeserved karma works when juxtaposed to the truth and check if you will recuse and apologize for spreading lies?

She won't be found guilty this time either IMHO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's also important to point out that you are wrong and your statement is unsubstantiated. Metformin does increase the life expectancy of people suffering from metabolic syndrome morbidity, namely DM. It's also a fact that metformin's main mechanism is by induction of LKB1 AMPK where inhibition of mitochondrial respiratory capacity is an element through activation of (e)HIF-1a as a factor. AMPK is the main upstream anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory signaling path involved in longevity and all known ways of lifespan extension are downstream of it including inhibition of mTORC1 mentioned here. The claim presented in the study that "multiple lines of evidence indicate that AMPK is
dispensable for metformins beneficial effects (Foretz et al.,
2010; Griss et al., 2015; Kalender et al., 2010)" is a bit baffling and IMHO is a result of not well and completely understood mechanisms of AMPK induction as is the case with Compound C which was considered as an AMPK antagonist while research shows it acts as an agonist but I could be wrong here. Metformin is a drug and as a such has a prescription label use although it's widely used off-label. It's not something ppl buy OTC and gobble to extend their life yet. However your statement contradicts the scientific fundamentals of the model of action of metformin and the signalling paths involved which are also, I repeat, involved in longevity.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> According SOHR, the one-man run info website in London which feeds on entirely radical Sunni/Wahhabi/Salafi aka "rebel" sources, the SAA has not taken part in the air-strikes and they have been lumped as Russian airstrikes. Total BS as info and credibility, same as the White Helmets aka the ISIS Red Crescent. The vast majority of the civilian casualties are caused by the SAA chopper airstrikes and attributed wrongfully to Russia for a reason. You see the real difference now? </TEXT>
