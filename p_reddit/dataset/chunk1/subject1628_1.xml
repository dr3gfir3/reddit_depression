	<TEXT> Yes, 40mg but took it before bed. And yes, faithfully used both products. Even going up and down the stairs would cause perspiration. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone, 1st time poster in this sub. Hope everyone takes care of themselves today. Anyway, depression sufferer for about 6 years now. Went through about 5 different antidepressants before getting off them about 3 months ago in favour of a cannabis subscription.

Results have been mixed. I do not do the cannabis everyday, and maybe if I did things would be better. But I'm feeling sad, angry, and just plain flat. I am thinking about going back on meds but the side effects on the most recent one I took included sweating through like 2-3 shirts per day and lack of sleep.

Any advice from people on a cannabis subscription OR who have struggled with their med regimen but finally found something that worked would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the serious replies. I'm struggling a little bit myself. I'm skeptical that anger management would help for me since the underlying problem is depression. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was working retail and my supervisor was eating a hot dog. We were shooting the crap, me sweeping the floor and her at her desk eating. Suddenly she just went silent. I looked over and she was purple, trying to cough but nothing coming out. Dropped the broom, got behind her and did a pretty aggressive Heimlich maneuver- she was super tiny and I was lifting her right off her feet. Luckily, the piece of hot dog made its way up and she spit it out. 

Of course it was my duty afterwards to remind her of the time she choked on the big wienie:) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. MIC is an awesome add on. Great selection, high-quality streams.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It has been said but it is true-RD will not help your live streams. I am not sure where there is a list of addons that work with RD. But take it from me, I am rural with not great internet speed-probably the minimal needed to even use Kodi. RD ensures you have the best stream available and they do seem to load a lot better. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You can use it with Exodus, SALTS, Specto to name a few. Enough reason to get it right there. I do agree with the comments here RE: reliability though. Most times it's great, well worth the coin. Others it's frustrating and only the free links seem to work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reminds me of the IT Crowd episode where Roy encourages Moss to swear to relieve some tension. So Moss musters up all of his courage and strength and what word comes out?
