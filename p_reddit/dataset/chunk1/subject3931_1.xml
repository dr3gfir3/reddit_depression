	<TEXT> I'm a gamer and one of my favorite games is Dragon Quest IV. Something I've always found fascinating about it is its plot structure. Chapters 1 through 4 each deal with an entirely different cast of characters. In chapter 5, all of their paths cross and you see how everything is interconnected.

Would you enjoy a gimmick like this in an anthology show like Black Mirror, assuming it's graceful instead of forced? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> One example of many is I like to play a lot of Crystal Maiden. Because I am a slave to guides, I'll get an Urn and a Blink after boots. So, let's say on the enemy team there is an Axe. Do I build the Eul's immediately after boots? Or do I still build something smaller like an Urn before? Or is a positioning item so important, even in the face of a hero who is dominating your team because they keep clumping up together, that you should get the Blink even before Eul's?

And like I said, Axe is just one example. In general, when should I build a counter item, especially as a support who isn't going to get as much gold as a carry throughout the game? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If season 3 were three episodes long like the first two seasons, which ones would you choose? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-05 22:50:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This question comes to mind partially because I'm currently watching Men Against Fire for the first time and, 36 minutes into it, I'm not enjoying myself much at all. In fact, I'm convinced that if this were a short season like before Netflix acquired the series, that it wouldn't have made the cut.

So - a thought experiment. Which three episodes for you? Personally I'm not sure other than that Men Against Fire wouldn't be here and that San Junipero would definitely be one of the three. I'm also tempted to say Nosedive is a little too similar to Fifteen Million Merits and that, if necessary, despite being a good episode, that one would also be axed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We lost a match owing to a lot of reasons, and of course the blame game comes at the end. They said "lol a support building diffusal" but my logic is - well, none of my teammate has enough magic to counter Omni's ult, so I need some way to counter him. Of course, by the time I got my Diffusal, my teammates had already fed the enemy so much that it didn't matter. But under better circumstances, is Diffusal on a support a good idea? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-04 23:14:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was younger, I used to always think bigger was better. Longer songs, longer books, longer movies. I mean, hey it's more content and you don't want a good thing to end, right?

But I've become convinced that I'd rather have something short and dense that rewards a second reading/viewing/playing. For books in particular, this is anywhere from 200 to 400 pages, though I'd have to say 300 is the magic number. 

Much longer than that, and you need a VERY good reason to justify the extra pages. More often than not, a long 600+ page book gives to me the impression that the writer had so many ideas and couldn't choose the best one, and it shows because the subplots tend to be weaker and inconsequential. </TEXT>

They're both from Vintage International and HarperCollins, so it's not like they're some no-name company. Is this just me being paranoid or are books just not made to last anymore?

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 5 games sounds reasonable enough to me. Obviously not going to master the hero at that point, but you should have a very general idea that you shouldn't spam Shadow Demon's Disruption during a stun, or that you shouldn't use any skills during Winter Wyvern's ult, or etc etc. People at low MMR go into ranked without even having played a hero before and it's incredibly annoying.

	<TEXT> This is probably a bit odd of a request, because I don't imagine very many want to read lit crit for pleasure. But I remember when I was in high school my library had a section for it and I *loved* reading what others had to say about books when I'd finished reading them. This despite that I felt some of them analyzed too deeply into symbols that might not have been there. 

Today we've got books from authors like Malcolm Gladwell and Nassim Nicholas Taleb that attempt to make science accessible to the layperson. So I'd love to know if any critics have ever tried to do the same for literary criticism. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to love House of Leaves. I thought the gimmick was so clever in every way. The foot notes, the multiple narrators, the typography. When I tried to read it a second time, the only part I enjoyed was The Navidson Record, the faux-academic paper *about* the house. Johnny Truant's bits made me want to gag, as did the typography silliness.

Based on that experience and a few others like it, I'm afraid to read what I considered favorites from high school. Particularly Albert Camus's The Plague and Virginia Woolf's To the Lighthouse. Reading those for the first time, I loved every second of them. But what if I hate them now? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd always thought the answer to this question was "Yes, absolutely." But okay... I'm playing Lifestealer, right? And no one else is buying detection against a Riki. After a while Medusa starts calling me out, says "How do you have only an Armlet and Boots?" And I tell her, well, no one else is going to buy this shit, so I'm sacrificing myself to win. She says "You picked carry, so fucking play carry and farm. If you wanted to support, you should have picked support."

I'm baffled at this opinion, honestly. Many people at this MMR truly believe you'll get lucky with a stun or something and kill an invis hero without detection. They don't want to buy it even if they have the gold and the empty slots. And when it IS bought, they'll whine that the person buying it doesn't have items. Sub-1k MMR is goddamned insane.

	<DATE> 2016-10-29 22:07:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> To me, so many long books seem like a case of poor editing. When there could have been 5 words, the author decided to use 50, and the editor (was there one?) decided the redundancy was acceptable.

Prime offenders for me are Harry Potter's Order of the Phoenix and Middlemarch. With the Harry Potter, I ended up quitting the series because of it. Too much seemed inconsequential either to plot or character. And with Middlemarch, I feel like the book might have been long simply because it was a soap opera or "TV miniseries" of its time, if you will. 

But as for long books that felt like they had no filler... I can't think of one. As much as I wanted to love Don Quixote, I feel like it would have been better as a novella, because it became VERY repetitive.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a bad habit of buying books purely based on acclaim and praise, not opening them to read a page or two. This is obviously a mistake, so this thread is as much a curiosity about how others approach this as it is a way to determine how I should do it myself.

What I've started doing is reading the first paragraph, the last paragraph, and the first paragraph on page 100, 200, 300, 400, etc. That last bit about a paragraph every hundred pages might be too excessive, maybe instead I should extend it to the first 2 pages of the book and the last paragraph.

edit: I'm a little confused why such a harmless question is being downvoted. Does this sub not like MissASMR? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like a nice Goldilocks middle when it comes to the style/tone of a book, and yet that seems largely impossible. 

I can't stand Victorian literature. Not because it's difficult to understand, since I'd say any one sentence of a novel from that period is easy enough to understand. But you string them all together and it's so dry, you can really tell they were paid by word count.

But I can't really stand modern prose either, like DeLillo or Chabon. Sentences that seem like they should be short and sweet are peppered with this flowery language that makes me want to gag.

I'm so unforgiving of things that annoy me in books, I guess because, unlike TV, there aren't audiovisuals to occupy me when the characters or stories start testing my patience. 

Has anyone else ever felt maybe they don't like books as much as you wished you did? And what did you do about it? Did you take a break or did you look harder for books you might like? </TEXT>

Then you've got... these floating damage values. There isn't anything like "muh skill cap" in my complaint here. Rather, I think they're ugly and distracting. I don't like the font, for one thing. And I'm always tempted to look at them, because they're new information on-screen, and decades of gaming have taught me anything new should be paid attention to. But really, I don't see the use of them for a casual like me other than cluttering up the screen and confusing me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've tried to read Eliot and Dickens. I want to like them, since they're supposed to be the start of where authors explore the psychological depth of their characters. But honestly, I can't make it through the prose. Where five words would do, they'd throw in another thirty. I know for Dickens this is partially because of the way he was paid. For Eliot, I'm honestly thinking that was just her style. 

Jane Eyre, so far, is the only novel from this era that is really fun to read. More like this would be great. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Skyward Sword is one of those games where I was so hyped that I lapped up sooo much pre-release material. Videos, screenshots, bullet point details. I was excited. I thought "this game is going to be MASSIVE", because I didn't once entertain the idea they'd show their entire hand before the game was released. But that is exactly what they had done. Except for the final dungeon, they showed every dungeon/gimmick/boss/item. There was little surprise left once I played the game for myself.


Because of that experience, I've refused to follow so closely the development of any video game. For Breath of the Wild, I've seen the trailers and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIrY56yg7dY), which is thankfully confined to the opening half hour. The problem is because I don't know what's in the game, I'm forming all these wild ideas in my head. For years I've wanted a game like the NES Zelda in 3D, where there's no hand holding and you simply stumble inside a dungeon through your own exploration. I know press releases have SAID that's what this game will be, but I don't know it until I see it. But I don't want to see it, due to how I spoiled Skyward Sword.

So, it's an odd little conundrum.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In particular, I'm intrigued by the FF6: Brave New World mod. The interesting thing is its readme claims it's not a difficulty mod, despite the name of its website host.

For anyone who's played any of these, are they a carefully balanced challenge or is it "hard for the sake of hard"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never really played a WRPG, however I've always been interested in them. Part of the reason I've avoided them is I know they can be long and involving affairs, and I don't want to get dragged into something for 10 hours or so only to realize there's not actually much depth.

So, the two games that I've always been super interested in ever since they were released are Divinity Original Sin and The Witcher 3. Divinity mostly for its clever ways you can interact with NPCs and The Witcher 3 for its overworld which seems like it would be fun to explore.

Other than these two, what else should i play? I tried Skyrim once and something about it just didn't really click with me. Though I know there are gameplay mods for it, maybe some of those could help.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After playing so much Dota, I need a break. For different reasons. Not simply because of the toxic community, as I'm sure is probably the typical reason give that one needs a break from Dota, but also because the lack of a story is actually starting to bug me.

I'd prefer a game that doesn't necessarily rely on cut scenes to convey the dialogue. While I never did play The Last Story, I loved reading the reviews that stated there was a lot of chattiness between the party members while exploring the world. 

Can be either WRPG or JRPG, though right now I'm more in the mood for a WRPG. </TEXT>

When allowed to direct the entire series instead of an episode here or there, of course Moffat got a little ridiculous. Chibnall doesn't have any celebrated episode and there's not much distinctive about his episodes that could give us a clue what he's going to do with the series.

So... have there been any juicy details yet? What does he plan to do? Do we know his favorite episodes of the show, maybe that could give us a clue what he might want to do in terms of mood, story, characters? </TEXT>

So, instead when I want something modern, inevitably I turn to TV - your cliche shows like Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Justified, etc. And I have to wonder if that's just where all the best writers have gone, because I can't think of any other explanation. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> If a band makes poor studio albums but is excellent in a live setting, how do you feel about that band? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Warpaint has me conflicted. They used to be one of my favorite bands, when it was just their EP and their debut. Their last two albums have been crap, in my opinion. But I decided to give them another shot and watch some live videos - and they're much better, it's like they're in their natural habitat.

Usually the saying goes that if a band can't recreate live what they did in the studio, that they're not that good. What about bands who are great in a concert setting but can't deliver a good studio album? Does that make them somewhat of a lesser band compared to the ones who can do both? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0PXEfFrP0k) version of Disco//Very and [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOfah_QyUkI) version of New Song are, to me, unquestionably better than the studio versions. There is a fire and energy not present on the albums. Both of these performances just so happen to be from WFUV Public Radio, so there's a possibility their sound mixer is simply fucking good at what they do. 

But I'm gonna give them the benefit of the doubt and say, yeah, Warpaint is still an amazing band who, unfortunately, makes poor decisions in the studio. Does anyone else get the feeling they're more in their element when performing live? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I have this classic literature that I read last year. While The Odyssey was presented in full (and I loved it, convinced it could be wiped out of history and released today as a bestseller in the fantasy aisle), The Iliad was only bits and pieces. And most of these excerpts were pretty boring, fights and action scenes. Not much dialogue or philosophical asides that I love to see in classic lit.

Are the two somehow so far removed that if you like one, you might not like the other? Or did the anthology maybe do a bad job of highlighting the interesting parts? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-03 04:05:41 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've heard differing opinions on this lately. Some say if you pull/stack/gank, secure farm for your carry, make an early game impact, etc, that you'll win because the enemy support won't play as well as you.

But the fact remains that games are won by farmed carries. If my carries refuse to last hit or even attempt to farm, just standing at mid waiting for a "potential" fight, what is my early game contribution going to do for anyone? Incidentally, this is the advice I hear most often, just pick a carry and dominate the game yourself if you want to win.

So which is it? As fun as I think it is to support, I seem to win more reliably when I play carry. Supporting is a gamble, hoping that your carries will do their job. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is probably something super obvious to all of you - since most of you are like 5k and always talking about all these concepts I don't see at low level Dota - but I noticed something today after 1300 hours of Dota. I'd always heard the neutral creeps dying and passed it off as an immersion factor. But if you know there are only three or only four creeps in a camp, or whatever number of them, you can count off how many deaths you hear and then when there's one left, that's when you pull.

This is going to be super helpful because I've never been able to find a good camera position where I can watch the creeps die and then pull the camp on time. So for the handful of people who don't know this, there you go. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm on a quest to stop supporting for a while and spam carries. Since these heroes are so popular, I'm wanting alternatives in case they're already taken.

Void is pretty easy for me, however he's typically an offlane hero. Does it really matter at 1k mmr which lane a pubstomper is played in?

Drow becomes fairly easy after a while, though I'm really bad at laning with her for some reason.

Luna is another one I love. She doesn't seem to do much during team fights (or I could very likely be playing her wrong?) so she seems like one of those heroes like Sven where you let your team 4 v 5, farm farm farm, then come out tearing the enemy apart.

Viper... if I can convince anyone to let me go mid, he's usually an easy one to end games fast. Death Prophet is the same way. Should I just fight for mid, knowing that I'm really good with those two heroes?

That's just a bit of brainstorming, really. Anything I should add or remove? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Early game, as soon as everyone gets to lane, players will immediately start attacking heroes instead of farming creeps, and they'll only farm creeps when the heroes leave to go regen. I can understand when supports do this, that's their job, but carries will ignore farm to hit each other. It's annoying as a support because, well, it's kinda hard to get anything done. And it's annoying when I see a carry do it because they should be farming.

I guess I could watch Lost for more of Michael Emerson, somehow never did watch that. Just a bit afraid that it's not going to hold up in 2016, I'd always heard the story got a bit too unwieldy and that the writers admitted they didn't have any concrete plan. </TEXT>

I'm usually a fan of shorter seasons like Breaking Bad, and 22 episode shows usually have a lot of filler. But I don't think POI has any filler at all. I'm hoping when I get to season 5 that it doesn't feel rushed due to the shorter length. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've had pretty good games with both of them even when I'm the only one warding and whatever, I buy aura items for team fights, and I feel like even if there's a rocky start sometimes during laning phase, we quickly bounce back either due to smoke cloud or track gold. But I feel like I could still improve, obviously. 

I don't think I should try to snipe the courier because most carries can't handle themselves alone. Should I just pull and gain a couple levels that way, like a normal support, then go roam? Or roam right from the beginning? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Any one of his *TEN** spells would seem OP on any other hero. Deafening Blast can disarm you for up to 6.5 seconds. EMP can burn up to 625 mana. Ghost Walk can slow you down for up to 50%, not to mention gives him an extra 30% movespeed.

And while I did mention the highest values that can be achieved, even at low levels, these spells can be devastating. I don't really understand how to play around him unless you've got silences on your team. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What are the most useful chat wheel commands? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-27 04:07:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been wanting to mute chat, for my own sanity. As far as I know, chat wheel commands are still displayed to teammates when I have them muted. And you've only got eight options. Some of these seem a bit redundant or useless, but there are enough good ones that I'd like some help.

"Get Back!" this one seems useful, however ctrl+alt+ping could serve the same purpose

"Push now" this one is probably also a little redundant because of alt+ping to enemy towers?

"Group up" "Spread out" "Split up and farm" all three of these sound decent to me

"I'm retreating" this one is probably super essential for someone not using chat or voice, so I'm including it without hesitation

"Out of mana" "Skills on cooldown" these seem possibly good, except you can alt-click on your health/skills, so probably not worth including 

(Similarly, the "missing bottom/mid/top" callouts seem pointless when you can be more specific by alt-clicking the enemy hero icon at top of the screen)

"Coming to gank" this one MIGHT be useful so I can warn them I'm about to help?

"Requesting a gank" however, this one seems possibly useless because I can't really trust strangers and try to focus on my game

"Destroy the tower, then get back" This one seems good

"Pulling creeps" I play a lot of support, so this one technically seems good.. except more than a few carries will ping me ask what I'm doing, so maybe it's not worth telling them

"Current Game Time" also seems pointless because you can alt-click the clock at top of the screen

So uh... yeah, a long musing to ask you - which ones do you use, which ones do you think are the best to use? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'd been trying to figure out why I lose so much lately, then I think I realized an important reason. I look at a hero, let's take Bounty Hunter as an example, and I expect him to be played as an aura carrier like the pros and high level pubstars run him. And almost every time, instead he goes with phase boots and deso and all that "outdated" shit. I keep forgetting, somehow, that anything that is "outdated" lives on at my MMR. Playing to the current meta only serves to fuck up my expectations of what both my teammates and enemies will do.

Am I making excuses here? Or am I on to something that I shouldn't ever expect that PA to go Vlads/Deso instead of BF, that I'll never see a Void build anything other than MoM for whatever bizarre reason, that Drow will always build Shadow Blade instead of Hurricane Pike?

And on the flip side, should **I** be playing heroes to the current meta at shit tier MMR? Taking the first example of BH, I do copy the pros in terms of item builds, and seem to do well with it. Should I keep doing this or would I have more success adapting to my MMR? </TEXT>

Right now, the only thing that comes to mind is Invoker for easy sun strikes - but really this is more of a way to help Invoker than Bloodseeker.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Just had a 66 minute game. I lost, but that's not the point. Even when I win a 66 minute game, I want to gouge out my eyeballs. It's usually not because of some back-and-forth battling, but rather because my carries farm, farm, farm - and then don't do anything with it. They don't push or fight. They just keep farming. And by the time they've slowly built up their items - because, of course, they're BAD at farming - the enemy has better items and can slightly outplay them, thus winning the game.

So... what can I do in these all too common situations to make sure towers get pushed? Pushing a lane doesn't really do much because usually the enemy team sends two or three heroes down to clean it up. And it's not like we're simultaneously split pushing another lane to distract them and instead take THAT tower, because like I said these idiots are just farming the whole time like it's Diablo.

edit: Or another thing they'll do, they'll pretend to push one tier 3 tower, then go to another tier 3. They never finish what they start. Maybe I'm wrong - I do lose my fair share of games and pretty low MMR - but this seems pretty stupid to me. Shouldn't we focus on taking down one tower completely before moving on to the next? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just finished Stranger Things and I loved it. Got me thinking I need to check out more of their stuff - but these days it's so much more than just House of Cards and Orange Is the New Black.

What else is as good as Stranger Things? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How do you play Invoker before getting an Aghs? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, I've never really played Invoker because of the whole intimidating factor. Part of this is because when you get Aghs, you can Cast All The Things and it's overwhelming to remember which spell is which three letter sequence.

However, Invoker confuses me just as much for a different reason. Before you do get Aghs, Invoke is on a fairly high cooldown considering how useful it is. How do you decide which two spells you need at any given moment? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is pretty annoying when playing Kunkka or Drow, especially Kunkka when I'm trying to hit creeps one by one, and then use the Tidebringer - at least, I assume that's what I should be doing. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Typically, you want to kill them so you can push a tower or take Rosh. But if they're low health and all run back like scared kittens, isn't that essentially the same victory, assuming you get a tower in the meantime? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Are there any heroes who should NEVER build a gem? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The easiest way for me to counter Mirana, and much cheaper than spamming sentries, is to buy a gem. But once I do buy it, I tend to stick with the rest of my team in fear of losing it. I'll be more likely to do this if I'm someone like Ogre (higher HP) or Bounty (invis, enemy usually too stupid to buy detection against me)

But let's say I'm CM - should I just stick to spamming sentries or can someone squishy still hold a gem with careful positioning?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Which supports can I run solo and still push out the lanes when needed? [details/opinions inside] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-09 00:36:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm wanting to narrow down my hero pool for ranked. At low MMR, most of the time I'm a solo support. So I need a) a stun and b) a way to push and c) ??? maybe something else I'm forgetting.

The only 100%  supports I know I can play well and that fit the criteria are CM, Ogre, and Venge. [though Venge can't the best, she does have the aura]

At first, I was considering Wyvern but there's no stun other than her ult. So I think she's out.

Kunkka has the Tidebringer which is pretty nice, but I'm not 100% convinced he can solo support.

Naga Siren's images, even without Radiance, SEEM like they'd be good when pushing along with creeps. Maybe? Maybe not?

Venomancer is fantastic as pushing lanes and sometimes even taking towers, however he has no stun. Is his slow good enough? In my experience, yes, but it's possible I've just got lucky.

Shaman - he's supposed to be really good, but in my experience, the enemy comes and destroys the serpent wards before they do much of anything. 

Lion - great disables. Can he really push, though? Earth Spike has a small potential, but doesn't seem good enough.

Dazzle - again, he's got a slow instead of a stun. How much does this matter? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've played a few hours of CSGO and love the idea of working together, love the maps, love the weapon recoil. The whole idea of bunnyhopping, though... is this something only the pros use or will I have to adapt? If I will, I'd rather not bother.  </TEXT>
