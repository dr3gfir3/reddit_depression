	<TEXT> Oh damn, I love your responses and I'm kinda happy with what you said.. because farming mobs and stealing packs sounds soo much more fun than being taking care of trees, plants and whatever. 
Do you guys need someone new in your guild ? :) I'm up for it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh really? Why did DiegoElExplorer say that as someone who wanna PVP, you will be  in disadvantage if you have land/farm. I'm sorry for the question but now I'm just confused.. :'/  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> oh what an awesome explanation you did there! Thank you soo much, you're awesome.
I'm planning to level up a Darkrunner, since they look so damn awesome.. but as you can see the guy above you commented that you HAVE to have land and farm to have time to pvp? while what you are stating is the true opposite of that?

This makes me kinda confused. As someone who wanna PVP.. should I focus on farm/land as SpaceBaconator said? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys. straight to the point :
As a new player who only played until level 30 when the game came out.. I'm now waiting for the fresh start servers.. All I wanna do is basically PVP, PVP and once again : PVP

Now here's my question. I know that the game is grindy.. and yes I am going to go patron.. do I still need to worry about farm/land/house and all that bullshit? Because I see these threads about people terrified and are worried about something called "16x16" land and landrushes blablabla..
Is this necessary to obtain the best gear? to actually farm and obtain land? or is there other methods to achieve good gear to eventually PVP all day long.

I'm sorry if this question was stupid.. but I still want to know if this farming thingy VERY important for END content. </TEXT>
