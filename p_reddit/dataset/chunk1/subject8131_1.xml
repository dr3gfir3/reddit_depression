No, here were/are better ways to handle it:

	<TEXT>  Most JavaScript developers are not disciplined, however.

Where's your source? Also, even if they weren't disciplined to do large scale development, they probably don't need to.  I'd imagine most javascript development is just simple DOM manipulation.

 In fact, they're usually JavaScript developers because they didn't like the Java or C++ compilers repeatedly telling them that they fucked up.

Where's your source? </TEXT>
