	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are many ways to get to Howard OnDemand. Whilst there are often posts on this subreddit claiming the OnDemand is empty or new shows have not been added they in fact are always there. The app is fucked up but not as it is implied. **There are about 5 or six places to click on HowardStern OnDemand and some of those options lead to a screen that says OnDemand is empty, but it is not empty** you just have click somewhere else. Yes it is not perfect, but it is always there, worst case open and close app and try again but I have always found HowardONDemand by clicking to it a different way when it says it is empty.  I'm pretty sure the empty result always comes from the same entry point so just try a different one.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-27 15:56:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Part seven of the failing media's failed ability to cover hard news, clearly afraid of more pro-Trump blowback for their falling ratings. At the very least, the Recount is very interesting and rip for political commentary and to instead continuously use it to casually accuse Jill Stein of stealing money is disgusting. 538.com is happy to throw the recount under the bus although they also point out "The paradox is that in our current electoral system, without routine audits, seeking proof requires calling for a recount, which in itself can undermine confidence in the election." They also point out this excellent USA today article about [why Voting Machine Audits are necessary](http://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/11/18/election-audit-paper-machines-column/93803752/)


Donald Trump shit his pants about this on Twitter this morning and that is more than enough already.  Fake Twitter accounts are using key words to slam the Jill Stein recount. While the media sits on this the Trump Social Media Machine is crushing the story and the enthusiasm.  Stop saying it is not going to change anything, it will change something, so stop saying it will change nothing. Something progressive will happen as a result of this recount. So stop saying it won't change anything. Say nothing or say Jill Stein is hero. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A frog goes into a bank to get a loan. He goes up to the teller, she's wearing a name tag that says Mrs. Whack. 

"Hello there," says the frog. "My name is Kermit and I would like a loan."

"*The* Kermit the frog?" Exclaims Mrs. Whack.

"No, not that Kermit you fool! I *am* Kermit but not Kermit the frog, Kermit Jagger! For my father is the great rock and roll singer Mick Jagger."

"I see, well do you have collateral for the loan?"

"But of course," says Kermit and ever so carefully he reached into his pocket and pulled out a tiny ceramic pink elephant.

"I see," said Patty, for that was her first name, "I must ask the bank manager about this, whatever this is, i tell you i don't think it will get you a loan."

So she goes over to the bank manager and asks, "Mr. bank manager, this Kermit fellow wants a loan but all he has for collateral is this ceramic pink elephant and I don't even know what it is!"

The bank manager says, "It's a knick knack Patty Whack now give the frog a loan, his old man is a Rolling stone!"

	<TITLE> The Media Continues It's Backwards Attempts To Take Down Donald Trump: Declares Pence Clear Debate Winner Even Though Pence Policy is Clear Evil </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-05 18:04:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't blame the media's overexposure of Donald Trump for his rise during the Republican Primaries; I would more simply say, the media failed in taking him down. The media failed to expose Trump and instead overexposed his gaffes and over analyzed their clear racism and hate. Perhaps they put him on TV too much, certainly they spent too much time debating what he said, so much so, that it normalized his exaggerations and filled in the blanks to explain that what he meant to say was a fair complaint...


**ParaphrasedNewsPerson:** *Trump says 'Hillary and Obama are the founders of ISIS.' Now that is clearly insane. If he had said instead, that Clinton and Obama did not stop the spread of ISIS and perhaps handled Iraq differently, that Terrorism would not be what it is today, he might have had something. Some Democrats have said basically the same thing of George W. Bush, so it's basically not that insane.*


Thank you media for your grand Trump Spam of debating the not debatable. Good job, but you know they are going to call you biased no matter what!



Speaking of DEBATABLE, I was incredibly shocked watching the VICE PRESIDENTIAL Debate last night, that a minute after Trump's Veep Michael Pence tells all woman of America what they can and cannot do with their bodies, that the media, liberals and conservatives, all media is calling Pence the clear winner. 


**ParaphrasedNewsPerson:** *Governor Pence said a bunch of crazy shit but clearly America will view Pence as having a better style and therefore he makes Trump look better. Interrupting is bad, remember? People will probably believe what Mike Pence was saying because he was more calm and assertive.* (And then the most hypocritical line ever..)  *Mike Pence will probably lose the post-debate, but he has won tonight."*


What the fuck does that mean? He won the debate but he will lose the post debate?  So he lied his pants off, but we will hold it against him later...what's that you say media, you say the media isn't biased against Trump and you'll prove it by patting Pence on the back. You will even say the moderator was a little biased and talkative? So the media will pretend Mike Pence won so the media can appear unbiased when they take him down for his lies later this week?...What? AND The media says we should pretend Pence won so we can make a BACKWARDS ATTACK against Trump's own demeanor? Do we have to say Pence is smooth to put down Trump who is rough? Once again, the media will let the evil policies stand strong WHEN presenting the truth that evil policy is evil is not bias!


**Someone who makes such a grand religious statement against abortion**


PENCE: But for me, I would tell you that for me the sanctity of life proceeds out of the belief that -- that ancient principle that -- where God says before you were formed in the womb, I knew you, and so for my first time in public life, I sought to stand with great compassion for the sanctity of life.


**someone who makes such a strong statement against an entire country of people**


KAINE: And with respect to refugees, we want to keep people out if they're dangerous. Donald Trump said keep them out if they're Muslim. Mike Pence..

PENCE: Absolutely...

KAINE: ...put a program in place to keep them out if they're from Syria. And yesterday an appellate court with three Republican judges struck down the Pence plan...

...PENCE: And I stand by that decision. And if I'm vice president of the United States or Donald Trump is president, we're going to put the safety and security of the American people first.


...KAINE:...We won't do it based on discriminating against you from the country you come from or the religion that you practice.


**someone who says their canidate Donald Trump did not say the things he said**


*PENCE: This isn't the old days where you can just say stuff and people believe it.*


That someone is a loser. Why media? Why appeal to deplorable people who will only say you tricked them, why justify their complaints?  Policy policy policy. Take down Trump for his policy. Take down pence for his policy. Take down conservatism for its policy. All Republicans that are anti-abortion, anti-imgratiin, anti gay right, and anti-civil rights in law enforcement are deplorable, are wrong, are losers. 



Let Trump deal with this:

*PENCE: You know, things don't always come out exactly the way he means them.*

*KAINE: Well, can I say...*

*PENCE: But I'm telling you what the policy of our administration would be.*


Just attack the policy!

	<TEXT> During the Sept. 26 debate, Donald Trump claimed that he never supported the Iraq War. That is not true. In a 2002 interview with Howard Stern he expressed his support for the war.

I was against the war in Iraq, he told debate moderator Lester Holt.

He said that he did the interview with Howard Stern, very lightly. He then asserted that he had told Sean Hannity he was against the war. Hannity, an outspoken Trump supporter, said last week that Trump told him  in private conversations  that he was against the war."
