	<TEXT> I realized I should've examined protagonists a bit closer, but I only had my stacks of coverages; I didn't have the scripts anymore to verify age/race/sexuality/etc. But as for the question:

 Do you have a sense of how many protagonists you saw who weren't the default young, white, straight?

Young and straight, absolutely; probably 90%. But it's hard to tell with regards to race: often, the writer doesn't include the characters' races, unless the name gives it away. Maybe that's a wise move: you wouldn't want to turn off Denzel by writing the role for DiCaprio. 

But the best was when the writer presented an unspoken assumption that every character is white, until it was specifically noted otherwise (e.g. "...*where we meet JOHN, a skinny black man, who*..."). Since, apparently, white is the norm for society.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Overall, the scripts fall into two categories: 1) derivative, and 2) unexciting. The majority of scripts either feel very familiar and are little more than a by-the-book retelling of a basic premise, or have a good idea but don't quite know how to turn it into an engaging script. 

I think it's definitely inexperience. Every week, I read a script that's like a mirror to my early years as a writer: I made the exact same mistakes and produced the exact same shoddy result, convinced of my own brilliance. It's embarrassing to think about, but I have without a doubt written scripts as bad as the worst scripts I've read. But I learned, I improved, so I wonder what will happen to those same writers whose bad scripts I read. Maybe after a few more scripts, they'll look back on their work with the same embarrassment I do towards mine. 

I don't know how terrible scripts wind up in my hands, and I've read some really terrible ones. But I respect the mystery. Makes my job easier, anyway: it's easier to condemn a terrible script than wade through a so-so script.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the late story is a result of writers loving their characters a bit too much. It's certainly something I did when I started writing: your babies are the characters, not the story. The writer wants to introduce his/her characters without any distractions, so we can come to love them as much as they do. So it's forty pages of character introductions, before a story arrives to put them to use. There's nothing that says we can't meet the characters *and* begin a story at the same time. Trial by fire: we learn who the characters are, as they're battling the story conflict. 

Maybe the problem is also a case of misidentification: us meeting the characters *isn't part of the story*. The story needs to be self-contained; introducing the heroes to the external audience isn't Chapter One. 

As for the RECOMMEND scripts, there's nothing I could really do with them. I can't reveal specifics about those scripts, obviously, so there's little I could say. Besides, there's no secret winning strategy those 8 scripts nailed. They just had good stories and told them well. It's such a case-by-case business; there's never any hard-and-fast rule to writing a good script. 

To get a RECOMMEND, you need to do everything right; to get a CONSIDER, you just need to do one thing right. You need a good premise, or a fun protagonist, or an engaging voice, or a remarkable ending: you need one strong element that catches my attention and makes the script worth considering. There have been a lot of cases where I've written CONSIDER WITH RESERVATIONS (for the premise): the script was terrible, but it had a good idea buried within it -- it just didn't know what to do with it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of the above. 

If you do something new, then you're already ahead of the pack. Nobody's interested in telling a story that's already been told twenty times (well, actually, they are, but this is for spec scripts). Go in a new direction and make it work, but don't assume I'll give it a RECOMMEND just for the novelty. A street juggler with chainsaws is more entertaining than a street juggler with torches -- but he still has to be able to juggle them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't describe script specifics due to confidentiality issues, but I give a RECOMMEND if I can't find anything to criticize. The script has a great idea (or a great execution of an okay idea) and took chances. A RECOMMEND script doesn't have to buck the tropes; it just has to use them well, and has to have some self-awareness as it's using them. Edgar Wright and Rian Johnson are both aware of the tropes of their genres (film noir, cop movie, caper flick, zombie movie, sci-fi), but know how to use them in a fresh way. Tropes are tropes for a reason: they work.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I dunno, it should be pretty self-explanatory, but to expand on a few:

THE NARRATIVE FALLS INTO A REPETITIVE PATTERN

It goes back to [Trey Parker and Matt Stone's advice](http://splitsider.com/2011/09/trey-parker-and-matt-stone-crash-an-n-y-u-writing-class): the story isn't strong enough if it's just a series of "and"s. *This happens, and then this happens, and then this happens...* Their advice was to replace "and"s with "but"s and "therefore"s. *The heroes do this, therefore this happens, but then this happens, therefore the heroes do this, but then this happens..."* A good story, like a good piece of music, evolves and builds as it moves along. 

Pretentious analogy: Check out [Beethoven's 7th, Op. 92: II. Allegretto](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhARR-zmTCE) and hear it start slow, before the momentum starts building, the different instruments coming in and out, joining together, until the piece reaches its climax. Beethoven's 7th is a great illustration of a story's crescendo and climax, so it's no surprise that [it's already been used as such](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fY3BOcjAnw).

THE VILLAINS ARE CARTOONISH, EVIL-FOR-THE-SAKE-OF-EVIL

As much as I love *Die Hard*, I don't want to read another script about a Hans Gruber knock-off. It's really tempting and so much goddamn fun to write big, hammy bad guys, but it's a shortcut. I can't count the number of times I've quoted *The Incredibles* while reading a script: "He starts monologuing! He starts this prepared speech about how feeble I am compared to him, how inevitable my defeat is, how the world will soon be his... The guy's got me on a platter, and he won't shut up!" If you're worried your villain is too corny, imagine Dr. Evil saying his lines: if you added jokes, would your scene fit perfectly in *Austin Powers 4*?

THE FEMALE PART IS UNDERWRITTEN

There's no easy solution for this: it's hard for guys to write girls, and vice versa. That's just human nature. Maybe a trick is imagining the actress' reaction: if the female role is so one-dimensional, why would an actress want to play it? How could you strengthen that role to give an actress something to sink her teeth into? Joss Whedon and Woody Allen have a pretty good track record for writing female characters; there's lots to learn from their work.

THE SCRIPT FAVORS STYLE OVER SUBSTANCE

In my opinion, *Lucky Number Slevin* is the perfect example of style over substance. I love it, but it definitely tries very hard to be cool, in story, in twists, in character, in dialogue. There's nothing wrong with making your script zing, but don't make it empty zing: have the goods to back up the style. *The Matrix*, in my opinion, combined style and substance very well: the movie had flash, but damn did it ever have a story too. It varies from genre to genre: the balance between style and substance is harder to maintain in different types of stories. 

THE ENDING IS ANTI-CLIMACTIC

*Casino Royale* ends with a fitting anti-climax: not everything is solved onscreen, but you're still left with a sense of closure (i.e. "The name's Bond. James Bond."). It may not be the best example, since the story continues in the Bond franchise, but I didn't need to see Mr. White die to feel satisfied. *The Matrix*, to a lesser extent, ends with a minor anti-climax: the bigger problem isn't fixed, but it's sure gonna be. 

THE CONFLICT IS INCONSEQUENTIAL, FLASH IN THE PAN

It's like the writer knows the heroes' plan needs to hit some obstacles, so he throws in a quick problem that takes one page to solve, and then continues on without a hitch. *Inception* negotiates it well: whenever a problem arises during the heroes' plan, that problem lingers (e.g. Saito getting shot, Fischer having armed subconscious projections, Fischer dying in the snow level, Mal sabotaging Cobb's scheme). The problem is never gone within a page; it remains until the end. 

THE PROTAGONIST IS A STANDARD ISSUE HERO / THE CHARACTERS ARE STEREOTYPES

If your characters don't have their own TvTropes page, all the better. I will stand by my claim that *Galaxy Quest* is one of the smartest movies ever made, in part because the characters aren't just characters. 

THE SCRIPT SUFFERS FROM ARBITRARY COMPLEXITY

I read a lot of scripts wherein the writer threw in an armful of plotlines to keep the story busy and the waters swirling. The problem is, the writer is aware that not all of these plotlines are important, but will ignore it because he needs the pages. But I can tell when I'm reading it: if I'm keeping track of a dozen plotlines and muttering out loud "Well what does this have to do with anything else?" to half of them, the script's in trouble. *The Prestige* and *Glengarry Glen Ross* both have three or four plotlines to manage, but each of them has a purpose in the greater story. All the plotlines eventually converge dramatically, and that's what matters. If you keep your plotlines separate, and parallel, I'll end up asking "What's the point of Plotline #9 here?"

THE PLOT UNRAVELS THROUGH COINCIDENCE/CONTRIVANCE

[John August](http://johnaugust.com/2007/perils-of-coincidence) explains it better than I can. 

THE SCRIPT IS TONALLY CONFUSED

Sometimes writers are afraid to really get their hands dirty. You've just killed a character, everything is going wrong for the hero, and you're worried that all this drama/chaos/pain will turn people off, so you add a joke to lighten the mood. If people were indeed unhappy with the drama, they're going to be doubly unhappy that you just invalidated all that drama by capping it off with a joke. *The Ice Harvest* and *No Country for Old Men* mix heavy drama and black comedy successfully. I have no idea how, but they do. 

THE PROTAGONIST IS NOT AS STRONG AS NEED BE

Meaning the protagonist is basically just a vehicle through which to view the story. He/she does what's required of them, scurries along, but isn't at all memorable. As much as I like the movie, *Hollywoodland* falls into this trap: Louis Simo fulfills his role as protagonist, but that movie's strength lies elsewhere. Hell, even *The Dark Knight* encounters this problem: Batman does what he needs to do, but kinda pales in comparison to the Joker. 

THE PREMISE IS A TRANSPARENT EXCUSE FOR ACTION

Frankly put: the writer has shit he wants to see, and has pulled together a bare bones premise to allow it. Writing for yourself (as opposed to writing for the audience) is great advice, but it can be taken too far. You may have to kill your darlings: if a sequence/scene has nothing to do with the premise/story/theme, it has to go, even if you love it. It's a script, not a sizzle reel. 

THE SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT IS TOO UNDEFINED

If the ghosts/demons/aliens/vampires appear to be omnipotent, then what's stopping them from ending the conflict immediately? Even supernatural creatures need boundaries and limitations. That's why werewolves have the full moon/silver bullets, vampires have garlic/daylight/stakes, ghosts have the boundaries of the haunted house: there needs to be something preventing them from slaughtering the heroes at the first sign of trouble. What *can* the supernatural begins do, and what *can't* they do, and *why*? 

THE STORY IS ONE BIG SHRUG

After a few scripts, I've literally said out loud, "Well what was the point of that?" Sometimes it's unclear what we're meant to be entertained by, or captivated by. This is definitely a case-by-case problem; it's hard to explain in vague terms. 

THE SCRIPT IS A POTBOILER

This doesn't necessarily mean it's a bad story; *The Lincoln Lawyer* is a great potboiler movie. But sometimes a script just hits all the necessary beats, tells a doable story, and comes and goes without much excitement. The script might be a nice distraction for two hours on a Tuesday night, but I want something more. 

THE SCENES ARE VOID OF MEANINGFUL CONFLICT

[David Mamet](http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/) said it best.

THE SCRIPT MAKES A REFERENCE, BUT NOT A JOKE

aka the [Seltzer](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0783536/?ref_=tt_ov_dr)-[Friedberg](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0294997/?ref_=tt_ov_dr) Model of Comedy.

THE DRAMA/CONFLICT IS TOLD, NOT SHOWN

I see this a lot in action movies: the villains will be discussing the hero who's coming to kill them, and will describe the badass feats he has accomplished, to sell the idea that this guy is not to be fucked with. He took down three black ops mercenaries with a pencil; he blew up Big Dino's office and burnt him alive; he slaughtered the Chinese triads with a half-empty revolver. It's all very colorful, but we're not seeing it happen and it doesn't matter, because it happened in the past, outside of the current story. *The Usual Suspects* did the same thing to Keyser Soze, but it worked in that movie because Keyser Soze was more than just a character: he was a mystery, and one that drove the story. But in these scripts, making a character badass by having other characters call him badass is lazy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The card just before the seven of diamonds has been cut a quarter of a centimeter shorter than the rest of the cards in the deck. That means when he riffles through the deck, there will be a *tiny, tiny* but unconsciously noticeable gap that lets the seven of diamonds linger in our view for longer than the other cards. It's a split second longer, but it's enough for us to see. 

Right after the "That was too fast" riffle, you can see there's a gap in the deck just past the halfway point. That gap is the too-short card.

You can actually duplicate this with your own deck, if you cut one of the cards just a quarter of a centimeter short. Whatever card comes after that one is the card the audience is going to see.

	<TEXT> I disagree. Early Stewie was even more one-note than he is now and had absolutely nowhere go. 

The two things Early Stewie wants more than everything (taking over the world and killing Lois) will *never happen*. If either of those happened, the show would be over. So Early Stewie either had to evolve out of that character to have somewhere to go, or we'd spend every episode waiting for something that never happens and never will happen. Because despite all his gadgetry, all his evil intentions, all his genius, the logical end of his character will never arrive.

Also, you can't tell me that Stewie's obtuse vernacular wouldn't get a *tiny* bit tiring after eleven seasons. "Vile woman" this and "wretched womb" that. 

Current Stewie, on the other hand, isn't as one-note. Yes, he's effeminate, but he's not gay; his many female love interests prove that. That conflict alone makes him a more thorough character than Early Stewie. Current Stewie has somewhere to go and ways to grow that Early Stewie did not.

Brian is a better character now for the same reason. He's no longer the character who has all his shit together, he's something better: the character who only *thinks* he has his shit together. He's got real problems in a real life, frequently with real relationships, of which he had none back when he was simply a smartass with one-liners. Brian was nothing more than Peter's smart-alecy sidekick, but now he's a full, troubled character of his own right. I think it's an improvement.

The curtain goes up, hiding the Statue from view, and the platform - very, very slowly, imperceptibly - *rotates*. The lights around the Status go dark, and when the curtain is pulled back, the Statue appears to be gone -- because everyone is now facing another direction. If you were watching the illusion from Manhattan, the Statue would still be there (it just wouldn't be illuminated).](/spoiler)

* Houdini vanishing the elephant: [mirrors. When you look inside the box (where the elephant was just standing), you're only seeing half the box. There's a mirror running down the middle, concealing one half of the box (where the elephant is) and reflecting the other, empty half of the box.](/spoiler)

* Sawing a woman in half: [fake legs, or two women.](/spoiler)

* If you ever go to the Disneyland magic shop, you'll see three tricks: the floating card, the fingertip lights, and the rising cards. [Floating card: it's invisible thread, running from the card, through the magician's fingers, to the magician's vest. The card hangs there, like a puppet; you can't tell because it's always spinning, rather than simply hanging. Fingertip lights: a special apparatus on the fingertips, that's all. Rising cards: only half the deck is real. The other half is a big block (disguised as cards) which holds a small pulley system loads with a weight (like an elevator/counterweight). The chosen card is stuck to the pulley system, and when the deck is turned upside-down, the weight descends -- pulling the pulley up, and making the card rise from the deck.](/spoiler)

* Cups and balls: [it's four balls, not three, and a lot of sleight-of-hand to conceal and load the fourth. *All* close up magic relies on two things: sleight-of-hand, and memory.](/spoiler) [Watch Penn   Teller give a quick sleight-of-hand lesson.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXGr76CfoCs) Close-up magic is just gorgeous. Every close-up effect is a result of dedication and practice. This means there are no simple explanations for close-up effects; no gotchas or gimmicks or "Oh, of course, it's so obvious". It's one artful move after another: conceal, load, produce, and repeat. That's the difference between close-up magic and stage magic: once you learn the secret behind a close-up effect, you're still amazed. Differently amazed, but still amazed. You used to be baffled, now you're just impressed.

	<TEXT> That my parents are infallible. 

It's an interesting rite of passage to realize that your mom and dad are just regular people, who have their own problems, their own insecurities, their own highs and lows, and who don't have all the answers.  </TEXT>
