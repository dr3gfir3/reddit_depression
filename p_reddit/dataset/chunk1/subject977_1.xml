	<TEXT> Wie gut ist die Sapphire Radeon RX 480 8GB NITRO+ denn im Gegensatz zu der GTX 1060. Die hat ja 2GB mehr, aber wie sieht es mit der Leistung aus? Nimmt die schnell ab? Bei Radeon bin ich gerne vorsichtig aber es kann ja sein das Radeon zu unrecht einen schlechten Ruf hat.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **What will you be doing with this PC? Be as specific as possible, and include specific games or programs you will be using.**

* I will be using the PC for gaming. I am looking forward to Battlefield 1 and the beta showed me that I do need a better PC.

**What is your maximum budget before rebates/shipping/taxes?** 

* My maximum budget is 750

**When do you plan on building/buying the PC? Note: beyond a week or two from today means any build you receive will be out of date when you want to buy.** 

* I am planning on building/buying the PC as soon as possible. I got holidays at the moment so I am looking forward to doing something. 

**What, exactly, do you need included in the budget? (Tower/OS/monitor/keyboard/mouse/etc\)** 

* I need the Tower. I already got a better monitor and mouse. Keyboard will be coming later.

**Which country (and state/province) will you be purchasing the parts in? If you're in US, do you have access to a Microcenter location?** 

* I will be buying the parts in Germany.

**If reusing any parts (including monitor(s)/keyboard/mouse/etc), what parts will you be reusing? Brands and models are appreciated.** 

* I will be reusing my monitor (BenQ sorry forgot the model and not home), keyboard (some old Medion) , mouse (Logitech G401) and I got an OS ready (Win 7).

**Will you be overclocking? If yes, are you interested in overclocking right away, or down the line? CPU and/or GPU?** 

* I am not interested in overclocking at the moment. 

**Are there any specific features or items you want/need in the build? (ex: SSD, large amount of storage or a RAID setup, CUDA or OpenCL support, etc)**

* I was planning on including a GTX 1060  in the build if there isn't a better alternative. Edit: GTX 1060 6GB

**Do you have any specific case preferences (Size like ITX/microATX/mid-tower/full-tower, styles, colors, window or not, LED lighting, etc), or a particular color theme preference for the components?**

* I don't have a preference case.

**Do you need a copy of Windows included in the budget? If you do need one included, do you have a preference?**

* Already got Windows included :)

	<DATE> 2016-09-19 01:52:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As the title already says I am planning a Civ V LAN and I would love to hear some tips and suggestions from you to make it more interesting. 


I have never planned a LAN before but wanted to do a small LAN with about 6-8 people to celebrate my birthday and the ''soon'' release of Civ VI. Now for this I thought we might play some Civ as it seems like a game you can play on a LAN for 12 hrs or something so you can finally finish a game without waiting for everybody to gather and everybody likes the game. I thought about some things like: 

* Experienced players get weak civs, not so experienced get strong        civs  
* Free for all but allowed to create pacts
* Everybody bring a flag of the civ they are playing (?)
* Civ drinking game (?)

But that is all I got so far. And as you see that is not a lot. I'd like to have some things to make the game fun and fair for everybody. So let me hear what good/unique ideas you got :)

I am currently playing with magic the first time and I saw somewhere that the Balder Side Sword is really good at +15. Now I havn't played Dark Souls in a while since my controller. (Not from me being pissed off but from being a 4 year old and cheap controller). What are some things that I should skill to get the best out of magic and my Balder Side Sword. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How I spent my 30min playing Civ 6 at the gamescom and why I am proud of what I've done </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-21 22:25:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am not really active in this sub, but a friend of mine is active so I thought hey why not give you guys an impression of what Civ 6 is. Now I am no pro in any Civ game I played one on my DS ages ago and I got about 150hrs in Civ V. I met my friend and we waited about 45min to play the game, as it was the first thing we went to. I was really exited when I got to the PC and although the mouse and keyboard were a bit too low for me, but that's only because I am above average height. So we get to play as China and it felt like I already knew basic things. I am not going into details about the politics system as I didn't really pay attention, because I set myself one mission. Conquer the city state I spawned next to. I am really impressed by the Civ 6 units. I started with slingers and warriors as basic units I could produce. So I made some slingers and warriors and killed some barbarians while I waited for the technology to make archers. After I got the archers I produced about 4 of them and walked to the city state, which I declared war in the second round, and started shooting it with arrows. It was early game so the city couldn't attack me and their units were really weak compared to my army. After nearly 30 minutes I finally managed to take the city with archers and  a lonely slinger unit (Marched in with a warrior I made about 3 rouns earlier while the city was down on health). I know it's nothing special probably gives you no idea about the game but I am happy to be one of the first or even the first one to conquer a city state in Civ 6 (if anyone was at the gamescom and played Civ 6 please tell me what day and time :) ) </TEXT>

As we are coming closer to ESL One Cologne 2016 I think we need a return of the Friend Finder. Of course Adam did it for MLG, which was really nice,  so maybe we get someone from ESL to do one. From my viewpoint it would really help, as I too go to the major but non of my friends can so I would be a lone wolf, but I want to cheer with some eSport fans and meet new people :) Pls mods bring the FF back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have written an exam about Bismarck in history last Friday and one of the tasks was to write a statement about the question in the title. I found that very interesting and I'd like to discuss this topic, because I don't think his intention was an equilibrium policy to benefit Europe rather then making sure he is the political power in Europe. I stated: ''The German equilibrium policy is only a byproduct of Bismarcks plan on being the political power in Europe and just a wishful thinking.''  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow redditors!

I'm learning Java at school (doing my A level in math and computer science) and I have to say that I love programming. Well I got bored of doing just normal programs for school and I wanted to do something I'd enjoy doing which also makes me learn new things. I know that Android Studio uses Java and I've tried some things in but no major things just basic things. Now I got this idea and I know what I need to do if I'd do it in my Java Editor. But how do I connect that with Android Studio? Do you know any good tutorials that are good at explaining how you use certain things like e.g. one part of the app is supposed to be some kind of profile. Now I know what I need like a String for the name and stuff like that but I'm not really sure how to do such thing in Android Studios, as I am only used to my good old Java Editor. 

I'd appreciate if anyone had some really helpful and good explain tutorials. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello o/

I'm currently learning Java in school and I really love programming. I could site there for hours and hours just doing some fun little stuff. For example I did a little 'game' where I'd have to chose options from a menu and have a coin system to buy more stuff and so on. I really loved doing it and I thought that I want to make something like this for a living. Now the problem is I don't know where to start. I read that I could try to make an App and I tried using the Android Studios tutorials but they just overwhelmed me with too much stuff and some things worked differently in the new version so I was lost at some point. What are  some things you would recommend someone who doesn't know where to start from now. I know a fair bit about Java now and I am willing to learn even more. I already thought about maybe doing a little website, because why not? But I feel like that doesn't quite do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow redditors!

I am 17 year old German on a trial as a blogger for team-dignitas.net and I am trying to improve my work and I want to know what you would like to know more about. 

To give you an understanding of what I am doing I'll link you one of my blogs below. Basically it is writing tutorials for newer and more experienced players as well as interview which I haven't written yet, but I would love to in the future. In the last days I've gone over my work and noticed that I don't like it, because it is not quite what I want to do week after week, and I am sure you, too don't want to read how to throw smokes every week. I thought that I might ask the people who I want to address what they would change what they would change or maybe even give me some tips as I am not an experienced writer. 

I'd appreciate serious tips and critic.

Here is one of my blogs:

	<TEXT> I've beat the game some days ago and started NG+ which I didn't think would be that hard. And oh well it is. Now my question is I saw that scaling is pretty useful and I can't decide on what weapon I should use, because at the moment I use the great Great Scythe +15 but I have more STR than DEX so I figured maybe I should consider using something else before going down the hell hole called Abyss to defeat the four kings. I'd be glad if someone could help me.

These are my stats:

STR 40
DEX 31
INT 20

	<DATE> 2016-05-05 22:43:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So first off I know that there are a lot of posts about how good co-op is and I loved to read them so maybe I can give something back to the community with this. I was struggeling with O S on NG+ and farmed about 30 humanity first to summon Solairebro to help me. He was help for the first one either Smough or Ornstein but then I just got recked. After a few tries I thought to myself why not wait at the bonfire and see if anybody is there. And how nice there was someone there. I ran to the summon sign and summoned 'Chronial' he tried fighting O S two times and I kinda fucked up because I died being stupid. After the second try I summoned him again and saw another summon sign. It was 'Darksoul' and jesus he kicked ass. He had the weapon which shoots the thing from the moonlight butterfly. We ran to the giants before O S and I am not sure but I think he one-shoted one of the giants. After we cleared out the area we ran to the fog gate and prepared to kick some ass. As we three entered the room O S tried to welcome us with a faceslap, but no not this time! We dodged like heros and just went storming onto Smough he died pretty quickly and nobody got seriously hurt untill that point. I was quite happy, because on my first playtrough I killed Ornstein first so I didn't get his armor but now I had a chance to get his armor. It was an intense fight and sadly Chronial got hit by Ornsteins spear and died instantly. With a man down we kinda knew what to do without even speaking. I lured Ornstein onto me and dodged his attacks while Darksoul shot at him with his spear. Everytime he got close to Darksoul I ran in his direction and jumped at Ornstein with my Great Scythe. After some minutes we had him down and I was so happy that I finally beat Ornstein last and got his armor (which I am wearing right now). I can't be more thankful to my two heros :) Without you I'm not sure if I would be able to remain human and not hollow after endless attempts. So thanks for the jolly co-op and I can only say if there is a summon sign check it out and try it, maybe you'll have as much fun as I did. Praise the sun \[T]/

And here is a picture of us at the fog gate :)

	<TITLE> Did Hitler really help Germany out of it's great depression after WW I? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-01 17:41:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was reading a discussion today about Hitler not all being bad and the point of that person was that he helped germany out of depression with work and a growing economy. I couldn't quite agree with his opinion, because from what I learned in history at school it is not the work of Hitler that the econmy started to get better again. And I know he build some 'Autobahnen' which is of course work for a lot of people but if I remember correctly while Hitler was controlling Germany a lot of people starved in the winter because there was not enough food and it was really expensive (don't quote me on this one I'm not sure if I remember correctly). And as Adam Smith explained people take advantage of each other to gain advantages theirselfs. So my guess would be that Hitler did not care about how many people work in Germany but rather that they build him 'Autobahnen' for the war and that would give them work so they don't care about what he is doing. Plus he destroyed the german economy later, because he spent so much money on the war. I had a great statistic but I can't find it anymore. So did Hitler really help Germany or was it due to someone/something else? I'm really looking forward for an answer. </TEXT>
