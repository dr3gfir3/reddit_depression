	<TEXT> At one point I was considering doing a series of the same animal (turtles) with each having a different symbol on the shell for each person in my family.  A musical note for one of my boys, a little pink flower for my only daughter, etc.  I mentioned the idea to a good friend and he asked me if I really wanted to look like the back of an SUV.  I reconsidered and did something else.  I think you should work towards the idea of an arm band where the links of the band each represent a sibling.  Include yourself in the band. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's the plan, I want to give him some symbols of the things I love, music, the outdoors, etc. and have them create a weave that will begin at my wrist and work up to the end of my forearm.  So maybe an arrow, a musical note, etc.  The thickness of the banding can vary and wrap in and out of itself.  I have to wait until December to get it done but I'm already jonesing to start the design process.  This reddit has been a huge inspiration for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are my children's first and middle initials, yes I have 5.  I had a drawing of a Celtic design that had 6 points in it that were much smaller.  I wanted it to look like it was cut out of my skin.  Brian took it and revamped it into what you see here.  Now that I have it I'm contemplating having him design a full sleeve for my forearm that will incorporate this into it. </TEXT>
