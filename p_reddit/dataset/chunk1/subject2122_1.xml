	<TITLE> Does anyone else see Kyle Mooney as a combination of Andy Samberg and Fred Armisen? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-13 05:46:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been a big fan of his on the show so far and I think he encapsulates some of the traits that Andy and Fred used to have on the show.

Armisen: He's played many roles that Fred would've played in the past before. I could easily see Fred playing one of the ISIS guys in the Shark Tank from two weeks ago. Kyle also has portrayed Steve Jobs and Pope Francis, both of which Armisen also has played. I also have the feeling that Bruce Chandling would get along really well with Nicholas Fehn. Both usually play weird, offbeat characters on the show.

Samberg: Obviously, both of them are known for the shorts they've made on the show. I think it extends a little beyond that, however. Anyone remember the Lena Dunham teenage girl sketch where Kyle comes in as the captain of the schools' soccer team and plays as the straight man i it? That's a role that Samberg would've played five years ago. Andy hardly got lead roles in sketches, but made the most out of his small, supporting roles, like Kyle has so far.

Are there any current cast members where you see two former cast members in them? I also see Beck Bennett as a combination of Jason Sudeikis and Chris Parnell, but that's another conversation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They've done a tribute to her during the Sarah Silverman episode and mentioned her passing on social media through Twitter and Facebook.

	<TEXT> One of mine would be the The Gang Gets Extreme: Home Makeover Edition. I thought it was an okay episode but nothing special, since it's a prototypical Sunny episode where the gang hatches up a plan and things snowball out of control. After watching it for a second time however, I genuinely grew to like it. Frank videotaping the gang fucking everytthing up, Mac and Dee shoving American culture down the Juarez's family throat, Charlie and Dennis wrecking their house and the mother of the Juarez family stabbing Frank with scissors all make that episode for me. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I know 2014 is not over, but which actor in your opinion had a better year: Jim Carrey in 1994 or Chris Pratt in 2014? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-29 22:28:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Jim Carrey had three hit comedies in 1994 (The Mask, Ace Ventura, and Dumb and Dumber), two of which had sequels. Ace Ventura made $100 million at the box office, The Mask made over $300 million and Dumb and Dumber made over $200 million . He was also on the hit comedy show In Living Color, even though it was winding down around this time.

Chris Pratt was the lead voice actor in the #1 animated film of the year in The Lego Movie and was also the star of the #1 movie overall this summer in Guardians. He is also part of the ensemble of one of the most critically acclaimed comedies on television in Parks and Rec. He also hosted SNL, something Carrey wouldn't do until 1996 (though he has hosted one other time and is scheduled to do so again sometime this fall.)

	<TEXT> Taran could play the straight guy (for example, like him as Piers Morgan or him as simply as a dad or a coach) as Sudeikis used to and then in the next sketch, he could turn around and bring the house down when he plays a character like Eddie, which I think is a character that Will Ferrell could do in his sleep. In other words, I think he combines the groundedness of Sudeikis with the eccentrities of Ferrell. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to refresh your memory, this years' first-timers were:
Edward Norton
Kerry Washington
Lady Gaga
Josh Hutcherson
Drake
Jim Parsons
Lena Dunham
Anna Kendrick
Andrew Garfield
Andy Samberg

You could make a case for any of them, but my votes go for Kerry, Gaga, Drake and Kendrick.
Kerry was pretty versatile in her roles and had good timing, Gaga proved to be really game for anything on the show, Drake was impressive in his turn and his ability to squeeze the most out of the material (like the Indiana Jones ride sketch) and I really liked Anna Kendrick, but I somehow feel that she didn't appear a whole lot in her episode. What do you guys think?

	<TEXT> By this, I mean their first show (Steve Carell/Kanye West) when they first appeared on Weekend Update for an impression-off. Bill Hader did spot-on impressions of Peter Falk and James Mason, while Andy kept doing the same voice for each of Christopher Walken and Julia Roberts. Now they're both big stars (not yet for Hader, at least) and Andys' still inferior to Hader in terms of impressions. It's even higlighted when some of Andys' impressions in the monologue last night weren't so good. What do you guys think? </TEXT>

I could see him hosting the penultimate episode, as the finale will probably to go to a veteran of the show (Poehler, Baldwin, Hanks, idk).

	<TITLE> Was watching the James Franco Roast on Youtube and encountered Natasha Legerro's joke to Bill Hader: "You are this generation's Phil Hartman." </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-17 07:26:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The joke may have gone a little too far, but I do see similarities between the two SNL legends:

Both were on SNL for eight seasons: Phil from 1986 to 1994, and Bill from 2005 to 2013.

Both actually didn't start out in comedy. Phil was a graphic designer and designed album covers for a lot of bands. Bill was a production assistant for many years on a lot of television shows and movies, some of which were blockbusters.
                                                                                                
 Both have gained a good reputation around the entertainment industry for being strong voice actors. Bill voiced the lead role in Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs and Phil of course voiced one of the Simpsons most famous recurring characters in Troy McClure.

 Both are/were known to be good people while not on screen.

 Both started out at famed comedy theatres in Los Angeles. Phil was with the Groundlings before SNL and Bill was at Second City Los Angeles.

 Both were never actually thought of as the stars of the show necessarily. They were both backbones to the cast of their times.

 Both were known for their impressions (this one's pretty obvious.)

 Both also had good characters, but Phil never really had a standout one like Bill's Stefon.

 Both of their goodbyes on SNL involved characters. Bill did his in the form of a British punk rocker. Phil wasn't in character, but many members of the SNL cast said goodbye in one of their characters.

 Both never really had lead roles after leaving SNL, with Phil being a supporting actor in movies and in Newsradio, which was more of an ensemble. The jury's still out on Bill though, as he does have a couple of lead roles lined up, such as CWACM's sequel and an indie film, titled     The Skeleton Twins.

 They both had families (this one's stretching it.)

 And finally, both were really talented and can both be considered two of the best SNL cast members of all-time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When do you think it is the best time after someone leaves the cast to return as a guest host? I think having Kristen Wiig was a good choice to  host, but her return as one was too soon (not even a year after she left.) Personally, I think two-three years is appropriate enough. I strongly think we'll see Andy Samberg return as host later this year (Brooklyn Nine Nine's off to a strong start) btw. </TEXT>
