There's no conspiracy, they simply thought they could introduce these changes and underestimated the backlash and ferocity of the responses. 

Ellen Pao just happens to be the least powerful in the upper echelons of Reddit so she's the one who takes it in the ass.

In the following weeks, if they feel the damage is not yet contained, they will likely volunteer another ass to take a trip to Pound Town, and it's going to be whoever has the least influence or power. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An insect is alive in the same sense as an embryo is alive. It does not mean it has a sense of self or at least not enough that you can call it murder. 

Likewise an embryo or fetus up to a certain point is just that: alive, not aware, no self, and more of an automata than a person.

As science moves toward, we'll likely discover when awareness happens, and we would no longer apply arbitrary points in time to determine when abortion crosses ethical boundaries.

Simply banning it causes a lot of issues. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Easy availability of gun is to blame. And it doesn't help that there's always huge opposition from gun lobbyist and owners everytime there's a move to curb it.

It's a simple equation: more guns available equals more gun deaths. We've seen the opposite is also true in Australia, Japan, London...

More gun deaths from cops too because the have to assume you have a gun and might use it even if you're being arrested for a non-violent infraction.

Gun control makes sense. We just need to move away from the emotional or patriotic arguments for it for about to see it clearly.

(and now I've pulled away from the real story: the untimely death of someone's daughter) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The books is badly written. Maybe it's well researched, but the dialog and monologues are cringe inducing. I'm almost 90% done and I just gave up on it not caring what happens to everyone.

However this is one of those books that would lend itself well on screen. So the movie might actually be better.

Thinking about it now, the way it was written, feels like it was done by someone whose main mode of entertainment is the movies and probably the reason why it's a very stilted read (same way that reading the script of a good movie feels rather lackluster) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Sleeping Beauty series (Anne Rice's writing as A. N. Roquelaure) is awesome erotic fiction. You can jack it off to the quality of her prose alone (if you're into well crafted phrases) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember this one time, a friend of mine asked me if I've ever fucked a cow, and I said "Are you fucking insane?!"

"Oh, no no no, it's good you gotta try it man!"

"What about the horns?" I asked. "Those things, short as they are they could fuck you up bad!"

"Don't worry man, I could hold them for you, make sure the cow can't move her head."

And so we went to this cow that he's been seeing regularly. He got in front of it and held its horns while I do my business from behind.

It was good. 

And when I was almost there I said, "Let her horns go!" 

"I can't, you'll get gored!"

I said: "Fuck that noise! let it go so I can give it a kiss!"

He got off light IMO.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> we visited last year and discovered cacaolat. we liked it so much we brought back two 6-pack packages of it.

we're down to the last bottle :-( and can't find it anywhere in the US or websites that sell international grocery products. 

does anyone have any advice on how i could get more of it? 
would anyone here be willing to purchase and ship it over to me? (i'll pay of course)

thanks!
