	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm pretty sure that the entire point of the iOS Twitter App is to keep users inside the Twitterverse, including their browser. The thing is, I'm really uncomfortable with the 3rd party tracking that does on using naked browsers and the vulnerabilities w/ some rich ads. FWIW, I whitelist sites that aren't abusive to feed the commons.

The Twitter App Prefs doesn't seem to give an option to have clicked links open in Safari iOS instead of their browser. Am I missing something?

Failing that, is there an App for Twitter that has this feature?

And: in the extremely remote chance that Facebook users care about their digital privacy, I suppose it'd be nice posing the same question for FB iOS users. See: servicey! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Motherboard: Vape Regulation Is Coming, and It Just Might Kill the Industry. If so, what viable counter strategies? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-04 22:25:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Motherboard has an article, [Vape Regulation Is Coming, and It Just Might Kill the Industry](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/vape-regulation-is-coming-and-it-just-might-kill-the-industry).

It's not optimistic. Very worth the click-thru, but the gist:

The major concern circles around one thing: a grandfathering date that determines which products can stay on the market, and which would face regulatory barriers so high, some vaping advocates say it would kill the business.

This date could destroy the industry, said Gregory Conley, the president of the American Vaping Association, a nonprofit advocacy group.

Just a few possibilities remain that could alter that date and tip the scales between two potential futures: the beginning of a new, more-structured market for e-cigarettes, or the veritable death of vaping on US soil.

Is the pessimism justified?

* Will pre-made juices from independent be banned?

* How about e-cigs (the decent refillable mods, not those crappy gas station one-use kinds foisted on us often by the tobacco companies)?

* If so, will ordering the batteries/tanks etc overseas be viable? Vastly more expensive?

* If so, same for pre-made juice?

* If so, will making your own juice or forming local collectives to do the same be a viable tactic?

As a former smoker whose life has *dramatically* improved thanks to vaping, I can't begin to describe my anger/anxiety. I support not selling Vaping goods to children and labeling. Even banning those (horrible) one-use vaping products. 

This is far worse. It's finger-wagging prohibitionists trying to stomp out adults making informed choices and stomping on legitimate and effective harm reduction strategies that have made a difference.

For context, I use an Aspire CF Sub Omega and buy e-juices mail-order, about a month's worth per shipment.

TL;DR: assume the worst and the FDA bans Vape Sticks   pre-made juices. Is importing around it likely to work? Home-brewing and home-fabricating your own equipment?

Thanks!

	<TEXT> Hey, all -

Just throwing this out as one reader to another. I like /r/privacytoolsIO a lot, obviously. But I've noticed there are a couple links that go straight to video (YouTube and the like, although Vimeo etc. would raise similar issues).

For me, it's really hard to know what the post is about unless I can read it. Not everyone has the time to slog thru a video, or they're at work, have bandwidth limits, be on mobile, etc.

And, I can scan a paragraph or so and know an article is worth the read, versus videos I really can't. Or there might be interesting info but crappy production values. Etc.

So, what are your feelings on this? Should direct-to-video links be discouraged? Not allowed? Leave things as-is unless it gets worse? Have MOAR video links? 

It's all good, just trying to solicit feedback. I'm *personally* thinking, videos are grand, but only if the link (or self post) gives context first, so everyone knows whether it's worth playing the danged thing. Again, personally speaking, mod hat off. 

Curious what others think.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, all -

A subscriber who's a student wants to poll /r/privacy on privacy rights. Awesome! But s/he's using Google as the polling solution. The irony is a bit rich for us, and we *love* irony.

So, any suggestions for a web based polling solution that is verifiably privacy-respecting that we can steer him towards? If it's good, we may make it the default polling platform choice for future queries. 

Having to register to create a poll is fine, but we'd require respondents to not have to. Duh. Google's poll does that, but also does a lot of backend tracking that we're not wildly enthusiastic about implicitly endorsing.

I did a quick survey w/ DDG, and nothing stood out, so I thought I'd turn to you wonderful readers.

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [EU] A Game of Thrones chapter, scene or the entire saga. Told from the perspective of Balarion The Black (Cat). Or all of the ASOIAF cats. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-22 00:05:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Game of Thones backstory concerns the Targaryens  past dynasty of dragon-riding, conquesting kings spanning generations. They are (nearly) snuffed out in a coup-de-tat where one of the princesses is among those slain. She had a small black kitten that witnessed the horrors, then grows into the most ferocious, ornery and feared cat in all of King's Landing, the seat of power in the main continent of GRR Martin's saga.

He's mainly featured in the first book but is referenced throughout the series. Clearly showing he's integral to the culmination of the series in a way we aren't yet privy to.

http://awoiaf.westeros.org/index.php/Balerion_(cat)

A Song of Ice And Fire has received some small acclaim and attention. Martin's use of Point-of-View format for each chapter is inspired, since by seeing events through different eyes, the personalities and flaws of each featured character's chapter must be interpreted by the reader. However, the series, despite its small success, is handicapped by a singular, fatal flaw: none of these POV scenes are from Balerion's perspective. Or any cat's perspective, for that matter.

Please fix this.

I humbly point out the feline species has a short attention span, are distracted by small, fast-moving objects, and are easily placated by catnip, having their ears scratched and conversely, scratching the bejeezus out of damned near everything. They're rather fond of naps. While they lack opposable thumbs, they possess twenty *very* sharp claws to compensate. And they purr.

While their mutual antipathy towards canines is documented, I'd like to see a story revolving around their relations with dragons being non-antagonistic  neutral or even species allies preferred. Unless you think writing about a dragon playing against the rules, because he (or she) has nothing left to lose, works. But only because he (or she) has been Pushed Too Far. But then it's on you to explain why a dragon is committing this against-type breach.

And, there must be blood. There must be fire. There must be hissing, remorseless **vengeance**.

Thanks! </TEXT>
