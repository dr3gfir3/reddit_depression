	<TEXT> I can't help but think... A moment in time like this, by the time you got your camera or phone out, got it ready, and snapped the picture... You would have missed it. 

So... I can't help but think that the OP was videotaping his two dogs having sex and caught this moment, screen captured it, and uploaded. Which begs the question... Why are you videotaping your dogs having sex? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in this restaurant one time. I walked in and there was a sign that said "Please wait to be seated". So I stood there and waited. Place was a ghost town too. After waiting for 5 minutes to be seated, I got tired of waiting, and went and sat at a booth. I waited again for over an hour, and the waiter never came. I tried clearing my throat, making noise, nothing. After an hour and a half, I realized the place was closed.

tl;dr There was a reason this restaurant didn't have anyone else in it! </TEXT>
