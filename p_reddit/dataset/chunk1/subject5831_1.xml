	<TEXT> It makes me happy to know that you were able to find a way to get somewhat closer to God. I guess I just need to find my own. Thank you so much. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your words. As for going to events on campus I've gone to 4 since I moved in. I try my best to be apart of the conversations and everything but I feel so far behind everyone and I never know what to say. This weekend I'm going to try and find a Church off campus and see if that helps me. </TEXT>
