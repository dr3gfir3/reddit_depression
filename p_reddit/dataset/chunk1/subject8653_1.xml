	<TEXT> There are no "esoteric" explanations given because the journey that you're about to take is a very personal one. I agree that memorization is the key. Take for example the JW's lecture. We've all heard it as we pass through our Initiation but, unless you have a photographic memory, you probably have forgotten most of what was in that beautiful lecture. Take your time to memorize it, as you become more proficient with the memory work, you will notice that you're lips and gestures will be doing all the work without much mental effort- thus freeing your brain to contemplate on your life as you recite the words. I am not sure if that makes sense to you at all but I guess you'll get it when you get there.

	<TEXT> Hmmm... It's been more than a decade since my last chapter meeting but I think I still know the main focus or essential teachings of DeMolay.
The 7 Cardinal Virtues of a DeMolay:
1. Filial Love
2. Reverence for all Sacred Things
3. Courtesy
4. Comradeship
5. Fidelity
6. Cleanness
7. Patriotism

I was Initiated, Passed, and Raised as a Master Mason here in Canada but I became a DeMolay and a "Knight" (Order of Knighthood - Thomas Michael Sherry Priory) in the Philippines. Young men take their DeMolay membership very seriously in that part of the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm now based in Canada but I grew up in a small island province in the Philippines where there are lots of dogs without leashes and feral cats. Some of the houses there keep bucket right outside the kitchen door. This bucket is for collecting leftovers such as fish bones, entrails, spoiled rice, etc. And then people from pig farms collect the contents of the bucket as food for the pigs. The problem is stray dogs and feral cats also find the swill irresistible. Once a dog or a cat discovers where the bucket is placed, it will come back everyday and make a mess. To control the problem, housekeepers poison the animals by adding a very generous amount of MSG (Ajinomoto brand) into the swill.  It's a slow death for the animal.  This is common knowledge in my province that's why a lot of us do not use MSG. </TEXT>

Grab it and do a Google back search and you'll see shots from different angles- all showing him wearing that golden Square and Compasses pin. If this does not prove his membership, it will prove that he is his father's son and he is a proud Lewis. </TEXT>

You have 3 here which traditionally represents wisdom, strength, and beauty- but it seems to me that the wrong columns have been used (unless this is intentional)- on the background you have a Tuscan, and on foreground you have two Corinthians which support the sun and the moon. And what iss the significance of the Metatron's cube/Flower of Life's position next to Leo? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been a stay at home dad for more than a year now. I have an 11yr old daughter and a 2yr old boy. I don't like hiring nannies. I like gardening and cooking. Lately I have found love in cleaning and organizing stuff around the house. I don't drink. But I love smoking the sacred herb. I was a corporate slave before I decided to work fulltime on my website where I sell neckties (my own design). When I received the Registered Trademark of my brand, that's when I decided that I'm jumping into this thing full time. It was a very bumpy ride but things are starting to look real well (spiritual, emotional, financial) and it looks like I may be able to extend my stay as a stay at home dad- the job which I've grown to love. </TEXT>

I have 2 Freemason rings. My favourite is a cheap one that I got on eBay for 9 bucks. It's a perfect fit, looks nice, and I know I'm not gonna cry if I scratch or lost it. My other ring is a 1930's gold swivel ring that I got also from eBay for about 300 bucks- the thing that I like about it is I can hide the S C when I have to. I don't wear it as much because I don't like it getting scratched. I'm planning to buy a 3rd ring this time from Jems by Jem- most of the rings there are stainless steel working man's rings. Something that I could wear everyday even while working with my hands.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks guys. There where 3 events that happened on that day. 
1. Around 7am, a red car parked nearby and stayed there for about 12 minutes.
2. At around noon time, a man was seen by one of the camera walking towards the side of the house and he took something from the bushes. Somehow he was able to get to the side of the house while avoiding the camera in front.
3. This video that you see here. 

My theory is they could be trying to clone the remote keyless entry code either to the car or to the garage but apparently code grabbing have been obsolete since the 90's. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fusilier Drive. The car that he was trying to open is a brand new BMW. I doubt that he's trying to steal the car itself. Maybe he just want to get something inside.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why ofcourse. Everyone knows that anything pentagram and the rest of all the geometric shapes came from Satan.

	<TEXT> I'm a Freemason and I say that this guy is a fake! I mean why would a 32nd Degree ex-Mason fail to disclose that thing that we do in the Lodge that involves a carrot and a goat?!? Unbelievable! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> An hour with google and you will find most of the "secrets" that a Freemason have sworn never to disclose. A Freemason could care less if you are in the possession of a "secret" which you have obtained outside the Lodge. Freemasonry imparts knowledge through symbolism and secrecy itself is just one of the many symbols it uses. I hope I have answered your question. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks Bro. Don't really know what I was thinking... Must be a case of tunnel vision- I just read the part about the apron corner pointing upward/downward as indicative of a Mason's rank. I reacted right away by saying that not all jurisdictions practice this. Didn't read the rest of what you said. My bad.  </TEXT>
