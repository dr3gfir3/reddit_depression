	<TITLE> Should I keep my car or trade it in when purchasing our next? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First time poster, long time lurker. Husband and I currently own 3 cars: Jeep Wrangler ('12), Scion TC ('08) and Camry ('02). All but one (Jeep) is PIF. Trying to weigh the pros and cons between keeping my Scion and getting rid of the Camry or keeping the Camry and trading in the Scion. 

We're expecting our first bundle of joy in December and are planning to get rid of one of our two cars and purchase a new vehicle more suitable for the kiddo. However, since we're also scheduled to make a cross country move sometime June/July 2016, we're postponing the purchase of our new car until after that move is completed. Our loan on the jeep is scheduled to be paid off by September '16, but in order to avoid having two car payments at once, we plan to pay it off after getting our tax return approx March/April of next year. 

Husband currently uses his Camry to commute (45mi/day RT) 5 days a week. However, his job also often requires him to drive during working hours, putting another 100-200 additional miles per week on top of his commute. His car currently has 250,000+ miles and zero trade in value, and has gone 3 cross country moves. We anticipate this driving estimate to remain approx about the same when we move in June/July '16. I currently use the scion (currently 100K mileage, est. 4.5K trade in value) to commute. However, due to impending doom (of both Kiddo's arrival and our move cross country), my boss and I have already negotiated a part time, work from home agreement for me after Kiddo is born. Due to this, husband and I have decided that it makes the most sense for me to drive the Jeep for work/errands when needed after kiddo is born. (I don't anticipate driving more than 2 days/week for work) I should also mention that having a beater car (whether it be the Camry or the Scion) is a non-negotiable for husband, as he wants to keep his road princess (Jeep) safe in the garage as much as possible. Our new car will be in the 24-28K price range, and barring something catastrophic, we plan to have an 8-10K down payment. (7.5K already in the bank-- this is exclusive of any emergency/retirement funds we currently have. Anticipated OOP moving costs also being accounted for.)

Given all that background info, my instinct is telling me that before the end of the year, we would be better off donating the Camry and getting a tax write off and keeping my car (Scion) for husband to use for his daily commute. The primary reason being that, even though the scion would get better trade in value when it's time to buy the new car, by keeping it, we would save much more over the maintenance of keeping the Camry. (Since one way or another, he insists on having a beater car) Husband wants to do the opposite and keep his Camry, based on the fact that we could get more trade-in value for my car. PersonalFinance, what would you do? Thanks for your input in advance! 

Tl;dr - Need to get a new car for our expanding family in June/July '16 after moving cross country. Should I keep 2008 scion tc and donate 2002 Camry for tax write off, or trade in Scion and keep Camry as a beater car?  </TEXT>
