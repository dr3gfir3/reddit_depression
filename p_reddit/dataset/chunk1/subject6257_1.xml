	<TEXT> I think i heard that the movie isn't cannon anymore..atleast i saw it in alot of yt comments being discussed about..and whis himself said it in this video that the gods power is the top of the castle and goku and vegeta's is that top of the tree..so if you scale it in a percentage i would say beerus used maybe 10%? lol. DBS is 100% cannon so  yeah... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So basically, when switching to first gear you let the clutch slowly and and at switching to 2, 3, 4 and etc you let it fast? Or still slowly? (Bit confused lol) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just wanted to ask you guys this, imagine if you're on 2nd or 3rd or even a higher gear and then you release the clutch to fast will the motorcycle shut down? Or does that only happen when you switch to 1st gear and release the clutch to fast?

(I hope this isn't a stupid question :( lol) </TEXT>
