Not sure what "new facts" I invented by suggesting Kwame Brown is a bust, but if you seriously feel the need to continue this then by all means. The point was moot 18 hours ago so I hope it makes you feel better to rail against Kobe like he personally offended you by playing in the NBA. God forbid a Lakers fan like myself roots for or cherishes the memory one of my team's greatest players. But then again here we are in r/NBA where it's considered heresy if I don't worship LBJ.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man, you must be Kwame's biggest fan, because I've never seen someone go to these lengths to defend his lack of basketball talent. Let's get surgical. None of the guys you've listed were drafted #1 overall and had as much stigma for sucking. Hickson was actually serviceable for a few years in the league and that was actually 73 games in 2010. Gooden averaged double figures most of his career. Brown only started 20 games next to LBJ. Snow was at the tail end of a career where he actually averaged 7 assists a couple years. Pavlovic posted a DWS of 2.3 in 2007, better than all but one of Kwame's seasons -- presumably Mike Brown kept starting him because he earned that spot with his defense. In 12 pitiful years, there is no proof that Kwame contributed anything meaningful on either end of the floor. In the words of Stephen A, the guy's a "bonafide scrub." He wasn't just bad in the NBA, Kwame Brown was bad at playing the game of basketball. I'm sorry, but you're just not going to convince me otherwise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stretch them all you want, completely ignoring that Robinson was one of the best defensive centers in the league his entire career, but you're right...he's practically Kwame Brown.

And by all means, let's ignore the impact of having a 6'9" Tayshaun Prince with a 7'2" wingspan guard Kobe all series. In the 2003 playoffs, Tim had the advantage of being guarded by (in order) a rookie Amare, a 32-year-old Horry, Dirk, and K-Mart. I'll throw you a bone, K-Mart was a solid defender but gave up 2 inches and nearly 20 lbs to Tim.

And as for this "historically great supporting cast," Malone and Payton were shells of their former selves. No one else in the rotation took more than 3 shots a game. League average PER is 15...guys 5-10 peaked at 13.6. 

This actually is pretty fun, keep going pal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I teach a Problem-Solving class in High School for Juniors/Seniors, and I want to start a unit on sports in a couple weeks. I want to have a topic to debate for each sport that's math related.

So far, my ideas are:
Baseball (Value of Hitting HR's vs Hitting for AVG)
Football (Value of Running vs Passing Offense)
Basketball (Value of 3pt shooting vs inside scoring)

Anyone have any suggestions/thoughts/ideas that I could use? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Question about fiction main characters... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-01 18:08:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a plan to write a nine book series, fairly ambitious but I consider it to be a lifetime kind of achievement.

Over the course of these nine books, the focus shifts to different main characters a couple times -- similar to George R.R. Martin I suppose. I guess my question is how do you feel about this sort of practice? Is it ok to impart my life experiences separately into several of these characters? Does it negate the plot at all to splice it among so many different players? </TEXT>
