	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Raw 10 is basically you naming 10 steps WWE should take on Raw every week.

Example: A stipulation should be named for Jericho vs Ambrose at Extreme Rules

Basically just name 10 steps WWE creative should take to book a good raw

This thread will go up every week the day before Raw.

Since this is the first Raw 10 I'm just finding my feet with this so if you have any constructive ideas for these threads or a better idead for the name then feel free to tell me, ill be sure to give credit to who ever the new name comes from.

Thanks and have fun. </TEXT>
