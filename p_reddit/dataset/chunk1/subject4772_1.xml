	<TEXT> It was just a general thing i could bring up we can measure halves on.

I honestly thought he was a poor player and had someone like mbye way ahead of him but moses has really improved. He can take another leap within the next 2 years.

Milford was my 5/8 of the year though. </TEXT>

Moses with 3 try assists and a few forced dropouts - Every commentator cums in their pants

Seriously though all this praise makes me think whenever the tigers win a game next year moses will get 3pts for the dally m... worth a crack to throw $10 on it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> for those who missed it, these were the dodgy calls titans were fed with... my flair is broncos but I fkn had $50 on titans with sportsbet... titans didn't help their cause with errors coming out of their half though.

1) Roberts kick: Personally i don't think much of it but as sterlo said if they go back to it titans get a penalty and march down the field instead of the broncos try 2 plays after.

2) Corey oates kamikaze penalty: In the first half Hayne made a break and bronc player swats it down with ref ruling a titans scrum... Bunker overturns it which was RIGHT but the fact they didn't for the oates penalty is a joke. Broncos march down the field and score from that penalty.

3) God forward pass: 5mins to go hayne throws a cutout ball to hurrell who offloads to his winger 40m away for a linebreak when they stop it there. It was fair game, though broncos were in cover and could have shut it down we don't quite know for sure. Don't hold me to it but I believe broncos score the set after.

And anyone saying "yea but they conceded 44pts, if you do that you deserve to lose" don't quite understand how being under pressure works. When you shouldn't even be under it to begin with, you won't concede points in the first place!

	<TEXT> You know, you could be totally right. It's just he's played 2-3 games at FB and we don't know for sure yet. Souths were sure Alex Johnston was destined to take over from G.I yet he's had quite a bit of time at FB and was meh. RTS made the transition, Holmes strikes me as someone who will too but French will need to otherwise he's just another Merritt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> True, though they would forfeit home games in the states.... it's not too big of a deal really the beginning of the process is getting a team settled in the 2nd division... until we get to first grade then theirs another story. But until then the organizers should be able to come up with a competent draw to suit the US   AUS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> mainly the matchup, it's easy picking for the dan tupou's   nene macdonalds to pluck a try out of the air or bulkier wingers like mansour to barge over. Fullbacks don't necessarily compete for highballs like wingers cause deep bombs drop while the chaser is still a distance away.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good on him, though let's still look at this guy going forward.

The wing is the most productive position in the NRL, year in and out we get freaks debut and sometimes develop their skills to move into fullback/center/second row and become versatile. Those guys that stay stuck on the wing have to compete against those 20yo prodigies year after year.

Then you arrive at a crossroads go down the Jason Nightingale path where your high workrate, finishing and versatility sees a productive career... or the Nathan Merritt path where while young will call upon freakish try scoring instincts but then as you move into your late 20's speed will drop off and season try tallies of single digits.

He will be a liability on the defensive side of the ball on the wing, if we are gonna see the best of french hopefully he's got some amazing ball-playing ability to move to fullback. He does not have the high hit-up workrate to sustain a career on the wing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> this won't solve squat... it neeeeds to be used in 50/50 situations like when a tard drops the ball and the ref gives a penalty, play has stopped and the captain has about a 10sec window before they tap it or kick to touch to go to the ref and challenge.

Also in golden point when we hit fieldgoalathon everyone is offside, if you get charged down by someone who jumped the gun i'd be spewing for a penalty or a challenge on it.

With regards to tries only we are still gonna get the bunkers messed up interpretations of what appears to have happened.

	<TEXT> you guys need stephen kearny from the broncos as head coach, when he was at parra although they were shite and had trouble scoring points and closing out games defensively they were impressive when you look at the roster the guy got.

Something tells me scoring points won't be an issue with the warriors roster next year so you guys would notice an immediate improvement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The biggest indicator he's going to come back in awesome form is that he's only looking for that 1yr deal on reduced money. He said he wants to give them a reason in that year to get re-signed.

Sooo many times in the past you would see out of favor players gun for that 3+ year commitment and when they get signed produce flaming hot garbage.

Warriors need to work him into their cap next year... also they need to keep tui and move him into centres, it will be extremely important to their depth when they pick up an injury to RTS or the halves and have him slot right in for the duration of the injury. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There was a game last year where she was on the panel with locky   johns at half-time. Score was 16-4 or something and they brought up the stats like line-breaks,missed tackles and whatever.

The incarnation of supreme rugby league knowledge sampson says in regards to the team leading "Well when you look at the stats they are completely lopsided and the ____ are in total control".

At the time i'm thinking WTF cause the stats were quite similar, about 3 missed tackles difference, 1 line break, possession had about a 2% swing and Darren lockyer says on air "umm no, you'll find that it's been pretty close and the second half is up in the air".

She don't know shit but is on the panel, and often will regurgitate whatever johns says when she closes of a discussion.

Man I hope she gets sacked from footy. </TEXT>
