I've always wished they would get like a 24 hour time period where if they were good enough to go back then they could. Ways around making it fair is for example when penner hurt his knee he should have been able to get it cleaned and stitched up but still only be able to eat what his tribe has access to like rice. Obviously someone like Caleb is life threatening and yes I know so was penners knee but do you think this would be something they would consider?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I did the math and it would cost (before taxes) roughly $1,027.95 to buy all the available seasons on dvd.  All access with no commercials (which is a must for me) is 9.99. After 9 years I would have payed just about the same amount as buying the DVDs. Thoughts on which is the better deal? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When penners knee got hurt it was obvious he had a nice open wound but medical didn't do  anything about it after the challenge. Why would they not stitch it up right then and there knowing it could easily get infected. Medical is usually very good about that kind of thing and I know Jonathan didn't ask for medical but they had to have known.  Do you think if they would have stitched it right after it happened that he would have been fine? Who knows how that season changes if he stays. </TEXT>
