	<TEXT>   Is the competition amongst man and beasts too mundane to have a meaning?

I hope I'm not preempting you falsely, but  one thought typically given by a lot of atheists in this line of discussion is something along the lines of

"Yeah, I know that all my impulses are ultimately meaningless physical phenomena, but that 
doesn't stop me finding meaning in loving my spouse and children/making artwork/learning new things"

However, all this is just a personal report that you happen to experience "feelings of meaning".
And that certain people might have the impression of meaningful activity is quite
compatible with the truth of nihilism.

It's not just some "arbitrary exception", though: reasons are given for the premises.

 That's just on the "if Americans came from Europeans then why are there still Europeans??" level of arguments. Terrible.

Why?

Physical evidence shows the existence of spontaneously existing particles.

I didn't feel tired after I did it, but I wonder whether that was related to me going for a brief run earlier in the day. Very humiliating. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This weekend, I was in a small town of ~20,000 people for a musical engagement. I've got to say, experiencing romantic rejection from a fellow musician who I'm really drawn to and sometimes spend a bit of time with has ended up being the biggest challenge to my faith I've experienced so far in my life. I think I'm working through it on an intellectual level, though. 

Went to church:

-They had a young (20s) minister, but a very old congregation. Apart from a couple of children, every one of their ~40 parishioners looked 50+ years old. It made me quite sad to see it.

-Received communion and got to sing two great hymns "Worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness" and "In faith and hope and love", and that was good. </TEXT>

The commonly used phrase "Those people aren't really pro-life: they are just pro-birth". I thought that that was what you were getting at in your comment.

The term 'pro-life' is a chipper label used by anti-abortion people who want to frame their position as a positive one.

Well, of course if you disagree with us, then you'll think that the label is a misnomer. One could equally say "pro-choice is a chipper label used by pro-death people who want to frame their position as a positive one." But it's just question-begging points-scoring that gets us nowhere. Why not let people use their self-designation? I'm perfectly happy with people using "pro-choice" to describe their position. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I'm correctly guessing what you are getting at, then I think this kind of remark is a result of the current state of conservatism in the US, which places such great emphasis on reducing state expenditure.

I'd like to make two remarks.

Firstly, the reason that many pro-life conservatives in the US are opposed to publically funded initiatives for mothers and children is not because they don't care about children post-birth: it's that they believe that privately funded initiatives will be more appropriate.

Secondly, there are many people like myself who are staunchly pro-life, but who also support state-funded initiatives for mothers and children.

So, as popular as the "they are just anti-abortion, not pro-life" meme has become, I don't think it's really accurate. </TEXT>

After the expulsion from Eden, God placed a cherubim to guard the entrance.

The veil covering the Holy of Holies was patterned (Exodus 26:31-34) with cherubim.

After Christ had made his atonement, the veil of the temple was ripped apart (Matthew 27:51).

Last year I took a unit which had 4 weeks on cell biology, 4 on genetics and 4 weeks on evolution, and this year, I'm taking one which has 6 weeks on genetics and 6 on evolution. 

 Darwin couldn't have quantified what natural selection is capable of. He knew nothing of genetics, DNA, etc.

Right, Darwin couldn't have investigated it, which is why the scientific world should have been much more hesitant to accept his ideas. It would have been proper to say "We currently don't know whether the kinds of changes that we see in artifical selection can be extrapolated in the manner you wish to".

I'll pick this up again tomorrow. </TEXT>

When you have the time, would you care to address my claim that the "plastic" view of biology is inadequate?

I have no doubt that Behe's ideas about what natural selection is capable of have flaws in them somewhere, but however flawed they are, they are always going to be better than a 19th century view which contains **no** real attempt at quantifying of what natural selection is capable of , which Dawkins tried to pass off as being adequate in his review of tEoE, and which is repeated in textbooks as being a good argument.

And now I have to go to a genetics lecture! </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  . As attractive as the "what good is half an eye" argument is rhetorically, it doesn't hold any water biologically. 

That diagram is an example of **exactly what I was talking about in my initial post**: it lists a few types of eye that are similar at the level of gross anatomy, but does absolutely nothing to show what kind of changes have to occur at the molecular level to build up, say, a lens or cornea.

Neutral intermediates. He assumes deleterious. 

Where does Behe assume that all intermediates will be deleterious? I've never seen him write this.

Furthermore, I don't think Behe "ignores exaptation" at all. See his attempts to reply to critics who put forward the Type III secretory system as a possible precursor for the bacterial flagellum. </TEXT>

Where does he assume this? As I read Behe, what I get from him is that he believes that selection can indeed operate in such cases where there is an increase in fitness, and sometimes, when there are a few neutral steps.

Where do you get the idea that Behe would say that something like cefepime resistance cannot occur? I must ask at this point, have you actually read his books, or just the accounts of his critics? I could be wrong, but it seems to me that you are under the same misimpression that [these critics were](http://behe.uncommondescent.com/2010/02/misusing-protistan-examples-to-propagate-myths-about-intelligent-design/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's take just one of your criticisms of Behe: that his models assume that "only the end point is beneficial". I think this is incorrect: he says that it is possible for evolution to produce "end points" that increase fitness that include neutral steps, and the entire chapter "Benchmarks" in his book the Edge of Evolution is given to trying to estimate what the limits of this might be under different circumstances.

Now, do you concede that the textbook is indeed an example of using the 
"plastic" view of biology that I mentioned earlier? If not then why? </TEXT>

Has not ceased;

Would, God, I were with her today!

	<TEXT>  and 2) explaining a case made by Darwin a century and a half ago.

No, it's not just saying that that's what Darwin said a century and a half ago: if you read the Summary of Key Concepts at the end of the chapter, under the heading  "What is the evidence that populations evolve by natural selection?" it explicitly says 

*"Similarly, many lines of evidence indicate that natural selection is the chief mechanism driving changes in the characteristics of species over time*, **including the following**:

*Rapid, heritable changes have been produced in domestic animals and plants by selectively breeding organism with desired features (artificial selection)."*

(My bolding)

The textbook is clearly putting it forward as an example which is valid to this day, not just as a historical reflection on what Darwin wrote. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Nobody makes those claims in support of Darwinian (or non-Darwinian, because he's a bit out of date at this point) processes. 

Here's a passage from Audesirk and Audesirk's "Biology: Life on Earth" 5th edition under the heading "What is the evidence that populations evolve by natural selection?"

*"Dogs descended from wolves, and even today the two will readily cross-breed. With rare exceptions, however, few modern dogs resemble wolves. Some breeds are so different from one another that they would be considered separate species if they were found in the wild; for instance, see the Chihuahua and the Great Dane in the Chapter 12 opening photo. Interbreeding would hardly be possible without a lot of human assistance. If humans could breed such radically different dogs in a few hundred to at most a few thousand years, Darwin reasoned, it seemed quite plausible that natural selection could produce the spectrum of living organisms in hundreds of millions of years."*

	<TEXT> I'm unsure as to why this is a problem, exactly.

Let me recap. Previously, I said that: 

saying "these pieces of evidence are compatible with common descent via the following scenario" is quite a different position to saying "these pieces of evidence support common descent", isn't it?

And you replied "Not really" because science is a paradigm based system in which observations merely being consistent with a theory are helpful.

I agree that observations being consistent with a theory is helpful, but that doesn't show that 

-observations which are likely to be compatible with common descent and other explanations

-observations which are only likely to be compatible with common descent.

aren't two clearly distinct classes.

I fully acknowledge that Gould was making an inductive statement in the quote I gave from him, and I don't think this undermines my point.

Let me restate what I was trying to say:

-PBS presents the near-universality of the standard genetic code, coupled with there being no reason for it being preferable on a biochemical level, as being an observation which is only likely to be compatible with common descent.

-I don't think it is, for the reasons I previously discussed.

	<TEXT> I totally agree with you that Gould was saying that common descent is the most *plausible* explanation, rather than the only logically possible explanation. But that's a red herring, I think: it doesn't change that he is still making the distinction between 

- observations which are likely to be compatible with common descent and other explanations

- observations which are only likely to be compatible with common descent.

	<TEXT> I guess what I take issue with is something along the following lines

David Swift, an English environmental scientist, writes in his book 'Evolution Under The Microscope': 

*"Darwin, being aware of morphological variations that arise naturally, but knowing nothing of the underlying genetic 
mechanisms or biochemical implications, believed that biological tissues are innately plastic.
Also, from the success of domestic breeding it was evident that variations are heritable
and that significant morphological change can be acheived by repeated (artificial) selection.
In the light of which, Darwin extrapolated that any amount of morphological change can be 
achieved through the selection and accumulation of small beneficial variations. In effect he
believed there was no fundamental limit to the plasticity of biological tissues: morphological
change was limited only by the viability of the resulting structure*

*...Unfortunately, many contemporary biologists, although they are aware of the genetic and biochemical
aspects of variations, still follow the uninformed 19th-century view when it comes to considering
the origin of new morphological structures."*

Let me give a prime example of this: Richard Dawkins' review of Michael Behe's "The Edge of Evolution" in the New York Times.

He writes: *If mutation, rather than selection, really limited evolutionary change, this should be true for artificial no less than natural selection... Behe has to predict that youd wait till hell freezes over, but the necessary mutations would not be forthcoming. Your wolves would stubbornly remain unchanged. Dogs are a mathematical impossibility. [Behe claims] that mutations are too rare to permit significant evolutionary change anyway.* 

But of course, in TEOE, Behe isnt so imprecise as to say that *no* significant evolutionary change is possible: rather, he attempts to give a quantitative measure of complexity in biochemical systems beyond which mutation and selection cannot reach.

When one person writes a book which includes 150 pages in which they delineate the kind of complexity they think processes can produce and give specific examples to attempt to substantiate this, and an expert sincerely thinks that: "Yeah, but wolves change... heaps!" is some kind of devastating and scientifically rigorous rebuttal, I think you begin to see that it something else is going on.

As I see it, Dawkins "Wow! Wolves can be bred into Chihuahuas and Great Danes! Look at that change! Imagine what evolution can do over deep time!" is just as rigorous as, "Wow! Look at how good the stick insect's camouflage is! Look at that intricacy! It just can't have evolved!". That is, not very rigorous at all.

Can you see what I'm getting at?

IIRC, influenza has certain surface proteins which are what is mutated in new strains of the virus. But what is actually happening to them? Is it the kind of thing which demonstrate the power of natural selection to accomplish that which people impute to it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today was a big one for the choir. We sung Victoria's [O quam gloriosum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9imZy_44MU) and Bruckner's ["Locus Iste"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nm1jfmbPM-A).

The bishop visited, and preached on Martha and Mary, the Gospel reading for today. I can't remember a lot of the sermon, but I do remember that he described how we can sometimes structure our lives so that Jesus gets our "spiritual leftovers" which I thought was a good illustration. I mean, I love leftovers but I can still see what he was getting at. 

Hymns were:

Praise to the Lord, the Almighty

Jesu the very thought of Thee

Alleluia, sing to Jesus (to the tune "Hyfrydol", of course)

Christ is our cornerstone </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The Mystery of Life's Origin" wasn't written as an ID book; neither was 'Evolution: A Theory in Crisis'. They were both arguments for creationism, specifically calling for the inclusion of a (Christian) Creator

I don't have Mystery on me at the moment, but I can tell you right now that Evolution: A Theory in Crisis is definitely *not* a Christian creationist book. Michael Denton, the author is an agnostic. Have you actually read the book, or are you just repeating this second-hand?

 It was 'designed' by a lawyer (Johnson)

Well, the changes in Pandas and People, and the other examples I mentioned occurred before Johnson wrote Darwin on Trial, so I think your chronology is off. Let me throw another example into the mix: Stephen Meyer, current head of the Discovery Institute's Centre For Science and Culture, got interested in ID and applied to do his graduate studies on the origin-of-life at Cambridge in 1985, well before 1991.

Regarding the Wedge Document, I think the Discovery Institute did a good job in their response [here](http://www.discovery.org/f/349). </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  ID is creationism reinvented to use politics to get the Bible into the schools.

I disagree with this narrative, and here's why:

It seems to me that, in the 1980s, a number of thinkers began to emphasise Look, these kinds of arguments from design *can* be decoupled from any particular religious system. Why not just assess them on those grounds?. 

Fred Hoyle, the irreligious English astrophysicist and scientific maverick suggested that abiogenesis was scientifically impossible, and that life arrived on earth by being seeded from outer space. 

*"if one proceeds directly and straightforwardly in this matter, without being deflected by a fear of incurring the wrath of scientific opinion, one arrives at the conclusion that biomaterials with their amazing measure of order must be the outcome of intelligent design."* (Fred Hoyle, Evolution From Space 1981)

In 1986, the Oxford Union held a debate on the proposition That the doctrine of creation is more valid than the theory of evolution. Arthur Wilder-Smith, an English chemist and pharmacologist debating for the creationist side, remarked 

*The scientific creationist says that you need, above natural law, extrinsic information. He does not specify where youre going to get it from. He believes, with Noam Chomsky, that the origin of information, because its a surprise effect, is not attackable by the human brain, and I believe the same. Second thing is that the religious creationist, and I dont speak tonight as a religious creationist, I speak as a scientific creationist, I didnt come here to teach Madame President or anybody else anything about religious creation. I say, from a scientific point of view, you must have, as Hoyle has pointed out, a source of information, surprise effects, acting on inorganic matter in order to do it. The religious creationist says God did it or Allah did it or Yahweh did it or Jesus Christ did it. Im not talking about that, Im saying from a scientific point of view, the scientific method is to add extrinsic information to the system in order to get out an order which isnt intrinsic to inorganic matter.*

In 1984, Lane Lester, Professor of biology at Liberty University, and Ray Bohlin, a doctoral student in molecular biology at the University of Texas, Dallas, published The Natural Limits to Biological Change. While the book was published by Zondervan, a Christian publisher, the first seven chapters of the book merely survey and critique evolutionary biology. The eighth chapter presents Another Alternative. The authors remark *Design in nature has been a topic of debate for centuries. We have no intention of trying to argue conclusively on a philosophic basis that intelligent design disproves any evolutionary theory. Rather, we hope to show briefly by example that the need for intelligence in bringing about the various designs in nature is by no means a preposterous proposition.* They go on to say that, in attempting to describe the limits to biological change, this is *essentially the creationists concept of the created kind.* And I think they argued that simply because their idea fitted in with biblical creationism, didn't mean it was reducible to it.

In 1984, Thaxton, Olsen and Bradley published "The Mystery of Life's Origin", a text widely regarded as a seminal work in the ID movement.

Note that all of these examples are dated *before* Edwards vs. Aguillard in 1987, the case which prohibited the teaching of creationism in the US, and which allegedly was responsible for the modern ID movement according to many. So I don't think this popular narrative of "ID was just designed to get around constitutional requirements after Edwards vs. Aguillard" is quite accurate.

I will concede that there is a lot of conceptual overlap between ID and creationism, and it seems that a creationist textbook ("Of Pandas and People" ) was rejigged to become an ID textbook after Edwards vs Aguillard, but I think that this is just one point of data, and can't be used to characterise the whole issue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A [2008 article titled "Reassessing HIV Prevention"](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/320/5877/749.full) containtained the following passage under the heading "What works"

"**Reducing multiple sexual partnerships.** Another preventive measure that has had a powerful impact and that could have even greater effect, if it were more widely and assertively promoted, is partner reduction (2, 4, 7, 11, 18, 2325). In Uganda, HIV prevalence declined dramatically following the extensive Zero Grazing campaign of the late 1980s (2, 7, 11, 23). WHO surveys conducted in 1989 and 1995 found a 50% reduction in the number of people reporting multiple and casual partners (11, 2325). In Kenya, partner reduction and fidelity also appear to have been the main behavioral change associated with the recent HIV decline (2, 4, 7). Similar behavior change has been reported in DHS surveys in Zimbabwe, where HIV has also fallen (1, 2, 7, 26), along with Ethiopia (7, 11), Cte d'Ivoire, and urban Malawi (see SOM). In Swaziland, the number of people reporting two or more partners in the past month was halved after an aggressive 2006 campaign focusing on the danger of having a secret lover (7).

There are, however, few demonstrated replicable approaches to reducing multiple sexual partnerships on a large scale. Nonetheless, mass mobilization of the community, as occurred with gay men in the United States and among heterosexuals in Uganda, **can effectively encourage behavior change** (18, 23, 25). And the Ugandan experience suggests that both partner reduction and combating stigma can be successfully achieved (24, 25)."

(My bolding)

Now, this section was addressing multiple partnerships, rather than abstinence, but I think it's clear that the mantra about human sexuality we hear endlessly repeated in Western culture ("people will just do the same thing no matter what you say, only 'harm reduction' is effective") really isn't accurate. </TEXT>

- In the Torah, the death penalty was never recommended for people who happened to have bad eyesight. </TEXT>

"Apart from their opposition to Moses there are other legends about these two Egyptian sorcerers; it was said that during the end of their days they had necessary occult knowledge to embark on a journey to the Judeo-Christian heavens. They were not welcomed and the angels of the first few heavens fought them vigorously but they could not evict them due to the potent talismans that were worn by the wizards. As they entered the fourth heaven they were met by Michael and Gabriel; legends say that the battle was very evenly balanced, but in the end it was the angels who had to fall back. Upon entering the fifth heaven they were met by none other than Metatron, who did not come at them with defiance or anger, but appeared accommodating, considering the circumstances; after conversing for a short time the angel was successful in convincing Jannes and Jambres to remove their talismans, leaving them thus vulnerable. Metatron was quick to act and threw them out of heaven with a wave of his hand. It is said that they lost all memory of the event after that."

	<TEXT> Speaking personally, I agree that novelty is present here, but doesn't any mutation which affects phenotype cause a "novel trait" in some sense?

The trait in question certainly could also confer increased fitness in some circumstances to E. coli, but again, I don't really have a problem with this.

You say "this is the kind of thing that creationists say can't happen". You may well be right that some creationist laypeople are skeptical that mutations can produce novelty and increased fitness, I strongly suspect that this idea isn't advocated by organisations like AIG or CMI. Similarly, if you take somebody like Mike Behe, who holds to evolution, but is skeptical of the power of the kinds of mutation we see in the lab to build up biochemical features, he certainly doesn't claim that mutation can't cause novelty or increased fitness.

So that's why I think the level the question should be addressed at is whether the example involves actually building up new biochemical machinery.

Isn't it the case that:

- Wild type E. coli already possesses a citrate transporter, but only expresses it under anaerobic conditions. 

- the "novel complex trait" of the Cit(+) strain [was caused by a mutation of a regulatory sequence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992527) which caused the transporter to also be expressed under aerobic conditions, and doesn't involve building up new biochemical machinery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello again.

Are you now arguing that minds don't exist, or that they're supernatural?

No, I was just pointing out that ID proponents have often phrased the issue as being about how an immaterial mind wouldn't be within the definition of "natural" that some would accept. Personally, I'm not sure the natural/supernatural distinction is that easily defined.

who or what is the designer,

I suppose the only possible candidate would be either an alien of some kind, or humans that time-travelled.

what's the mechanism?

The physical motion of the designer to produce the effects in question? I.e. like how you pressed your fingers on a keyboard to write your previous comment.

You've asserted that this isn't the case, but have not offered an alternative explanation for these facts. What's the alternative explanation?

After further thought, I think I'm willing to concede that the catalyst for the changes in Pandas was Edwards vs Aguillard. I just think that it's an unbalanced view to take this one piece of evidence, and then ignore all the other pieces that I presented. </TEXT>
