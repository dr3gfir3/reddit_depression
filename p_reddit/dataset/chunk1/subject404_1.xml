	<TEXT> thats irrelevant, if she wanted to see your sister and you she would have specified if she is singling you out she wants to see you. take it as some time to get to know each other. if it goes well things will naturally start falling into place like making further plans to hangout, flirting, making moves etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> wanting to go slow usually is my way of saying 2 things: 1. im not going to try to have sex with you so please dont make it awkward and try and 2. i really like you and i want to get to know you better before we progress. lol if you are interested in her dont pull back. she will probably notice and think you are becoming uninterested so just keep going at this pace. try to wait out your next move until you get a read on what she wants. shell make it obvious with her "hints" the way she touches you, looks at you, flirts with you. and most of all dont be afraid! women sense fear! :P hope this help a tiny bit! </TEXT>
