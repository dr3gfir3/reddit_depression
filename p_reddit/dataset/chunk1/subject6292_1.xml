	<TEXT> Beginning of the game, when the gate opens, Old Samos looks around and says "so this is how it happened." To me, implies that he is very aware of everything Jak is about to go through - but only from the perspective of Young Samos. 
I don't believe that Young Jak lost his memory after going through the rift gate. Merely that he was too young to remember.
As for Vin's death... it's hard to catch, but shortly after the Metal Heads swarm the city, he pops up on your flying radio thing screaming for help, and then you hear his death cries. But it's difficult to hear it over the battle sounds and the "tension" music that goes with it, so I can see how that wouldn't be clear.

One fan's perspective. Heh, I've played/beaten this game more times than I can readily count. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know, I've often rather subscribed to the notion that zombies' bodies (and various parts thereof) would remain animated until they are no longer receiving a signal from the brain. Meaning if you shoot off a hand, it'll just lay there on the ground, but the zed's not fazed at all by it,   keeps on coming. Same if your shot severs the spine - the lower body goes slack, but the upper body can still pull itself toward you. I've always thought it a bit amusing, because following this, if you just sever the head without destroying it, it just sits there gaping, and possibly bites at whatever steps near it. If this were implemented in game, it could perhaps be a trap against players? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The essential collection, if you want it as it was made to be given. I've seen the remastered version of the first game... not too great, honestly. True to the script, not to the performance (added too much matrix-y stuff, detracted from the atmosphere of the game.) So, if it's a well-delivered story you're looking for, I say you can't go wrong getting the Essential Collection. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used it for a week. Only went that long because I got really bored, noticed that no one would give my male avatar the time of day, so I made a hot female avatar (with my wife's assistance). Couldn't get the pervs off me. After about 20 minutes of being hounded by Brah's, I asked if they wanted to know what I really looked like, switched back to my male avatar, and sat back and laughed as they blew up, raged out, and stormed off.... all but one guy who thought it was hot   kept flirting. Creepyish.

As for what you're missing... go pay a visit to your local mall for a people-watching session and you'll have a similar experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a pointless human experiment. The countdown timer has only decreased about 5 hours so far, despite their best efforts. The only difference they've made is that instead of being released at the time of day they'd normally be leaving work (at least in my time zone), it will be released while they're at work. If this trend continues and they complete all the games, then the game will likely release by the time they have to leave for work. So, one way or the other, they'll have to wait just as long to play it. Suckers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember the days when a heartfelt message intended for a certain special someone was privately sent via snail mail, or even email. Why put it up here for everyone to see? It's obviously meant for one specific person who means the world to you, there's no need to put it up here for everyone to see. It pulls the emotion away from it, it's not special, it's not just for him/her. When you take this message that you painstakingly crafted for the object of your affections, and put it up here for the world (the Reddit portion of it, anyway), it's no longer personal, private, special, or meaningful. It's a Karma trap for saps and lonely people who wish they could feel the same. So, downvote for you, sir/ma'am. Next time, try to make it special. No one else needs to see this, and I guarantee your chosen person will appreciate it more if you make something JUST FOR THEM. Have a wonderful day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, enlisted member here. I went through basic two weeks after I got married, and I can honestly say that I drew my strength almost exclusively from the letters I got from my wife. I undoubtedly would not have made it through the ordeal if not for her showing me how strong she was being while I was gone. I knew that she worried unendingly about my welfare while I was there, especially with all the horror stories floating around the internet that she was finding at the time, but in spite of that she was being brave and making her way through the days productively. We had no children at the time, so she didn't need to do anything other than sit at home and worry and wait for me to finish, but instead she got up, got out of the house, and took care of business. Every day that I got a letter telling me how much she worried about me and my job and our future, and also how much she had done since she last wrote to move toward that future, gave me the strength I needed to move on and get through Basic. So, yes, the spouse at home has a harder time, because they have to stay strong for us. We can break down and come to them in our time of weakness, but if they waver and start to crack, we lose our focus. If they lose faith and leave, we lose our reason to continue the job. They know this and fight with that knowledge every day. And I know I'm not the only one who feels this way, though it definitely varies from couple to couple, person to person, but in this Airman's opinion, the spouse/significant other back home always has the worse time of it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, great game for imaginitive people, but whenever you hit a wall (figuratively, I mean... you're always hitting walls in this game) it loses its charm. I mean, I just built a giant city with a solid glowstone floor, complete with bakery, armory, a small fort, a library, a church, four different spawn traps feeding from the moat around the city walls, a world-dwarfing lighthouse that lets me see for miles... what else can I do? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hmm... well, the download is 1 .rar file. Inside that is the bumpmaft.jar, the instructions, and mc_patcher.

Basically, move the bumpmaft and patcher files into minecraft.bin, then do this:


3. Double-click the mcpatcher EXE file to run the patcher.
4. Check the box beside "Texture Pack," select 128x128 int he "Tile Size" drop-down box and click the "Browse" button just to the right.
5. Select "bumpmaft.jar."
6. Ensure all of the boxes in the "Options" section are checked, aside from "Custom Portal", which will be greyed out.
7. Click the "Patch" button.
8. When the new window reads "Success!... Probably", close that window and exit from the patcher.

	<TEXT> Um... If you have to ask, it's most likely rape. 
That aside, if you said no, even once, or resisted in any way, then yes, it was. And it was a shitty situation, and by what I'm seeing, yes, you were too afraid of being a tease.
But that aside, if you don't want it, if it's nonconsentual, it's rape. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually... when you press your fingers together (preparing the snap), you force all the air out from between them. Then, when you suddenly and rapidly slide them apart (performing the snap), your fingers separate so quickly that the air can't fill the space quite fast enough. This means that a tiny vacuum forms between your fingers for a fraction of a second.  The SNAP sound comes from the vibrations caused by air rushing in to fill the vacuum left in the space between your rapidly separating fingers. Basically, it's a mini sonic boom. Try hitting the palm of either hand with your finger, at any speed, and you'll see that you don't get the same, well, SNAP sound; that's because it's just flesh hitting flesh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That may be so, but to be fair, you should judge your "expected" price by more than just the visual experience. How enjoyable is the gameplay? How engaging is the story? These things, you may agree, can readily counter poor graphics. Take the original Fable, for instance. Engaging gameplay, good story, but all of the characters kinda look like fish. I paid full price. Now compare that to Final Fantasy 13. Absolutely beautiful. Gameplay a 2-year-old monkey could follow. I still paid full price. Wasn't worth it. 
There's way more to a good game than how shiny it is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait, seriously? You think graphics have anything to do with price?
Think back over the last decade or so. Can you honestly think of ANY game that didn't release with a $40-$60 price point? Graphics don't have anything to do with it, that's just standard fare. After that, the price is determined solely by supply vs. demand. The more popular it is, the longer it will be expensive. Your argument is invalid </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ground rules: It's about you guys. Specifically, the two of you. The third party needs to understand this. After that, it's up to the two of you to decide just how far you are comfortable with this person going on the other (I.E., no insertions, etc.) Make sure you both come to an understanding and agreement about these limitations and that she is aware of them. The one thing that ruins a relationship when it goes this route is having a boundary broken and feelings hurt (from any of the three) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's how I ended up playing through it.
Step 1: Use rubber band to set joystick "forward"
Step 2: Turn on auto-fire for the Confirm button.
Step 3: Read Harry Potter while watching the game play itself.
... Okay, maybe not quite that extreme. I did have to knock my characters off of a wall once in a while. </TEXT>
