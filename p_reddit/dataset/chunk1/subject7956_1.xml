	<TEXT> IMO best evidence for Mythicism are gospel narratives themselves. Remove all obvious BS miracle events even then the major events of Jesus' life make more sense as a literary creation than a historical narrative, I mean we can be sure that there was no Judas Betrayal or Paschal Pardon of Bar-Abbas or Pericope Adulterae or Triumphal Entry or Olivet Discourse or late night Sanhedrin trial of Jesus.

So even non-miraculous parts of his alleged life are a literary creations then how the hell there can be a historical Jesus. </TEXT>

That mention by Josephus aka Testimonium Flavianum is a interpolation done by later Christians, most probably by church historian Eusebius.

	<TEXT> Pilate was a hardball bureaucrat whom gospel authors portrayed as a softy, powerless leader. Which is just mirror opposite to what his contemporary or later historian described of him.

Philo(40CE) in his Embassy of Gaius described his governorship in vilest possible terms.

Philo writes that...Pilate had "vindictiveness and furious temper", and was "naturally inflexible, a blend of self-will and relentlessness". Referring to Pilate's governance, Philo further describes "his corruption, and his acts of insolence, and his rapine, and his habit of insulting people, and his cruelty, and his continual murders of people untried and uncondemned, and his never ending, and gratuitous, and most grievous inhumanity".

Though I don't think Jesus of Christianity ever existed, but if he's really a historical person and the crucifixion accounts of Gospels have any ounce of historical reliability then Pilate would have crucified both Jesus and Bar-Abbas without a second thought. </TEXT>

The director, Terry Jones, issued the following riposte to this criticism: "Any religion that makes a form of torture into an icon that they worship seems to me a pretty sick sort of religion quite honestly".

Damn Straight. BTW not only Norway it was banned in half a dozen countries and in some areas ban was lasted for decades.

	<TEXT> bus driver has been killed in a 'senseless attack' after a passenger poured flammable liquid on him and **set him alight**.
Cruelty was on a scale few could comprehend  it was quick and vicious, and the **man accused of doing it just stood back and admired**

Believes it was a completely 'random attack' with no apparent motive.

Damn, this is beyond horrifying such kind of inhumane acts are not expected in some dirt poor war-torn African Country let alone Australia. and He esp targeted the driver so its not a completely random attack and looks to me it was racially motivated.

Really such a ambitious, and beloved individual lost his life just because of one man's depraved mentality. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Q, Paul, possibly the sources that Luke references,

Q and Paul doesn't contain any narratives on life of Jesus and again even if the hypothetical Q existed, it was not some 'Book of Sirach' like extensive wisdom literature the earliest layer of of Q only contains some alleged sayings of Jesus nothing else. 

MORE literary attestations than other more prominent and more historical figures
stories follow typical literary conventions of antiquity and were quite possible created whole cloth.

There's a glaring irony in your logic.

Did Jesus exist? is substantially different from Did the Jesus of so-and-so Gospel exist?

Remove all obviously ahistorical miracle events even then the major events of Jesus' life make more sense as a literary creation than a historical narrative, I mean we can be sure that there was no Judas Betrayal or Paschal Pardon of Bar-Abbas or Pericope Adulterae or Triumphal Entry or Olivet Discourse or late night Sanhedrin trial of Jesus.

So even non-miraculous parts of his alleged life are a literary creations then how the hell there can be a historical Jesus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> which means that he might be more disconnected from what's been written recently. 

Emanuel Tov is 75 years old does that mean in 5 years his work will become obsolete ?, Feldman's work on Josephus and his opinion is still relevant, regardless of what you think about his conclusion.

But anyways can you tell about some recent studies on authenticity of TF ? the ones I read all concluded that the passage is a later scribal interpolation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  No, I am referring to Corinthians 11:23 where Paul says Jesus was betrayed

I think the Literal and more accurate translation there is ['Delivered Up'](https://books.google.co.in/books?id=ibbeBAAAQBAJ pg=PA84 dq=Corinthians+11:23+delivered+up hl=en sa=X ved=0ahUKEwiA_63y0vTPAhULPI8KHVwXDcgQ6AEIJjAC#v=onepage q=Corinthians%2011%3A23%20delivered%20up f=false), not betrayed.

	<TEXT> 50% of the sources you cited don't quite agree with your conclusion.

Do you have a habit of only reading the abstracts ? read the conclusions too of those studies.

The narrative grammar of the Testimonium Flavianum sets it sharply apart from
Josephuss other stories of the procuratorship of Pontius Pilate. The most likely
explanation is that the entire passage is interpolated.
http://www.academia.edu/9494231/A_Narrative_Anomaly_in_Josephus

 In the particular case of the Testimonium, however, it seems very likely that Eusebius work influenced the transmission of the Greek manuscripts of Book XVIII of the Antiquities.
http://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5871

"In conclusion, there is reason to think that a Christian such as Eusebius would have sought to portray Josephus as more favorably dis-posed toward Jesus and may well have 'interpolated such a statement' as that which is found in the Testimonium Flavianum."
