	<TEXT> Greetings. I come here hoping that someone out there can help me out. I'm working on a documentary about the Iran-Iraq war (80-88) and in this phase of the production I'm hunting for footage. If anyone has got some good footage from this war, it would mean a lot.
What we are looking for: - Attacks on oil-tankers and ships - Persian Gulf footage - Interviews Bonus points for anything with Norwegian ships/sailors/etc.
Help a fellow out? You can email me at beren666(at)gmail.com </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Foundry question: NPC related... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-17 22:20:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello!

I'm working on a Campaign that takes place on a small island just off the coast. I build two villages from the ground up, and populated them with custom NPCs. All was well until I started the second quest in the series... You start out in a shady tavern, and meet up with one of the NPCs from the first quest. 

My question is: Is there a way for me to save/import custom NPCs from one quest to another? Or do I have to rebuild the entire stable of characters in every singe quest if I want recurring NPCs? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Foundry Character Spawn Bug... HELP? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-05-07 19:46:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi there! I spent the better part of three days on a funny little quest, but every time I try to play through the quest my character spawns beneath the floor and falls to his death beneath the crypt... I've even raised the spawn point to 100 feet above ground, still he spawns beneath the floor. No matter where I put the point either... Same thing happens. 

Got a solution for me? </TEXT>
