	<TEXT> I'm not really that much into anime, but most of my friends are and whenever we hang out all they chat about are their waifus. So I thought I should get myself one so I can also contribute to the conversation, but I want a good one, so they can't say that I've picked a bad waifu, or that my waifu is trash. 

Is it okay to pick a waifu from a popular anime like Bulma from DBZ, or does the waifu have to be one of those smallish girls?

	<TEXT> B-Cup girlfriends are the best, personally wish I had one. As for your boyfriend, if he could transfer your brain into a D cup breasted clon of you, he might prefer that, but as the technology is nowhere there yet and probably won't be for the next couple of decades, he still prefers you. </TEXT>
