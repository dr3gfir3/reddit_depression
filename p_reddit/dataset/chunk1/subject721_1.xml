	<TEXT> Looking to start modding my Z this year to eventually relegate it as a track car when I can afford a replacement DD hopefully next year.

I was looking at the Motordyne Shockwave 2 and some Borla headers, but on their website there was a warning stating 'racing / off-road only'. Anyone know if they wouldn't pass emissions testing?

If someone could change the color of the car's body to black, but try to retain the headlights / taillights / rims, that'd be great. Thanks.

edit; Alternatively, if it's easier just change the rims to white on this one: http://i.imgur.com/IhxYXvs.png

	<TEXT> I've only put 10K miles on the tires that came with the Z when I bought it. Dealership told me they were new and the treads look to be in fine shape, though they're in plastic bags right now so I can't check exactly how much is left. Just finally got winter tires last week, and when the spring rolls around I hope to have some aftermarket wheels + new tires. Would love to offset that cost by selling my old tires.

$300 for all four? I have no idea.

Edit; Despite the thread title, I meant selling just the tires. I'll be keeping the stock wheels for winter tires, aftermarket wheels for summer/performance tires.

Edit2; They are Milestar MS932's. Goddamn, they are cheap as Dirt-- Amazon sells 'em for [$81](http://www.amazon.com/Milestar-MS932-225-45R18-24990003/dp/B0083TOAX8). Guess I won't be able to get much of anything huh? </TEXT>

Anyways, I find I'm bored as hell with every game on the market. I was just wondering how much content the devs are still churning out for this game. If I start playing again would there be much to do? I know Storm Legion came out a year or so ago which o hadn't checked out but wanted to. </TEXT>

Just wondering if anyone here could provide some insight, please. I'm afraid the facial features would get distorted or just look weird. Right now I just have an armband about 3/4 of the way up my arm so this would 'top it off', if you will. Just having a really tough time actually picturing it though. </TEXT>

The volt meter gauge on the dash shows my battery looks fine, though my stereo head unit was reset (colors changed, indicating it lost power / I need to reconfigure it).

Fucking freezing out so I didn't want to sit out there and tinker with it too much. Let me know what other info you guys might need :)

Can't tell super well because of the lighting, but no matter what angle I set the disc to / how I rotate the actual binding, I cannot get the screw by the front left to line up. And then the other two certainly don't come close.

I also tried the "3D" disc the Customs came with, no luck. What embarassingly-stupid thing am I doing wrong? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I've been out of the loop for close to a decade now. Just getting back into boarding for the winter now that I moved to somewhere with actual mountains.

I'm 5'8", male, about 200 lbs... Looking for a cheaper-ish setup for non-park use. That said, I usually spent my time just doing flatground tricks down the mountain and manuals and stuff, just kind of dicking around and having fun as most of my friends were slower. So flexibility is somewhat important but don't need something too crazy. I prefer a slightly shorter board than normal.

Here's what I pieced together;

* [Forum Scallywag 155](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/ProductDisplay?langId=-1 storeId=10208 catalogId=10000001 partNumber=10212707 cmCat=)

* [ThirtyTwo Summit boots](http://www.moosejaw.com/moosejaw/shop/ProductDisplay?langId=-1 storeId=10208 catalogId=10000001 partNumber=10224997 cmCat=)

Comes out to just under $500. Anything particularly shitty about these? </TEXT>

TireRack can get me 4 Blizzak's for $800 shipped, but I *really* don't want to spend that kind of money, especially since I can just work from home if I need to.

But at the same time, I don't want my baby to wind up in a ditch because I cheaped out. Considering compromising and getting just 2 winter tires for the rear so I can actually get going. Bad idea, or...? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is sort of a dumb question, and I'm pretty sure the answer is no... But with a RWD vehicle are you going to feel it more when there are really strong winds?

Getting 30 MPH winds with gusts up to 50 MPH today and I'm feeling it *way* more in my 350Z than I ever felt wind in my Corolla before this. Like to the point where I'm not sure if it's just the wind or something's up with my rear tire(s). It feels like the car is seriously pulling to the side. I've only had the vehicle for a few months so I'm not totally at the point of knowing every noise and feel of the car, ya know?

Also just wonder if I'm overly paranoid because everyone says how 'bad' RWD is for handling, so maybe I'm just being overly attentive to every single thing I feel? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Alright, so, I'm a Massachusetts resident and I'm moving to Buffalo, NY for at least 6 months. I'm buying a second car for the winter, but since I might be there for such a short period I don't want to go and register my primary car, get a new driver's license, get new plates, new insurance.... Anyways, so, do I have any option for buying a used car in or around Buffalo and getting new MA plates and everything? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, new job so I'm moving to Buffalo (from RI) later this month. I kind-of sort-of have my living situation sorted out, I should be in Amherst somewhere and do have a friend that lives there as well. He'll be able to show me most of the ropes since he's lived there for a while (UB student). Just wondering if you guys can recommend anything to do / where to stay away from?

Also, any recommendations on a good mechanic? I drive a Nissan and hope to get some old Subaru for the winter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might be buying a second car for the winter season soon, looking for suggestions.

I'll be in Buffalo which gets lots of snow from the great lakes obviously. I'll primarily use it to drive to   from work (10 minute drive), but on the weekends I'll take it to the mountain about an hour away as well.

So AWD and space for a snowboard + skis (and gear for two, maybe 3) is a must. Oh and must be manual. Heated leather is very much desired but not a deal breaker.

I don't have an exact budget just yet because I'll just be saving up money as soon as I start working, but anywhere from $3-8k probably.

My first thought was Reddit's favorite, a WRX wagon, but anything in that price range will have such an astronomical amount of miles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, I'm moving somewhere very snowy soon and I'd rather not drive my 350Z in the winter, so I'm looking for something AWD. I'd be looking to spend $4-$6K. Always liked Audi, so I'm considering an A4 but I wasn't sure if there were any big/common problems from the models 10 years ago?

I have no idea what features are standard, could I find something around 100k miles with heated leather seats and maybe steering wheel too? I'm a giant baby. </TEXT>

Have only had my Z for 6 months, didn't have snow when I got it so I don't know how bad it really is.'

	<DATE> 2013-09-02 09:23:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just got a new job making almost double what I do now. Next year assuming my contact gets renewed I can't think of anything I'd like to do more than buy an e30 and fix her up.

Depending on how bad it is, would it be feasible to get the car in tip-top shape for under $10K? I should mention I have zero tools and no know-how, but what better way to learn than by doing? How tough would it be to get parts? Since this is far off, anyone able to recommend some reading material to get started with?

I don't have an exact vision of what I want in the end, I suppose. I DD a 350Z right now (but I'll probably get an old beater to DD since I'm going somewhere with bad winters) so I don't necessarily need a "replacement" sports car. Not sure how frequently I'll be able to get to the track with this new location either. I think I mostly just want a cool car that I can say I built. I know I at least want to paint it white with the classic 3 stripes with the M colors [kind of like this](http://forums.pelicanparts.com/uploads7/3+21+06+0151142981797.jpg) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've noticed this for a little while now, tried Googling around have gotten a ton of different answers. I just went out for a driver and decided to record this noise coming from my rear axle, sorry for the lack of video but it's 2 AM.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TZl_PrfXeqw feature=youtu.be

Kind of hard to hear it over the crickets chirping, sorry. First 15 seconds or so is on the driver side of the car, then I walked over to the passenger side and it seems to be equally loud. Any ideas what it might be? I'm going to call the dealership tomorrow, between this and my clutch making a bit of noise I'm kind of worried.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I was just offered a new job and will soon have a pretty significant amount of spare income.

Realistically, how expensive would it be to buy an old E30 to fix it up? Also, I have no experience working on cars so this would also serve to get me familiar with everything.

Of course I won't rush into this before I've really "stabilized" with the job and know I'll be there for a while, but hypothetically could anyone ballpark a figure assuming I spend about $3K on the vehicle. Could it be done for $10K?

USD of course. </TEXT>

2 pictures:

He caused the scuff going down the bumper and 2 actual chips in the paint where the bumper meets the rest of the body, then one at the end of the scuff mark.

Unless he has some outrageously low deductible, I don't think the damage will be high enough to exceed whatever his deductible is and I know he can't afford however much it would be to get fixed professionally. He said he'll buy some touch up paint and clean it up for me, but I'm really pissed. I know it's a 10 year old car and there are fair amount of rock chips in it as is, but damn it, I worked my ass off for this car. I don't want to be a dick and go and impose some sort of financial stress on the guy who pays part of my rent... but fuck :(

What do you guys think? Just let him buff it out / paint over it and crack jokes at his expense for the next year, or....? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I bought my car, the windows were already tinted a little bit but there was some damage to the film on the driver's side. I want to get it replaced and possibly darkened as well.

Found [this](http://www.tintlaws.com/) site that says in MA you need to allow 35% light through. Problem is, I drive in RI 99% of the time and that site says RI requires 70% light. Even though my car is registered in MA, can I get a ticket if I had a much darker tint?

On a similar note, because I basically live in RI (but MA plates / license / registration) I usually don't jump on getting my state inspection done as soon as it's up. RI does have state inspections as well, but can they give me a ticket for an out of date, out of state one?

	<TEXT> So I want to make one last large purchase (finite dollar amount not yet set in stone, up to $200 probably) before I try to never spend money on Warmahordes again. 

Here's the stuff I own:

**Warcasters:**
Lich2, Denny1, Mortenebra, Goreshade 2 I think (never run him, not sure)

**Heavy Jacks:**
Slayer, Seether, Deathjack, Nightmare


**Light Jacks:**
2+ of each: Deathrippers, Ripjaws, Defilers

**Infantry:**
Bane Thralls   UA, 2 units of McThralls, Bile Thralls

**Solos**
BLT, Warwitch Siren, 2 Pistol Wraiths, Skarlock Thrall


I kind of want to buy the Witch Coven, and a bunch of Pirates or Ogrun stuff but I have no idea how effective any of them are (I never see them at my shop). Really not a big fan of the Satyxis stuff. Mostly curious if the Ogrun   Slaughterborn are good to run with Denny I guess? I feel like they probably need Skarre to keep them safe with Occulation, 12/15 isn't hard to take off the table. </TEXT>

Go on over to Invidia's website to check out their prices and they have 3 options;

* Rolled stainless steel tips
* Rolled titanium tips
* Single layer titanium


But they're all the same price. Is there any functional differences, or is it all just sound? Any info  / advice would be great :D

Long time gamer (who isn't), but lately I find I just cannot play anything for more than an hour or two. I have a huge catalog of games where I've said, "I can't wait for this to come out!" and then I get maybe half way through and lose interest.

Because of my inability to be captivated by a game recently, and my need to better myself as a code monkey I've decided to start dabbling in game development. I've been consuming a lot of videos on Unity as a starting point, but I find myself struggling to flesh out any idea or element for projects I want to do.

I was wondering what motivates or inspires you guys to go and do what you do? I feel like a kid staring at a blank word document with writers block trying to do a paper for school all over again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I might finally have the cash to take my car out to Lime Rock next month! Extremely excited, but I'm curious what sort of helmets /r/cars prefers (for those who have been to a track).

-I would like to get a full-face helmet with a proper visor, just for the extra protection should something happen, but I'm worried it would fog up? I used to snowboard, wearing goggles over my glasses was near impossible. Obviously there's much more space with a proper helmet though so I don't know if that would be issue.

-Also, how the hell do you know what size to buy? I'm only 5'8", so I assume a Medium would be fine but I don't know.

-Lastly, does anyone know of a place to rent GoPros and mounts? I'd love to have at least one for the event, but I can't warrant spending $200+ on a camera I might use once or twice per year. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey loseit, I think I've finally hit "rock bottom". I'm almost 23 and I haven't seriously exercised since I was a freshman in high school. I did go to the gym for 1 summer in college, but that was about it... Anyways, I've started walking 2 miles per day and as of yesterday I started 4 miles per day-- 2 before work, 2 after work.

I'm feeling pretty good about it, and I think each week I'm going to tack on half a mile extra per session. The only problem I have, even when I was in good shape I've always been poor at long distance, my ankles seem to get really sore really easily. But we'll see.

My biggest problem with overcoming my weight is my diet. I eat out frequently and when I do "cook" it's usually just throwing a pizza in the oven.

I'm a 5'8", 220 lb (1.7 meters / 100 kg) male. I don't know... anything about the "healthy eating" aspect to weight loss. I mean, obvious fresh meats and vegetables are better than Burger King and I should cut back on carbs, but other than I know nothing. Where can I start reading up on this stuff? How about healthy, easy foods to cook? Really any advice at all. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ELI5: I don't know anything about retirement accounts </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-16 17:51:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, where to start. I graduated and started working full time at the end of last year. My company opened a SEP IRA account with TD Ameritrade for me and I've been paying in to it for about 5.5 months now. I just logged in and have no idea what I'm looking at, but I was expecting about $2k.

It's about 3/4 of that instead. I really don't understand how it all works, and both my parents have always been pretty low-earners, under the table. Don't think either of them have much of a retirement plan at all...

So, anyways:

* Why is my balance much lower than what I've paid into it
* I understand there's significant tax penalties for withdrawing money before I'm 59.5 years old, would I still pay out the ass if I wanted to invest in stock *through* TD Ameritrade?
* What else do I need to know? :/

A few months ago I really wanted to buy some Tesla, but I didn't have a dime to spare aside from what was in my IRA. Really would've liked to buy a bunch because it's more than doubled since I started following it :(

edit; Another question. It looks like I can only contribute no more than $5,500 annually to my IRA. Does that include my employer's contributions too? We just got "raises" this week but instead the employer is just going to pay more into our accounts instead. I'll be extremely close to that $5,500 limit with the new rates then. </TEXT>

I bought the car at 49k miles, it now has 54k and I got my oil changed at 52 with some mobil one synthetic. Any other routine maintenance I should do around this time? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I got a nice chip from a rock the other day, put a sizable chunk in my hood and apparently on my roof which I never noticed. Was getting in my car yesterday and I noticed some rust.

When I bought the car in February I was a sap and bought the paint sealant protection package for $300 because the car looked immaculate on the lot despite being an '03. Here it is not 5 months later and now this. I plan on calling the dealership tomorrow to see if they'll cover it, but I really don't think they will. The terms explicitly states they don't cover a handful of things, one of which being chips from rocks. My roommate, who generally knows more about autobody than I do, says it definitely shouldn't have rusted as quickly as it did (only the roof did, the hood is OK) and that they should fix it.

I suppose I may as well call them up and see what they say (150 miles away, fuck). Pretty sure I'm SOL, so if that's the case, what can I do to protect my baby? Just grab some touch up paint and cover the spots? Anything I need to know about applying the stuff?

I just have no desire to play most games, even though I was highly anticipating them. Anyone else feel this way lately? I don't know if I just need to take a break and come back for a while, but so few titles interest me and it makes me sad that I don't enjoy them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just driving back to the office from lunch when I saw a Z infront of a dealership for an astonishing $7.5k

My first thought was it must have super high miles, I got mine for $12k and I thought that was a good deal. Just looked at the dealer's webiste, http://firstacura.com/Vehicle_Details/desc/Used_Nissan_350Z__/vehicleID/524493

185k miles!? Yikes! Just wondering how the Z holds up at that high milage. </TEXT>

Further wikipedia reading seems to say that some level of back pressure is a good thing though. How do you draw the line as to what's too much / too little?

Anything else I should know? It seems like a ton of money for such menial gains as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I get the money set aside, I really want to take my Z to the track, but I'm a little unsure about the most practical way of dealing with tires. I don't want to destroy my normal tires, I'd like to buy ones for the track... But the nearest non-oval track is 3 hours away, how could I possibly fit 4 tires in my tiny Z and swap them when I get there. I wouldn't want to put 6 hours of driving on them to and from the track unnecessarily, either.

It would be unlikely I'd be able to convince a friend to drive all the way out there so he can ride shotgun and carry my tires in their cars.

I was just wondering if any of you guys have experience with this. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, recently bought my first new-to-me car and with the pollen season setting in, I want to keep this sucker clean. I have zero experience with body care as before this I had some old beaters that I didn't care about.

I just gave the car a quick wash this weekend and before starting I noticed these two..
http://imgur.com/a/JfzbA

I'm pretty sure there's nothing I can do about the first one, it looks to be a pretty serious chip in the hood. How about the second blemish? No matter how much I wash, it doesn't go away.

There's also a ton of white specks on the front bumper, presumably just from rocks chipping away... Anything I can do to prevent that? :( </TEXT>

My parent's cosigned an auto loan for my brother, who has since more-or-less turned into a dead beat and my parents have made every single loan payment for the vehicle (not sure how long it's been, a few years at least) and my parents can barely afford it.

Is there a way they can get the vehicle in their name so they can sell it? Tried Googling around but I don't really know the proper terms so I can't find anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey guys, so I've had my Z for a little over 3k miles as of this weekend. I know you really don't need to change the oil every 3k, but I decided I would since I don't know what type of oil the previous owner used (I bought synthetic), when their last change was since I bought it from the dealership or anything...

So anyways, so I have no experience working on cars. Take the jack out of the back and prop up my car but I couldn't get it high enough to really be able to do a damn thing. I was wondering if there's just a different, better jack I can buy or something? What do you guys do?

I ended up taking it to a garage, which actually worked out for the best- they noticed my serpentine belt was pretty worn down. $20 for the labor-only oil change and $160 for the belt and replacement, not awful. I was going on a 400 mile trip the following day, so... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello /r/tattoos! I got my first (and only) tattoo four years ago as a birthday gift to myself. No regrets yet. It's a simple armband that says "I am sorry for all the things we did and did not do", then on the outter part of my bicep I have [this](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_M9HNyHQCPhc/R2f6Kf18WcI/AAAAAAAAACQ/yPyYgeAYOew/s320/BE+PAIN+OF+SALV.jpg). Whole thing is black, no 'background' or anything.

I am NOT an artist in any sense of the word, but here's a mock-up of what I want to get done;

http://i.imgur.com/imV95Vz.png

Basically it's a compilation of other favorite musicians' logos inside of bubbles from a bearded fish. Again that is just a very rough mock up, I'll have a professional designer come up with something / see what the tattoo artist can draw up for me.

My big issue is that that arm band I have now is right in the "center" of my bicep, and I'm afraid if I have this below my current tattoo it will look weird as the fish would probably wind up in my "elbow pit" for lack of a better term. Any thoughts / ideas? I want to have the bubbles leading up that circular emblem I have now as the 'final' bubble. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I recently got a job interview with a company up in Wilmington, MA. I grew up right on the tri-state border about 20 minutes South of Worcester. I've been to Boston a number of times, as a tourist, but I know very little about Eastern MA. What are some of the nicer towns in the region, without costing too much? I pay $400/mo in Student Loans and about $270 on a car payment.

I was just hoping to get any advice on where I should look into, where I should stay away from, etc. Salary looks like I should be making close to $40k assuming 30% goes to taxes, which is as much as I make pre-tax now, to give you guys a budget idea.

I'm open to the idea of living in Boston if commuting isn't horrible. Or a nearby small-ish town. I currently live in a shittier neighbor in a small city; 30k sq/m with 80k people and it's not too bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right now, I'm a full-fledged software engineer for a small company. I do everything; front end, back end, technical support, training, customer relations. Everything. My duties are, basically, the same as they were when I was an intern, and are the same as my peers in almost every aspect. It's a pretty relaxed environment, jeans and t-shirt kind of place. I really like it. But there is zero room for growth. Hypothetically, if I were still here in 10 years I'd be doing exactly what I'm doing now. Half of the employees still use a dead language I've never heard of until I started here.


I just applied to a company I already interviewed with months ago, and I was certain I was going to get the job until at the last minute they couldn't afford someone new at the time. This is a Tier II internal help desk role. It's quite the jump backwards on the proverbial corporate ladder, and a lot less responsibility (though frankly that's okay with me).

I'm pretty underpaid where I am now, so I'd imagine this new job will probably pay the same, and have room for actual advancement in the future. Do you guys think it would be wise to do it, or stay where I am now and get more experience as a full on developer, even though it's not great experience because I don't have a mentor or anything? </TEXT>

I'd like something a little more... refined/classy looking that won't distract me?

If we can keep the price under $200 that's great, but I can go up to $300.

Edit; Well I ended up with a Kenwood DPX-300U that I'm pretty UNhappy with, device keeps dying on me despite the shop saying the ground wire is fine / fuse is fine... so I'm probably going to return it and buy something else. </TEXT>

Sadly I didn't get a chance to drive it, they were just about to roll it in to the service station to put new tires on it they told me. It still needs to be detailed but it looks to be in pretty good condition, a few minor scratches but nothing serious.

After some re-evaluation of my budget (trade-in wasn't worth as much as I hoped), I think I can still afford it and I HOPE to buy it Friday or Saturday. Anything I should know about RWD? I've only ever driven FWD before. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi /r/350z . I've been looking to get one for the past few months now and I think o finally found a good deal. I'm up in MA, found an '03 Enthusiast with under 50k miles. They're asking $12.5k for it and I'm hoping to talk them down to $11k since it's winter time. I'm aware of the tire issues some of the '03-'05 have, but I wonder if something else is up? Seems pretty cheap for such low mileage.

Edit; I'm going to the dealership Saturday to check it out. Their reviews on cars.com (where I found the listing) were few but pretty poor. Someone called me this morning from the dealership (sent an email last night) and he said they have all the service records/ carfax.  What else should I be aware of? This is my first time buying a car from a dealership

Edit x2; RED FLAG? Found the car fax for the car online;

Is it possible the tech who did the inspection pressed the wrong keys for the mileage? Or is it possible the dealer did that... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been looking all over New England for the right 350z for me, found one that caught my eye. Then while reading the details, this website says

" 5-speed automatic transmission w/manual mode"

Normally I assumed it meant some sort of triptronic, then I looked over the photos and saw this;

Did they just mislabel it in the text, or am I missing something...? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dumb question about raising a car </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been looking into buying a 350z for a few months now, and I find a problem I'm having is so many of them in my price range have been lowered a lot. Not only do I personally think this looks awful, but in my particular location it's a pretty poor choice. I was wondering, is it expensive to pay a mechanic to raise a car back to its factory specs? Of course, everywhere differs in price, but if it were only a few hundred dollars I'd be okay with buying one like that. Unfortunately I work all the hours any garage is open, so I can't just call and ask around :( </TEXT>

Do any redditors primarily only play one single hero? Why? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been looking at used 350z because I don't enjoy my current car. The two that have my eye, currently, are an '04 with 50k miles ($13k) or an '06 with 57k miles ($14.5k). I like the '04 a lot more, asking a cheaper price, prefer the color, wheels, and it has leather seats. Haven't had an opportunity to drive either, but I was wondering where you guys generally draw the line at age versus miles? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm in a position where I might be able to buy my dream car off eBay for a fair price... but the only problem is that it's half way across the US. I work full time so I can't very well just take the day off to fly out there and test drive it before I buy it.

What can I do to protect myself /ensure the car is decent? The car is sold by a very large company, not a private sale. It's also used, 2003 but only 60K miles on it.

So if you've bought a car off eBay, please, share your experiences. </TEXT>

Could anyone recommend a decent army list? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Reddit, what do I need to know when buying a car? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-14 06:20:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I graduate very soon, and I'm kind of considering buying myself a nice car as a graduation gift (I will be the first person in my *extended* family to have a degree). A 2003 Nissan 350Z for $16k, 50k miles on it and it looks like its in great shape. I currently drive an '03 Toyota Carolla with 125k miles on it and while there's nothing wrong with it, I want something I LOVE to drive because its something I enjoy doing. Anyways, the main reason I'm posting this is because I've never actually bought a car. My parents are amazing and sold me it for very cheap, so I've never had to deal with a dealership / car salesmen. Any tips, tricks, or other things I should generally know? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So my shop is having a 50pt tournament soon, and I have no idea what  to run for my Cryx army.

Here's what I own;
Denny1
Goreshade1 and 2
Gaspy2

2x Ripjaw
2x Deathrippers
2x Defilers
1x Slayer, Seether and Nightmare

1x Full unit of Bane Thralls   UA
1x Min unit of McThralls

1x Pistol Wraith
1x Bloat Thrall
1x Gorman Di Woulfe
1x BLT
1x Skarlock Thrall

1x Wraith Engine

There's a second box of Banes and their UA on the shelf I could pick up at the store, so I could run a Goreshade2 T2 list for one list, then just some pDenny for the other. I don't know. Recommendations on what other models I should get? </TEXT>
