	<TITLE> Any other (preferably larger) TB3 monitors with more connectivity out now or on the horizon? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am toying with replacing my iMac with a monitor, to use as a docking station. My GF has been taking over use of my MBP,  so I am considering adding a 2016 to my fleet. It would actually be nice to have it so either of us could just roll up and plug in if we need to work on a big screen. 

We use the iMac as our kitchen tv, so I would like more inputs then just tb3. I would plug in a Chromecast ultra to pair with my Google home for voice activated music so I need HDMI 2.0 for hdcp. 

27 inches is actually a bit small for my needs since I watch while cooking from about 15 feet away. Would prefer 32. 4k is fine. 

I think I could get away with a tv instead of a monitor if I could get a solid 4k60 picture. I would just leave a adapter with all the peripheral plugged in, for the one cable solution. Has anyone had luck plugging a 2016 mbp into a 4k tv? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am really broken hearted to have to give up my note 7. It is by far the best phone I have ever owned, and is the absolute perfect size for me. Unfortunately I value the safety of my family over owning a dangerous product. 

I am on JOD, but I understand tmo is allowing even eip customer to return for any phone. I have already owned a S7 edge, and really liked it. It was 90% of the note 7, and had waterproofing,Sd card, amazing camera performance, and exceptional battery life. All 3 are top of  my list. 

Of the current phones on the market for T-Mobile, besides the iPhone 7, and S7 I'm not seeing much else that looks good. I don't want to go back to iPhone since it is incompatible with my smart watches, but getting another S7 seems boring. 

What are you planning on doing? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I just got back into the country after being away since late August. It was a pretty nail-biting experience doing lots of traveling with the note 7. Every plane I got on announced it was illegal to use, and every time I plug it in it tells me to power it down and exchange it. 

I figured by now this would be at least partially resolved. However every single store in the Honolulu metro area has a wait list over 100 peoplle long, and the phones are coming at a trickle. 

I tried calling 611 to just order a replacement, they instructed me to call Samsung. After 45 minutes on the phone with Samsung they dumped me into a hold que for T-Mobile 611. 

Very frustrating. Anyone have any insight on how to get a replacement phone without jumping through all these hoops? </TEXT>

This so far is the only tantalizing aspect of T-Mobile one for me. As a frequent international traveler this would be awesome. No more searching for local sims.

Meanwhile I was just cruising looking up maps, uploading videos to FB, streaming music, and youtube. Not a care in the world. At a few points I even had my hotspot on, and was hosting all of their phones on my data plan. 

Pretty sure Tmobile will have a few new customers after this trip. 

No point to this post except for a thank you to the awesome customer focused attributes of Team Magenta.

	<TEXT> Just received my OP3 for my gf. Since receiving she has been having atrocious call quality, constantly getting digital clipping and, audio drops. Never had this issue before, and the mobile data is working fine. 

I turned off VOLTE but still having issues. This is most prevalent in the area around her office, but honestly that is the only time she is making calls for the most part. 

Getting this phone necessitated, an new sim. Could that be the issue? T-Mobile couldnt really help much, and said as far as they know everything is fine in the area. The phone is indicating 3-4 bars. There is no wifi in her office so it is not a wifi calling issue. 

Any ideas? She loves the phone, and I would hate to have to send it back. However it does need to function as a phone.  </TEXT>

This will be my first trip with a locked phone in quite a while. I tried out the free data on a trip last year and couldn't handle how slow it was. Ended up buying a local sim. I know after 27 days I will need to have at least a period of Fast data. 

T-Mobile's international LTE rates are still quite high as compared to buying local Sim cards. Are my only options to buy a unlock phone strictly for this purpose or is there some way I can get a temporary unlock?

I really want to use my S7e, I also want to have a few GB of fast data to play with. Any options? </TEXT>

I have this issue across a wide range of BT devices I own, Bose BT speaker, Plantronics BT head phones, even my car stereo is noticiably lower volume as compared to the radio, or a local mp3. I know that is is isolated to my Android phone, my iphone 6s+ had no issues with any of these devices, and they are from reputable companies, capable of going loud. Even my company s4 will drive the speakers louder.

I have searched around on Google to no avail, and downloaded about 6-7 different apps from play store, that purport to raise volume.None of them helped at all. 

So is there anyway to tweak the volume?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am admittedly a bro and this is my mini take on HH
This movie is a instant cult classic, and the best super hero movie I have seen in years.
Every once in a while something cool actually slips through the cracks in cinema, and challenges the status quo.
Despite the 50% tomatometer. Mark my words this film will be hugely influential in coming years. People in the know will realize that a lot of cues are lifted wholesale from this movie in upcoming action flicks. This movie breaks new ground in badassery.


I know, I know... This movie is hugely influenced by cut scenes of FPS. It is a collection of tropes, and is derivate. However this is a love letter to single player campaigns, parkour, and disembowelment. It would make a damn good video game premise on its own.


Still the full commitment brick on the gas pedal, embrace of the genre, makes this instantly my favorite video game movie of all time, despite not adapting any specific franchise.


Just as raid redemption changed the whole game for action movies and made it OK to kick ass again, this movie comes along and ramps everything up to max volume. Maximum tits, maximum caved in heads, maximum explosions. A 12 year old boys fever dream appearing like a mirage up on the screen. Leaving the grown men in the audience with me alternately shiting their pants, and giggling like school girls.


I fucking loved this movie.

	<TEXT> Buying a Surface will be a bit redundant since I own a ipad air, and a MBP retina. Both of them are great, but neither is a great travel companion. The MBP is too heavy, and the ipad lacks the storage to dump my photos onto in the field.

I am tempted to go all in and get a i5 Surface 4, but there are a lot of good deals on the 3 pro, with keyboard in the $500 range around me. 

Question is will I find it lacking compared to the 4? My main concern is battery life, besides a little light photo shop, and light room I never intend to run any demanding programs. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Best of brocation for Europe in September? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Been to Europe many times before. When I am left to my devices planning a trip I always gravitate towards, a culturally enriching, romantic getaway. This has lead to some awkward circumstances with my bro friends. 

Last time we were in Paris, and my friend asked me "is this a date" as we took our romantic river cruise down the Seine. 

This time will be different! I am charged with showing my bro a good time for 8 days of debauchery on his first trip to Europe, in mid September 2016, and God dammit I want to make sure he doesn't think I am waiting for the right time to pop the question. 

Caveats: we are both pretty fancy, and firmly into "hello fellow kids" mid 30s. So puke stained never ending EDM dorm hostel is not what I am looking for. 

Just wondering what a good reliable trip would be if your main goal was strictly to have a rowdy time. So far I am leaning 4 days Amsterdam, and 4 more days in London. However world is my oyster money is no object, and I am open to anything. 

TL:Dr where would you take your male buddy if your SOs gave you carte' Blanche to run wild in Europe for 8 days unsupervised.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The iPad "pro" is really ostensibly the air 3. While making 32 GB the base memory is long overdue, raising the entry price by $100 is putting it a bit out of my splurge budget. It is a interesting decision by Apple to combat slowing tablet sales, by slapping a new name on a product and raising the price 20%. 

I realize that there are a few new features, and technology's included but this still seems like a greedy move, that will keep margins high, but  over all will greatly reduce their sales. 

Oh well I guess I will stick with my perfectly functional original air. I'm sure I am not alone in my ascertation.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cannot verify this but I have noticed my actual DL is quicker then what I get, when downloading from play store. If I fire up speed test I will usually see in the mid 20mbps range at work. Since I just got my S7 I have been downloading tons of apps. In a lot of cases they have been coming down at a rate of 5-7 MB per second. It is unreal how fast they download. 

Does google have some precached cdn with all the play store apps locally, or is ookla under rating the speed? 

I am certainly not complaining either way. This is sharp contrast to the iOS App Store which took forever even over my dank FTTP connection at home.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I searched around to answer this, but couldn't find anything definitive. I understand that there is now a soft 21gb cap on unlimited. I am actually ok with that as I would really have to try to hit it. 

However I am about to upgrade solely for the tethering aspect. Changes in my work responsibilities are going to have me spending long periods on a computer away from wifi. I will use all 14 gb allotted on the plan. I am wondering if they consider the tether and on phone data the same bucket?

Having only 7gb per month for data is doable, but tight for my needs.  </TEXT>

However if history is any guide then come September apple will roll out something must have in the iPhone 7. I stopped by the store, and the clerk told me that assuming I did switch phones in September I would only be on the hook for $160 worth of payments, and would receive a free year of Netflix, and a $100 gear VR headset making it essentially free to try the S7 out. 

This has to be too good to be true right? Is there any catch I'm missing here. It seems like such a money losing proposition for T-Mobile.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm beginning  to realize that I am a recovering alcoholic. Up until finding this sub and starting my new healthy lifestyle, I was drinking 5-10 drinks every single night, and then way more on the weekends. It was out of control and I was always fat lethargic and sick. 

Good friend is moving away soon. Went to a early going away party with the boys last night. Haven't touched a drop of booze since New Years. Saved up a bunch of calories all week for last night. Ended up having six drinks total, and eating my first slice of bread in 6 weeks. 

I feel so awful today, my face is all puffy, and my body is aching. I cannot wait for this to pass, and go back to my healthy ways. I also factored in calories for recovery day so I went and ate my favorite pho for my cheat meal. 

In the past a night of partying would have sent me off the rails and had me hitting the bottle again, but this time feels different. No matter how crap I feel my fat ass is running 5 miles tonight, and will be back in the gym tomorrow. 

No real point to this thread but I am just feeling happy that I am more attached to my healthy lifestyle then my old life at the bars. I also am glad that I had a fun night out with a moderate amount of alcohol instead of ending up shitfaced like usual. 

SV indeed one step at a time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been on a strict low calorie diet for the past month. For the past few weeks, I have had a extremely hard time "passing" my poop. I will spare you the details but it has gotten to the point that without a laxative there is nothing going out. 



I have tried supplementing my diet with Metamucil to no avail. I also have been eating plenty of veggies, and drinking minimum 10 cups of water per day. 



Does this just come with the territory, or am I doing something wrong? I don't want to become dependent on laxatives so I limit it to once every 3 days or so. I get a nice little boost on my next weigh in, but it is not healthy.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How does protein affect the rate of fat loss? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-27 10:07:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am a big guy, but I am also pretty buff. I have a body builder frame, that went to shit from too many 12 oz curls, and being layed up with a injury. I have been reading these guides on getting lean without losing muscle that say to consume 1g protein per lb. Well it is pretty hard to be on a cut, and get 263 g of protein. I could eat nothing but 10 cans of tuna per day I suppose, but that is not practical. My only other choices would be eggs, or lots of processed protein powders.

I have been getting in around 100 g protein per day, and have been eating a low carb, but high vegetable diet. At around 1500 calories per day. So far the weight has been begrudgingly coming off. I want to lose about 60 more lbs, in a fairly aggressive amount of time for a occasion, but I don't want to be skinny fat, at the end.

I'm wondering if I should shift to a higher protein intake, and if that would accelerate the loss. I really like my veggies, and fruit though.

Are the processed protein bars, and powders really actually good for weight loss? I have lots of them laying around from my training, but I associate them more with bulking. Reading the label on my GNC protein jug, it says one scoop is 200 calories for 20 g protein so to get to 1:1 body weight I would be looking at 2,600 calories, and 13 scoops per day.

Any insight would be appreciated. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I really enjoy drinking. I drank almost every day in 2015, a lot of days just a beer or 2, but settled into a rhythm of drinking 2 big glasses of bourbon every night. I really didn't have many ill effects, I was breaking personal records in the gym, and maintaining a active lifestyle. However the beer really took its toll on me recently when a injury had me home for a few months. Gained almost 30 lbs from 9-2015 to 12-2015 partying all the time, and shoveling food into my mouth. 

I have gone a few weeks without a drink at this point, and the weight is starting to come off. I don't feel like there was any revelation putting down the bottle though, am I missing something? I am a alcoholic I accept that, is it because I haven't hit rock bottom, and destroyed my life that I am pretty ambivalent about not drinking, and to be completely honest looking forward to sipping some vodka sodas once I lose this weight I gained. 

I am at a bit of a crossroads in life. Mid 30s, obese, but still eat, and drink like I have the metabolism of a 20 year old. Really the only thing I don't like about drinking is the getting fat part. 

I know that it is bad for me, but should I fell more guilty for being ok with my functional alcoholism? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have data stash. Watching hours of video is not a priority for me. However I read a lot of blogs, and like to watch the embedded videos. As far as I can tell when watching embedded videos on iOS the do not have a mechanism, to downgrade video to lower quality they stream at 1080p all the time. 

I switched to T-Mobile the day binge on went live, and ever since I have never been able to watch a HD embedded video without a huge amount of stuttering. I just ran a speed test on my phone and got around 35 mbps down. Then I go to watch a video and allowing it to buffer for 15 seconds yields me about 5 seconds of video. 

If I watch on the YouTube app the same video streams with no issues at 480p. I can only assume that T-Mobile is capping my video at 1.5mbps even though I do not have binge on. Is there any way to turn this off?

It is really frustrating because I want to watch videos from CES but I get nothing but buffering. 480p may be ok for some, but it looks like crap on my 6s plus.  </TEXT>

Now they are both sitting there with no appeals left, and nothing barring a moonshot federal court case will free them.

Sorry not sure what episode but the context was him on the phone with his mom calling from jail, after changing his mind on admitting guilt. He was saying that he wasn't involved, and said as an aside that he was only there for the fire. 

For some reason the way he said it really stands out in my mind. It was almost as if he was saying that he hadn't done any of the raping or killing, but was there to help burn her body. 

Just finished the series when I should have been in bed hours ago. All said and done I think something stinks about the case. However for some reason I can't stop thinking that he was telling his mom he burned her, and shouldn't be going down for all the other crimes, but realizes the whole he dug, and can't articulate a middle ground.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certainly not nearly as bad as the previous reboot, but I felt like it came off really flat. After seeing the exciting, and very well paced reboot of Star Trek, I was really exited for Abrams take one SW. Especially considering ST, has always been a bit headier, and slower paced then SW. I really think that the script played it safe, and was lacking wit. The acting was typically bad for a SW movie, the cgi was terrible (especially the main villain), and the action sequences were pretty formulaic. 

We will see once the other 2 come out, if this movie was just laying the groundwork for better things to come. However I can't say that my enthusiasm hasn't been dampened.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My company has been working me to death recently. 70 hour weeks for months on end with no end in sight. This has really been breaking me down, and really tearing away all the hard work I had done physically, and mentally. I have gained back all the weight I lost and then some, haven't stepped foot in the gym for months. I am walking around as just a shell of a person. 

Then I get a letter yesterday stating I owe somewhere around $10,000 in back taxes due immediately, or they will put a lien on my house. I don't have the money to pay it. 

This has put me into pretty uncharted depths of depression. I am usually a happy go lucky guy but this kick really pushed me over the edge. 

Not contemplating suicide or anything but I really feel pushed to the limit physically, and mentally. I feel like I might snap, and I need to orchestrate a plot to get away from people for a while before I say some things I regret. 

There is no point to this post I just felt like writing it down. Thanks for letting me vent this somewhere.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is the best subject to study for a mid career change? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-12 21:51:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am currently employed in a high paying job that is making me miserable. I was able to maneuver my way into this position from a totally unrelated field in the company. My only issue is that I am not 100% qualified to be here. Despite my years of experience, and good references from people as high as the ceo, I'm sure I would have issues landing a similar job elsewhere. 

As it stands right now I have had a total of 6 days off since July 4th, and am routinely required to put in 70-80 hour weeks. It is unsustainable for me, and is making me gain weight, and really straining my relationship with my girlfriend. 

I have been clocking so much overtime that I have about 2 years of living expenses saved. 

My question is if you were in the position that you wanted a total change in October 2015, and had the means to support your lifestyle for 2 years of study, what would you go for?

Coding, Cisco certifications, network security, X-ray technician? I like to be hands on, and I would not do well in a paper pushing office job. 

I don't have kids so I can adjust my lifestyle to a much lower salary then my current one, but I need a field where work is abundant, and pay starts out no lower then say $40,000. 

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Anyone else CF because they are scared that they would be a bad parent? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-11 00:01:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I see that for the most part people on this sub seem to site many reasons for being CF. Valuing your free time, pursuing careers, distaste for children, travel etc.etc seem to be common. They are all external factors though.


I am a realist, and I think I would be a terrible parent. I like kids, but that is why I decided to be CF. I have a really short fuse, and a bad temper. I go through manic depression. I drink (way)more then I should. 


Pretty much I am the problem, not the kids. My fear is that if I ever had kids, I would neglect them, or worse verbally abuse them when I had a bad day. Or worse yet just disappear, and leave my SO to raise them.


As it stands now I am a successful person, I keep my GF happy, and haven't managed to kill my dog. I project a very level headed, mellow persona, so people light heartedly ask when I am having kids. I usually tell them some BS like "none yet but it's fun trying"

However deep down, I know I would be a asshole of a father, so I just did my future kids a favor, and got a vasectomy.
I'm wondering if anyone else has the same feelings? This is a dark secret of mine, and I should have used a throw away but oh well.

	<TITLE> What impact does a speedtest have on realworld throughput? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-29 12:05:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At this moment in time I have both a fiber 100mbps connection, and a cable 300mbps connection at my house. (Yes I did load balance them, because I'm a nerd). I recently ordered the 300, and was really excited to have 3x the speed of fiber for the same price.

If you go by the speedtest.net results everything is as it should be. Ookla says I am getting 330mbps down, vs the as advertised 100 from fiber.

However in the real world my 100 mbps connection runs circles around the 300. Anywhere besides speedtest.net I get faster downloads. Torrents come down way faster, and my 300 connection actually has a hard time streaming 4k, whereas the fiber fills up the buffer in seconds.

What gives?

Is speedtest.net just a conspiracy, by the ISPs? They are definitely unscrupulous if they allow ads for known malware, like mackeeper. What good is all this speed to speedtest.net if regular websites never see nearly the same bandwidth?

Any thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pitted the Hawaiian Telcom fiber 100 vs the oceanic 300 maxx upgrade. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-28 23:32:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have noticed a common theme in posts on r/hawaii are about the 2 major ISPs here.  I thought some might be interested in a head to head comparison. 

I had oceanic come over and install the highest tier plan at my house yesterday. I already had the hawaiian Telcom 100 package, but my promotion is going to end soon. Oceanic offered 300 for $59.99 per month for 1 year. I currently pay $59.99 for 100 through HT. 

A bit of a description of my setup. I have last years top of the line asus Ac router, and run hard wired either net to my iMac, and to a switch hooked up to my 4k Samsung TV/ ps4/ Apple TV. Pretty much ideal setup for testing actual speed in a real world environment, since gigabit either net eliminates the variables of wifi. 

How did it perform?

Speed tests:

Well the good news is that to speedtest.net I managed to get above the advertised speed, clocking a blazing highest speed of close to 330mbps. Also hitting other twc servers in the mainland provided excellent results exceeding 200mbps in most instances. 

Unfortunately that is where the great speeds ended. It has been a open secret that many ISPs prioritize data to ookla, and the graphs really show it. When it detects speedtest.net traffic you can see the graph shoot up. 

I prefer to use a broad range of other speed tests to get a better idea. My favorite being testmy. Pitting ht vs oceanic in all the other speed tests put ht in the lead most of the time. To be fair ht also never got anywhere close to the advertised 100mbps, but I also never saw a result lower then 30mbps, whereas I saw many tests in the 10-15mbps with oceanic. 

Real world observable speed:

To test this I did a few different high bandwidth tests for things I do on a day to day basis. HD streaming, downloading games, and torrenting movies are the 3 things that stress your connection the most. 

 I am a early adopter of 4k, and use it wherever I can. Both my tv and imac are capable of streaming 4k natively, and at times it takes over 20mbps for just one stream. 

On my tv Netflix allows you to see the resolution up in the corner. Starting out with oceanic it would go 720p, then after a minute 1080p, then finally would get to 4k. 

Hawaiian Telcom starts out in 4k right off the bat. 

On my iMac hard wired in. I went to a 4k 60fps clip on YouTube.  Oceanic would play it but the status bar was barely keeping up with the white buffer bar, and over a few clips it had stopped multiple times to catch up. 

Did the same test with ht. no issues whatsoever. The buffer filled up, and stayed there the whole time. 

Downloading programs. 

For this I downloaded the same program from apple to my iMac twice. 

Oceanic seemed to be downloading at a rate of about 1.5 MB per second over the life of a 2GB download. 

Ht was about 2or so MB per second. 

Neither was very impressive but ht again took the win. 

Torrents

Not even close at all. Best observed speed from the most seeded torrent on the Internet at the moment(1080p mad max rip). 

Oceanic 3.5 MBps
Ht 7MBps

Conclusion. 

Ht was hands down faster in every aspect. There are many variables out of my control for this test. However I made the oceanic guy run a new drop to my house, and new home run coax to my 6183 modem. He said that all numbers were picture perfect. I ran every test back to back on the same equipment with the only variable being the ISP. 

I will be returning the modem, and canceling the oceanic account. For most people it would be fine, but if you want the best then HT fiber wins this round.

	<TEXT> ###Build Help/Ready:

**What is your intended use for this build? The more details the better.**

I want to build a PC to use as a file server/4k desktop for my 2 tvs. I may do a bit of gaming but definitly not sweating that as my priority.

**If gaming, what kind of performance are you looking for? (Screen resolution, FPS, game settings)**

Mid range. Not a big gamer, but would probably want to run GTA V at 1080p.

**What is your budget (ballpark is okay)?**

Under $1,000 all in

**In what country are you purchasing your parts?**

USA (Hawaii limits my shipping options)

**Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). [Consider formatting your parts list.](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/wiki/pcpp)**

GPU with HDMI 2.0

**Provide any additional details you wish below.**

Hey guys hope I filled out the format the right way. I am a total noob, but am good with building things. Considering my options to accomplish a few simple tasks. I want a PC permanently running connected to my 4k tv. I don't have cable, and I'm steadily amassing streaming devices. I just want to cut to the chase and have a HTPC to "aquire" content and watch it at my leisure, instead of my current process of getting it on one computer moving it to plex streaming dlna etc.

I know that at this moment getting a GPU with hdmi 2.0 is expensive, but I would need it to run 4k at 60hz on my tv. I would also like one that had display port as well. I am considering replacing my 27 inch iMac with this PC, and a 36 inch 4k monitor. I would fish a long usb, and display port cable to my kitchen. If the GPU could handle dual 4k desk tops that would be a plus.

I also need a mini case no taller then 18 inches, and no deeper then 14 it can be wide though, as its going on a shelf.

Gaming, and aesthetics are behind budget. This will be a utilitarian build.

Thanks in advance

**NOTE: You do not have to follow this format, but please be sure to answer these questions. Please do not ask to simply be given a build. You are welcome to delete this section.** </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Extremely slow downloads from PSN on fast internet connection. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-18 03:32:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was wondering if this was just a issue for me or everyone else. When I buy a game from PSN it takes a insane amount of time to download. I just bought walking dead which is a 4 GB game. It says ready in 17 hours. I can torrent 4 GB in well under a half hour with my 150 mbps internet. Downloading GTA was over 24 hours.


My Ps4 and router are in the same room. I thought it could be a wifi issue even though I have a nice AC router. So I just spent my day fishing a cat 5 directly to the PS4 through my attic. Did a speed test  in the system menu. I got around 95mbps, but still running slow. I bought the game after, and got 17 hours.

Any ideas on why so slow? The only other thing that indicates a slow connection is if I click on a trailer it will start out in 240p, and take about 1 minute until it ramps up to 1080p. I assume the trailers also come from PSN. Watching netflix/IGN/etc is flawless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously Every time I go home, I wander the hallowed halls of Ikea, and just imagine how cherry my house would be if we had one. If Target', Walmart, Costco, Home Depot etc can make it work I'm sure Ikea could pull it off.

I know they need certain demographics to build a store. Lets see a entire island of people living in tiny spaces, with a pretty high average yearly household income per capita. Not to mention the fact that it is such a transient place. If we aren't their demographic I don't know who is. 

They won't even ship us a catalog let alone buy the super concentrated awesomeness that is swedish meat balls, and minimalist Scandinavian furniture. 

I tried contacting their offices. 0 response.

Anyone know of a way to collect some signatures and get their attention? </TEXT>
