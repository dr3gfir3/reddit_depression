	<TEXT> Hey folks--

Thanks so much for the input you gave on the session we had at [Boston Skeptics](http://bostonskeptics.com/2015/06/sitp-larry-gilbertson-on-gmos-and-biotech/), which I called "Skeptics Ask Monsanto". I took skeptics' questions and made them the foundation of the discussion, as you can see. Some questions were fused together because they were similar concerns.  But there were also good questions from the floor spurred by the good foundation you helped me to create.

The blog post linked below has some highlights in case you can't be arsed to watch the [2 hour video](https://vimeo.com/132447651). But thanks for helping to craft the conversation.

If anyone can be bothered to watch, please feel free to offer additional questions, or constructive criticism about how it went. Two more local skeptics groups have asked us to do the same thing--Cape Ann, and Granite State Skeptics. So we can take new questions or refine it in other ways (needs to be shorter, for sure).

So thanks for your help, team skeptic. I hope we got some answers you are interested in. If not, let me know and I can ask for more clarification. Or we can discuss things in more detail. 

PS: I asked for the shill shirts, but was unable to get them. But they have heard your desire for them. I will keep at it....

Anyway, it's an interesting discussion about several topics of relevance to skeptics: media, science journalism, science and publication in predatory journals, open access, role of scientists in challenging bad claims, etc. 

It's an audio show. http://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/to-the-point/the-bitter-truth-on-junk-science </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What would it help you to hear from Monsanto? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-28 17:11:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been hanging around with the Boston Skeptics, and we would like to have a speaker from Monsanto come and speak to the group. We have a chance to direct the content a bit. 

I know skeptics aren't unified on the GMO issue. But I appreciate that most of them are at least open to hearing the data from the other side of their concerns. 

So here's my request for your questions: if you could hear from Monsanto, what would you like to have them address?

Alternatively, what myths do you think they need to tackle the most? What data might help you in discussions around the 'tubz on topics you face out there? 

For example, I'm going to ask about:

1. Biodiversity. It seems to me that people think there is just 1 kind of corn out there. How many varieties of corn are available to farmers? What differs among them?

2. The technology agreement: can you clarify if farmers are bound to your company and your chemistry in perpetuity? 

That sort of thing, really specific about Monsanto's science and business.

I hope this doesn't devolve into threads of wild claims on the conspiracies and chemtrails and all. I am really asking for guidance on some constructive ways to move the discussion out of those kinds of ruts. 

EDIT on day 2: Thanks very much for the helpful ideas, everyone. I will try to get these issues discussed. I will also press for a video, but if I can't get one, I'll take good notes and bring back a report somehow. 

EDIT (much later): The official announcement it out. If anyone wants to join us, the details are here: http://www.thebostoncalendar.com/events/boston-skeptics-in-the-pub-dr-larry-gilbertson

And I will use the real questions from this thread as part of the discussion. Thanks for your help on this. 

Edit July 7, 2015: for anyone who finds this thread later, the follow-up post and video I did based on this discussion can be found here: http://www.biofortified.org/2015/07/skeptics-ask-monsanto/ </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-04-02 22:25:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Boston Skeptics group continues to fire up at the new location at The Burren in Davis Square, Somerville. [right on the T red line]

Next Monday's talk is about gluten. It's given by Alessio Fasano. I saw him speak at the recent NAS panel on food safety and GMOs and I was completely perplexed about what he was saying. So I'm hoping for the opportunity to clarify some of the things in person.

Here is that talk: https://vimeo.com/album/3318277/video/123106720

I was really baffled by his throwing stuff out there, and then walking it back, and have no idea what his ultimate conclusion was. It was funny to see him describe the Samsel and Seneff correlation work as being akin to the rate of murders and use of IE--in other words, bunk. But mostly I still had no idea what he was getting to. 

He acknowledged that wheat is not GMO. So I guess he faults conventional breeding....?

Here is one of his slides that I edited with some helpful time notation. https://twitter.com/subject8379/status/573592430555086849

Anyway, I'll be at The Burren with some questions. Would love to see more local folks active IRL with the skeptics.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Taking on people who are *wrong on the internet* is not generally hard. There are ways to make noise here, comment threads, your own blogs, etc. 

However, there have been cases of kids being the issue advocates who are wrong--and this is a tougher situation. You can't challenge kids the same way. 

One example I saw was this kid at a TEDx: http://kfolta.blogspot.com/2012/04/more-tedx-credulity-sad-sad-talk.html So one mechanism was to go to the TED folks and talk about credibility. It's not solved, but they did attempt to clamp down on it. But still--the kid is out spreading nonsense: [Birke on the Farm](https://archive.today/crWNv).

That kid who published a book on heaven: [Boy Says He Didn't Go To Heaven; Publisher Says It Will Pull Book](http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2015/01/15/377589757/boy-says-he-didn-t-go-to-heaven-publisher-says-it-will-pull-book). You can't go after an injured kid. This story collapsed of its own accord. 

Recently there's been a young woman name Rachel Parent on the same path. [Nonsense at TEDx](http://debunkingdenialism.com/2014/12/20/why-rachel-parent-is-wrong-about-genetically-modified-foods/), TV appearances, and founding a ["kids" organization against GMOs](https://archive.today/s6Lvv). 

It certainly had the whiff of being stage-managed, but I never looked any deeper into it. I saw others point out that Parent is also peddling vaccine misinformation lately. https://twitter.com/RachelsNews/status/553636386566594561

Young ideologues are one thing. At some point they won't be cute anymore, and media will vanish. But it turns out, there's more to Rachel's story. The [Parent family owns alt-med franchises](http://youtu.be/H8ei-M5pGUw). (The value of the biz seems wrong here, that seems industry-wide. But still, it's a big money enterprise.) This moves the issue from uneducated juvenile to profiteer of dangerous ideas--like avoiding vaccinating and treating with homeopathic nonsense.

But what can you do about this? Does anyone have ideas about how to tackle these kinds of situations? What works? What doesn't work? Discussion welcomed.  </TEXT>

New location: The Burren, Somerville. [Sweet! This is a nice walk for me.]. https://twitter.com/bostonskeptics/status/558258946902085632

Next talk: 
Join Boston Skeptics on Feb 2, 7pm at The Burren, Somerville for a screening and discussion of @InvisThreat @SITP #SITP

This appears to be that film that teenagers did on anti-vaxxers, that earned them a lot of venom.  </TEXT>

DO NOT GIVE THIS PROJECT ANY MONEY. But I was afraid the video would vanish after the project fails (which it will in a few hours). It's a classic of narcissism, Galileo Gambit, and the suppression of scientific truth, of course. And that's only the first 10 minutes. It's an hour long.

	<DATE> 2014-12-23 15:24:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been musing this gray Festivus morning about my top grievance this year. It's hard to pick one. Mike Adams' hit list of scientists and science writers was way up there [Are these science writers and publications facing death threats for covering GMOs?](https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2014/07/are-these-science-writers-and-publications-facing-death-threats-for-covering-gmos/), but he's a two-bit huckster and has little credibility among sane people. 

The FUDbabe is well covered by others. Again, a minor player in the wider scheme of things.

I nominate Greenpeace for my top grievance. I am irked that they have not been jailed for damaging an ancient cultural artifact and research site. I also regret that the have not been brought to the International Court of Justice [for opposition to Golden Rice yet](http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/nobel-laureate-bats-for-gm-crops/article5441159.ece). 

They have international footing and the capacity for more real and widespread damage to science and solutions, so they are my top skeptic grievance. 

I pass the pole to you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> FoodBabe has tweeted that she is being rebuffed by health magazines, because of the incident with the recent cover appearance she had on *Experience Life* magazine.

For those who weren't aware of how this transpired, when FoodBabe appeared on the cover, the readership of the magazine that preferred facts rather than Foodbabe rebelled. They accosted the magazine folks via social media, they trashed the Amazon reviews, and it completely unwound when the magazine claimed it was a concerted effort by the food industry enemies of FoodBabe. 

The Foodbabe also thinks everyone who dislikes her earns 60 per post/tweet/etc. 

Sometimes it's hard to know if commenting pays off. I think this is evidence that is did.

Foodbabe reports the rebuffing: https://twitter.com/thefoodbabe/status/523199680680038400

	<TEXT> Recently this project came to my attention. I'm not going to link to the page, because last time I tried that my post vaporized. But I thought this was a really clever and pro-active way to make a point. And have some nice healthy squash. A skeptic group has raised funds to plant a garden of GMO squash, as a way to demonstrate the value of this tool, and as a way to possibly get legal standing for the future.

Most of the time we find ourselves on defense, and it was great to see a group find a way to go on offense. And yes--team anti-GMO is offended already, so it's already a win. 

Way to go Humboldt Skeptics! 

[Humboldt Skeptics Squash Garden Project Fundraiser](http://i4.photobucket.com/albums/y147/mem_from_somerville/Humboldt_squash_garden_zps8f870002.jpg)

*I am not affiliated with this group, and do not seek funds for it, it's all funded. I just loved the idea of this project.*

EDIT: I found a link that isn't the fundraiser site so it might not disappear my post...
