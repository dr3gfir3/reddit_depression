	<TEXT> Game is wrecked, but i still bought season pass yesterday. Why? Because developers are doing their best to fix things. I'm not a software developer but i know it can't be easy to fix things that are currently wrong with the game. 

I love the game, the lore, story, co-op,... 

I haven't and I will not lose hope for The Division. Developers showed today that they're working as fast as they can to fix things, when they fixed some major glitches during the same  day.

So please. No whining. Give them chance. 

Regards,
casual player, who still loves the game. And the game is a beauty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im quite a beginner when it comes to whiskey, but im starting to really enjoy it (26M). Really interested in getting more in to it.

Since i have limited knowledge on the matter i thought if any of you can help.

My father got [this whiskey](http://imgur.com/NKirPGx) as a gift when i was born. He gave it to me for my 18th birthday. And i promised to him that i won't open it until my first child is born and we can drink it together.

Im curious about the brand though. Have no idea if this is some cheap bottle or something i could look forward to trying. Will drink it anyway though.

	<TEXT> i'm an amateur comedian. I always had a wish that if i knew when i'm going to die, i would record a few-minute act to show at the funeral. It would mostly be dark jokes about my death of course. If people will cry at my funeral, i would like if at least some of them would do it out of laughter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thomas Chrn was Slovenian Bishop. He was the leading force behind the Counter-Reformation in Carniola, and Protestantism was suppressed in his diocese between 1600 and 1603. He was responsible for burning loads of very valuable books and translated texts that were some of the first in the slovenian language. However, Jurij Dalmatin's Bible translation was retained and he received papal permission to use it, thereby preserving its linguistic and literary tradition. </TEXT>
