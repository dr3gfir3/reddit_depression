	<TEXT> We tried starting a small fire four days ago just before dusk, to try and draw their attention away so we could escape. 

At first we thought it was working because they all gathered around it. But they collectively began spraying it with water from fake flowers on their chests and put it out. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I tried confronting a clown </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-06 15:09:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know what I was thinking. 

It seemed like an innocuous idea: find one of the clowns, corner it, and find out why they're doing all of this. I would become a media sensation! My findings might have led to blowing the entire clown sensation wide open! All because of my bravery.

I'd be a hero.

At first, my town seemed to be a sacred land that no clown dare touch. It was a god-fearing, blue collar town where everyone knew their neighbors and the postman could eat for an entire week thanks to the housewives and their generosity. There was one school, a Baptist-run institution that - surprisingly - focused more on education than religion. Everyone who has ever lived in the town went to that school, just like everyone here got their first job at the window factory. It was simply how things were. Some call it trite. We called it home.

Sure, there was crime. One time, for example, the little Daxterly's oldest boy lashed out and broke three windows at the church. It was all over the news and the papers. People would gossip, of course. However, no one chastised him for his actions. Instead, everyone was supportive and got him the help he needed. I'm not trying to brag, this was just a genuinely pleasant and nurturing community.

When the news broke that a clown was seen sitting on the steps of the school the other night it sent a ripple throughout the calm town. 

Everyone had been following the stories, yet no one was concerned of seeing them here. Why would we be? We all knew it was a prank - albeit a stupid one - that would fade away into obscurity. It was chalked up to the Daxterly boy lashing out again...until the next sighting.

And the next.

Then another.

Then two clowns together.

It wasn't until a dog was found mutilated in the middle of the town centre that the population collectively began to panic. Curfews were enforced. Shops closed early. School and church service was reduced to twice a week. Had someone passed through after dusk they would have found a ghost town. Fear was running the town now.

I wanted it to stop.

My plan was simple. Every night since the first incident, the clowns have been seen on the school grounds or the church grounds. All I would need to do is stay out of sight of the sheriff while I waited to see a clown. Then, simply run up on it and find out what the hell they're in the town for. Easy.

Darkness had finally fallen the night I made the decision to act. I've never believed in guns, nor taking a weapon to an unarmed fight...but I have to admit, the hysteria was beginning to grate on me at that point. I went out with a wooden Louisville Slugger and a flashlight.

It was slightly after 10pm, and most of the residents were already sleeping in hopes of seeing daylight sooner. That made it easy for me to avoid the sheriff as I was able to cut through backyards and hide in driveways when the patrol cars got too close. This was a small town. On a regular night I could walk to the school in less than ten minutes, but law enforcement wasn't taking any chances. It took me almost an hour to reach the school, and when I did I was upset to see nothing waiting for me. Nothing.

I posted up in a nearby tree that had a clear view of the front of the building and got comfortable. Something in my gut told me I was going to have a long wait ahead of me. I wish I could say that a few hours into my shift a clown came and I was able to get my answers. I really do...but I fell asleep.

I woke up on the lawn under the tree to blinding daylight and a gun in my face.

The officer was stern and visibly shaken, but nice enough to me. At the station he gave me coffee and a nice selection of pastries and fruits to choose from for breakfast. In other cities this might be seen as them buttering up a suspect to get them to talk, but not here. This was southern hospitality at it's finest.

We talked for a while about everything going on with the clown situation. The conversation wasn't focused on my actions like I had expected. The officer was more interested in what my thoughts were on how to deal with this clown situation that was currently paralyzing the town. I think he saw my actions as more brave than incriminating - like I wanted. I could still be a hero.

After a couple of hours, we came to an agreement on the situation. The sheriff's office would turn a blind eye to any investigations I wanted to conduct alone - even after hours. However, any criminal activity would be penalized to the fullest extent...especially assault. He made it *very* clear that no matter who was behind this, I wasn't allowed to touch a single hair on their head. It was a reasonable compromise. 

That night, I returned to my post. It was a lot easier without having to stay out of sight. A simple nod of acknowledgement was the only exchange I had with the officers patrolling the streets. When I made it to the school I found no signs of life yet again. I climbed the tree, and settled in for a long night.

About two hours into my wait I still hadn't seen any signs of a clown. My eyes were getting heavier by the minute so I made the decision to inspect the grounds and see if I could discover anything indicating a clown might be in the area.

When I jumped to the ground from the lowest branch , I was greeted by a tall figure wearing a bright, shiny blue body suit that was bedazzled with buttons and patterns. I'd be lying if I said I didn't fall back against the tree, gasping for air. All confidence left my body as my eyes met it's face. I had been expecting a poor silicon mask, not a white human face with red lips and blue hair staring back at me. The lack of a red nose unsettled me as well. This wasn't the clown I was prepared for.

I couldn't move. My body had shut down on me when I needed it most. The clown didn't move - didn't even blink. It just stared at me deeply with bright green eyes and a smile that was permanently affixed on it's face. A stand off.

After a few more minutes, the clown reached one of its white gloved hands out to me. I looked to it's hand, and then back to those oddly bright eyes without budging and inch. Nothing about the clown had changed aside from it's arm. The clown still didn't blink. It still had that fucking smile. It nodded a couple of times towards it's hand like it wanted me to grab it. I was confused, but with the hope of humanity being behind the costume, I reached out to shake the outstretched hand. Before I was able to fully lock palms with the clown, I was met with a light shock that radiated up my forearm. I screamed. The clown arched it's head back, grabbed it's belly, and laughed at me. It sounded like there was a broken squeaky toy lodged in it's throat.

The electric jolt must have been enough to revitalize my body, as I jumped up and shoved the clown away from me as hard as I could. It fell back in an exaggerated manner, flailing it's large white shoes up and sliding on it's rear end across the grass. After a brief pause and a look of disbelief, the clown began to silently cry while rotating it's fists under it's squinting eyes and stopping it's heels into the ground. 

I was annoyed with the dramatics and started yelling at the it. Nothing remotely coherent came from my mouth - just a smorgasbord of profanities and blame. Once I relieved my pent up frustrations, the clown stopped pouting and began it's squeaky laugh again, but this time it was accompanied by another noise. A louder noise that wasn't coming from it's mouth. The air around me was overtaken by a sound that was similar to a million cicadas clicking in a deep whisper.  I couldn't hear the clown in front of me any longer. Everything was this overtaken by whatever was making this background noise. I fell back again, grasping my head in pain and attempting to cover my ears.

**Bang**

My heart stopped. I looked up and the clown in front of me was now a Rorschach painting across the grass. My interrogating officer was standing next to me with a shotgun. "Run!" He yelled at me as he grabbed my arm and yanked me to my feet. Surrounding the entire were clowns of all shapes and sizes, walking towards us with their mouths wide open, slightly facing the ground. We barely made it to the station, circumnavigating all the clowns that overtook the streets.

It's been thirty-eight days since that incident. 

We've been barricaded in the station, taking rotating shifts in the camera room. The clowns...they've taken on our everyday lives. We watch them go shopping, walk dogs, go to school and work. It's like they're trying to replace us.

The only peculiar thing they do is surround the station at night and laugh in unison. All night, until the sun rises. Then they continue on like nothing happened. We've got full utility access here, and have been keeping up on the news. We know it's spreading. I fear that my actions that night may have caused them to resent humans. [I](https://facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) wanted to be the hero, but I can't find a way to stop this. Greenville is gone. Don't let the media fool you - stay away from here. 

More importantly, don't go near the clowns. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "You *filthy fucking whore*." I berated her. "One cock wasn't good enough for you? Sit **down!**" She tried getting up, but to no avail - the ankle bracelets were too tight and I left no slack in the chains.

"You think," I heckled, "you think you can just go fuck anyone you want to?" She looked at me so beautifully, overwhelmed with fear and guilt. The blood made her face even more attractive than usual.

"I've got someone you can fuck."

I threw her down onto the stained, decrepit mattress on the concrete floor. She didn't resist me as I chained her wrists to the wall and put the clamp around her neck. She looked so innocent, so loving - I...I couldn't help but have a moment of clarity. This was my *wife* restrained in front of me. What kind of man would do this to someone whom he swore his undying love to?

There was a metallic knock on the door to the enclosure. "Hey man, I've got shit to do today - you ready?"

My wife began to squirm.

"Yeah. It's open."

A gargantuan man in height and mass ducked into the room, barely clearing his bald head as he stood fully erect inside. "Honey, this is John. John's going to rape you."

She began to spasm uncontrollably, like a germ being multiplied. Tears mixed with the blood on her face, creating a red sea of pathetic lies. John wasted no time removing his pants and stroking his titan-sized cock into a full, rock hard erection. 

"Com'ere, darling." John said as he knelt down and ripped my wife's legs apart like a lobster shell. He immediately shoved his monstrous dick in her, not caring at all about foreplay or preparation - just like we had planned. She began screaming. Shrieking, rather. She couldn't handle his impossible length nor his girth...she was ripping. 

"Wait!" I shouted at John as I briskly walked over to them. "This is my *wife,*man. We can't disrespect her like this!" Upon uttering those words, I took my pocket knife and carved a heptagon lightly into her chest, between her massive, expensive breasts. "We have to play by the rules."

I walked away and John continued to pound her until she started to become limp. "On her face?" John asked me.

"No, down the bitch's throat."

John withdrew his throbbing, blood coated member and forced it into her mouth with no resistance, cumming straight into her throat. Her gags and gasps for air told me she almost drowned.

"Thanks, man. Here's the cash." I said as I threw an envelope to John. 

"Anytime. I've been eyeing a new truck anyways." John said as he wiped himself off and put his clothes on. He left with an affirming nod. He would come back if I asked him to.

I looked at my wife who was close to blacking out from her sexual adventure.

"Baby...sweetheart. Can you hear me?" She weakly nodded. "I got a really good angle on the [camera](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ) this time. But we're going to have to dip into one of the kids' savings if you want to keep doing this cuckold shit." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Charlie's Bedroom </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-04 13:10:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Charlie was your normal five year old boy...well, as normal as he could be. Charlie liked all of the normal little boy activities just like all of his friends did. He liked to draw and paint at his little art table. He liked to drive his cars around the house. He *really* liked to go outside and play in the yard while his parents sat on the deck watching him. Sometimes, if he asked, his parents would even play ball with him! Yes, Charlie was your perfectly normal five year old boy.

Until it was bedtime.

You see, Charlie had a secret in his bedroom. A secret that he never told anyone. He *really* wanted to tell his Mom and Dad, but Charlie was afraid he would get in trouble because he learned in school that telling secrets is bad. No, instead Charlie kept the secret to himself...and the Dark Man.

Every night, a little after his parents told him they loved him and left his room, the Dark Man would appear. First, Charlie's window would quietly slide open, letting in the cool night air. Then, the Dark Man would slide inside of the room like a snake sliding through grass. The Dark Man never made a noise when he was coming inside, because he said that if he woke up Charlie's Mom and Dad they would hurt him. Charlie used to feel bad for the Dark Man, so when the Dark Man asked Charlie to keep him a secret, he said he would.

For weeks, the Dark Man would come into Charlie's room and stand in the corner. He only ever wanted to watch Charlie. That's all.

Until one day, after standing in Charlie's bedroom for a while, the Dark Man floated over to Charlie's bed and sat down, stroking Charlie's hair and face.

This made Charlie really scared and he screamed as loud as he could for his Mom and Dad. 

The Dark Man got angry and smacked Charlie for sharing their secret, but not even a couple seconds later, Charlie's Dad ran into his room and threw the Dark Man on the ground. Charlie started crying and hid under his Spiderman blanket. All he heard was yelling and things falling down until the loud sirens came. That's when everything stopped.

The police took the Dark Man away in their car, and stayed at Charlie's house for a while to ask him questions about the Dark Man. He told them all about their secret, how he would come into the room, everything. The police officer was really happy that Charlie was being such a good boy, and gave him a big, metal badge as a reward for helping them keep the Dark Man away. The officer also told Charlie something very important, and he made Charlie promise to not forget it. The officer told Charlie that if he ever has a secret, he needs to tell his parents right away so they can keep him safe. Charlie agreed, and the police officer gave him a big hug.

Charlie never kept a secret from his parents again.

	<TEXT> It's been 723 days since we met in the hallway during senior year. Do you remember that moment? It was 11:53 a.m., two minutes after the bell rang to let out fourth period. I was walking down the North hall towards the lunch room when you stepped on my new Vans. Boy, I sure was pissed until I looked up and saw how stunning you were! I was without words for a moment and you were giving me your heart and soul through your eyes. I think we both knew at that exact moment that we would be inseparable. 

We were both right. 518 days ago you told me you loved me. I had been waiting for so long to hear those words and had nearly given up hope. My mistake, I believe, was telling you so early - we had only been dating for 72 days, after all. The night you finally said it was raw bliss. Sitting in your living room in front of a movie neither one of us intended on watching. My spine tingled and my skin covered itself in speed bumps as you held my hand and professed your love for me. We both wept on your parent's light brown couch. It was 4:14 p.m., an hour before your mother would be getting home from work.

Our families were elated when we told them about our engagement 201 days ago! March 3rd. Eight days before we left for New Orleans. Your mom was already calling me her son, and my family genuinely believed you were the perfect woman for me. Maybe Facebook wasn't the best place to announce it first. I know some people didn't take well to it, but it's 2016 - it's the norm now. I was surprised you didn't cry when I asked you to be my wife since I could barely keep the frog from hopping out of my throat. You smiled, though.

When you moved into my apartment 108 days later it seemed like nothing was going to stop us. Our lives were finally one, like a true family. You, me, Tommy the cat, and that little turtle I found. Perfection. It balanced out so well, too. Since you weren't working yet and I had been with the firm for a couple years now, you didn't have to worry about money anymore. You had plenty of time to get on your feet and find a career that you were passionate about. What good would a job have been if you were miserable at it, right? Ha, you always said that.

It's been 36 days since I began getting suspicious. It started with you always tilting your phone when I was sitting next to you. You always placed it face down too, which made it seem like you didn't want anyone to see your notifications. It really ruffled my feathers that Thursday night when I woke up at 12:56 a.m. and you weren't in bed. Becky had never gone out drinking on a Thursday before, but I understood the whole "friends don't let friends drive drunk" mantra.

The next six days were filled with more and more suspicious activities from you. It didn't make sense that you had three job interviews that week. I checked my computer - you didn't have anything close to a resume saved. Also, I had filled up my tank on Sunday and only drove nineteen miles between then and Tuesday morning when you needed the car. It didn't make sense that you picked me up with under a quarter-tank for a job interview in Birdtown. That's eleven miles from our apartment.

It culminated when I went to the Giant Eagle and saw Becky at 6:14 p.m.. When I asked her how her weekend was after Thursday she gave me a blank stare until I reminded her about how you had to go pick her up. Then, her eyes spoke to me and informed me that it was a lie. I hated to leave all of that fresh produce...but you and I needed to talk. 

7:02 p.m. 

"He's just a friend!" you pleaded.

7:21 p.m. 

"You haven't been home when I needed someone. He was there for me. I swear I only love *you.*"

29 days ago you left me to be with him...because I was being "unreasonable."

I'm embarrassed that it took so long to find out where he lives. It was 18 days ago. I followed you from our gym to his house, where you opened the door with your copy of his house key. It was a bittersweet feeling to see you still using the gym membership I bought you.

It's been 15 days since I started following the man himself and learning about his life. Where he worked. His hangouts. His friends. His hobbies. His routines. He appeared to be a pretty fun guy that brought in a pretty nice paycheck. It made sense to me that you would go for someone like him - you needed more time to find a career you were "passionate" about. 

Eleven days ago I broke into his house. 2:00 a.m., through the side door he left unlocked so he could easily let his dog, Max, out. 

It wasn't ideal, and I'm still dealing with the guilt...but Max started barking a little *too* early. I can clearly hear the whimper he made when I stuck my knife into his belly. Max didn't do anything to me. I hear it every time I glance over at him. I'm going to properly bury him when all of this is over.

Max aside, eleven days ago I broke in and lured your new love into his basement and restrained him in the storage room. I used the handcuffs we bought that vanished mysteriously one day. He seemed pretty used to the idea. 

A day later, I decided it was time to start the beatings. Nothing crazy! Every hour, from 11 a.m. until 5 p.m., 
I would hit him in various places with an aluminum tension rod I found in the basement. A little tease, if you will. It wasn't until I finished dinner at 8:12 p.m. that I decided to up the ante. Remember when we watched the first Hostel movie? It was on when you told me you loved me for the first time. No? Well I went with a method similar to that...for you, of course. I took my knife and made small incisions about 1/8 of an inch deep on the tops of his knees, feet, and shoulders. Not enough to bleed out, but enough to leave open flesh.

Six days ago, Max was covered in maggots. It was disgusting, but I needed them. I grabbed a handful and went over to your darling minstrel to tell him about my plans. He squirmed a bit as I placed the maggots inside of the incisions I made four days prior. I put them in at 8:00 a.m. exactly. The slightly rotted flesh was eaten away by the time I checked on him again at 5 p.m. and the maggots layed inside of him, with their heads popping out of the skin ever-so-slightly. At least I was able to make something happy.

I was elated to see that the flies had started laying new eggs two days ago. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt like the flies and I had an understanding of each other. I would provide them with food as long as they would keep the wounds clean enough to keep lover boy alive. They also stayed away from us when I began cutting off his digits yesterday. 

At 10 a.m., I went to check on him. He was quite pale due to the blood loss and I was worried I lost him when he didn't respond to the back of my hand striking his face. It took me sticking my index finger into thigh to get any sort of activity. I explained to him that I was going to remove the tape and let him talk one last time. When I did so he said, verbatim: 

"She loves to swallow."

There's a spot on the body called the carotid triangle. It's named as such because the carotid artery, among others, are relatively superficial and don't have the normal amounts of muscle and bone protection that the rest of the body provides to other major blood vessels. Surgeons use this spot frequently because it allows easy access into major parts of the neck. I used it to jam [my](https://facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) knife into lover boy and end his life six hours ago.

In one hour, it's your turn. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Ow, Lily! Stop!" I yelled, as she hopped off of my legs.

It was cute when she was a tiny newborn and would sit on my lap, curl up in a ball and suckle on my fingertips. These days it was just a bit too much - she was *way* too massive. Around eight months or so, when she began hitting her final growth spurt, Lily's appetite became insatiable. Dry food was no longer enough, no. She needed fresh, wet food which was not easy to come by in my city and when you could find it - you couldn't afford it.

I had to come up with my own solution.

It started with stray animals. To me, if they were roaming the streets then the odds were slim that they would be missed. Lily would have a small cat in the morning and if she was good, a small dog for dinner. It worked out perfectly...for a while, at least. She began starving between meals. The veterinarian recommended only feeding her twice a day but after she got most of my left hand in a hunger-induced fit I decided to up her intake. However, there were only so many strays in the city.

After attempting to feed her homeless people, and a few close encounters with the bad people, we needed to leave and find a new food source.

We needed livestock. Livestock, and less laws. 

Mexico.

We left to come here a couple decades ago and haven't had an issue since. I only let Lily out at night and she's restricted to one farm at a time. Every once in a while, some paranoid farmer will catch a picture or small video of her but usually their evidence gets dismissed as a crazy "urban legend" hoax. Life is good here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In hindsight, I probably could have warned that family that I was going to burn down their house. Maybe sent them some cryptic letters or lit a smaller fire first or something. When that urge hits...I can't control myself.

It's like a drug addiction. 

My body starts to shake and my hands get clammy - that's the first indicator. Usually I can subdue the cravings at that moment by fiddling with one of my lighters. If I can't, though, then I have to burn something. 

Dumpster fires. Cars. Houses. Bums. A cat, one time. It's the only way I can calm myself.

The problem is, my studio apartment is too small to house all of these victims. Every night when I get home from a fix there's less and less room for me for live. 

This last family was the tipping point. 

I need a bigger apartment. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Tale of Marcus </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-28 18:55:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "Marcus, my brother!" shouted a distant voice. Marcus whipped his head around, flailing his lengthy black hair around him. 

The field was void of life.

Marcus knew he was alone but couldn't contain his excitement at the prospect of there being a survivor from the Battle. As the lone General, Marcus carried the pain of guilt in his large, muscular chest. Responsibility for the casualties was his, and Marcus had no intentions of escaping it. 

"I was foolish," he thought, "to let these men come into battle. This was not their fight." 

Marcus was right. The Battle of Igar was not a war between common men - it was a war between aristocrats. Money moves men to do unspeakable things, and there was no shortage of greed surrounding Igar. The Three Lands each attempted to stake a claim over the salt mines only to meet opposition from the others. Instead of compromise and shared ownership, the Three Lands sent armies to claim the mines before another could. Marcus was chosen to lead one of these armies due to his reputation - a massive, ruthless warrior turned master blacksmith.

The Battle was fought with cunning tactics and merciless force. Thousands of lives were lost but survivors were still abundant - until the creatures of the mines were woken by the noise of fighting. Wretched beasts that dwelled in the old, damp mines for centuries. It is a well versed tale that these creatures are the embodiment of hatred and sin. They arose from the depths, angered by the disturbances, and began slaying all living things that were not of their own flesh and blood. Hours upon hours of savagery. Marcus, the sole survivor, was only sparred by his ability to kill. The creatures tried - with no shyness in numbers - and found themselves becoming fodder, causing a retreat.

While Marcus carried this burden of guilt, he now had one goal: to return home to his wife and daughter. Marcus knew that he would have to answer for the devastating loss of his entire legion - it was an inevitability. For now, however, letting his family know he was still breathing and holding them in his arms took priority. 

He continued on his path home, through the fields and ravines that made up Igar, imagining the scene of his return home.

As he walked across the field to their house under the tree, his wife would spot him while planting flowers. "Marcus, my love!" His wife, Beth, would proclaim as she would run to him. Their daughter, curious about her mother suddenly running into the distance, would cautiously follow, seeing her mother jump in Marcus' massive arms. "Papa!" She would yell joyously as she ran to join them. A truly gay reunion of a family stuck in the limbo of uncertainty. 

A bit farther East than he expected, Marcus came upon a tattered stone bridge that connected Igar and his homeland over a raging river. This was an unfamiliar sight to him, as the maps have never shown any water separating the two bodies. With low caution and rising eagerness Marcus began to cross the unmarked bridge. 

No more than halfway across, Marcus was abruptly stopped in his tracks by a force he could not see. Despite his large stature and legendary strength, Marcus could not pass the point he met the resistance. He was free to move in reverse as he willed it, but progress was impossible. As Marcus contemplated his current situation, he heard a wet coughing coming from the side of the bridge as if someone had almost drowned. Rushing to the side, he was met with a slender, decaying brown hand attached to a thin arm that indicated he should go no further.

"Just a...moment...please," the voice forced out between breaths. "I haven't climbed these stones in a few decades!" After a moment the voice was given an identity. An old, brown and yellow troll now stood on the bridge with Marcus, holding his round belly while trying to catch his breath. The troll was a dwarf in stature compared to Marcus. It had skinny limbs that ended in large hands and feet, covered in skin that seemed to be melting off. It's clothes consisted of nothing more than a stained red headdress and a red, hole filled shorts. How this creature had such a large belly was a mystery, as it appeared to be weaker than an infant child. 

"Ah, a warrior. I see...you want to go home?" The troll had a nasal voice and a condescending tone. "You've hit my barrier!" It began to laugh. Marcus was not pleased, and took an imposing step towards the troll. 

"Listen to *me,* creature. Remove your spell on this cursed bridge and I may just spare your life." Marcus grabbed the handle of his axe.

"Settle down, settle down. I am Dol. I own this bridge. My land is sanctioned by King Armedius and *you*, Marcus, are trespassing." Dol began to brush himself off, causing bits of skin to fall with the dirt and other rocks. "My bridge," he cackled.

Marcus, frustrated, let go of his axe and sat himself on the ground, crossing his legs. "Dol, was it? If your land is sanctioned then I must beg your forgiveness."

"Forgiven."

"Thank you, kindly. If I may bore you for a moment I would like to tell you my reason for needing to cross this bridge."

Dol agreed to listen and Marcus recounted every detail of his life from the past weeks, sparring nothing in order to stay on good grounds with the troll. It seemed interested, and better yet, genuinely impressed. 

"Family men. Men that owe themselves to their families. Those are the truest of the true. Like you, Marcus, family is also an important part of my life. I will grant you a deal. Do you accept?"

Although Dol seemed to be sincere, Marcus was still weary. "What are your terms?" He asked.

"Ah-ah!" Dol exclaimed, "Agree and learn, or turn down and leave." Marcus looked around for another way. "You'll die in the river." 

"If I must accept your deal to pass, then we have a deal." Marcus said hesitantly.

Dol was visibly jittering with excitement at the deal. "Answer me riddles three and you shall pass and you shall see." He smirked. Marcus sighed in frustration. 

"One. The answer I give is yes, but what I mean is no. What was the question?"

Although most men of his size typically lacked any skills outside of physical labor and combat, Marcus was surprisingly quick witted - a trait his wife loved to hate. 

"Do you mind?"

"Do I mind what?" Dol snickered. 

"The answer, troll, is 'do you mind?'"

"Correct!" The troll jumped around in celebration. "Have an apple!" Marcus caught the fruit and gave it a quick inspection before biting. It was refreshing after his long travels.

"Two." Dol produced a male figurine from the air. "This man was born before his father. How?"

Dol began to dance the tiny man around while Marcus  thought of the solution. "Tick tock, where's the clock?" He sang in rhythm with his movements.

"The man was born while his father watched." He wasn't completely confident in the answer, but had no alternatives.

"Ding! Three." In a swirl of smoke the figurine vanished. Marcus stood up in preparation to finish crossing the bridge - an intimidating shadow cast over Dol.

"Many have heard me, no one has seen me. I will not speak unless spoken to first. What am I?"

Marcus let out a thunderous laugh from his stomach, "An echo! Mother used to tease me with that riddle when I was a boy. I'll be on my way now, friend." He tossed the apple core into the river and began towards the other side. 

"Marcus! Friend!" Dol dove in front of him. "A final riddle, with no catch. *Please?*" 

Tired of the games, but pleased with the honesty of the troll, Marcus gave him an affirming nod.

"Thank you!" Dol smiled from ear to ear, revealing his fuzz coated teeth. "Four. We started as two, then became three. We lived in a house under a tree. We lived as three, we died as three. Cross this bridge and you will see."

The river stood still and silence rained down over the bridge. Marcus, confused, stared at Dol until he felt the need to sit down again. "House...under a...tree," he stammered. Marcus began to feel weakness taking over his body inch by inch. His face started to become flush and his throat itchy. He sat back, bracing himself with one arm. Dol sat on his lap.

"The King sends his love." Dol whispered as he placed his hand on the warrior's forehead and laid him down.

In front of the house and under tree sits a family, one, two, and three. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was morning. I woke up with a raging piece of morning wood in my shorts, so, naturally, I started helping my uncle jack off the roof. No, not masturbate. When I get a rager I go wake up my uncle jack and give him an old fashioned on the roof until he sprays his MANSEED into the bushes. Then. I'LL go to my room and wank my fuck stick until I blast boyseed all over my mom's wedding picture.

This morning when I went to go face blast my mom and dad, a bunch of mold came out!!!!!!!! AND THEN THE STICKY PICTURE OF MY MOM AND DAD CHANGED AND THEIR FACES WE'RE SMILING WIDE. ALMOST TOO WIDE. AND THEY HAD SHARP TEETH. ALMOST TOO SHARP....like a bears food mashers.

I ran out of my room, mold dick in hand, and, ran to find any human life that remained in the house, and stuff. I saw the guy who used to play doctor with my mom and dad, Taco, and he had a mold dick too! It's was spreading! I had to stop it because I'm going to stop the creature like no one else has ever been able to do before me like no one else has before them. And so on.

I killed my cat because I felt like this was a good opportunity to do so. Then I prayed to Valka for help after I was safely in my car. She didn't answer, but my former totally not my cousin lover Bek did. I don't know how the fuck she got stuck in the mold from my mold dick and at that point I was too afraid to ask. I had to get out of the house and get to class. 

I ran into my best friend Jake on the way to class. 

Literally. 

He was jaywalking.

I go so excited by my new found goreporn fetish that I stopped the car and beat my moldy fuck stick until it sprayed mold all over the world. 

I'm your god now, bitch.

As for class and all that riff raff....fuck it. I know everything because I rule the world bitchizzzzzz with my homies Daf and Jesse. We smoke weed erryday # 420bruh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You'll have to excuse my grammar, spelling, and any potential phonetic errors. American English isn't my native tongue.

-----

You won't believe me if I told you but this really did happen I swear. It was just the other night - I had witnesses but they are dead now. **It** took them. No, not the scary clown. That's all made up unless you live in North Carolina. Then u ded.

No, this story is a true story. 

It was just the other night. My friends and I decided we were finally brave enough to try out the urban legend about the Candyman. If you don't know; the candyman legend started with a movie called candyman. The legend says that if you say his name 5x while naked in a mirror (not really naked, but Liz had big boobs so we said naked) that the candyman will show up and kill the person who said it with a big hook that he has instead of one of his hands. We thought "hey, if we all say it at the same time then there's no way the candyman can kill all of us"! So we all chanted his name while naked and secretly looking at eachothers bodies in the mirror. 

Except I didn't say it for the 5th time because I'm not stupid lol.

When we got done, nothing happened. Everyone got dressed and we sat on the couch eating raw cookie dough and smoking black and milds. 

Then we heard the cat scream from the bathroom like it just got ripped in half. We all ran to the bathroom and there was the cat ripped in half. 

Seriously? I thought. Now we have to clean this up.

But before anyone started doing anything, Gene Wilder's ghost appeared in front of us with a bloody hook instead of a hand. 

I swear this is true:

He started killing everyone with his hook hand while humming the Golden ticket song from Willy wonka. Except for me. When he was done murdering everyone and getting blood all over the place he walked up to me while I was crying and whispered in my ear:

"The Candyman can because he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good." </TEXT>

All of them were into anal

Of a man named Brady
Who was busy grooming three boys of his own
They were four men
Hard all together
He never left them alone

'Til the one day when the lady met this fellow
And he knew that he had to find her girls
That his boys must somehow get her daughters 
That's the way they all became the Butt-Fucking Brady Bunch

The Brady boys fucked those girl's butts until blood and poop covered the carpet's shitty 70s pattern. Then they left them to bleed out and/or die from sepsis. True story.  In the city the family was from they renamed the house the "Poopdickblood Home."

	<TITLE> A thought on story comments </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-02 14:52:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **This might be long.**

Remember how everyone was debating on staying in character in the comments, immersion, and if it all truly had a purpose?

I don't know if that will ever get resolved - we all have varying opinions and that's perfectly fine. I do, however, want to add my opinion based on a recent story I wrote and my experiences with the readers. 

Lately, I've been experimenting with posting my stories under alt accounts to see if there's any major differences in success and and if commenting in character makes an impact. The idea got sparked with the debates on the importance of immersion and it's usefulness/necessity. 

To date, I've posted four stories under different accounts (three of which I won't be claiming here) and I would like to draw your attention to the most recent one, written under /u/ILoveMyDad95. I'm not going to link it, because I don't want to get it traced back to this post by a bot or anything. 

*Wait. What?*

Yes, I care that much about keeping the immersion alive in that story.

*Why, Mikey?*

Glad you asked! See, that story is short. Like, I'm pretty sure it just barely clears the 500 word requirement. It's a letter from father to son about when he found out he had a brain tumor, and the weird experience he had that led to it's discovery. I didn't add any implications of what actually happened to the dad. No monsters. No spirits/demons. Nothing. The only thing that can be taken to mean there's something sinister at work is the ending, where my character says he has started having a similar experience to his dad. 

My intent was to leave it wide open to interpretation. There was never going to be a follow up post. It is what it is. 

*Mikey. Dude. What's your point? There's like fourteen other things I could be doing.*

See, this story got a few comments rather quickly about what might have been going on with the dad and, subsequently, the son. Some people suggested that my character might have a tumor similar to his father. Others brought up the idea of a demon or spirit. One person suggested aliens, but I'm pretty sure he was just trolling. What did I do with these comments? **I responded in character.**

From my responses, the comment section spiralled into a plethora of suggestions about what my character should do to be safe. Salting my windows and doors and setting up doctor appointments were the most prevalent. I also received a very kind message from a person who was deeply concerned with whether it was a story or not who let me know they knew how to help me if it wasn't. 

In my opinion, the comment section could be a whole second layer to that story - one that I never even thought to be there. If I was so inclined, I could feasibly write a follow up post just with the material from those discussions. 

**You don't get that anywhere else.**

If this was just a sub for scary stories and didn't have immersion rules in place, that story would have fallen flat. I guarantee it. Because of me maintaining my character, it stayed on the front page for a full day and got a respectable amount of attention. It wasn't the next SAR or DFK, but it holds its own. All because I responded to comments in character. I'd also like to use that point to emphasize the importance of interacting with your audience here. It matters. Whether they believe the story or not, it's fun and regular readers here expect good things in the comments.

As for success? In terms of upvotes, all of my stories have been more successful with alt accounts. Is there a market for writers who use one account for everything? *Absolutely.* I don't find anything wrong with 46 stories from one writer. When they're good they're good, regardless of immersion. It also helps build a following for writers like EZ and iia. That's great! 

However, I feel that a valid argument for the necessity of immersion can be made here. The aforementioned story could have easily been debunked if that account had a history of posting in NoSleep. But it didn't. And people, whether they truly believe it or not, ran with it. 

In true, NoSleep fashion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this one time I ate peppermint taffy, and I'm allergic to peppermint taffy. My face swelled up like a big, pus-filled balloon that was ready to spew pus out of my little eye balls drains. Kinda cool, if you ask me. But my pops wasn't having it. He made me go to the hospital for in order to save my life. Psh. 

It wasn't me being scared of dying that made me scared it was the things I saw. Black figures walking around me everywhere I looked. They kept asking me questions but all I heard were whisper noises. Then, surprisingly. They started stabbing me to death with sharp pointy needles. I basically died. No really. I did. I died for like a minute I bet. 

Pops says it turns out it was just the doctors and nurses helping me out but I'm not sure. I'm going to have to go back and investigate the clear demons there. Upvote if you want me to go back. I'll update if there's interest. </TEXT>

Every. Single. Day. We go through the same thing. **If you make a mess in your room, CLEAN IT UP.**

*God.* What do you think your father would say if he was still here? Do you think he'd approve of this mess? Boy, you'd get the belt. *I promise you.*

I've told you a million times that if you're going to get body parts everywhere you *have* to pick them up before you leave the house. I'm not cleaning up your mess anymore! Do you know how hard it is for me to try and put the arms and legs together with the right torsos?! I don't know what bodies they go to! These heads...they could go to anyone of them!

I'm sorry. Just. *Please.* Start cleaning up after yourself. I can't do it anymore. It's been so hard since your father left us. Come on, don't do that. It wasn't your fault baby. He had it coming to him, okay? You did everything you were supposed to do. 

Ah, see? I see that little smile! 

Now, please clean these parts up.

If you clean up soon, maybe we can go out and find a new toy for you to take apart! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was great...I think. We read some Harry Potter before bed, like usual. Then, as he was laying down he started to hear me read a story to my girlfriend (she likes the way I tell stories, I guess). He wanted me to tell him another story so (being the strict dad that I am) I told him he could come out to the living room with us. I decided that for family story time I would go with [this](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/27el9i/i_was_a_part_of_queens_guard_in_england_one_of/) gem from a of couple years ago (with some serious word omissions).

Boy, that was a terribly great idea. It's a two parter, and I had to tell him the Christmas story I wrote after part one to calm him down. He wanted to go to bed before I started the second part, but I could hear him getting uneasy from his bedroom even though he *swears* he didn't hear me. 

It's 11:26 pm. He's still awake, bedroom light on. (As I typed that sentence he just asked me: "Hey dad, are you still reading that scary story still?") 

I don't regret my decision. I've never read him a scary story before and it was oddly fun to watch him get a bit uneasy and ask me to not make it so scary. I think there's a spot in Hell for me.

Anywho, just wanted to share a fun personal thing with you all. Happy August 21st! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm a detective. Detective Mickelson. Well, I was. I'm in a mental hospital now. I didn't do anything that would be considered *criminal* in the eyes of the court..just..wrong, I suppose. I'm not quite sure why I did it. I wish I never took that call. My wife won't answer my letters. I lost my position with the force. No one will even let me know what is happening with my kids. 

Wait. You're probably wondering how I got into this situation in the first place. Let's rewind.

-----

It was May 8th. I was sitting in the Root Cafe enjoying an exquisitely smooth dark roast and a bagel with the house special cream cheese. I've never known what they put in that cream cheese that makes it so damn good, but if you ever go there you'll get hooked. Anyways. I started to get a bit woozy. I hadn't eaten anything elsen that day and the coffee was *strong*. The bathroom was my fortress of nausea. That's when the call came in.

**"Attention all units we have a confirmed 10-47A with the possibility of a 10-47. Home is in the Westend neighborhood. Closest unit please respond."**

Initially, I planned to ignore it. I wasn't in a good position to take a suicide call. When you're responding to a confirmed attempt you have no idea what you'll find at the location. You also need to be sharp. If the person(s) in question haven't gone through with anything by the time you arrive, the pressure could push them to action. I wasn't in the correct state to handle that, nor to see a 10-47. My stomach wouldn't have it.

Time elapsed. No response. I was banking on there being a squad car somewhere over in that area (Westend isn't a great place) but there was silence. I responded. Chief Jacobs would tear me a new one if he knew where I was and I didn't take the call. 

Dispatch informed me that a neighbor called in the suicide attempt out of concern, stating that his neighbor was going through a divorce and hit his breaking point. At the time of the call, the neighbor barricaded his home and hasn't been heard from in almost two hours. From my few years as an officer, and my couple years as a detective I've learned that eight out of ten times that means the person in question went through with the act - now a 10-47. Protocol in these situations is to call an officer to investigate and confirm the suicide who is then supposed to call the morgue to confirm the death. So there I went.

I arrived at the house around 8:17 pm. I parked my car around the block and walked to the house. Didn't want to take the chance of a potentially suicidal person seeing a cop and pulling the trigger. I neglected to touch base with the neighbor in favor staying out of the limelight. Also, if I'm being honest, I was still a bit off from that sugar and caffeine rush from the coffee - talking to people wasn't something I wanted to force myself to deal with. 

The initial call stated that the house was "barricaded." By barricaded, the neighbor must have meant "he locked his doors" - clearly this guy was seriously worried about his suicidal neighbor. I picked the lock with ease and crept into the living room. The house was dark. A smell of pot roast permeated the air. Delicious to someone with an empty stomach like myself. To my investigative brain it meant that this man was cooking dinner recently. 

"Hello?" Echoed into the front of the house. My blood turned to liquid nitrogen. I was fully prepared to find a lifeless body. 

"Sir, this is Detective Mickelson. I'm here on a call from a concerned neighbor of yours. Mind if I speak with you in person for a moment?"

Creaking footsteps began from the ceiling above me, heading towards the stairs. They stopped. 

"Sir, could you please come downstairs for me?" 

"Oh-oh..of course officer. My apologies."

The footsteps began making their way down the stairs. It wasn't dark enough to eclipse my vision but I turned on my light in order to avoid surprises. I shined it to the stairs and saw...nothing. The footsteps were still coming down the stairs and there was no one with them. I knew I wasn't ready to take that call. Too woozy. I've never been good with coffee on an empty stomach. 

Was I freaked out? Not entirely. There was and good chance I misread where the noise was. I was also good at keeping my composure. This was a job that put me in positions to see unnatural things on a regular basis. What got to me more was when I tried a light switch and nothing followed the click. I always hated dark houses. I could feel the tips of fingers tickling the little hairs on my neck and arms when I walked through them. I called out two more times to the man I had just spoken to but I received no answers. Upstairs. As much as I hated the idea, that's where I needed to be.

About halfway up the stairs the resident "ghost" called out to me. "I've fallen in the bathroom, could you pl-please help me?" 

My tension instantly melted away. This was probably some guy who's going through rocky divorce proceedings and started drinking to cope. Not uncommon. I almost chuckled when the realization hit me, in all honesty. 

I briskly made my way up to the bathroom and just as I suspected there was a boozed-up man on the floor with his pants around his ankles. A quick glance around the room told me this guy had clearly given up on himself. The tub was full of murky water. A couple of hair appliances were tossed on the floor. Towels and clothes thrown all over. I was sympathetic for him. He thanked me for helping him up and surprisingly told me that he and his neighbor hate each other. This guy, Tom, said his neighbor probably only called to get the satisfaction of knowing he was dead. Then he asked me of I would care to stay for dinner. I politely declined although I let him know that was some of the best smelling pot roast I had ever had the pleasure of inhaling. 

He laughed at me. Full on, comedy-show laughing. 

"Officer, that's not pot roast. See that tub over there? That's beef skin soup."

I gave him a quizzical look. 

"You have to make it in big batches. Go ahead, try some!" He said as he handed me a ladle.

Now, I want to be perfectly clear here: **I only tried the soup because I was afraid of offending someone who may have been suicidal.** That's it. 

I took the ladle from Tom and grabbed a spoonful. It definitely looked like pot roast, and smelled like pot roast - just a tad on the cooler side. It. Was. Delicious. I don't know how much I had before I realized Tom was gone, but it had to have been *at least* two bowls worth. I called out for Tom but didn't hear anything back. Stupidly, I assumed he went to get us proper bowls and spoons. I continued to eat. The little bits of beef were some of the most tender pieces of meat I had ever consumed. Pure bliss, honestly. Until a couple of officers barged into the room, guns drawn, and scared the piss out of me. Apparently I was in the house for longer than I thought as the neighbor called again. 

"Easy boys. We've got a potential 10-47A. I'm trying to keep the situation lax."

"Mickelson, step away from the tub and come with us."

"Guys, trust me I-"

"*Now.*"

Confused, I went to set the ladle on the edge of the tub when I noticed a black cord hanging between the tub edge and the vanity. I motioned to the officers to hold for one second and I pulled the cord up...and came with it was a toaster...from the water - followed by a swollen, tender, decaying hand. I laughed so hard I began to cry. "Skin soup!" I shouted out between laughs.

The trial was short. Tom clearly killed himself, and there was plenty of evidence of that. My lawyer was successfully able to get all criminal charges dropped against me under the agreement that I plead insanity. Pretty much the only option after telling them my story and eating parts of a dead person. I still can't explain how I talked to Tom, and that's where you come in. I need an investigator. 

I need you to get this letter to someone who can help me. I *know* I was drugged at the Root Cafe. I do. Go there. Try the house cream cheese. You'll understand. In the meantime there's a woman, Michelle C. who knows how to find these things. She's the best in the business. I don't have her contact info...but she can fix this. On the small [sheet](http://i.imgur.com/S9v2Rlq.jpg) that's enclosed I have some places you can post/send this letter. She'll find one and contact you. Trust me.

	<TEXT> I'm *really* in the mood for Mexican food right now.

Also, I wrote something short a couple weeks ago and I can't get it out of my head. I keep getting all of these crazy ideas for content in this story and all of these other ideas. I think..I think I'm ready to make my first attempt at a longer-than-nosleep story!

I've never written anything larger than what I've posted here before, but I need to expand on this. Does anyone have any tips? 

Should I plot things like characters, locations, etc out beforehand?

I know my major plot points already as well as my conclusion. Should I outline and then fill?

I have no idea how to start this. It's going to be started, though. I just want to give it more loving than some small plotting and writing. This is a big one for me.

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Well Tammy, I have to tell you, I don't think *anyone* was expecting this out of North Korea." The male news anchor said with a mix of worry an concern in his voice. 

"You're absolutely right, Lou." Tammy agreed, while turning forward towards the camera as it panned in. "Folks, I am proud to announce to you today that Kim Jong-Un has announced his plan to save the entire planet...and it's-it's-"

"-going to work." Lou interjected. "Top scientists and government officials from around the globe have spent the day in talks with Leader Kim Jong-Un and as of this moment they are confident in going forward with his plan."

The bar was silent. Not a soul knew how to react. Was it time to celebrate? Time to be afraid? Even the cute, absent-minded server understood something big was happening. All of those years of empty threats and pointless missile tests...and now North Korea has the solution to solve the Problem. A man teetering on his stool made a joke about it being April Fool's Day while proceeding to down a shot of regrets.

"As of 5 a.m. United States Pacific time, North Korea will begin enacting it's plan." Lou was holding back a frog in his throat with utmost professionalism. "Our station will be releasing a statement later today that will include a list of items we believe will be useful to pack as a supply cache for you and your loved ones. We-"

There was no panic as the power cut out. This was their first move, and it's been used before every attack for a year. First, the power cuts out. Then, a piercing high-pitched beep would deafen all living organisms within a 400 meter radius. It closes with the smog. When the smog clears every living creature would be dead on the floor - limbs torn apart and eyes gouged out.

I remember the entire bar remained perfectly still and the patrons exchanged worried glances in a morbid unity of acceptance. I ran behind the bar immediately and used the trapdoor to get into a tight crawlspace. It was big enough for two, but the woman behind the bar was paralyzed. The beep must have begun. For the first time in my life, I was happy to be mostly deaf.

After I closed the plank over me, I began to smell the smog permeating the air above. Burnt bread. There was no sickening odor, which led some "experts" to believe the smog had no adverse affects after inhalation...and they were right. It was a cover for the creatures to come in and attack without leaving a memory in a dead persons eyes. The beep was the paralyzing factor. They didn't need anything after it.


The sad part is, you couldn't run. They were faster than humans. If you managed to avoid paralysis and ran, a group of them would surround you and maul you to shreds finer than mozzarella on an uncooked pizza. Quite a site to behold, honestly. I've seen it twice. The best thing you could do is hide and hope they couldn't find you and that the smog didn't suffocate you.

That's what I did. I made it out. I heard dozens of people screaming in agony as the creatures mutilated them in ways only seen in slasher films. The smell of metal and shit almost gagged me on my way out. Kim Jong-Un says he can stop this? Fine. Let's do it. Do it before they take over the world. We woke them up...let's put them back to sleep.

No one listened to the warnings from the top environmental scientists. Republicans said global warming and climate change were democratic propaganda. Well, here we are. The ancient creatures awoke because we fucked up and now the areas most dense in creatures are going to be demolished.

There's only one problem to his plan - the creatures are invisible. [I](https://m.facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) should say, no one has ever spotted one. The only way the world is aware they exist is from their attacks. No human can attack so quickly and so violently as these creatures do. The plan is to carpet bomb high-activity areas with nukes...and the entire world agrees with him. 

We caused this. If you're reading this, hide. Stay away from light. And goodluck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, as we all know, there have been plenty of complaints about series tagging and blah blah blah. 

[This](http://deadline.com/2016/08/viewers-wont-watch-series-unless-catch-up-past-episodes-1201797735/) is on the frontpage right now and I feel it translates very well to us here in /r/nosleep. 

In the article, it states that viewers are less likely to begin watching a series if they aren't able to access the previous episodes with ease. Logical, right? Why would you pick up Arrested Development in the middle of the second season and just go from there? You want to be able to start from the beginning and you don't want to search high and low or wait for reruns. 

Now, if you change the words **"viewers"** and **"watching"** to **"readers"** and **"reading"** respectively, we're talking about our community. 

I find this to be a good argument for making sure every part of a series is tagged and contains links to the previous entries (at the very least, the most recent entry). In my opinion, a lot of writers don't have a desire to continue a series because of the decline in interest over the course of the entries. Yea, it could be chalked up to a million other reasons. However, I feel that this shows a case can be made that a series writer will garner more interest in what they're writing if readers can easily find their way the beginning. 

I lost my train of thought.

**Tag your series and include the entries. Don't rely on the bot.** - main point </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growing up, we had a small house on the outskirts of town right against the border to the woods. Yes, border to the woods. A thirteen-foot tall fence topped with barbed wire. No one was allowed to enter the woods for fear of the ghouls. We all understood and accepted the Mayors decision. Hell, we were named the safest town in Northern Virginia year after year after year. Zero crime, zero incidents. 

Living that close to the border, I used to hear strange noises almost nightly while I laid in bed. 

There was the howling, of course. I mean, come on, they are *ghouls* after all. Sometimes I heard the screams of the fools that wanted to show off to their girlfriends and sneak past the border. Then there were the sounds of nature. Creaking, blowing, scratching. All normal life for me and my family. 

Until I heard the other noises last night.

I was laying in bed casually browsing Facebook when I heard the faint sound of scratching. Ever so light at first, but slowly gaining volume. It became closer to the sound of sandpaper rubbing on a wall. I panicked. I turned on the lights and I searched all over my room. 

Nothing.

It kept getting louder and louder, like it was inside of my own head. I wanted to rip my ears off and stuff the holes with them. I ran to my dad's room in tears, beating at my head. 

Dad, being the strong, intelligent man he was, gave me some medicine and explained what I was hearing: the bugs.

It was the Mayors plan:

- Border the woods to keep the ghouls out. 

- Offer them sacrifice to keep them from revolting.

- Plant the bugs in the head of the citizens so when they have bad thoughts, they would turn into ghouls. No bad people, no crime.

It's my turn. The bugs are awake and converting me. 

I shouldn't have been touching myself to the pictures of the Mayors daughter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's was following me for days, that man. Or woman, perhaps. He was gorgeous like a Scandinavian goddess, but put together on the frame of a male Olympic swimmer. It could be breast tissue or it could be a well-developed pectoralis major. Regardless, I would have loved to assert my dominance on him.

I first noticed him on the bench at the park. Gold hair, slightly longer than shoulder length, peeking out from the side of a black hood. That's all I noticed besides his physique. 

Then he was three lines over from me at the grocery store.

Sitting at the drive-thru ATM as I was leaving the bank.

Waiting for the bus while I was at the laundromat. 

Everywhere.

I was riding the train on my way downtown for a meeting. It was early in the morning, as I liked to avoid the the overly grumpy commuters who blamed their misery on lukewarm coffees and uncomfortable shoes. I dozed off. Something about the light vibrations of the train always made me drowzy. I woke up catching my head from making a full bob and he was sitting right next to me. This train was a abandoned aside from us and the decaying remnants of an alcoholic businessman who lost everything. He wanted my attention.

"We are who you know you want to be with." He said in a feminine voice as he slid me a piece of [paper](http://i.imgur.com/EEpKxAn.jpg).

As I analyzed the contents the man began walking away. My eyes followed, unable to get away from the temptation of that voluptuous rear.

My mind was occupied for the entire meeting. A mix of curiosity and lust kept me from functioning as a member of society. They were GPS coordinates. I understood the message. I had to meet him...to either fuck or be killed, I presumed.

Two hours past dusk, I made my way to the location the coordinates directed me to. There he was, gold hair...and everything else exposed. Bold eyes, like a sea of shit. Enticing, to the right person. A sleek, hair-free jawline and the plump, moist lips every guy wants to put his dick between. This was one hell of a manly woman, or he had a *very* good surgeon.

He didn't see me. I knew better than to jump into meeting a stalker...no matter how much I wanted him.

After a couple hours of waiting, he decided to take off. I followed. 

Following every possible cliche, he went into a small, desolate cabin surrounded by a small wooded area. Luckily, there were no blinds or curtains so I was able to keep some distance while I watched him undress...and begin masturbating. Well, watched *her.* That was my signal to enter. 

I wasted no time and spared no noise. She was shocked, naturally, when I smacked the front of her mouth with a pipe wrench. Some teeth shattered - I liked that. I grabbed her head and made her chew them, crunching like she was eating glass french fries. I don't think I ever saw a more uncomfortable look. Until I made her start touching herself again, that is. 

She wasn't as into it the second time, which disappointed me quite a bit. She needed help. I mounted her, grabbing that golden hair until I could see the red dye being applied to her roots.

"I. Don't. Like. Being. Watched." I said between thrusts. When I was done I let her go. "I'm not a killer, sweetie. I just saw something I liked and I took it."

She laid there in a brief silence with a look of contemplation on her face.

"Fuck me," she commanded, "now."

We got married not long after. Splendid private ceremony. After the "I-Do" part we made the priest eat the glass french fries too. Munching and crunching on his front teeth, the sound of chewing hard candy overtook the air by the alter. We had to kill him, though. Broken neck. Nothing crazy...we aren't killers, afterall. 

I woke up one morning years later and my wife was gone, but my old college buddy Tim was sitting on a chair in the bedroom with me.

"Bro. Bro! Holy shit man, you good?" He asked. I was groggy, but excited to see him after so long.

"Tim! How've you been? It's been years!"

"Umm. Dude. It's Tuesday. That's two days." He replied, matter-of-factly. "Fuck man, how much of that shit did you take?"

I was confused, to say the least, and couldn't respond. 

"C'mon. The acid. Tiffany's party? Stripper pole? Nothing??"

I laughed, "I've gotta tell you about that trip. *Fuck,* dude."

Tim was a fun guy, always willing to try new things. I stood up to give him a bro-hug for keeping an eye on me and slammed his face into the nightstand. A few teeth shattered, just like I expected. 

"Have you ever had glass french fries?" I asked him, as the sound of crunching teeth escaped the gap in the front of his mouth. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's my plan guys and gals.

I made a comment in passing about rewriting a story to fit nosleep, giving it the title we all hate, and it being the most successful story I've written to date. I want to see if that will actually work. 

For fun, I want someone here to name it. 

The story is about a woman forcing a man to fight a bear, which turns out to be a metaphor for his experiences in therapy for his panic disorder.

No voting or structure. I'm just going to pick the one I like best. I'm taking my dog on a walk then rewriting the story and picking a title. Hoping to get it live around 11pm eastern (US). Lets see what happens!

**Edit**

[This](https://reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/4uynur/im_a_bear_wrestler_and_this_was_my_worst_fight_yet/) is what I went with. It made the most sense to me. You guys had so many awesome ideas.

	<TEXT> So I made this post! Also, I'm curious.

What kind of challenges do you give yourself as a writer?

Do you set out to write about a certain topic every once in a while? What about doing that exercise about writing about a mundane object and making it scary? 

Personally, I like to test myself and see if I can write one story a week inspired by some simple thing I saw. For example, about a week or so ago I saw a priest walking through an airport. Priest led to religion which led to mass which led to communion. Then, [this](https://reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/4tlegc/i_hate_being_a_cannibal/) was born. 

Or today, there was a shower thought on the frontpage. I liked it. I wrote an unique little piece about it. 

In the name of **MOOCGA**, I want to challenge you to write a scary story, paragraph, sentence (or whatever!) about the 9th post that's on /r/all at the time you read this. Be sure to link it up!

Harry and Ginny had a child before Albus Severus Bumblefuck Potter. 

After that last movie, Harry needed to break away from the showbiz lifestyle...but he didn't know how. Fucking all of those bitches with different wands was a *very* niche fetish, and Ginny wasn't down. She was a freak, but she wanted the dick, not a wand - she had her own. 

Since he couldn't get his rocks off anymore, Harry developed a drinking problem. Over the course of a day he would pound back a fifth of butter beer vodka and like three or four of those little packs of Bernie Bott's Every Flavor Beans. When he was tanked, Harry would get super horny and had to have Ginny right away every time. 

Well...wizards and witches don't have birth control. I mean, yea, there were basilisk-skin condoms but they killed the sensation, man. 

Ginny realized she was pregnant when she doubled over from a piercing pain I'm her abdomen. They went to the wizard doctor and he went all "x-ray spexray spellotronus" and confirmed Ginny's fears.

At home that night, Harry was livid. He wasn't ready to have a kid yet. Especially with all the wands he had left to use. After she went to bed, Harry snuck into their bedroom ever so sneakily and snuck onto their bed, sneaking under the covers and sneakily opening her legs. 

"Accio-fetus" he whispered sneakily.

A small *pop* was heard, as the fetus sneakily made its way out of Ginny and into Harry's hand. He snuck out of the room, sneaking down the stairs and to the trashcan. 

"Maybe next time" Harry whispered sneakily. </TEXT>

The pig grunted loudly as he masturbated faster and faster. All of the horses looked on in horror, too afraid to watch yet too curious to look away. Plus, they all wanted to win the bet. 

Squeals began filling the barn as he neared ejaculation. 

Other animals from the farm began peeking in the cracks of the wood. *What was going on in there?*

Suddenly, an eruption of white, sticky webbing spread all over the stables and barn floor. 

"Ta-Da!" Charlotte yelled, standing on top of the webbing that adorned her words. 

Everyone whistled in amazement. 

"You were right, Wilbur. You *can* do magic!" A horse said, congratulating him. 

"Thanks, I think the circus will be excited to have me!" Replied Wilbur. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was a normal workday, no different than any other. Woke up at 5am, quietly, so I wouldn't wake my wife and son up...which never worked. Every morning by the time I was done showering and brushing my teeth I would be greeted by a gorgeous woman and a smiling little four year old boy holding coffee and a bagel. It was rough working that early, but my family made sure I remembered how worth it it was. I walked to the train station - cutting through the park. Hopped on the train, and went to the airport. Not to travel, though - I ran a small shop inside of it. A mediocre job at best, but the added benefit of having a train station inside of the terminal made me hate the commute to work a bit less. Train in, train out, home.

I was closing the store that day, much to my dismay because (aside from the fourteen hour day) I wouldn't be leaving work until well after dark. Now, I may be a bit of an intimidating fellow standing at 6'3" and carrying 210 lbs. of muscle and frustration, but when you have to walk through dark alleys and wooded fields alone at night it humbles you. I've done it more than enough times - it's just something that you don't become acclimated to. 

After leaving the train station that night my first hurdle was a narrow alley bordered by fencing from start to finish. The implication that escape wasn't possible was daunting in its own right, but the lighting always hurt me worse. The entire alley was lit by one light post, circa 1940, that worked only slightly better than the US political system. When the light was out, you couldn't see anything outside of an arms reach. I got lucky that night, as the light was working just fine.

After crossing the alley, it was a straight shot through the dilapidated, city-funded park. Decorated like the Berlin Wall, it has a unique artistic vibe - beautiful, in an urban kind of way. Surrounded by woods, a lot of the...less-than-desirable types tend to gather there as it's harder to see what drugs and guns they have with them. 

I walked briskly, hoping to narrate my walk with brevity. 

"Through the grass, past the trees, to the street." I whispered to myself. It was my mantra - keeping me strong in an environment home to fear. 

**Pop**

My ears ached. It sounded like a firecracker exploded on my shoulder. 

**Pop**

I fell to the grass. I swore I saw myself standing next to my pain-infected body, laughing. Like a lucid dream gone wrong. 

I heard a familiar voice whisper:

"It's *my* turn." 

That's all I remember.



When I woke up, I heard my wife and two men discussing poking at my feet with a pen. 

"Ba..babe...where's our boy?" I asked, to an eruption of excitement and tears. I couldn't see yet, but I knew her crying voice.

"You're *awake*!" She hugged me, weeping into my chest. As much as I wanted to hug her back, I couldn't. 

"Where is he? Is he okay?" I asked.

"Honey, I...you're...they said-"

"Answer me, **dammit**." 

I tried thrashing up, but to no avail. I was tied down for some reason. What *happened*?

"Calm down, Steven. We can answer all of your questions in due time. Right now we need to administer a few tests and evaluate the present options." Interjected one of the male voices. 

"Sweetheart, you were attacked two nights ago. Someone found you lying in the park..." she sobbed heavily for a moment, "you had something lodged in your back -" she couldn't finish her statement. 

"Your spine was punctured at T6. I'm sorry, you've been paralyzed." Finished the male voice. Then a door opened, filling the room with instantaneous silence.

"Hi, Dad!" 



After a couple weeks in the hospital - and some extensive training with the motorized wheel chair - I was able to go home. 

My son was only four when I was attacked and he didn't quite understand the entirety of how life was now. I was always the dad who would take him on walks to the park. I taught him how to dribble a basketball...throw a ball...ride a bike. He viewed me like I was the one of the superheroes he was so fond of. 

It always made me smile when he would randomly come up me, give me a hug, and say: "Dad, I like you. You're the best dad."

He learned to love the wheelchair rides on my lap and loved helping his mom push me when we would go out for walks. Surprisingly, he seemed to be just as happy as ever for those first few years. At night, my wife would bring him to my bed and he would hold his book while I read it to him. We made it work. Although I couldn't physically help him with things, I made damn sure I was verbally supportive and that he knew how proud I was.

As time went on and he got older things became...trying. I was no longer the "cool dad" that could take him on rides. I became the dad who couldn't play catch. The dad who couldn't show him how to play guitar. The dad who couldn't play Mario Kart. He would never admit it, but he didn't need to. I felt the resentment and the distance starting to grow. I was losing my title of "Dad" in place of the my new name: "Burden." 

I loved my wife so much throughout everything. She stayed by my side for years, keeping our family together. As our son was growing up, she kept me mentally stable, insisting it was just puberty. I knew the truth - he didn't want me. 

Eventually, she had to hire an aide to come in daily and help her with the more physical tasks. I couldn't blame her, honestly. Our son wanted nothing to do with me. Anytime my wife asked him for help he would meltdown, reminding both of us - very audibly - that I wasn't a real dad to him and that I should "just die already." Tommy, however, was a great aide. 28. Good shape. Kind of resembled a younger me at times from what I could see. Tommy and I have never made eye contact...he always makes sure to keep his eyes diverted and his face partially obscured. But he definitely made the physical tasks my wife could no longer handle easier.

Bathroom. Bedroom. Stairs. Car. Orgasms. Tommy made sure she never had issues because of me. 

I wanted to be angry. I wanted to get up and cut off his fingers one-by-one for touching my wife...but what position was I in to place blame? Even on good days the best I could do was slightly squeeze my wife's hand. 

Besides, they had a strong bond like my wife and I used to have before the accident. She began laughing and smiling again. Her makeup came back and her hair fixed itself overnight. He swooned her using a lot of the same moves I used on her back in the day. We must have learned from the same people. I understood why we never exchanged eyes.

It was hard not to be jealous at times. But dammit, she still stayed. I'll love her forever for that.



A few nights ago, someone broke into the house. I was alone. My wife and Tommy went to get some groceries (their code for sex, we didn't eat *that* much) and left me to sleep on my inclined bed. Usually, this meant Tommy and my wife would go make love, then he would head to work and she would come home a bit later with things we didn't need.

I heard the small window on the back door shatter and the cracking of the hinges as it was opened. 

Brisk steps. The dual clacking of a heeled boot made its way through the house, straight to the front of the bedroom door. 

"Steven, it's time." A familiar voice stated. "This entire plan has been drawn out for years longer than it should have. Did you know you were supposed to die that night?"

I remained silent. Not out of fear, but perplexity. I *knew* that voice. It was familiar to me...but how? I wanted to place a face to the name but he remained outside of the door.

"You know, you were lucky to pass out that night in the park. It's the only thing that saved you. If you would have fully seen me, there's no doubt you would have died on the spot." He continued, lightly stroking the door with his fingernails.

"I'm going to give you a few days, Steven. Go ahead and get your affairs in order. Tell your wife how much of a slut you think she is. Tell your son how you hate him. Do what you want. Do what makes you feel good so you can die happy...I can fix your damage."

The man pushed the door open slightly, sticking his arm through the gap and giving the thumbs-up. 

"Same time next week?" 

With that, he left.



It's been five days now. 

I took the man's advice after some internal debate. He was right. Once I figured out who he was I realized it didn't matter what I did to them this past week - all would be forgotten. He really *could* fix the damage I created. 

I had my wife call my son first, since he was away at college. Unsurprisingly, he didn't want to talk to me. Ever since he left the house he's been a memory.

I looked my wife in the eyes before she left my room last night and called her a whore. There was no need for elegance or explanation. No conversation. We both knew the "what" and the "why."

Tommy, I like him. He's a good guy just trying to get by in life. I don't blame him for anything he's done and I feel he deserves a bit of thanks for typing this for me, and for being my confidant. Tommy here is the only one who knows the identity of the man and his ultimate plan.

They're going to call it a miracle, you know. Probably credit the experimental drugs I've been taking for a few months now. How else can you explain a quadriplegic gaining full mobility again? Unfortunately, the truth is less spectacular. 

The man who came to me almost a week ago. The one who tried to kill me in the past. Who's responsible for years and years of mental torment...is *me*.

Well, sort of. He's been wearing a disguise this entire time. Hiding. Waiting. [I](https://m.facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) knew Tommy had a trick up his sleeve...he's me - my doppelganger. 

In two days I'll be gone, and it will be his turn. </TEXT>

First draft. I'm leaving out a lot of detailing to keep my point concise.

----

It was a normal workday, no different than any other. Woke up at 5am, walked to the train station - cutting through the park, hopped on, and went to the airport. Not to travel, though - I run a small shop inside of it. A fun job, with the added benefit of having a train station inside of the terminal making my commute to work awesomely easy. Train in, train out. 

I was closing the store that day, much to my dismay because I wouldn't be leaving work until well after dark. Now, I may be a bit of an intimidating fellow standing at 6'3" and carrying 210 lbs. of muscle and frustration, but when you have to walk through dark alleys and wooded fields alone at night it humbles you. I've done it more than enough times too - it's just something that you don't become acclimated to.

The implication that escape wasn't possible was daunting in its own right, but the lighting always hurt me worse. The entire alley was lit by one light post, circa 1940, that worked only slightly better than the US political system. When the light was out, you couldn't see anything outside of an arms reach. I got lucky that night, as the light was working just fine.

After crossing the alley, it was a straight shot through the dilapidated, city-funded park. Decorated like the Berlin Wall, it has a unique artistic vibe - beautiful, in an urban kind of way. Surrounded by woods, a lot of the...less-than-desirable types tend to gather there as it's harder to see what drugs and guns they have with them. 

I walked briskly, hoping to narrate my walk with brevity. 

"Through the grass, past the trees, to the street." I whispered to myself. It was my mantra - keeping me strong in an environment home to fear. 

*Pop*

My ears ached. It sounded like a firecracker exploded on my shoulder. 

*Pop*

That's all I remember. 

----

When I woke up, I heard my wife and two men discussing poking at my feet with a pen. 

"Ba..babe...where's my boy?" I asked, to an eruption of excitement and tears. I couldn't see yet, but I knew her crying voice.

"You're *awake*!" She hugged me, weeping into my chest. As much as I wanted to hug her back, I couldn't. 

"Where is he? Is he okay?"

"Honey, I...you're...they said-"

"Answer me, **dammit.**" 

I tried thrashing up, but to no avail. I was tied down for some reason. What *happened?*

"Calm down, Steven. We can answer all of your questions in due time. Right now we need to administer a few tests and evaluate the present options." Interjected one of the male voices. 

"Sweetheart, you were attacked two nights ago. Someone found you lying in the park..." she sobbed heavily for a moment, "you had something lodged in your back -" she couldn't finish her statement. 

"Your spine was punctured at T6. I'm sorry, you've been paralyzed." Finished the male voice. Then a door opened, filling the room with an immediate silence.

"Hi, Dad!" 

----

After a couple weeks in the hospital - and some extensive training with the motorized wheel chair - I was able to go home. 

My son was only four when I was attacked and he didn't quite understand the entirety of how life was now. He loved the wheelchair rides on my lap and loved helping his mom push me when we would go out for walks. Surprisingly, he seemed to be just as happy as ever. At night, my wife would bring him to my bed and he would hold his book while I read it to him. We made it work.

As he got older things became...trying. I was no longer the "cool dad" that could take him on rides. I became the dad who couldn't play catch. Or the dad who couldn't show him how to play guitar. The dad who couldn't play Mario Kart. He wouldn't admit it, but he didn't need to. I felt the resentment and the distance starting to grow. I was losing my title of "Dad" in place of the my new name: "Burden."

I loved my wife so much throughout everything. She stayed by my side for years, keeping our family together. Eventually, she had to hire a nurse to come in daily and help her with the more physical tasks. I couldn't blame her, honestly. Our son wanted nothing to do with me. Anytime my wife asked him for help he would meltdown, reminding both of us - very audibly - that I wasn't a real dad to him and that I should "just die already." Tommy was great. 28. Good shape. Definitely made for the physical tasks my wife could no longer handle. 

Bathroom. Bedroom. Stairs. Car. Orgasms. Tommy made sure she never had issues because of me. 

I wanted to be angry. I wanted to get up and cut off his fingers one-by-one for touching my wife...but what position was I in to place blame? Even on good days the best I could do was slightly squeeze my wife's hand.

But dammit, she stayed. I'll love her forever for that.

----

A few nights ago, someone broke into the house. I was alone. My wife and Tommy went to get some groceries (their code for sex, we didn't eat *that* much) and left me to sleep on my inclined bed. I heard the small window on the back door shatter and the cracking of the hinges as it was opened. 

Brisk steps. The dual clacking of a heeled boot made its way through the house, straight to the front of the bedroom door. 

"Steven, it's time." A familiar voice stated. "This wasn't supposed to happen. The entire plan has been drawn out for years longer than it should have. Did you know you were supposed to die that night?"

I remained silent. Not out of fear, but perplexity. I *knew* that voice. I wanted to place a face to the name but he remained outside of the door.

"You know, you were lucky to pass out that night in the park. It's the only thing that saved you. If you would have seen me, there's no doubt you would have died on the spot." He continued, lightly stroking the door with his fingernails.

"I'm going to give you a few days, Steven. Go ahead and get your affairs in order. Tell your wife how much of a slut you think she is. Tell your son how you hate him. Do what you want. Do what makes you feel good so you can die happy...I can fix your damage."

The man pushed the door open slightly, sticking his arm through the gap and giving the thumbs-up. 

"Same time next week?" 

With that, he left.

-----

It's been five days now. 

I took the man's advice after some internal debate. He was right. Once I figured out who he was I realized it didn't matter what I did to them this past week - all would be forgotten. He really *could* fix the damage I created. 

I had my wife call my son first, since he was away at college. Unsurprisingly, he didn't want to talk to me. Ever since he left the house he's been a memory.

I looked my wife in the eyes before she left my room last night and called her a whore. There was no need for explanation. No conversation. We both knew the "what" and the "why."

Tommy, I like him. He's a good guy just trying to get by in life. I don't blame him for anything he's done and I feel he deserves a bit of thanks for typing this for me, and for being my confidant. Tommy here is the only one who knows the identity of the man and his ultimate plan.

They're going to call it a miracle. They'll probably credit the experimental drugs I've been taking for a few months now. How else can you explain a quadriplegic gaining full mobility again? Unfortunately, the truth is less spectacular. 

The man who came to me almost a week ago. The one who tried to kill me in the past. Who's responsible for years and years of mental torment...is me.

In two days I'll meet him face-to-face, and he can take over. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My girlfriend just bought her first house and we're currently in the process is fixing it all up and making the adjustments she wants. Right now, we're on the bathroom. I don't have pictures at the moment, but all of the walls are half ceramic tile, half painted plasterboard. 

What she wants to do is just remove the tile portions, and replace it with drywall/plasterboard to match it to the remaining walls. Is there any legitimate concern with doing this aside from aesthetics? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It started with the gunshots. Seven clear *bangs* cracking the air. Some looked confused, unsure of what to do. They probably never experienced anything like this before. Others were afraid. Fathers ran for their children while they cried out in fear.

The sirens came next. It sounded like an entire fleet was coming to the rescue, armed to the hairline in tactical gear...hopefully. The response time was surprisingly fast for a *random* shooting. 

Finally, the screaming. 

**"My baby! You shot my baby!"**

Everyone looked around. Despite the circumstances, despite their differences, everyone was willing to be a hero that day.

Then it came again.

**"My baby! You shot my baby!"**

In the same tone. No one could see a person downed, covered in blood...nor a woman weeping over her child. 

**"My baby! You shot my baby!"**

That's when I realized the screams were coming from the trees by the jungle gym. I ran to the first tree and gave it the strongest shaking I could muster...and all the crows went flying out.

"These birds have seen some things." I muttered. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The body was torn apart. Small fragments of its former self that were much easier to consume. It was a slight inconvenience but the concern of a choking hazard was greater than the preference of a few other cannibals. Traditionally, however, the body would be consumed in small, whole pieces - no bones. 

Every last drop of blood was also drained from the body to be used as a liquid sustenance. The ones in charge told us that this was needed to become one with "Him." I never agreed with it. The idea of eating body parts and drinking blood disgusted me every time. 

It was a Wednesday. As we began to line up for our meal, the doubt in this practice overtook me. When it was my turn I spit in the face of the old man, and walked away. Before I opened the doors to the freedom awaiting me I audibly informed the group that they were "filthy cannibals."

I haven't been to church since. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It was the start of lunch and Norman had finally decided to try the Mexican restaurant around the corner from his office. Norman was unusually excited for he had put off trying it for seven months, in favor of his turkey sandwich and crackers. 

He ordered a set of three tacos with just beef, light lettuce, and light cheese. Instead, Norman received three tacos with beef, lettuce, light cheese, and raw onion. Feeling adventurous, Norman ate one - saving one for Norman and one for a snack later. 

A couple hours after returning to work, Norman felt a small pressure build up in his stomach...the onions. Onions never sat well with Norman, and now he needed to use the facilities. Upset, Norman returned to the Mexican restaurant and asked to speak in private with the cook. Palms sweating, unsure of what to say, Norman took the cook into the back of the restaurant and smashed his head into the side of the building. 

"Please don't put onions on my food. They never sit well in my stomach." Said Norman as he walked away, eager to tell Norman about how he stuck up for himself. 


"Maybe I'll stick with the turkey a little longer." He said, as he walked back to his office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there!

You might be wondering what to expect here, or why this subreddit exists. To put it simply, I love the stories at /r/lifeofnorman but in that sub they're limited to keeping things fairly "PG." 

Personally, everything about Norman makes me think that he would have some insanely sinister secrets to hide in his unremarkable life. Also, this serves as a writing test in a way. To come up with a scary/dark story under 500 words and written in one specific style is definitely a challenge - one I intend to meet multiple times a week.

That's it. Have fun and enjoy!

	<TEXT> The phone call came slightly after 11p.m.

"Mikey, the gate to your store is open. We have a cop watching it now but you'll need to come in to secure the store and close it."

*Fuck.*

My little Hyundai was in disrepair, causing me to have to take the train to work. Luckily, the stop wasn't too far from my house and I could get there in about five minutes if I walked through the park. 

Phone? *Check.*

Headphones? *Check.*

Wallet? *Check.*

Keys? *Check.*

Off I went, fixing one of my employees mistakes again. The streets were quiet less the sounds of two cats either fighting or fucking...or both. It's funny how much humans and animals are alike. 

There was an older man, no more than six foot, sitting on the slide at the park. His features were masked by darkness except for the small ray of light illuminating his tired, emaciated mug. He was transfixed on one spot. Watching. Waiting. *Protecting.*

As I passed through the park, a child - no older than twelve - ran up to the playground overjoyed when he should have been exhausted. 

"This **my** gym you asshole!" The man belted out as he charged towards the kid, stopping seconds before he went out of range. The child ran away in tears, yelling for his grandma. The man stumbled back to the slide, ready to defend again, in the name of valor. </TEXT>

"Norman, do you remember where I put the paper towels?" asked Norman.

Norman sat on the cushion of the kitchen chair, watching Norman as he began to sweat lightly. 

"Of course you don't." said Norman, chuckling to himself for expecting a response from a cat. 

Norman always bought his paper towels in bulk because it saved him $0.19 per roll. Sadly, Norman hadn't made it to the store yesterday since he was waiting to let the gas man inside to read the meters. The gas man never came, which made Norman unusually peeved - Norman missed the last day of the sale on cat food, and his coupon for paper towels expired. 

The gas man came to Norman's house a few hours ago. Norman welcomed him inside with a smile and an offer of cold tap water with three cubes of ice. As the gas man was enjoying his beverage, Norman stabbed him with an ice pick five times - one for each hour he had to wait. Blood spilled all over the white tiles of the kitchen floor...and Norman didn't have enough paper towels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My house was freezing. I accidentally turned the air conditioning on too low before leaving that day, worried my dog would overheat. There was no way I was getting comfortable without my blanket. 

Curled up on the sofa under my smooth, warm blanket I turned on the news - I wanted to catch up after a long day of work. My dog jumped up to cuddle, but I had to put her down because she always chews on the blanket. I've had to sew so many new parts onto it because of that damn dog. 

*"A breaking story out of Cleveland Heights this evening. Another man was found dead inside of an abandoned home. Twenty-eight year old Jason..."*

I clicked off the news. All they talked about these days was the "serial killer" running around on the east side of town. I get it, I guess. The killer always skins their torsos and dumps the bodies in old crack houses - it's an interesting story!

But they keep assuming different motives for the killings: drugs, gang violence, etc. Honestly, I just need new parts to fix my blanket when the dog ruins it. </TEXT>

As she was counting out the money I couldn't help but feel like everyone was staring in my direction. They all had these judgemental eyes, insinuating I was doing something wrong. I didn't have a choice! I needed this money right then and there. All of them could leave soon and buy their groceries and go home to families. I couldn't. This was it for me. 

"$12,408, sir. All in small bills, like you asked." 

I begrudgingly grabbed the money then stood there for a moment while the man behind me sifted through the bag.

	<TEXT> "Michael, I'm going to pull back the curtain and when I do, I want you to look out of the window, down to the pavement." She informed me, sternly. We had a good relationship, even though it was apparent she was starting to become annoyed by my cowardice. "You need to stick your head outside and look down. That's all you have to do. I'll be holding onto you so you won't have to worry about falling." 

I understood. She wasted no time grabbing the drawstrings and tugging the curtain to the side. This was it. The window was five feet away. All I had to do was stick my head out and look down. That's all. My chest puffed out a few times, I took my first steps and stopped. I could have sworn the sprinklers went off in the building because of the heat, but I was the only one getting soaked. I took a few more steps, almost getting knocked over by a sudden series of shakes in the ground, making my knees wobble. 

I made it to the window. 

"Look out, Mikey," she said with an affectionate smile while placing her hand on the middle of my shoulder blades.

"Are you sure it's not raining in here?" I jokingly responded. I had water dripping down from my jawline, onto to the windowsill. Knowing I couldn't turn back, I stuck my head out of the window.

**"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!"**I shouted, forcefully retreating into the office. **"ARE YOU A PSYCHOPATH?"**

"Michael," she sighed, "that is the Bear. We've talked about this so many times." She rubbed the bridge of her nose. I knew she wanted to be done with me, but I just couldn't do it.

"You have three options. One, you can fight back and kill the Bear. Two, you can let the Bear come in and kill you. Three, you can run as far away as possible and try to hide from it. What are you going to do?"

"Fuck, man." Slid out of my mouth, as did some spit. My insides ached. Everything in my body was shutting down, preparing to just lay there and die.

"Fight. Or. Die." She was cold now. "The Bear is here. You need to decide."

**"JUST MAKE IT STOP!"** 

My head collapsed into my hands. I was wheezing - unable to get the air out anymore. I knew I was helpless. This was it for me. The Bear was going to beat me this time.

She sighed, "Okay, we're done here for today. Next week, same time. For now, here's the refill for the Xanax. One milligram - we aren't going up any higher." </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How I Quit Smoking </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-02 17:34:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Quitting, for me, wasn't about health benefits - quitting was solely about the money. Working at minimum wage wasn't enough to support my habits. I had bills to pay, a dog to feed...a life to live. 

None of the methods I found online worked. Meditation helped a bit, but before long I would get frustrated, persuading me to light up. Oddly enough, my job was the one place that had a helpful solution - a 24/7 quit hotline. 

The hotline was beyond fantastic. Greg, my personal "Quit Coach," was the only person who didn't give up on me. He even offered me my saving grace - sucking on hard candy. When I had the urge to smoke I would pop in a Jolly Rancher and the urge would disappear! A+ job, Greg. 

Until one day, at work.

My company was receiving double the amount of freight, and the stress was unforgiving. I had Jolly Rancher after Jolly Rancher. This was my test. Was I really going to quit?

In the middle of unloading, I ran out. I reached into my pocket and...nothing. That realization was enough to break me on its own, but I was determined to hold strong. Just an hour. An hour until we finished and I could go buy a bag. One hour. I felt my blood pressure spiking. I was tense. I began slamming boxes. My clenched jaw grinding my teeth. Brow crushed by gravity. 

*Cruunnncchhhh*

I almost fell to the ground from the pain, but I couldn't give in. I knew if I stopped that was it. A disgusting, metallic taste engulfed my mouth and I felt the sharp edges rolling around my mouth. I broke a tooth. My mind wasn't going to break, though. I could have been stabbed and I would have kept working just to avoid smoking. I kept my mouth shut and the broken tooth inside...kind of like...hard candy. 

I rolled the tooth around my mouth a bit, sucking on it - and my irritation...subsided. I became less tense. Less stressed. It was...therapeutic. 

I can't exactly say when the transition occurred. All the years of smoking left me with weak teeth, making it easy to break pieces off. Plus, on top of saving money on meth, I didn't have to buy Jolly Ranchers either!

I hid my new technique from Greg for a couple of months. I told him one day, though, when I ran out of teeth. He held his composer like a true professional. He told me he was sending someone to my house to help me. I love that man. 

Ms. Angela Craymoor came to my apartment to talk in a "comfortable setting." Part of her methodology, I guess. The problem is, you can't trust an addict to make rational decisions. I knocked her out. One by one, I extracted her aging, slightly yellow teeth and put them in a [jar](http://i.imgur.com/2FC1Tba.jpg). I called a friend, who took her away. Deed done, hands clean...well, slightly bloody. 

I haven't smoked in years. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I had only been doing it for three years, but addiction builds up incredibly fast. After roughly eight months I was going through a full bag every two days! Now, I preferred the elegance of using a pipe, which uses a bit less than other methods, but if you've ever smoked, you know that's an absolutely insane amount of product to go through that fast. My wallet, that darling, loyal friend of mine, shot itself and left a big hole where all of my money would keep pouring out. It couldn't handle the stress my newfound hobby caused. 

Quitting, for me, wasn't about health benefits - quitting was solely about the money. Working a job that paid me four dollars over minimum wage still wasn't enough to support my habits. I had bills to pay, a dog to feed...a life to live. Smoking needed to stop holding me back.

None of the methods I found online worked. Keeping my hands busy? No. Gum? Nope. Cold turkey? Ha! Nada. Meditation helped a bit, but it would never be long before I would start shaking and become angry, persuading me to light one up. My job, oddly enough, was the one place that had a helpful solution - a 24/7 quit hotline. 

The hotline was beyond fantastic for me. Greg, my personal "Quit Coach," was the most inspiring person I've ever met and, as much as I hate to admit it, was the only person who didn't give up on me. He was always available when I needed him - even those late nights when I couldn't sleep and wanted to give in. 

After a couple failed attempts with other techniques, Greg offered me my saving grace - sucking on hard candy. At first I was a bit skeptical. Let's be honest here, if none of the "official" methods worked, why would that? Well, I was proven wrong rather quickly. Every time I had the urge to smoke I would pop in a Jolly Rancher and the urge would disappear! A+ job, Greg. 

This worked out great for me until one particularly bad day at work.

My company was receiving double the amount of freight that day because of an upcoming holiday, and I was the one in charge of the unloading process. The pressure was rapidly building up inside of me, almost to the point where I couldn't see clearly. Jolly Rancher after Jolly Rancher after Jolly Rancher. This was my test. Was I really going to quit or was I going back to the first square? 

Then I ran out. Right there, in the middle of unloading the truck. I went to reach in my pocket and there was just a box cutter. That realization could have been enough to break me on its own, but I was determined to hold strong - I couldn't let Greg down. Just an hour. Just an hour until the truck would be unloaded and I could go buy a new bag. One hour. I felt my blood pressure spiking. I was tense. I began grabbing boxes harder and slamming them. My teeth were grinding inside of my clenched jaw. My brow getting crushed by gravity. 

Cruunnncchhhh

I almost fell to the ground from the burst of pain in my head, but I had to keep working. I couldn't give in. I wouldn't quit quitting. I knew if I stopped that was it. A disgusting, almost metallic taste engulfed my mouth - blood. Right after that set in I felt the sharp edges rolling around in my mouth. I broke a tooth. My mind wasn't going to break, though. I could have been stabbed and I probably would have kept working just to avoid the opportunity to smoke. So I just kept my mouth shut and the broken tooth inside of it...kind of like...hard candy. 

I began rolling the tooth around my mouth a bit, occasionally sucking on it. What else was I supposed to do? I couldn't swallow the damn thing! Not even ten minutes of doing this and my irritation started to subside. I became less tense. Less stressed. Furthering myself from the inevitable aneurysm. It was...therapeutic. 

I can't exactly say when the transition occurred. All the years of smoking left me with weak teeth, making it easy to grind them together and break a piece off. Plus, on top of saving the money on meth, I didn't have to waste anymore on Jolly Ranchers either!

I hid my new technique from Greg for a couple of months. Can you blame me? Slowly losing your teeth sucks away your sense of confidence. I told him one day, though, because I...well...I ran out of teeth. I didn't know what else to do. Greg, that saint, he held his composer like a true professional. He told me he was sending someone to my house to meet with me and get me the help I needed. I love that man.

She came to my apartment to talk me through my troubles in a "comfortable setting" for me. Part of her methodology, I guess.

	<TEXT> I've always been a family-first type of guy, providing for others and ensuring they were taken care of before myself. Not just my family, though. I take care of my friends and other people who have been good to me - like Alex. 

Alex was the first person I met here who was genuinely nice to me. He explained how everything worked and even took time to show me around and introduce me to the higher-ups. Alex was a real class-act. In return, I made sure he got that vacation he requested...and a little raise (the kid needed it). Alex and I, we had a good friendship and if the circumstances were different I would have considered him family.

Until last week.

I had one last request: a box of Malley's Chocolates, from Cleveland. That's it. Alex was in charge of fulfilling my request, which was easy given its only about two hours from here in Clairsville. Piece of cake, right?

Let me tell you about what this fuckin' kid did.

Alex shows up about twenty minutes late - well past the end of dinner - with the slightly damaged box of chocolates. One request, and he couldn't even keep the box from getting ripped open. Lucky for him, I had no choice but to let it go. So I open up this box of chocolates and what do I see? One missing. That son-of-bitch. Still, I was at the point of no return...I bit my tongue for the first time in my life.

Now, I may be old but I'll tell ya I'm as sharp as ever. I decided to have Alex eat some of the chocolates with me. After all, the kid and I have been so close for all these years - it was only appropriate we enjoyed a final dessert together. At first Alex declined but I quickly reminded him it was either dessert with me now, or dessert with Ricky later. He knew his odds. Alex had a couple of pieces, but I decided to pass. Lost my appetite after all that prior bullshit.

Later that night, Alex came and got me and we took our long-awaited walk. It was unfortunately silent. I was hoping to impart some wisdom on the kid but he didn't seem to want to talk now. We got down to the room and I laid down on the table without any fight or resistance. I knew my odds. But before they could get me strapped down, Alex collapsed. 

We had to postpone. He was the only person there licensed to perform lethal injections. Something about poisoning or some shit. Beats the hell outta me!

It works out though. The feds are investigating everything surrounding Alex's death...including me, and that's buying me at least another few months. Maybe the next guard will be smarter about getting me my damn chocolates. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I Collect Mugs </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-28 15:20:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Connoisseur. 

Why, yes. I would say that the term fits me quite well, wouldn't you say so? Ha! Forgive me. You wouldn't know of my collection yet. I haven't told you!

You see, I collect something that your average layperson wouldn't understand. The general population doesn't share in the refined tastes that some of us fellows living in the penthouses of Manhattan do (let's not discuss the erratic tendencies of those "Bay Area" disappointments, hmm?). I collect mugs. I collect mugs from all over these great States of a multitude of shapes, sizes, and designs. At the time of this writing I would say my collection consists of approximately seventeen aboriginal pieces. Yes, seventeen now that I dwell on it. It would be eighteen, however one of the earlier pieces in my collection was unknowingly knocked off the mantle by Greta, my maid, and destroyed by that damn hound. Greta, being the sweet, sweet woman that she was, willingly donated her own mug to replace the one she had let be defiled.

Ahh, Greta. A saint if there ever was one, truly.

I fondly recall the very first mug I received. She was a big, black beauty that caught my eyes in the city of Grand Rapids, Michigan  (lovely city, should you ever desire to travel). I first saw her at Founders Brewery on the second to last day of my travels there. Carved by the hands of Aphrodite, she was darker than the night, with the smoothest complexion a man could hope for. This mug had to be no more than twenty-one, and even with that had aged like a bottle of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti. 

I had offered a price for her that was more than her yearly salary, but she quite audibly declined my generosity, the bitch (apologies for the language). I hastily made my exit and I decided that, offer be damned, I was going to have her for the start of my collection. I phoned Steven, my concierge, and informed him of my intentions and the compensation he would receive for starting my collection - to which he joyously obliged. 

Not soon after the brewery shut down for the evening, Steven kidnapped her as she was waiting for the bus in a (fortunately) dimly-lit area. Steven, in his words: "shoved that stupid whore into the backseat and bled her like a fountain pen." Good ol' reliable Steven. Although I had to reprimand him on his language, I was more than exhilarated at his success. 

Steven brought the body to the temporary facility not soon after 3 a.m. and we went to work. 

Now, as a gentleman, I refuse to explore the details of what removing a person's face entails. What I will inform you of, however, is that the process of preserving the mugs is of utmost importance. If one little piece of flesh is left unconditioned the rot will begin to set in rather quickly and will overtake the rest of the mug like a mold. Luckily, Steven, Greta, and I perfected the process around the third or fourth piece in the collection. 

Sadly, I must beg your leave now. My business is taking me to Newark on a meeting of taxes. To say this is entirely a business trip, well...I will just say that the man I will be enjoying dinner with tonight could have had a lucrative career in modelling as opposed to his life as an accountant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wanted to bust out a shorter story for a concept I've been sitting on for a while but, long story short (ha!), I went in an entirely different direction with it. I decided to just write some weird, crazy nsfw-style piece.

I used a throwaway because I really wasn't confident with it but it's gotten some really fun comments and now I'd like to see if anyone can give me a critique of it.

	<TITLE> I Dig My Own Holes </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-22 14:54:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thump. 

That's the noise, alright. I used to think it was sort of a squishy thud, but after throwing so many into the holes I've realized it's a very clear thump.

Thump. Thump. Thump.

Every. Time.

In my profession, you have to do all of the work yourself. Countless hours of manual labor aging your body a year at a time and the psychological stress almost makes it not worth it. But nothing can stop me.

First, you have to secure the body - a feat that is difficult in its own right, given the state of the world today. Once you have that you're immediately tasked with securing it in order to keep it in tact...a broken body is no good to the holes. Transportation is a bitch too, depending on the type of body. Some might need to be kept chilled in order to make it to their final destination, some need to be bound tightly down to a flat surface to avoid movement. You also have to deal with loading and unloading one-hundred plus pounds alone, which, to be honest, sucks.

At the destination you could say things become a bit easier. The body is unloaded and generally any materials keeping the body intact can be removed (wrappings, ropes, etc.). Occasionally, you have to trim some of the limbs off in order to save space (it tends to get cramped now with so many bodies in a small space), and that can get messy depending on their thickness, but it's usually not a hard job. 

The only pain here is the digging of the hole. I don't have the sophisticated tools that some of my peers do - I'm all about shovels. They leave less of a trace. The depth of the hole can vary wildly based on what the age of the body is. The young ones typically only need shallow holes and the older ones need larger, deeper holes. Common sense, really. 

The young ones, though. They really get to me. I can't help but get emotional every time I put one into its hole. Thoughts about how they got here, what happened to them before, their futures...it's just...a lot. I know that they're serving a greater purpose now. I get that. But I wish they were able to stay at home in their natural state where they belong. Instead, I go and take them away and bring them to my land - acres and acres of other holes, filled with trees - hoping I can make a difference. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I really love this story. I'm proud of it and it's gotten really good feedback from people I've shown it to (excluding reddit, but that's not important to me).

However, one continuous comment is about the ending being confusing. 

My initial idea was to reveal that the narrator was stalking his fiancee before they ever started dating. That changed into me wanting to make it more vague and leave it to reader interpretation. Somewhere between those two I muddied it up and now it's missed it's punch. 

What could I have done to make it more clear in either direction?

	<TITLE> She Has to Know </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-06-15 23:10:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For four long, long years love has suffocated the air. Two people, brought together by fate and stuck together by pure, raw obsession. This isn't love - no - this is greater. The gods themselves worked in unison to flap the butterfly's wings at all of the right moments. This is perfection.

No details have been spared to plan the future here. "A wedding fit for royalty" has been the only analogy made that can be accepted and honestly, it's true - Royal Family be damned. This is going to be an event of legend that generations upon generations will share with their kin in an undying tale of true love and devotion. Hollywood producers will kill each other to get their hands on this script.

Which is why she has to know before it happens.

"Mike, you'll never let go of the one you let slip through your fingers," my Grandpa always told me. Gramps might have been a bit of an ass most of the time, but I would be boldly lying if I said he didn't nail how much I wouldn't be willing to let go.

For years before my fiancee and I began dating I had an...obsession. Her name was Mary, and she was mine.

Attempting to describe her would be an injustice. Mary is that feeling you get when you finally sit down after a long, hard day of working. She is the whiff of a smell that takes you back to your childhood. A morning stretch after a night of long overdue sleep in your own bed. Mary is perfection.

We met during our senior year of high school on a Tuesday (March 11th, to be exact). Roughly ten minutes before the end of my French class, the familiar yet deafening drone of the fire alarm began to yell. As us students were trained to do, we briskly skipped out of the classroom door into the hallway, heading towards our momentary reprieve from educational slavery - the outdoors. Only one thing stood in the way...Mary.

Some might say that handing out fliers for the next school play during a fire drill would be ill-advised, but Mary was a go-getter. As the stream of students flowed past her I couldn't help but stand there, frozen in awe.

"Hi! My name's Mary, I'm the president of the drama club. We're putting on a *super* exciting play about the struggles of students during finals. You should come! I'd love to see you there!"

"Hi...umm..yeah, absolutely. I'll go." I said as I took a flier.

She shot me a wink and we both went on our separate paths.

The remainder of that day was spent preparing to sit in a stiff wooden chair for two hours next to classmates who didn't care to be there and parents who would have no choice. Excitement would have been an interesting lie, but for the opportunity to see Mary again, I was willing to do anything.

"How do I dress?"

"Should I bring flowers?"

Showtime came and went quicker than the balding gentleman next to me fell asleep. Now, most guys would tell a tale of how they found her backstage after the performance and performed a grandiose gesture of romanticism to woo her off of her feet and into their arms. Me? I stood outside of the auditorium hoping to run into her when she was leaving for the night. It was a fairly nice night for waiting - cool air, a few clouds playing hide and seek with the new moon, crickets in the bushes - and I was determined to have my time with Mary.

Years began to pass.

"Do you think she'll even be coming out this way?" I asked, starting to question my plan. "I mean, this is really the only way to get anywhere from the school."

Mr. Cricket didn't seem to have any advice, and decided to bounce off for a more entertaining venture.

However, not long after my company departed, I heard a metal clanging that bribed my attention - the auditorium doors! The dormant volcano of excitement erupted. I leapt to my feet and created a twister from the speed I turned with. As my eyes caught up with the rest of my body I saw her...beauty incarnate...kissing Tyler from my choir class. My feet, they gained their own heartbeat.

I turned back immediately. The blinds on the windows needed to be pulled down to keep this betrayal out of sight. My soul ached. My heart found a new home. My stomach ate itself in desperation. Still, I stood there like a fleshy statue of the anguish I had become consumed by.

"Hey! You're the kid from the fire drill, right?"

She noticed me.

"Hey, thanks for coming! It really means a lot to us that our fellow students support us. Are you...waiting on someone?"

I turned to her. She was alone now, and glowing with excitement. Tyler must have walked off.

"Ohh, me? Yeah, I'm just waiting on my friend to come out."

"Well, be careful. You never know who's lurking out here at night. I was walking home one day and I *swear* someone was following me. Anyways. I'll see ya around!"

On that note she began walking away, heading down the street past the cemetery. Something clicked in that moment, though. The adrenal glands began pumping harder than ever. I knew I had to let her know how I felt, boyfriend be damned. It was now or never and my body was practically forcing me away from that bear waiting to eat me.

I started walking to catch up with her, keeping my distance to allow my brain to formulate exactly what I would say.

Left on Pearl. Straight for a few moments. Left on Gifford. She was closer to the school than I thought. Seven houses down she walked up a driveway and into a modest blue house. My damn brain had taken too long to organize itself! All the while, without realizing it, my gait had slowed to nothing more than a geriatric patient's.

**Damn.**

The next couple of days were a blur. School. Home. Mary. Food. Mary. Sleep. School. Mary. Home. Food. Mary. Mary. *Mary.*

She was the only thing I knew now. My obsession. I *had* to have her.

Well, with motivation, anything is possible.

It wasn't meant to become a regular routine. The idea was that she would notice me often and eventually begin striking up conversations because of the coincidences.

"Oh hey, how crazy! I just saw you at the grocery store yesterday! How did that lasagna turn out? I bet your mom loved it."

"Where ya off to? The bus is such a great way to get around Cleveland. Great for the environment, too."

"No way! You like Pixar movies too?! My favorite is Monsters Inc., what about yours?"

Every scene was scripted perfectly, ready to play out at any given moment. All I had to do was be in the right spots at the right times and cross her path. There's no way she wouldn't notice me then! How could Mary ignore someone she ran into on a regular basis? That would just be rude.

My plans worked out perfectly...until she moved away for college - a day I'll never forget. I remember watching her holding back tears as she packed up her posters. It was hard for her. She was saying goodbye to her adolescence. To her parents. To everything she has known for 18 years. For her it was going to be worth it, however. Kent State University had an absolutely fantastic program for Graphic Design - her passion. Kent State also had a great program for Human Resources, and they were willing to offer me a great scholarship paying 3/4 of my tuition every year for four years. It was perfect.

Once our freshman year started, days turned into years rather quickly as I was always busy with school and extracurricular activities.

While in college, I discovered I had a talent for photography and you could always find me between classes with my camera - bus stops, trees, cars, park benches - anywhere and everywhere. I would spend all of my spare time trying to capture things in their most natural state of being, completely unaware a photograph was even being taken. There was a certain elegance in voyeurism that you can't replicate. Mary agreed, but I swear she knew I was there sometimes because she would try to model for me. Why else would she undress so close to a window? 

One day after a particularly long night of photo shoots, I retired to the campus Starbucks to refuel and edit some photos. That's when it happened.

"I know you, you're that Mike guy, right? From high school?"

There she was, standing at the front of my table with a heavenly smile and a glowing aura of love. Seeing her side-by-side with a photo really helped me realize how ridiculously stunning she is when not behind a camera lense.

"Can I sit with you?"

---

As cliche as it may be, the rest is history. We became inseparable. There would never be a pair of human beings who shared the same mutual obsession with each other again. We were truly a once-in-a-lifetime couple. The definition of a perfect relationship. Divinity.

Gramps was right. I never let Mary go.

Every single day I wake up and I'm instantly reminded of how much I love her. Throughout my day I frequently catch myself reading old texts from her I saved in my phone. I can't go on Facebook without going directly to her profile and seeing what she's been up to. On my drives home from work I always plan out dinner based on our favorite meals. I go to sleep inhaling her favorite scented lotion that she puts on before bed.

I can't get married like this. My fiancee has to know everything. She's so willing to make a lifelong commitment to me and I've been hiding this secret from her for years. It's time.

There's about twenty-five hours or so until our ceremony. Twenty-five hours to formulate my speech and resolve any issues it may cause between us. Telling her will be the hardest thing I'll ever have to do, but [I](https://m.facebook.com/knutsonwrites/) can't hide it anymore. It isn't fair to her. Mary gets her makeup done at 11 a.m. and her dress on at 1 p.m.. She would never forgive me if I made her walk down the aisle in any less than perfect condition. I just hope she understands how much I've loved her. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came to and my head was pounding. It was one hell of a drop and, to be honest, I'm surprised my body survived it. But where was I? 

I had never seen a palace like this before! The walls were a beautiful, slate gray and ran up to shake hands with the sun. There was a small stream that ran between the walls all the way to a stunning outdoors made up of trees, rocks, and the most amazing shrubbery I had ever seen! This was a foot-for-foot scene from the Lion King.

I couldn't contain my excitement any longer, I just had to get out there!.. and that's when I saw him: a massive, black shadow standing just above my head. 

I have never been so afraid of a shadow before, my mom always taught me to be tough and adventurous. But as my soul was taking its last step from my body, the shadow and I locked eyes. He looked concerned, yet had a gentle warmness behind his worries.

The shadow picked me up and explained that he was the Guardian of the Palace, and his job was to protect all of its inhabitants at all costs. As he picked me up and got me to a comfortable seated position the Guardian explained that he didn't see me as a threat and would love to show me around the Palace grounds...my fear was momentarily overcome with excitement -- and that's when we heard them -- the Keepers...

I will never forget that noise. It was comparable to a man gurgling blood, trying desperately to absorb the air and mutter his last words.

"No time to explain, young one. We must leave this place and seek haven!" The Guardian roared as he grabbed me and ran down the stream to the outside. 

I thought we were safe. The Guardian thought we were safe. Things were going to be okay!

The Guardian and I locked gazes and I felt the warmth from him once again.

"Pht"

The air moved around my head.

"Pht pht"

The Guardian fell. I knew what happened instantly. The Keepers shot him, and they were going to come for me next. I sat there, unsure of what to do while waiting for my certain death. As the Keepers came closer, a blinding light cast a blanket over my eyes, and prevented me from seeing the Guardian's murderers.



I woke up in a hospital bed with my mother sitting next to me. I could tell she had been crying because her eyes practically swell shut at the first tear drop. She jumped as I said her name and attempted to turn me into a fruit puree. I joked and told her that of she keeps crying she might leave the hospital blind.

Her and the Ranger explained to me that the Guardian had to be killed in order to me keep me safe.

"HE WAS PROTECTING ME!"I bawled out. But before the tears had time to roll down my cheeks I felt a familiar warmth...

The Guardian! He was standing there too, right next to my mom!

"I'll always be here to protect you, young one." He whispered.

"Thanks, Harambe." I smiled.

He's never left my side.
