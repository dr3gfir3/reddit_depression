	<TEXT> Though i disagree, my view is also drug related. I think all drugs should be legalised and controlled; to reduce crime, addiction, and dangers in their usage.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What would you do with 3000 </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello all,

Just looking for some advice. I just got an unexpected payment of 3000 Euros. 
I have no debt or expenses to pay, but also no source of income as I'm currently travelling while between jobs. To add, I've no savings, no house or assets.
I'm a college graduate with two degrees and hope to start work in a few months when my travelling is done.

I'm not very experience in finance and am looking for the best option for this money. Save? Invest? Something else? Any advice would be most welcome.  Thank you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for your comment. I would tend to agree. Being a live take, the synth seems oversaturated and the vocals not as strong. That's the price you pay for doing it live I guess! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think the purpose of this subreddit is to share entertaining/strange/unexplainable/creepy stories or anecdotes that have happened to people. Suspend your disbelief and enjoy being bemused for a while.

 It is not a subreddit which is trying to turn people away from science. I myself have a degree in science for example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A similar experience happened to me while I had the one and only panic attack I've ever had in my life. It was an extreme attack with extreme manifestations of the classic symptoms - feeling I was dying, feeling I was going crazy, feeling reality isn't real, time misconceptions, tunnel vision, heart palpitations etc etc. 

Going back to the "feeling reality isn't real" (derealisation) symptom. For about an hour, a strange sensation was coming and going in waves where I felt flat. I felt 2d. Existence was like a side scrolling super mario game. This seems to fit in with the pages of the book concept. To add an extra spin, which I've no idea of the relevance, as well as feeling 2d, I felt infinitely stretched and long as if from my toe to crown was the length of the entire universe.

Furthermore with the time travel theory, time was insanely messed up during this attack. 1 minute felt like an hour. It goes to show that the passage of time is only experienced when there is a brain to do so, and altering the brain can alter the sensation of time.

This 2d sensation happened to me one other time previously from medication also. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I asked. He had no recollection of dreams where he visited me. Perhaps he was too young to remember if he did; or perhaps he simple did not have one. Although he did have a picture of him wearing a suit as a child. It was from a family portrait. And of course, it was the same black suit he was wearing while standing in my doorway at night.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Saw my living friend's ghost appear in my bedroom. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-29 19:27:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This happened many years ago when I was about 9 years of age but I remember every detail vividly, as it was so shocking. I'll try keep this story short.

It was a regular night, nothing out of the ordinary and I was sound asleep in my bed. I woke in the middle of the night, I'm guessing about 1 or 2 am, which I often did as a child, and sat up slightly. I looked over at my bedroom door, which was open, and saw my good friend standing there (friends since birth), holding hands with her younger brother. The two were looking at me, smiling, and seemed happy to be there, as if this late night visit was totally normal. My friend was wearing a period style dress and her brother a suit. At the time, I had never seen them in such clothing. To make it stranger, the two appeared totally white an translucent (like the classic "ghost" appearance). As a child, this scared the crap out of me, so I immediately jumped out of bed and made a run for my parents room. As I ran between my friend and her brother, I pushed them aside by the shoulders, and in doing so felt resistance, as if they were solid. 

Here's where it gets weirder. I kept this story to myself and passed it off as a dream; I didn't mention it to my friend until 7 years later when I was 16. The reason I mentioned it to her at this time is because she told me she had a really vivid dream where she visited me in her sleep when she was 9 (we're the same age. 1 week apart.). I asked "were you wearing an old dress, almost Victorian style, during this dream?". She said "yes, an old dress my aunt gave to me which she wore while making her first communion" (FYI: catholic ceremony). "I think I have a picture of me in the dress somewhere" she continued. My friend took a step-ladder, and reached into the back of a tall cupboard in her room, and pulled out a box of trinkets and memorabilia. In the box she took out a photograph from when she was younger, wearing her aunts old dress. To my shock, it was indeed the exact same dress she was wearing when she visited me that night. 

I certainly cannot explain what happened that night but I remember it as if it happened yesterday because it was so unusual. I only found this subreddit recently and thought I'd share the story and try get insight. Both my friend and her brother are alive and well to this day, and we still hang out. It's just something we accepted and guess happened because we're so close and were kids (I read that kids are more open and prone to this kind of thing).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like you mentioned in another comment, I was on the JET programme for a year. You leave Dublin with about 50 co-workers so you immediately have a close social network of Irish counterparts. 

Furthermore, when you get to your home prefecture, it's not long before you become introduced to the JETs who have arrived from other countries, and JETs who are already present in the prefecture. 

The programme pays very well also. 
That being said, I did leave it!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to a decent club in Daegu, not far from you. There are two very people foreigner bars called "Thursday Party" where you can meet English speaking Koreans and foreigners very easily. It makes for a good place to warm up your night before hitting the late clubs.
Then of course there is Seoul with lots of places in Itaewon, Hongdae (younger university crowd), and Gangnam (yuppy type crowd) as popular spots. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was in Japan myself for 3 years until recently and had plenty of Irish friends. There are about 1600 Irish on the islands at the moment mostly around the Tokyo or Kyoto/Kobe/Osaka area. For meeting people, I'd recommend the usual - hanging around bars and going to events. Japan has a thriving music scene and I found gigs, festivals, music events etc to be good places to meet Irish and other nationalities.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sorry, but no, I am not wrong. Everthing I said is entirely correct. 

 I didn't say that serotonin and Psylocybin are non toxic. You are correct, as with all chemicals, they have a LD50 or "median lethal dose". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is bad science. On the contrary, the wiring of the brain is not altered, and the active ingredients in the mushroom are quickly eliminated from the body. 

Psylocybin, found in mushrooms, is converted to the primary active chemical psylocin, which produces the profound effect. The only difference molecularly between our endogenous serotonin (a mood stabiliser amongst other things) and psylocin is the position of the 'OH' group on the benzene ring. What implications does this have?

In short, chemicals which are more similar to our bodies native chemicals are generally less toxic. The body can recognise, metabolise, and eliminate these chemicals easier. This is why mushrooms are perfectly safe and do not produce a hangover. It is also why alcohol (ethanol is not endogenous to our body) produces such negative effects and hangover. It also explains why DMT, the most powerful psychedelic known, is the least toxic and most fast acting - it exists in our body already in small amounts.

The personality changes due to mushrooms are caused by the mystical and profound experiences people encounter, and not by the drug itself.  </TEXT>
