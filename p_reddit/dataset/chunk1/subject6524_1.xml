	<TEXT> HOUSTON -- In the most exciting fourth-quarter rally in Super Bowl history, the New England Patriots showed their remarkable resolve to do something no team has ever done before in coming back from a 28-3 deficit.

They were down 19 in the fourth quarter.

In rising up in such fashion to win 34-28 in overtime, quarterback Tom Brady wrote the most dramatic chapter in his future Hall of Fame career, earning MVP honors to set up a highly anticipated Monday morning MVP news conference with NFL commissioner Roger Goodell.

This was a script that not even Hollywood could have come up with for believability, especially when considering the greatest Super Bowl comeback had previously been 10 points.

Linebacker Dont'a Hightower's strip sack in the fourth quarter changed the momentum of the game, and receiver Julian Edelman's 23-yard "how-did-he-do-that?" catch was the reverse David Tyree.

In the end, Brady took center stage as he won his record fifth Super Bowl in a game he dedicated to his mother, Galynn, who has been battling an undisclosed illness.

"We all brought each other back," Brady said on the Fox telecast after the game. "We never felt out of it. It was a tough battle. They have a great team. I give them a lot of credit. We just made a few more plays than them."

You could point to two mottos that stuck with the Patriots this season: Through the playoffs it was "One More," and throughout the season was the common refrain of "Do Your Job."

No season had a feel of the Patriots' motto of "Do Your Job" more than this season in which the team managed to prevail after obstacles from Brady's suspension to losing star tight end Rob Gronkowski to injury. What has stood out along the way is the stronger-than-the-norm emotion from Brady ("Let's gooooooo!!!!" he would often scream before games), with Brady embracing the Super Bowl moment as much as ever before.

Now that they've achieved their goals and won Super Bowl LI, here's the bottom line: This one means more.

It's vindication.

As owner Robert Kraft said in the days leading up to Super Bowl LI, Deflategate penalties levied by the NFL against Brady and the team had a deeply rooted impact on the 2016 Patriots. Brady was hit with a four-game suspension for the January 2015 incident that months of court battles couldn't overturn. Meanwhile, the Patriots were fined $1 million and docked a first-round pick in 2016 and a fourth-round pick in 2017.

"I think in a way," Kraft had said last week, "that galvanized our whole team."

All the way to a record fifth Super Bowl championship, with no more talk of underinflated footballs.

The 2016 season began with questions of how big of a hole the Patriots would have to dig out of playing without the suspended Brady. While oddsmakers still gave the Patriots 6-1 odds to earn a Super Bowl berth this season, that doesn't guarantee wins.

The Patriots may have begun the season without Brady, but they did have Belichick. He created a game plan that in conjunction with offensive coordinator Josh McDaniels allowed backup quarterbacks Jimmy Garoppolo and Jacoby Brissett, a rookie, to do enough to help the Patriots win their first three games.

There the Patriots stood, 3-0 without Brady, and they didn't have Gronkowski in two of those games because of a hamstring injury.

By the time Brady returned on Oct. 9 in Cleveland, it felt like a home game, many fans taking advantage of Columbus Day weekend to make the trip to be there for that moment when Brady first took the field.

It had a Super Bowl-like feel to it, and what manifested itself the rest of the season was a region showering Brady with its appreciation and love on a daily basis. While Brady had his offensive line protecting him on the field, New England fans, as passionate as ever, were protective of his legacy.

Random chants of "Brady! Brady! Brady!" broke out at games. His homecoming trip to San Francisco in late November provided a springboard for more reflection on his career.

By the midway point, the Patriots were 7-1, the Buffalo Bills accounting for their only loss in Week 4 (Brissett's final start). When Brady returned, he was protected by a healthy offensive line under the tutelage of veteran offensive line coach Dante Scarnecchia, who returned from a pseudo retirement to lead the group.

The line not only helped Brady but created options for running backs LeGarrette Blount and Dion Lewis as the team's average of 117 rushing yards per game ranked seventh in the regular season after finishing 30th last season.

The Patriots needed other elements of their attack to be reliable, especially once Gronkowski was lost for the season due to a back injury he suffered against the Seattle Seahawks on Nov. 13.

The addition of veteran tight end Martellus Bennett via trade from the Chicago Bears last March meant the Patriots had another option when Gronkowski was placed on injured reserve. Bennett was the team's third-leading receiver with 55 catches, 701 yards and seven touchdowns.

Meanwhile, the defense had to come together after the offseason trade of defensive end Chandler Jones, and then a surprising in-season trade of linebacker Jamie Collins. Hightower, a team captain, cited the Nov. 20 win at San Francisco as a time when the group started to come together.

The unit ultimately finished the season ranked first in the NFL for fewest points allowed per game (15.6 average), although some critics still asked, "Have they truly played any top quarterbacks/offenses?"

It all ended up coming together for the Patriots, and Brady steered the direction. Once the Patriots arrived in Houston, the emotion of the season seemed to bubble over for Brady. During media night, his first night in Houston, Brady was nearly brought to tears in his meeting with reporters at the Super Bowl when a 7-year-old had asked him which person was his hero.

It was his dad, but Brady couldn't explain why. His eyes welled up, his voice cracked. That type of raw, poignant emotion has never been seen before from Brady in that setting, and it was quickly discovered why that was the case.

His mother, Gaylnn, has been dealing with an undisclosed illness, and it's put a strain on the tight-knit Brady family. So if there was a picture that captured the essence of Brady's emotions leading into Super Bowl LI, it was this.

The emotions peaked even higher as the confetti fell at NRG Stadium on Sunday night.

Brady took the stage and raised the Lombardi Trophy and yelled, "Let's go! Let's go!"

"Its going to be a great celebration tonight," Brady said from the stage. "Thank-you to all of our fans. Everyone back in Boston, New England, we love you. Youve been with us all year. Were bringing this sucker home! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im not sure I would have made it through the last two weeks without this sub or this team. It has been the distraction I needed. 

But when we were down by so much, I started feeling really, really low. I was desperate for a win so that I had something to feel some joy about. Now, I happen to be an atheist, but I still told Baxter out loud how much I needed this to help move on with things. I pretty much begged him for his help. 

I dont care if its a coincidence, everything about this experience the last 2 weeks, and this game tonight.....I know Baxter is ok now, I am feeling HAPPY, I am feeling PROUD (of so many different people), and I am feeling THANKFUL to be a member of this community. What an absolutely mind boggling night. 

We're onto #6. Fuck The Jets. I love you all.

	<TEXT> What are these people doing? I am obsessed with RPGS so the name of one wont matter to me as long as the game itself is something I am interested in....

However, a lot of casual western RPG gamers, people for example who would never in a million years visit this sub, have got to look at games like Bravely Default or the upcoming Project Octopath Traveler, and be like "wtf is this weird shit, I will never play this". This upsets me because I am looking forward to that game more than anything and I want it to do well.

The list goes on, too.....The new Kingdom Hearts game titles? Seriously? And it isnt just square.....Idea Factory/Compile Heart (dont know which entity titles the game in the West) games like Hyper Dimension Neptunia? 

And I get that its not bad to be quirky or weird once in a while, but I just feel like its been such an over-saturated trend. Why doesnt it make sense to give your game a title that can relatively easily identify what your game is? 

Maybe I am alone on this and am about to get flamed, too, I dunno. Curious what you all think.

Edit: To be clear, some people for some reason get the impression that I think game titles are the most important aspect of a game or something.....Of course not. They are a minor part of what makes a game a game, and what makes it successful......but still a part of it.

I just feel like its starting to get ridiculous how much better he has been getting. From being a decent pickup when we first got him, to coming off the bench to score for us, to becoming a starter, a leader....to an all star...to a 50 point scorer....to the Eastern Conference leader in scoring. 

Its been an amazing journey, and its only been a couple short years, but feels like longer. My long drawn out point is, how much higher can he go? What are some things he would have work on in his game to be closer to the greats of the current and past eras?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hidden sidequests and/or party members: The JRPG dilemma </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-01 18:34:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been thinking about this lately, as JRPGs have changed so much over the years. 

One of the biggest changes over the last 5-10 years (maybe a little bit longer) is a lot of catering to players who want to experience everything a game has to offer without putting any time or extended effort into finding. 

While I understand how many people appreciate this way to go about it, as not everyone has time to put 100 hours into a game, I feel that it has cheapened the experience of a lot of games. 

In pretty much every game that comes out now, all sidequests and most secrets can easily be found, in most cases, right on your map or mini map. For me, this dulls the gratification you would otherwise feel finding the objective on your own and completing it. 

Kind of similarly, is the general lack of secret/optionally recruited playable characters and/or party members in games when compared to generations past. Some examples off the top of my head are FF6 (which was the game that did it best, imo), Star Ocean 2, the Suikoden series, and a few more. While I know even back then the majority of games did not have these things in vast proportions, I feel there are most definitely *less* nowadays. 

I think there are two reasons for this over the years. The first goes back to my other point: people who buy these games want to be able to get everything their money paid for without having to sacrifice their personal life or time to get. The other, is that as stories have taken more cinematic approaches over the years, it is more difficult to implement hidden novelty characters, etc into games than it was in the past. 

 Lately, I have enjoyed the Cold Steel series, as even though side quests are marked on the map, you can turn it off (I think I remember being able to do that, my memory is fuzzy), but there were also some quests that were indeed hidden and unmarked. 

Also enjoyed the way Xenoblade Chronicles X party system worked out. It was hard work unlocking Mia!

Anway, I just feel like I would really love a return in some way or another to JRPGs that didnt hold your hand all the way through, and offered a wider array of hidden content you have to actually work for. There has to be a way to balance it better. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been noticing over the past year or so, that a lot of youtube reactors have been doing some older series. I am still as obsessed with Lost as I was when it was on the air, and would love to see people who know nothing about it watching it for the first time all the way through. 

There is literally not one single channel that has done a blind reaction. The only one I found is a girl who did season 1 and then stopped uploading to her channel. 

If anyone has any youtube buddies, you should convince them to do this....as they would be the first on all of youtube to put up a reaction series to this amazing show. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had this really old bag I kept hanging on to as a backup in case I ever went dry....its been months and luckily I have always had some fresh stuff so I never used it...

It was pure shake, dried as fuck....it was good bud when I got it though....but at the point it was at, if someone offered you some to smoke...you'd pass.

Anyway.....I had some coconut oil in my cabinet and decided, what the fuck, Im not gonna smoke it, lets try making some cannabis oil for the very first time. If I fuck up, I thought, who cares, its 6 month old weed I wasnt gonna smoke anyway.

I made it as carefully as possible, even going to the CVS down the street to pick up some Lecethin as the guides I read told me to. 

9 hours after beginning, my oil was done and I made the batter out of the first coconut oil recipe I found. It came out to a perfect consistency and color somehow. 

Baked that shit at 330 for 9 minutes. Ate one as soon as it came out. It tasted, somehow, incredible. It has been 90 minutes now, and I have a body high that you would never imagine rank-ass, half-a-year-old weed could ever give you. 

The moral of this story.....Dont be afraid to make your own oil or butter! I had always thought it was a tougher process than it is. But its not. If you can read a recipe, you can make it yourself. I am pretty god damn sure this is a complete shitpost, but I am feeling so good I really dgaf. I love you all.

	<DATE> 2016-10-17 05:01:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so, this is a retelling of the story told to me by the person who went through this today. So take from it what you want. 

My buddy really wanted to help clean up his area from the damage that hurricane Matthew caused. He did a quick search online for organizations looking for volunteers. The one he found close by was being run by a church. My friend is not religious, but didnt see why that should stop someone from volunteering with them (it shouldnt). 

As soon as he walked into the church he realized he made a big mistake. There was a woman speaking to the group about the "evils" of gay marriage. Perplexed, my friend thought he was certainly at the wrong place. He got up to leave and on his way out he asked someone by the door where the volunteers were meeting. The guy told him that he WAS in the right place, but the group was going through "orientation" and that he should sit back down. 

In order to volunteer with the group, you had to sit through this orientation of theirs, which apparently just consisted of an old woman reading hateful remarks from an index card, and the real kicker, YOU HAD TO SIGN A CARD DENOUNCING GAY MARRIAGE in order to volunteer with them. You cant make this shit up!!!!

This is one of those things where I cant believe it, but I *do* believe it. Sick of this shit. My buddy was so disgusted he walked out (while voicing his opinion to them)...so congrats, South Carolina Christian church, you managed to turn away someone who wanted to do some good today because of your obsession with other people's sex lives. 

Unreal. I wish I could say which church this was, but for the sake of rules, I wont.  </TEXT>
