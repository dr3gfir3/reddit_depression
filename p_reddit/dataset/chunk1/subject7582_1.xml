And if they were going to replace Frusciante, there was no oneore well suited for the gig than Jane's Addiction's guitar player. Chili Peppers fans love Jane's Addiction, but hate One Hot Minute.

	<TEXT> There are less destructive ways to screw with someone who does this. Unscrew the valve stem cap on one of their tires, insert very small pebble, put cap back on. It'll drain the air without damaging the tire. But it can screw up the valve stem, so don't screw it on too tight.  
I did that once to a guy who came up the wrong direction in a parking lane where I was waiting for a spot. The other car left their spot, and asshole cut me off and made a 5 point turn to steal the spot.  
I ran into him at the back of the grocery store and said something like "that was really uncool, man. You saw me waiting for that spot." He responded with something like "fuck do I care. I got where I needed to be."  
I cut my grocery shopping short, checked out with what I had, walked outside and deflated 2 of his big truck tires and left a note under his wiper that said "good luck getting where you need to go now." It was a total dick move on my part, and I probably should have been the bigger man, but sometimes those baser instincts get the best of me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not just traditional bubblegum pop music either like you might hear on a Top 40 Station. Country music is terribly generic too. I love this [6 song mashup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FY8SwIvxj8o) with country songs all made into 1 continuous song that makes as much sense as any 1 song would have on it's own.  
Rap wasn't much better in the 2000s. Thankfully, every once in a while a genre gets a Nirvana, Kendrick Lamar, a Townes Van Zant, and gets a reality check on what is and what is not art. </TEXT>
