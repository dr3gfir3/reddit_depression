	<TEXT> My 20 year old Bryant heat pump went out this past Sunday. It was an R22 heat pump. My air handler also has a tag on it that says R22, along with all the other info associated with the air handler (carrier brand). My question is does it matter to the air handler what refrigerant the heat pump use? If I upgrade my heat pump do I also need to get a new air handler? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I are planning on buying a house for 214500 and putting 20% down in fishers Indiana. Our lender have us a FTH rate of 3.875%.

	<TITLE> Hourly worker, weekly pay tax question </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-10 15:10:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work at an hourly job that pays me $35 an hour. A couple weeks ago I only worked 8 hours and was paid $230 after all taxes were taken out. Last week I worked 40 hours and made $994 after my taxes were removed. So essentially my take home pay was $28.75 an hour when I worked less,  and $24.85 an hour when I worked more. Going back through my pay stubs it seems that my weekly tax% removed is higher for more hours worked. Why is this? Is it because to tax weekly they are assuming that that week's pay amount will be uniform for the whole year,  and base the tax bracket off that? 

Thanks for the help </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Indiana resident with Indiana LTCH </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-21 01:40:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm an Indiana resident with an Indiana LTCH. I'm confused by Michigan's "resident permits only" policy. Does this mean that only Michigan CPL holders can carry a concealed weapon,  or does it mean that my Indiana resident LTCH is valid, because it is not a non-resident permit (i.e. Someone from South Carolina with an Indiana non-resident LTCH)? I'm heading to Michigan this weekend and wanted to carry my pistol on the trip. 

Follow up question: if you are a passenger in a vehicle that is stopped in Michigan do you have to duty to inform as well? In Indiana we don't have those laws so I'm unfamiliar. 

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I just moved from one suburb of Indy to another and now I have a temporary DL (I still have the one from my previous address too,  for whatever reason they didn't take it). Can I privately sell a gun to another individual while I don't have my renewed license? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Currently my license and LTCH list my parents address, however I moved into an apartment. If I notify of a change of address for my LTCH do I also need to update my drivers license? Can I not just claim my parents house as my "permanent residence?" and keep both ltch and license listing that address? I hate to go through all the changes when I intend to move again in a year. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Mid back sensation for weeks.. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-23 21:38:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm new to this sub, but this feeling I'm having is driving me crazy. To preface, I lift weights, and do lifts that can cause back injury when done improperly (squats, deadlifts, bent over rows, even bench press because I arch my back pretty hard). 

About six or seven weeks ago I started having this weird feeling in my mid back, right about where the lumbar region meets the thoracic region. It's like my muscles on either side of my spine are stuck in flexion. Like someone is "poking" me, just mildly pressing their finger into my back and keeping it there. Kind of like it's being compressed. It's really hard to describe I guess. It's not painful. And I can't recall when it started, it's not like most injuries you hear about where you feel it immediately and know you've screwed up bad. But it's causing me a lot of psychological stress, and it keeps me up at night. It seems to be worse when sitting or laying down, not so noticeable standing.

I've stopped doing the lifts mentioned above about a week ago, and only do lifts that do not put any pressure on my low/mid back (not that I'm certain it's a lifting injury, maybe posture related?). I've also been doing leg and lumbar stretches every day. The problem persists. I've seen a chiropractor a couple times who doesn't think it's anything, and gave me the straight leg test to rule out a hernia (again, I feel no pain, just constant discomfort).

My mind is running wild about what it might be, causing me more stress. I am seeing an orthopedic non invasive spine doctor in three weeks, which is the soonest appointment I could get, which I'm guessing will be followed by an MRI. I've also scheduled a massage with the chiro's on staff masseuse for next week also.

Has anyone seen or experienced anything like this? I'm getting scared because of how long it's been. </TEXT>

Hello,
I just bought a used road bike (2005 specialized s-works aerotec e5) and I'm not sure how to adjust the handlebars (if possible) or remove the seatpost. Both are pictured in the gallery. I'm only familiar with cheap mountain bikes, and these components are new to me. Am I missing something obvious? </TEXT>
