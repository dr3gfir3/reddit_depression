	<TEXT> A bachelor's degree is NOT an investment. There are so many people attending college now that it's significantly de-valued. Equal to a HS diploma or a just a tad higher. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No way. Cornell is the easiest Ivy league school to get into. HOWEVER, it is known to have the toughest curriculum out of all the ivies. There is a gorge that is connected by bridges near campus. Yearly, students jump up off the cliff. The place is a pressure cooker. Rutgers is a good school, but doesn't belong in the same category in terms of difficulty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Take the full ride. Pay yourself first. No debt is a good thing. Don't gamble against uncertainty. There are no guarantees of landing lucrative internships or a big payday after graduation. It can definitely happen though. If you'd like to cut down the price, commute to Rutgers (if possible). Do whatever you can to help yourself graduate with the least amount of debt possible.  I have friends who graduated with over 50K of debt because they banked on Rutgers having all the connections and opportunities. When things didn't work out....they still had to pay back the debt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Throw everything you have at the debt, except the amount that allows you to live with necessities.  Don't let the interest have a chance to accrue. You'll have plenty of time to enjoy your life. Would you rather have a black cloud hanging over your head for a shorter or longer amount of time. Work hard while you're young, so you can pay it off. 

Most that are traveling, driving around with nice cars and such are just prolonging the inevitable....payments, debt, and loan repayments. It's why leasing enables people to drive cars they truly cannot afford. Reframe things and realize how fortunate you are to be a physician. That alone is an accomplishment. 

Try to consolidate the debt (if federal loans) and make more than the minimum payments each month. Even if you were to make standard payments, your still going to face the undesirable debt obligation. Therefore, again....it's best to sacrifice now and enjoy being debt free...instead of living a large portion of your life paying other people before yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think most people in higher ed are a bit misguided. They try their best to latch on or associate themselves with the fame of notable figures in our society. While it's a cool tidbit of info, nobody really focuses on where you went to college unless you become famous. Then everyone wants to use your notoriety to increase the PR and marketability of the said school.

The sequence of events and link to the presidency is a bit of a stretch, though. "Almost" a US president is not an accomplishment. lol

	<TEXT> Of course fraternities haze. Sororities do as well. Hazing is "illegal," but it still happens. Brothers are sworn to a code of secrecy not to go against the brotherhood and reveal the "process." Social pressure keeps people from revealing the truth. It's a well known thing amongst greek life and anyone who tells you it doesn't happen...is an ignorant lemming. 

As for girls, Sororities will haze the $hit out of you. Specifically, the well known ones. Ever heard of Gamma Phi Beta, Phi Sigma Sigma, and Zeta Tau Alpha? Never met so many girls with such low self esteem in my life. The hazing process mentally destroys them. It's sad to see. 

It's all about what you want, though. What are you willing to give up to be part of it.  And before anyone comments, that I didn't get a bid...I was part of Greek Life while at Rutgers.  </TEXT>
