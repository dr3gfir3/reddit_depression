	<TEXT> Some of the most useful things I've learned about in my life are cognitive dissonance, group think, and logical fallacies.

You want to be able to police your own thinking before you move on to judging or debating the ideas of others.

Instead of surrendering to this whole post-truth 'people must be entertained to be persuaded' acceptance, critical thinking needs to feature earlier and more often in our education system.  I can assure that it does in the better private schools.

Getting it into the broader context of public schools is the challenge, but it is far better to address this challenge than just accept that everything has to be fun for the public to embrace it.

And, even if we are moving into "a post-truth era", it ought to be noted that we've been through numerous post-truth eras throughout history.  The dismissal of the educated by the ignorant represents more of human history than vice versa.

The reality?  We'll probably have to go ahead and do another tour of post-truth until people want truth more than titillation.  Fair enough.  The result is just that we collectively get to be remembered as one of those dark ages periods where things went to crap until we collectively decided that we didn't want to be this way.

If I'm to accept the author's proposition, then I say let's get it on.  Bring on the stupidity so that the stupidity can end sooner rather than later.  

It might just be that this is what's happening.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-22 03:48:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Reporting that Trump is lying hasn't deterred him, nor did it keep him from winning the election.  I would, in fact argue, that the media reporting his lies served to amplify them.  At much the same time, I do not feel that the media aggressively confronted him about the lies during the election, and now it's even harder to do so.

My proposal would be to avoid carrying the content of the lies as headlines:  Trump claims largest electoral victory in history v Trump lies about his election performance again.   Do you see what I mean?  In the former, what he wants to say gets disseminated, whether the report is for or against that information.  In the latter, his lying gets disseminated, and you actually have to read to find out what his claim was.  Sadly, in this day and age, actually having to read is a step too far for many.  Those most susceptible to gaslighting, I would guess, tend to be those who don't actually want to read.  So my idea is to bury the lies in text instead of carrying them in tweet-length headlines.

Maybe that's just not the right way to go about it.  If so, I'd like to hear why.  Or, I'd like to hear other approaches other than simply acquiescing and suggesting we're headed into the "post truth era".  This smacks of capitulation. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-18 09:20:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello,

After my recent discovery of r/birdsforscale, I come to you in a search for answers.  Difficult answers to difficult questions.

I'll preface by saying birds have made a truly noble contribution to visual arts by serving as a beautiful and subtle device for showing the scale of things painted, drawn, and otherwise visually rendered.  Without birds to show scale, I would not be here speaking to you.

So the burning questions I have are about the origins and classic uses of birds used in art to articulate the immensity and/or to indicate the diminutive size of subjects, objects, people, and possibly even other birds in the history of art.

My questions are:

1) What is the earliest known case of a bird being used in a painting or drawing to show scale?

Was it a the Chinese? The Greeks? The Dutch Masters?

Who did it first occur to that one of our feathered friends was just the size to contrast size with?

2) What is the most classic painting that uses birds to show scale?

  Here I hope to find a painting by one of the all-time greats featuring at least one bird, if not a whole flock of them, for scale.  Alternatively, it doesn't have to be by a famous artist, but maybe it's simply a painting or drawing that we're all familiar with.

Thank you for reading, and I look forward to your responses. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello birds for scalers,

I have to admit I was somewhat skeptical when I saw the title of this subreddit, but by jove these birds are totally revealing the scale of all kinds of stuff.

My question/request may have been covered at the inception of this subreddit and I missed it, but what I'm wondering is when the first birds were added to artistic works to show the scale of things?

Did the Greeks have birds for scale?  The Dutch Masters?

The Mona Lisa was cool and all, but Da Vinci missed out by not having a sparrow flying off into the background or a parrot on her shoulder.

So, please help me out here.  Is there bird scale historian that has traced this noble lineage?  Similarly, what would y'all say is the quintessential piece that includes a bird for scale? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is now a weekly problem that is bad for both devs and players.

I propose:

Set one off-night for server server stress tests.  Say Tuesday or Wednesday prime times, and offer double xp to all players for four hours at those times.

This will make up for player lost time during weekends, allow the devs to sort the problem at a time other than the weekend, and provide an impetus for this to truly get fixed.

I'm writing this as I'm once again blocked from logging on after it took 2 hours to initially log on.

And I know that I'm not the only one. </TEXT>
