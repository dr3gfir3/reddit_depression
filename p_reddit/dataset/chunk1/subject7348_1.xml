	<TEXT> Your perception of how much you put into the relationship, or how much you do in the relationship, will always be skewed. If you feel like you are putting in 50%, your spouse is carrying most of the weight. If you think you are putting in 75-90%, it's most likely equitable.

	<TEXT> I feel you. I've been fighting my way into some bromances since moving back here and it isn't working. They don't find anything wrong with me, they are just comfortable where they already are, why risk it with hanging out with someone new? Even with the crew I grew up here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ripple Effect martial arts is so geared towards kids and is so good for them that the only adults participating are the parents of the kids. They are wonderful to the kids and motivate the kids to do well in school (by giving out gold and silver stars on their uniform lapels). They compel the kids to start doing chores at home by requiring a certain number of "attitude stripes"on their belts before graduating to the next belt. As someone who grew up with martial arts, the teaching is good and kid centered. I wish had this type of school when I was a kid. </TEXT>
