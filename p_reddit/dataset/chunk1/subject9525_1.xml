	<TEXT> I'm not saying boots desolator. In the situation that I said you could be in, you've most probably already farmed an sny or mom or something 
(Mom + battlefury again is insane wave clear) 
So boots, mom/sny/best case scenario manta, then deso to help you quickly rat

	<TEXT> AM style rat is mostly just clearing waves quickly because battlefury + manta is extremely good at it. But if you're losing the game around 30 min, a manta will be much harder to farm than a deso.

	<TEXT> I've found that jugg scales well and the stats based items like skadi ani butterfly further enhance it, rendering the expensive 4.2k gold aghs overkill. 
Mom was good when they buffed his crits. Now, you can do just as well without it. I've found vlad's to be a bit better, the armor, mana regen + lifesteal aura. It's good at pushing too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah. Same. I'm saying would deso be good under situations like you're behind and you need to take towers fast. Or sneak a rosh get back, take tower, get back and repeat 
Desolator would be a much more affordable item in the case that you're behind  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Skadi and manta are a bit more expensive than a deso. And since you're behind, you're much likelier to have the gold for a deso than skadi or manta or sny </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consider this situation. You've lost all or most of your tier 2 towers. You need to take towers and take back map control before they snowball. 
Would a deso be good in this situation to push out the wave faster, take a tower, tp back, defend and repeat?

	<TEXT> A huge chunk of his income does come from killing heroes. But a battlefury is good at clearing waves, works good on clumped enemies during Omnislash and it doesn't hurt to farm faster 
Ember gets a battlefury because sleight of fist is a mini Omnislash. 
So, basically the same principle

	<TEXT> Mom is a common item, so I added that. 
I agree with you about manta and skadi. 
But I'm asking if desolator is a good item in the situation that you've lost plenty of towers and you need to counter push fast and then tp back (basically rat) 
Or your opponents are high armour and you have no other way to counter that
Situational is the keyword.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most popular = the build that is most commonly made by most professional players 
Aghs is expensive and ends up being overkill because juggernaut scales really well. 
And if you need lifesteal, vlad's would be better because of all the stats + aura 
So, no. I don't mean the mom + aghs build </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The current most popular build on Juggernaut is battlefury into agility items. 
Desolator would provide him some extra damage + the armor reduction will work wonders with Omnislash. 
Is it a good item to build for him? 
If not, why so?  </TEXT>
