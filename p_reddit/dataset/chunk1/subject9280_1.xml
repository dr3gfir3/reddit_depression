	<TEXT> I always hate the fuck out of quotes like this.  The ideas like this surronding our culture make it so that people feel suicidal after breakups, after divorce, after the death of a loved one, etc.  If you  make anything or anyone at all the meaning of your world, when they inevitably move on from your life you will be left broken inside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you MUST go FULLY no contact and block him on everything. If you don't he might message you or you will be tempted to look him up. Either way, no contact is seriously important. Take it from someone who spent almost 11 months refusing to go no contact for my evil manipulative bitch ex girlfriend. When I decided to finally block her and finally rid my mind of all all possibility of us in any sense could I finally begin to let her go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A simple way to put it, most mentally healthy people will be sad about a break up for a week or two and then move on. For me, as someone suffering from seriously intense depression and anxiety (and being unfortunate enough to have dated a manipulative devil) I became suicidally depressed daily for months and months on end. Now that's not some normal sadness.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My life is in complete shambles. I'm 23 and am almost broke and can't hold a job because of my extremely severe depression and panic disorder. I've been suicidal for a very long time and have been in and out the hospital and have tried almost everything. I am in serious debt and couldnt finish school and have no friends left and have been struggling by and haven't eaten much the last three weeks as my pantry is almost empty. There's a papa johns near me and i can make a pizza last for almost two days as I know how to ration well. It would mean so much to me. I love you all you guys in this subreddit btw.  My request wasn't fulfilled btw it just says "got pizza'd" from the past

**EDIT: Thank you u/Whisperers for the pizza gift card!** </TEXT>

I installed all the tweaks I used to use on past jailbreaks and it's been great. However, I haven't really messed around and done any more with my jailbreak I'm a while because as of now I'm pretty sure everyone on this jailbreak's certificate expires in April and then the jailbreak will disappear. Please correct me if I'm wrong or any updates or solutions to this problem have come out since it was discovered, because as of now I really don't see a point in customizing my jailbreak anymore if it's going to just disappear soon.

	<TITLE> It's this type of thinking that mainstream America thrives on that can often be very toxic </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-14 04:22:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In high school I developed this *hard* mentality on life where everything should be accomplished with intensity and sheer blunt force and intense motivation against the dark forces of fear, pain, and its subcategories such as procrastination, laziness, and avoidance.  I got interested in the marines and felt this ideology on how to approach life was awesome.  To this day I fully appreciate many different parts of this way of thinking, however, I no longer view it as the most important way or central of thinking.


With this ideology as my main way of thinking I used to burn out extremely easily, would almost always be motivated by fear or anger, and would always feel shitty, even just hours after reaching some success.  No matter what I did, I would never feel any peace at all, and everything I did would be about this desire to be *alpha* and extremely intense.  In my belief, this *need* and reinforcement to live through this state is what is largely contributing to the mental health issues of many depressed and suicidal veterans who are already suffering with PTSD and who are eventually taking their own lives.


Although some aspects of this way of thinking are important, using it as a main way of living is very very stressful and will leave one in a constant state of needing to be productive and produce results and be *intense*.

After reading The Power of Now six months ago and learning all about the spiritual and presence approach to living and about meditation, I've now begun to live my life in a much calmer much more peaceful way, approaching things not as intense problems but just as things that are to be dealt with or accepted.  

Looking at things from outside the box now, I always can't help but be amazed at the sheer absurdity of certain mindsets that the mainstream culture we have still upholds.  Posts like 
  **[this](https://www.reddit.com/r/GetMotivated/comments/57au97/image_my_hero_is_always_10_years_away/)** clearly express the flaws I'm speaking about regarding this culture of intensity and blunt force action we live in today.  It's not healthy at all to be chasing something that never comes, and will leave a person worn out and dejected, because as stated, the "hero" will never come.  I don't know about all of you, but I see past a lot of this "motivation" speak now and see that ideologies of balance and presence are the true keys to being able to be successful and or happy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [QUESTION] Tweak to remove recording button in messages? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-28 04:23:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Currently on 9.3.1, I used to use a tweak called NoAudioRecorder to remove the recording button on the right of the text box, but it doesn't seem to work for the 9.3.x. Anyone have any good alternatives?  I had a friend who was texting his boss and accidentally recorded himself talking shit about him and the recording sent lol, so its just a nuisance to have it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [QUESTION] Help getting rid of white bar at the bottom of custom respring logo </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-12 06:11:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have an iPhone 6 and am on 9.3.1, and I made a custom respring logo and followed a tutorial which said to place in a certain folder and duplicate the file 4 times for a total of five files in the folder. The tutorial then said to name the 4 duplicates as follows: (however didn't say what to the name the original so I just put it as logo.png)

* apple-logo@2x
* apple-logo@2x~iphone
* apple-logo@2x-iphoneapple-logo-black@2x
* apple-logo-black@2x~iphone

The next step was to go to winterboard and enable the theme and respring which I did. The respring logo worked but there's a white bar at the bottom. I tried to respring again and even tried rebooting and re-entering my jailbreak, but I still get the white bar. Need some help please :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was on Accutane several years ago when my acne had become very cystic and it was very very bad. It helped, but over the last three years a very large amount has come back. I spend so much time every morning and every night cleaning my face and then putting on 2.5 benzoyl peroxide and then a non-comodogenic moisturizer. When I use enough benzoyl my skins gets better but it's in insane pain. When I don't use even a tiny bit less then enough I break out horribly. I can't keep doing this, but when I go to my dermatologist he goes oh your skin is fine you don't need a second accutane course and to try this cream such and such instead. I don't know what to do, but I need a second course of claravis and don't know how to get it, please help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm 23 and my problems are giant giant mountains and everything in my life is just so wrong and dark and fucked up.  I miss my ex girlfriend every day of whom my relationship ended with in February. All my insurmountable problems and insane 13 years of extreme unhappiness and how much I miss her are pushing me to end it.  I can't overcome my problems.  I can't stop missing and thinking about her.  I have tried so hard for so long and now see and know there is no way my suffering will ever end except with my death.  I dont have a reason to hope. I don't have a reason to believe.  The problems I face are not able to be overcome.  I can't do this anymore. It's been months and months of the same feelings, I see the end in my eyes because I can't live any more.  I know the suffering that people have and I have aren't justified and don't happen for a reason, and I've essentially lost all my belief in god and truly everything else.  Please help me before I kill myself because I have so many infinite reasons to die and none to live even another day.  I have no more options, I can't suffer any longer </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So two months ago my ex-girlfriend broke up with me because for the past 8 months I had been going through so much I neglected her all the time and pushed her away.  We had dated almost a year.  I had had so many issues and bad things happening but she too had some smaller ones.  There were so many times where I wanted to break up with her because I figured I could never be with her because of her small problems but I never wanted to break up because I loved her too much.  The last two months since she broke up with me my depression and anxiety got 1000x worse and I've literally been suffering from crippling panic attacks and insanely severe depression and dark thoughts almost all relating to her and not having her and wanting her back more than anything in the world.  Since we broke up I've been telling her I've been wanting her back and I that I've changed a lot.  A couple weeks ago I wrote a really long letter and printed out a picture of us both and was planning to bring both and flowers to her apartment at school in person and ask if she wanted to get coffee to talk.  Days before I was gonna go she texted me saying she needs to be single for a while.  I then called her and calmly talked and i even told her about what i was planning to do with the letter and things and she said at least until next semester starts in the fall she needs to be single. I asked her if in the fall we could have a chance at talking again and she said yes.  The next day after that she messaged me because she was at home and her mom made her really upset and she wanted to talk to me.  I went about the conversation calmly and said I do want a chance so bad in the fall but I understand she needs her time now and I respect that.  Later that night she messaged me drunk and the conversation was similar.  A week or so after that on a saturday night I saw about twenty minutes after she sent it she asked "can i come over" along with two missed calls at 1am. I then called her and she said can i come over and was at her friends house and I said of course you know I want that and she said actually let me call you back in ten I need to think if its a good idea or not. Twelve minutes went by and no call so I called her and went to voicemail.  Then she called me back a couple minutes after and said i didn't need to come.  Twenty minutes later I was in bed and my phone vibrated and she said she wanted to come to drive her to her apartment so I then left and got her.  Her apartment was ten minutes away and she was somewhat drunk and kissed me when she got in, then started crying about how I mistreated her, then I started talking calmly about how I want a chance so bad in the fall, then when I went to drop her off she said to park for a minute.  I did, then we started kissing, I put my hand up her shirt, she started giving me head for 40 seconds while I put my hand down her jeans to her ass, and then she said she needed to go.  I got out to help her and she said can we get back together, I said its what I want, then she said not until next semester while she was kind of crying.  The next morning she texted "sorry for last night."  I called her and said I just want a chance in the fall and she was like yes i already said yes but she was like I can't promise anything 1000%.  I then said I'm just worried she'll be with someone else and she then said its unlikely but obviously she can't promise 1000%. I then said I wouldn't message her for a couple months and she said okay.  Then a couple days later on this past friday morning I woke up to a text she sent an hour before which from her which said something bad happened.  Several hours later I went to her apartment to help her even though she was reluctant at first, I was there five minutes and she was slightly uncomfortable and I gave her the things I brought that she needed and then said I just want to know for sure about the fall and she was like we already talked about this then I said so yes? and then she said yeah but said that she cant guarantee 1000%. she then thanked me for the stuff and I left.  Then this morning I woke up to a missed call from her last night at 3:30 am when she was obviously drunk and so I texted her saying "I missed your call last night, is everything okay" and she messaged back "Yes I'm sorry for calling" and i didn't message back after.


I'm very sorry I made this so long I'm just very very very mentally sick right now and every little thing triggers me about her.  I stopped jacking off a week after we broke up because sex, sex stimuli, thoughts about sex or her literally make me truly want to die.  I can't even see commercials with females at the moment and any smell that reminds me of sex triggers me like crazy wanting to die because I don't have her and she's free now to have sex with other guys.  I know there's five months between now and next semester and that when i asked she said in the fall we can have a chance to talk again I'm just so scared she won't take me back or she'll meet someone else or change her mind.


Days after we broke up I jacked off to pictures of her boobs and her ass I have locked away that she had texted me so so so long and it was so bad because after I just missed her and wanted to die.  I used to have an addiction to porn and jacking off but was fading for over a year now and the last almost two months because of my severe triggers I didn't even want to and havent since a week after she broke up with me.


I don't have any desire at all to jack off literally none, and that is the truth, I just want to stop thinking about all these dark thoughts about her and I don't know if jacking off to regular porn would help me after I cum, like if part of my huge attraction to her will be subsided for some time because I'll feel more free.  I'm literally in the most pain ive ever experienced in my entire life and have been sleeping almost all day every day because everything else I try to do doesn't help.  I've been on zoloft three weeks now after trying other things for the last many months that didn't work but it isn't working yet.  I have two therapist appointments this week and one appointment Wednesday with the psychiatrist where I'll ask him to increase my zoloft dose because it isn't working yet and for xanax which I know he won't give me because he never does.  I almost went to the hospital many times the past couple weeks and especially the last couple days because i literally can't exist at the moment.  


I know I need medicine to start working immeadielty and to start making changes and getting healthy for myself first and I won't message her probably until july at all and I have to wait till the fall, it's just ive been talking to my friend and my sister and my parents about this im just terrified in the fall five months from now she wont take me back or that she'll change her mind or she won't give me a chance or tell me that she's met someone else even though its unlikely or that she'll tell me she just want to move on.  I really put her through a lot the last many months of us dating and she said before she's afraid if we get back that I'll be good again the beginning and it will get bad later.


Please please please help me guys with advice and anything you can offer me, I need your guys' help more than ive ever needed anything </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My friend who has built 3 PC's before this built my PC three days ago.  I was with him when he built it but I didn't know how to build really. He's very good at this stuff and says everything is almost 100% definitely in the right places and connected properly. 


So here's where I'm at now. Two days ago I powered it on and it turns on fine and the fans spin and everything and even the GPU light is on and its fans are spinning too, but I connected an HDMI cord to the GPU's port first and then tried the motherboard's port and neither showed anything on my monitor's screen.  I am very much a newb and don't know if I need to use a keyboard and hold down a button when starting to see anything or if I need to connect an optical drive with an install disc to the PC or a flash drive with the windows install ISO, or if its something else.  

When I say nothing shows up on the monitor I mean not even a black screen, the monitor literally doesn't detect the PC is connected.  I've tried my friend's monitor too and to no avail.  I also know its not the cord because I use this cord for a projector all the time.

Also here is my build list:

[My Build](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/hPzyGX)

And here is what the GPU ports and Motherboard ports look like:

**Please help me I'm so close to escaping peasanthood.**

**EDIT #1:** Thanks for your answers and help so far guys, I'll be back at school sunday and will try these things and then update if anything worked. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was on anti-depressants for about 2.5 years, and was most recently on paxil for 1.5 of those last years. Six and a half weeks ago I took my last pill. The first almost two weeks of the withdrawal were hell with me feeling depressed, angry, just awful. Then starting during the third week from the last pill i felt amazing and that continued for about another 3 days, totaling about 10 days of feeling good. Even since then my thoughts and progress in life is great and NOTHING IN MY THOUGHTS ABOUT THINGS HAVE CHANGED. However, after those ten days I started to literally feel pshycially and emotionally fucked sad and depressed. Since then, about three weeks ago, I have been extremely depressed and very very sad and close to the edge. My conclusions have been that it's either still some weird shit from the withdrawal and that I need to give it more time to feel better, OR that this is the real me and I need to do something.

PLEASE HELP ME, i've never felt so sad and depressed for such a continuous period. People that have been on paxil please can you help me to tell me if you experienced something similar or anyone else please give me your conclusions/answers on this. thank you </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have 2 main apps installed to tweak my music app: Acappella II   Aria 2.

I think it's Aria 2 that makes it so when one clicks the search bar in the music app the default tab searched with is "Radio." It's terribly annoying for someone who doesn't use iTunes Radio one bit and who uses the music app all day. 

The thing is I need Aria 2 for my music app. If anyone has a way to customize the music search bar at all that would be perfect.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Thanks for people's help, I bought almost every part necessary so far for the next-gen exterminator build. I just have two important questions if someone can help me out promptly.

**FIRST:** 

does the exterminator build thats listed right now in the build guides (which is the one i purchased my items with) give the PC built in wifi?? 

**SECOND:**

I see that the exterminator build doesn't say to get any fans or cooling items. won't it need something like that? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The "Next-Gen Crusher" Build or "Next-Gen Exterminator" ??? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-24 02:49:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've finally decided it is time to ascend, as my xbox 360 just isn't cutting it, and the longest I've ever had online play was 1 month in total in almost ten years of ownership. 

I have narrowed it down to either the crusher or exterminator builds, and I'll get the exact items listed in each build to make things simple for buying. I wanted initially to get the crusher build as it is more than $300 cheaper, only, I figure since I'm upgrading in the first place I desire to run all my games at 1080p 60FPS.  I know both builds are supposed to be able to do this, while the exterminator obviously being much better at it, but my question is will the crusher still run basically all the games I desire at the settings I mentioned above? I don't want to purchase something saving several hundred if its just not worth it in the first place.

At the same time, it's quite difficult to justify shelling out another three hundred bucks for the exterminator if the crusher can already perform essentially all my desired games at 1080p 60fps.

I am unsure if I want an oculus, because I think its best to wait a couple years for the technology to lower in price and get better before making such a large investment, but I know that the exterminator will be oculus ready if I chose so.  HOWEVER, my thought process is that although the exterminator is oculus ready right now, if I buy an oculus in 2-4 years from now, which is the MINIMUM amount of time I would wait to buy an oculus for gaming, will the exterminator if I would build it right now STILL be perfectly great for newer oculus technology that's released in 2-4 years? or i will i need to upgrade processors and graphics card or ram all over again?

**PLEASE PLEASE HELP ME WITH THIS DIFFICULT DECISION BETWEEN THE CRUSHER AND EXTERMINATOR! ALSO SIDE NOTE, THIS PC WILL ALSO BE USED FOR KODI A LOT OF THE TIME.**

**LIST of games I plan on playing (whether through steam, origin, or other console emulation):**

*gta 5
*just cause 3
*modern warfare 3
*cod world at war
*cod black ops 2 or 3
*halo 1
*gears of war
*battlefield 4
*star wars battlefront

	<TITLE> What are your Pax 2 using methods? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-13 05:56:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Two days ago I posted whether or not to keep my pax 2, tried some different things and got super blazed off of it twice now since then and have decided I fucking love the pax and am keeping it.

I am curious about everyone's exact method of using the pax 2, and by exact method I mean down to the seconds of everything.

Since two days ago I first grind my herb very fine, and pack it with some wiggle room. Next I start on a 2 then progress to a 3 and then 4. I take 7-8 hits on each setting.  For my hits, I inhale hard for 4 seconds, hold for 1.5 seconds, then wait for exactly 15 seconds until my next hit and repeat. I don't stir my package at all.

Doing this got me blazed for 2.5-3 hours with a nice clear heavy head high and slight/moderate body high.

What are your exact methods? I'm very curious to hear and hear the results you have.

	<TITLE> Should I sell my pax 2? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-10 21:36:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm very very conflicted over whether or not to sell my pax 2 to someone who wants to buy that is offering cash right now. Ive had my pax for several months but never can get really high off of it. If I ever do get high it lasts for so little time. When I use it it takes like 10-15 minutes to feel anything compared to a bong which takes 10 seconds.  I need a strong arguement on it right now because part of me wants to keep it because everyone says online they can get high off of it, but everytime I try I can't get really high. I don't know what I'm doing wrong but I've never got blitzed to like a 6 out of 10 or higher 

EDIT: managed to find a method to get UBER BLITZED with my pax, fucking love it now, awesome device. KEEPING IT!!!! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was a grasshopper follower, (never got a chance to preorder), i spoke to trevor back last may about getting my preorder out in july, its already december, and almost two years or whatever since the campaign ended. I used to check this subreddit twice a month. but stopped back in mid august when they said they were almost ready. my curiosity somehow overcame me today and i wanted to check this subreddit and expected to see loads and loads of forums of people talking about their grasshoppers, sharing pictures, etc. this is just fucking hilarious to come here today after not being here in almost 5 months, and see that absolutely zero has changed. sorry to say guys, my guess is those of you that preordered arn't getting them until next december, as in december 2015 at the EARLIEST. most likely sometime in 2016. and this im sure of. this just cracked me the fuck up coming back here to look at this page. I feel really sorry for you guys who donated money to their campaign and expected results. i understand its a gamble with shit like indiegogo, but nevertheless, this is still fucking hilarious how these guys at the grasshopper team have been pulling everyone's balls saying "oo its coming soon" for almost two years now. these dudes are taking so long that i quit weed in the time its been taking them just to get little parts months and months apart! all i know is, this did provide me a nice laugh and a smh moment. just wow </TEXT>

	<TEXT> like many of you im assumming, i was hoping to make the grasshopper my first vape, and was planning on getting in on the preorders after i messaged trevor. welp, looks like thats not happening for months. dont spend you're summer without a good vape. im seeing eminem, going skydiving, going camping, and going baked to six flags and some crazy shit. and i definitely dont wanna be vapeless during these times. so ive decided its time to either purchase a pax. fuck what u say about conduction or the price or shit. at least i can press buy and itll be in my mail within three days with a free grinder. i encourage you all to join me :)

ps: if not, have fun w/ bitches on the beach without vapes this summer </TEXT>
