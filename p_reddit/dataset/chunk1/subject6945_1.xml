	<TEXT> Yeah, I realized I messed up. But you have to understand the guy was extremely manipulative. He was a good guy, when he wanted to be. I figured by doing him favors he'd stop being a dick, but I was wrong. Oh well. Hindsight is 20/20 I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As in lockboxes? We weren't allowed to have them. If an RA or campus safety saw a lockbox or safe in our room they'd confiscate it under suspicion. Happened to my friend Jordan when he got in trouble. Long story short they found a box cutter in his room (he's a stock boy for a store) and confiscated a safe that he kept his grinder, bowl and rolling papers in. I thought I hid my stuff well enough, I took old socks and put them in the pockets of dirty clothes. I think it's worth mentioning that Mario was my roommate because he was banned from the other residence halls and we were constantly bothered by our RAs because of his past.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went to school in Syacuse New York last year for two semesters. Dropped out due to poor grades, stress and anxiety. The latter two were brought upon by my roommate my second semester, we'll call him Mario. 

This first two paragraphs are backstory so you can skip those if you want. 

My first semester was great. I lived in a triple dorm with my best friend (that we'll call Jim) and then another kid that we knew from playing tennis in high school (we'll call him Rick). The whole first semester consisted of going to frat parties and playing madden and just having a great time, I finished my first semester with a 2.9, not great but not bad. At the end of the semester Jim and his girlfriend broke up so he dropped out due to the depression and he also didn't do very well on account of the frat parties. For the first month of the second semester it was just me and Rick hanging out. Going to parties, playing tennis and just having a good time like normal, until Mario came along. Now Mario, he was a character. He was a gangbanger from the east coast, covered in tattoos, wrote rap songs (that were awful) and was friends with other gangbangers on campus. (If you hadn't guessed I didn't go to SU, it was a community college). It started out fine. He was respectful of our routine, played video games with us and was a cool guy. We actually wrote a few songs with him singing/rapping over me playing guitar chords and played at open mics and at parties. He was becoming a good friend. Then, something clicked, he knew that we were scared to piss him off or disagree due to the fact that he was extremely aggressive and his posse was intimidating. 

One day I came back after my classes and saw the entire room rearranged, He texted me earlier in the day and told me Rick was okay with it (2/3 people in the room agreed so I didn't argue even though I was pissed). So whatever. Then Rick  comes back and same thing, he didn't bother to argue. So Mario leaves and we start bitching at each other, we had a good setup. And the way the room wa smoked around basically made it so my desk was cramped between my bed and Marios bed so I had no room. Apparently, Mario told Rick I was okay and he told me that Rick was okay with it. He fucked us over, and it got worse from there:

- My video games started disappearing, I'm assuming he stole them. GTA V, FIFA 15 and Mortal Kombat X. 
- He stole money from my wallet and also smoked my weed and cigarettes when I wasn't in the room, I know this because Rick told me. And I started hiding it and it would still end up missing (should've his it better) 
- Multiple times he tried to break into my computer to "play NBA 2k" even though he has it for Xbone 
- He would steal food, my grandmother made me brownies and I came back from a party to eat them and the box was empty on his desk
- He would bring his posse over when I would have friends or a girl over and kick us out. He would basically bully them until they left. 
- I let him borrow my Mac so he could type a paper because his laptop broke, he returned it and my wallpaper was changed and there were a bunch of programs that he installed onto it
- He stole PS3 controllers from me and gave them to his friends. I had six when I went to school and left with two. I went to his friends apartment to buy weed and found one of my controllers on his coffee table (i carved my name on the back of it) 
- He stole phone chargers from me, I was buying a new charger every month until I decided enough was enough and only charged my phone in my other friends room.
- He used my ecig without my permission and was going through my juice like a madman, a 15ml bottle of juice would normally last me two weeks and when he started using it i was running out within days 
- I confronted him about stuff that was missing and he got in my face and started screaming at me, telling me that I'm disrespecting him and to back the fuck off, when I threatened to report him to campus police because of it he threatened to have his friends jump me, and actually had some of them follow me around when I would go on walks or go to class. I was terrified. 

It might seem petty or immature to blame him for the reason to drop out but he really was. I have OCPD, and he would fuck my routines up and destroy the room and it got to the point that I would go days without going in due to the fact that I couldn't be comfortable there. Your room is supposed to be somewhere you feel safe, and I would've rather been on the Gaza Strip than be there. I had to go to counseling just to be able to go near the school and see my friends in Syracuse, I'm alright now, but I'm never stepping foot in that building again. In hindsight i should have had more of a backbone rather than be a doormat, but I prefer to avoid confrontation, I wish I didn't do that. But it was a learning experience. Don't be too trusting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know you said you're biased but top five? Really? What does the rest of your list look like? He's definitely top five for the time he played but all time is a bit of a stretch. Personally I'd put him in the top 20. That's not to say he isn't extremely talented, but he was wasn't that dominant for too long and it seems like he's disappeared the past few years.

My top five: 

1) Rice
2) Moss
3) Owens
4) Largent
5) Harrison </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really is the only gripe I have with UE. Even the gnasher stuff doesn't bother me as much (not saying it's not annoying, but I don't hate it as much as  a lot of other players I talk to). I lost count of how many times I've matched up in social playlists in UE with my friends and we get stomped by players that are a lot better than us. One of my friends barely plays anymore because of it. I don't dislike it that much, I still have fun, bud I'd really like to see a good ranking system.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a Tae Kwon Do tournament when I was 15 I got knocked the fuck out by the guy I was sparring. The video went all around the school and one of the upperclassmen sent it to Daniel Tosh and it was on his Facebook page for a while. I asked the guy to take the original video down (it was 3 and a half minutes long and showed the second hit and a bunch of the spectators freaking out) and he put up just the first minute (which shows the first kick to the head. Ended up with a concusion and having to go to counseling because of the bullying. Jokes on them though because I still won. Guy got DQ'd. People also ignore the fact that him and I became good friends afterward. The only bad part about that is because it was my fourth concussion I had to stop playing contact sports. 8/10 would do it again for $100.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I may have posted this before but I had also written an essay on it my freshman year of college. 

2007, Bills vs Cowboys. I was 11. First NFL game. 

Romo and the offense were playing like shit, he threw five picks and there was just no chemistry. We got that onside kick near the end and as time winded down we sent in Nick Folk to win the game. He kicks a 56 yarder, his career best and just barely makes it. We freaked the fuck out. Then we find out that the Bills iced him and we were deflated instantly. Then he lines up to kick it again, The Ralph was insanely loud. He kicks it and it goes perfectly down the middle. WE ERUPTED! From that moment on I was a die hard Dallas fan.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Title should be self explanatory. Basically you can pick any currently retired NFL player to play for you for this season (including postseason) and they will be in their prime. But they can't have ever suited up for your team. For example:

Cowboys fans can't choose Emmitt Smith, neither can Cardinals fans. 
Ravens fans can't choose Ed Reed, neither can the Texans or Jets. 

So anyway my choice would probably be Barry Sanders. #20 behind our current Oline would be unstoppable. Who would you guys choose?  </TEXT>

I was so unbelievably hyped for this game. Aliens is my favorite franchise ever along with my dads favorite. Him and I split the preorder cost and even got the special edition and the season pass. We went to the midnight release together and everything. We got home after getting the game...loaded it up...and were immediately disappointed. The first mission was cool, when you first land on LV426. But as soon as you started fighting other humans him and I realized it was a lost cause. I hadn't preordered a game since up until Fallout 4 was announced. But A:CM ruined my dreams. Luckily Alien: Isolation was awesome as hell.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to be a huge stoner starting at 15. I'm 19 now and have been sober since May 10th of this year. There were a lot of reasons I quit. I was spending a lot of money on it, I was doing horrible at college and the increased paranoia and anxiety started to control my life. I don't believe that marijuana is a gateway drug, it was for me but not for the rest of my stoner pals and other ents that I know. I went from weed to painkillers to coke and then combinations of all of three of them. I quit those three and focused on cigarettes, and I quit smoking those last Monday. As far as why I don't smoke weed anymore? I don't enjoy being high anymore. It brings back all the bad memories and panic attacks and it just isn't worth it. Do I miss it? I guess so. But that's not who I am anymore.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like that's been happening to me a lot. I've noticed it my whole life really. Whenever I have a goal in mind I always strive to achieve it and I always seem to fall just short. I just feel like whenever there is something nice that happens to me or is about to happen something swoops in and makes it unreachable again. It's almost as if life or God or even my mind is playing tricks on me. Like, imagine happiness as a download bar, and every time the bar gets to 99% it shoots all the back down to 20%. Then you work tirelessly to get back up to that 99% only for it to jump down to 50%. That's just how I've been feeling about things. This is my first post and I'm not sure if I'm breaking any rules with it, I looked at other posts and the sidebar and I think I'm alright. But if I'm messing up I'll gladly fix it. Anyway, thanks for reading this if you did. I know it was probably weird but that's the only way I can describe what I'm feeling.  </TEXT>

But I appreciate what you wrote, it's not gonna stop me from preordering, or buying Day One DLC, or buying early access games (even though neither of us brought that up, but that's another thing people on Reddit love to hate) but it is gonna make me more aware of who I preorder from. I'm still going to preorder from developers I trust such as From Software or Bethesda, not so much from the likes of EA.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [REQUEST] Killing Floor 2 PC </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-13 03:16:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello /r/GiftofGames, I'm here to ask for Killing Floor 2. My name is Jake and I am a college student living in Syracuse, New York. I want Killing Floor 2 because Killing Floor 1 is one of my favorite games of all time and I had recently played KF2 at my cousin's house. I ask for your help because I have just finished my second semester of college. I would be purchasing this game myself, but the summer job that I was given has been withdrawn due to the deterioration of my mental health. Throughout this past semester I had dealt with the death of my grandfather, my best friend and roommate dropping out of school and working two hours away from me and also the divorce of my aunt and uncle, two people that practically raised me. This Monday I will be going to Liverpool for a psychological evaluation and the money I have to pay for the ride to the Therapists office will be enough to dry the well for the next few weeks (or even greater if I end up having something that requires a medication). 

Killing Floor 1 is in my top five video games. It is actually the reason I spent the money on a gaming PC two years ago. The gunplay, the intensity and the fun with friends made it almost addicting. I never got suck of picking it up and playing 10 rounds on Manor. And the frantic firefights never ceased to surprise me. I lov everything about the game. From the soundtrack to the characters and weapons. The maps and monsters are some of my favorite in a video game as well. 

As I stated earlier, I played a few matches of Killing Floor 2 last weekend at my cousins house. It was somehow better than I had hoped it would be. The new reload animations are fantastic and the revolutionized store and overall interface of the game make it feel new but not different from its predecessor. I really want this game so I can play with my cousins and other Steam friends as they have all moved on from KF1. One other thing I admire is that it really helps me unwind after a long day. Blasting away endless waves of grotesque creatures is like Chicken Soup for the Soul. 

In short, I'm hoping one of you will read this and help a broke college that has been going through a lot of hard times his past few months. If you do I will be eternally grateful, and promise to return the favor once I get back on my feet. Thank you for reading. If I messed up any formatting or forgot anything please let me know, as this is my first time posting on this subreddit.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey all, I'm looking for the most powerful gaming laptop available within my budget of $1500. 

I have a Desktop currently but I want to be able to play the games that I play on my desktop when I travel and also for LAN parties. 

The only thing I really care about is the screen size, 17 inches is preferred but I'm open to any and all suggestions. 

I'm going to mainly be playing Counter Strike GO, Civilization 5, Skyrim and other games I dabble in are H1Z1, DayZ, Shadow of Mordor, and Diablo 3. 

I also want at least 8 GB RAM but 16 would also be nice if I decide to stream with it. 

I'm going to have $1500 to spend and I'm looking to spend all $1500.

	<TITLE> Suggestions for a person new to horror films. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-18 04:56:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a friend and she is nervous about anything horror, so I was wondering what are some movies to watch with someone that hasn't ever watched a horror movie before, but also one that isn't too scary. A stepping stone if you will. I want to introduce her to horror movies because it's another way for us to spend time together. 

I had two movies in mind, tell me what you think (open to any and all criticism/ideas)

- Godsend, one of the first horror movies I ever watched. Maybe not so much horror as it is a thriller but there are quite a few jump scares, not too graphic from what I remember. 

- Saw, I know not a lot of people are fans of torture porn but I feel this one is a classic. The suspense is constant and the atmosphere is one of my personal favorites. 

Again, I'm asking for your help so any and all ideas are welcome. Thanks!  </TEXT>

My dad has a friend that builds computers for a living and he sent me a build, but then I had one of my friends that builds computers for a living and he sent me one. I want to go with my friends because it seems to have a better graphics card and it is cheaper. Do you think you guys could help me decide which one is the better deal?

My Friends: http://pcpartpicker.com/p/2hyl8
My Dad's Friends: http://imgur.com/ALOciTr

List of games I'm planning on playing:

* Natural Selection 2 
* Killing Floor
* Dishonored
* Left 4 Dead 2
* Counter Strike: Global Offensive
* Starcraft 2
* Red Orchestra 2
* Amnesia: Machine for Pigs
* Amnesia: The Dark Descent
* Sanctum 2
* Orcs Must Die 2
* Farcry 3
* Skyrim
* Battlefield 4
* Titanfall (not released)

The most demanding games are going to probably Natural Selection and Battlefield 4.

	<TEXT> Hey r/teenagers, I'm in need of advice from people that I can (hopefully) relate to. A very good friend of mine is a really big party person. The thing is, she wasn't always like this. She was  sober for the past 6 months up until her most recent boyfriend broke up with her, since then (a little under a month ago) her life has been about the next beer in her hand. but right now, even as I'm typing this she's at her third house party in a row. I was talking to her this morning about her drinking, and she told me that she wants to stop, but can't. I'm hanging out with her Tuesday all day and also all day Friday. Basically, what I'm asking is if any of you have ever been in this situation? What are the best things I could do to help her?

Tl;Dr Friend is drinking her problems away, want to help, what do?

I'm a guy for the record, if that helps at all   </TEXT>

So naturally, I see her in school, give her a hug and tell her that I missed her, I knew something was wrong and should have stopped there. But I didn't. Because I'm stupid. The school day ends and I get home. She posts a picture on instagram and I like/comment on it. She doesn't acknowledge my comment but acknowledges everyone elses...hmmm...about 15 minutes ago, I'm sitting on my couch and got a message from her on Facebook that basically said,"You creep me out. The touching isn't cute or funny anymore, it's really disturbing. I really don't want to be your friend anymore." And that was that. Not only do I still have goosebumps, but I'm not even upset, I'm just...numb...anything you guys can do to help cheer me up?

Note: I took this girl to prom, spent loads of money on her, and I visited her in the hospital. And honestly, I don't want to try and fix this. I just want to feel...better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My cousin and one of our friends both have Macs and can't stop saying good things about them. Today I went to the Apple website and picked out what I want my MacBook to come with, here's what I have so far. 

13-Inch MacBook Pro w/ OSX Mountain Lion 
Retina Display
2.5 GHz
Dual Core i5
128 GB
USB Superdrive
Backlit Keyboard
Pages
Numbers
Keynote
Apple TV
Thunderbolt Cable [2.0 m] 

the final cost is about $1900, money isn't that big of an issue as of late, but since this is my first Mac, I can honestly say that I do not know what to expect.

EDIT: I'm planning on using my MacBook for video and audio editing, as well as school work. And of course miscellaneous internet browsing. I'm not too worried about gaming on my Mac, I have a Playstation 3 for a reason.

EDIT 2.0 : Thanks for the help guys!  </TEXT>
