	<TEXT> In mostly every arc the SH split up in groups (duo but mostly trios). I really like when Nami and Usopp team up its always [funny!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mlnn0hSVyRU). But we hadn't a team yet where Robin and Brooke are together, this would be very interesting to see. Which is your favourite SH team ?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> No Couples in One Piece? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-09 14:45:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone! Did you notice that in hole One Piece story there are no couples, like a married man and woman (or they are together)?

If you are a pirate you will leave your family (Yassop, Dragon, Gol D Roger, Devil Diaz) and if you were married Oda will kill your spouse or let them die (Queen Otohime, Zephyr's wife, Tom, Vivi's Mother, Robin's Father)

The only couple I know of are Sabo's Parents. Don't understand me wrong I don't need a love story in OP, but I think it's really interesting. Of all the main characters we know like the Supernova, the Yonko, the Admirals, the Vice-Admirals and the Shichibukai. 

What do you think ?

	<TITLE> What do all Strawhats have in common? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-01 16:22:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> H everybody! 
First of all I wanted to say I find it suuuuper to find so many like-mindes OP Fans here, who love the series like I do. I've been reading OP for more then 10 years now and its been a ride :-)

So my question (or observation) is that the Strawhats have many things in common Such like everyone of them lost somebody really close to them before they joined the crew (maybe except for Sanji). Each of them has a dream that he only could achieve outside on the wide Ocean.

I think Jimbei really fit into the schematic, his dream could be to fulfill his promise to Ace and protect Luffy, that's one of the reasons why I think Rebecca is not gonna join the Crew, because her dream is (like Vivi) to rebuild here kingdom. But let me hear what you think, do they have more in common?

PS: You're all awesome!  </TEXT>
