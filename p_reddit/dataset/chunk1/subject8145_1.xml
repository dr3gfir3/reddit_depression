	<TEXT> Hi! I just discovered this subreddit so I'm excited there's a reasonably active LDS reddit community!

I've never gone to the temple outside of doing temple baptisms. I'm just curious about what people's personal opinions are on the matter.

I guess I can't find the logic that allows someone who abuses their body with fast food and taking more than their fair share or food needs being allowed into the temple when people who drink coffee and tea are not allowed into the temple.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What do you guys think about this Romney holding John Lauber down and cutting his hair off? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-05-10 23:48:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Washington Post article: Romney cut off John Lauber's hair. John Lauber was a "presumed homosexual"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/mitt-romneys-prep-school-classmates-recall-pranks-but-also-troubling-incidents/2012/05/10/gIQA3WOKFU_story.html)

First off, if this actually happened, not cool.

I guess I have a few comments or questions. 

1. Was John Laubner ACTUALLY gay? In the article, they referred to him as "presumed homosexual". Does anyone know if he was actually gay? I feel like in r/news everyone is assuming Laubner WAS gay and saying it's a hate crime. 

2. I find it weird this story is breaking within a day of so of Obama coming out in favor of gay marriage (after his inept VP forced his hand on the issue). If Romney has been "running for president for 6 years", why has this story never come up before? According to the article, Laubner has been dead for 3 years so it's not like we can ask him.

3. I'm still not voting for Obama. I think that people who are extremely irate about this would not have voted for Romney in the first place. 


Just curious what you guys think or comments you may have about the situation.

edit: answer to my 1st question ... I heard on the radio that Lauber came out as homosexyal later in life.

Romney response to the story:I had no idea that this person might have been gay I participated in a lot of hijinks and pranks during high school and some may have gone too far. And for that I apologize. and  I dont remember that incident. I certainly dont believe that I thought the fellow was homosexual. That was the furthest thing from our minds back in the 1960s.

	<TEXT> I bought some new running pants that are SUPER cute! I havent bought specifically marketed "running clothes" in a long time because my main workouts have been lifting weights or yoga.

But I did start running and I got some running pants. 

HOWEVER I wore them to lift weights and as I was squatting down to do cleans I had that realization that the last pair of running crops were totally see through. 

So I pulled a trainer aside (female) and asked her to follow me outside. She  checked my ass out during a deep squat. And they were not see through. Finished my cleans (95# if you're wondering). 

TLDR; thought my running crops were see through (like my other experiences with tight running pants). squat check. they werent. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a lot of people liked Moon with Sam Rockwell (2009). 

For some reason Take Shelter reminded me of the feeling I got while watching Moon. I kind of liked Take Shelter a littel more even.

They arent really like each other plot-wise (I honestly cant remember what Moon was about) but I just remember having the same feeling while watching.

Take Shelter is a slow burn. 

If any of you guys have seen both and have comments on why I might make a connection b/n the two movies, I'd love to hear them! I have no clue why I think if you like Moon you should watch Take Shelter.

	<TEXT> This might be a silly question but I met a guy at my box a few weeks ago who started a Crossfit gym in Iceland (he looks like a Norse god)! He says it's a small community and at their first games they hosted, he had about 4-500 participants. 

I see other people posting from other countries on here as well. So it's cool to see Crossfit start to spread beyond the US's borders!

I was curious though how other countries handle the hero workouts? Do they understand it's in honor of Americans who died in combat? Or do they just do Helen and go about their day? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I havent really run since high school and maybe a little bit of college. I'm 30 now.

I wanted to run but found I had no time. I have a hard enough time getting up early as it is and find my legs are jelly in the morning, so I dont run before I go to work. After work, I am teaching yoga or I go to Crossfit the other two days so I just dont have time. 

So I have started running during lunch. About 15 min travel time to and from the trail. About 30 min to run. And then there's the cleanup. Currenlty I have a rag and towel I hide in my office. And I brought soap. 

I dont know, am I doing it wrong? I feel like baby wipes wont take care of the issue during the humid summers in GA.

My hair can hold sweat well enough. I have curly hair that is usually up. Would you guys suggest a dry shampoo?

Or if you could post your work running routine, I'd like to hear it because I'm super interested in the "lives of runners". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sound so American! I NEED IT FAST AND IMMEDIATELY.

But I'm not looking to eat a large lunch bc I kind of take care of that during breakfast and dinner! 300 cals would be fine. 

And I'd like to stay mainly vegetarian (but low cal easy meat stuff will be appreciated. 

I dont want any yogurt or milk either.

Also, I really am trying to remove processed food from my diet. So I'd prefer things to be "whole" foods. No juices, etc.

I was thinking things like carrots and hummus, I guess a premade sandwich (sometimes those dont keep in the fridge so well though ...)? 

Are any of you guys in similar situations? Do  you have any suggestions besides just apples and bananas and stuff? 

Thank you in advance! And if some of the whole foods, non processed stuff is too restrictive, just throw out suggestions! I'm really all ears.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The ice cream they make at the demo is different than the one in the Vitamix recipe book.

The Costco recipe looks something like this.

* 1 cup French Vanilla creamer (like a coffeemate liquid brand)

* 1/2 package of Instant Vanilla pudding (must be instant)

* 2 cups ice. If you use frozen fruit, then subtract that volume you use from the frozen ice. The ice should go over the 2 cup line a little bit. (so if you use 1 cup frozen strawberries, use 1 cup of ice).

* (optional) if you want to do the veggie trick, you can add a slice of cabbage and the equivalent of 3 baby carrots or something. 



And when they make it at Harry's, they use like a coconut cream instead of the French Vanilla Creamer. And they use whatever instant vanilla pudding they have at Harry's in lieu of the Costco brand.


This is super easy and I remember it being super yum.

But just a side question: The Vitamix guy doing the demonstration at costco was making ice cream and he added like carrots and I am pretty sure the second ingredient was cabbage. He said those two added together complemented each other to result in a vanilla flavor. Is this a well known thing or did I hear him wrong? 

The ice cream tasted legit so who am I to argue? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-01-11 18:37:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From The Atlantic.

Thus far, European media voices have also expressed a strong preference for Romney over the other contenders. Clemens Wergin, for example, writes for Die Welt that the results in Iowa "show how uncertain the conservative movement in America is of its own identity." Mitt Romney represents the "classic, pragmatic, business-oriented branch." Then there's the "Christian, archconservative" side represented by Rick Santorum. Ron Paul "stands for the anti-state, radical libertarian impulses of America and for many populist reflexes. At the same time he's the candidate from whom there is the most to fear."

So Europeans like Mitt Romney and seem scared of Ron Paul?

	<TITLE> Romney taking flack for Bain capital and firing people? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-11 18:04:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few thoughts on this: 

1. Businesses exist to make profit, right? Not to create jobs. As long as the business practices don't hurt the rights of others (like trading sub prime derivatives), what Romney did at Bain can be part of his record (and we can discuss that and talk about how many jobs he actually made - like, that I dont mind)... but I dont understand why CONSERVATIVES are knocking on him for making millions in the private sector. 

(Also: When he worked for the SLC Olympics ... he didnt take his salary there. Versus Newt Gingrich with his Fannie Mae connection).

2. I'd rather have Romney take risks with investors money than what Obama did with taxpayers money with Solyndra. 
Which leads me to a question: What the government did with taxpayers money and Solyndra ... was that the same thing that Romney's company did at Bain? I honestly don't know.

3. Firing people. I would like someone to reduce the size of government. Wouldnt that mean people are going to be fired?! I'm okay with that.

The only person that came to Romney's defense was Ron Paul. I dont know if this is a valid complaint against Romney among conservatives or if Newt and Santorum are grasping at straws. I'm interested in other [conservative] people's thoughts on this. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How would I go about finding my biological father if I've never met him and he lives in a different country? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-07 07:07:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I dont know if this is the appropriate subbreddit. BUTTT here goes.

In short, my biological father lives in the former Yugoslavia ... somewhere.

He came here on a green card or work visa. It expired and he had to go back home. But during his 1-2ish year stay in the US, he impregnated my mom with me! (When mom got pregnant with me, she was actually dating this US guy in the Air Force. The AF guy had a vasectomy and he knew the baby wasnt his. They got a paternity test anyways and found out for sure that I wasnt his. He stayed around till mom had me though. And signed my birth certificate. But left shortly after that.) 
(You are NOT the father)


All I know is that my biological father was in the USA when my mom got pregnant. I know his first and last name. And I have a book and an old letter written in Serbian or whatever he speaks. Someone kind of translated it but the letter wasnt written to me. It was written to someone else and he mentions knowledge of me. And he mentioned some other kids of his (I found out about this letter when I was like ... 14, and Im under the impression they are younger than me).  

My mom is getting older and cant really fill in too much for me. I have a book about a city called Ljubjiana (this is from memory ... I just moved so I dont know where the book actually is right now). And it had an address taped inside but I couldn't find the address on google maps or anything. But found something that sounded almost like it in Slovenia. But mom has always told me they lived in Serbia. 

Mom and I have always been a little too worried about my stepdad's feelings to really pursue getting in contact with my biological father (my stepdad raised me since I was 4). But now I'm 30 years old .... I mean, if not now, when?!

So if  you guys could give me some starting points. Can I talk to some embassy and explain and see if they could pull some immigration records? Or what? I have no clue where to really start. I tried to google his name but his last name is fairly common and I doubt a 50, 60 year old guy from the former Yugoslavia has a strong internet presence. 

Sidenote: My biological dad's roommate used to live in the US and probably still does. My mom was good friends with his American wife. But they've been divorced for a long time and my mom hasnt talked to them in over 20 years. 

Anyways, yes! Help me out!! Or send me to another subbreddit. Or something. What could I do? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Falcons - Saints Christmas Poem </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-12-27 02:59:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Twas the night after Christmas, when all through the Dome

Not a Falcon was stirring, as the game wasnt Home

The team had flown down to New Orleans to fight

Their most hated foe on a crisp Monday Night.


The fanbase was settled all snug in their seats

While Jon Gruden suckled on Sean Paytons teats

And Berman and TJ, Keyshawn and Cris

All picked the Saints in a one-sided diss


When out on the field a coin toss occurred

The Falcons had won, and did not defer

Mularkey began with a run up the middle

And like we expect, it gained not a diddle


Coach Mike Smiths hair was like new fallen snow

Contrasting quite sharply with his red face below

When, what to our wondering eyes should appear

But a play-action pass, received with a cheer


Into no huddle took Matt Ryan the team

An audible came: a route up the seam

Methodically up the field they came

And Wes Durham shouted and called them by name!


Now Roddy, now Turner, Now Tony Gonzalez!

On Jones! On Harry! On Matty and Jacquizz!

To the Red Zone they went! To the pylon the throw!

And a Julio touchdown completed the show.


As expected with Brees, the Saints were not fazed.

They took to the field, and our defense was razed.

To Graham a thirty-five yarder ensued

And fans held their heads, all hope subdued.


The gains came in bunches, the safeties were rocked

The Saints scored a touchdown, the Falcons were shocked

But Smitty was calm, with a sly knowing grin

A rivalry game is no easy win


So the offenses traded their blows with precision

And the defenses were bathed in their fandoms derision

At halftime the score stood tighter than most

17-14, with the edge to the Host


The third quarter came, and the Saints took the ball

But the Birds defense held and put up a wall

The Falcons no-huddle returned the field

And half-time adjustments the offense revealed


They shredded the corners, they marched on the line

The yards came in bunches, they scored in good time

The Saints fans stood slackjawed, their giddiness stomped

It seemed that the Saints wouldnt win in a romp


The game rambled on until three minutes remained

The Saints were down four, with 80 to gain

They started to march and all hope seemed to fade

The Saints would win, it was all a charade


And there on the thirty, some pressure applied

Drew Brees saw it coming, his feet went to slide

But Abrahams hand came down on his arm

Brees fumbled the ball! The Saints were appalled


Matty kneeled the ball three times in succession

While Saints fans went home to greet their depression

The Falcons had won! They never froze up!

Merry Christmas to all! The Falcons Rose Up.

	<TITLE> NYTimes: "The Problem with Serving Sizes" - How would you ideally like to see serving sizes on packaged foods? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-12-22 19:27:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [The Problem with Serving Sizes](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/the-problem-with-serving-sizes/)

Another product that made the list of egregious offenders was cooking sprays, which list nutritional information based on ridiculously tiny serving sizes, the group said. One of the most popular, PAM, boasts zero calories and zero fat on the label of its original canola cooking spray. But that information refers to a spray lasting just a quarter of a second.

Thats just not the way people use them, Mr. Jacobson said. Its probably impossible to spray for a third of a second. We suggested six seconds might be kind of reasonable. A six-second spray, he said, has 50 calories and six grams of fat.

I think redoing the serving sizes would be helpful but it's kind of hard to legislate that.

But I was doing the calories for my soup today. And the soups come packaged in 2 separate containers (This is the Costco soups). And, this is going off my memory, but I eat about half of 1 of the containers per meal. And there are 3.75 servings in the whole product. So each container has 1.875 servings? And then I divide that by two and figure out I have about 0.94 servings ... It's a little ridiculous on the math there. Or I could be reading the serving sizes wrong and the servings are actually 3.75 PER container and not 3.75 servings per 2 containers (as it comes packaged in). Thinking about this and writing it out, I'm sure they mean there are 3.5 servings in each container and not mixed b/n both containers. Eff!

Anyways, I had this nightmare of a calorie calculation and then I ran across this NYTimes article and I thougth it might provoke interesting discussion

I know polls are "BS" but ... I can Newt losing to Obama 20 points.  Its going to all be about Newts baggage (And I hate to use that Restore Our Future word). 

Newt has Congress, the only thing with a lower approval rating than Obama, written all over him.

And I remember reading a nytimes article where you're going to have a family man, young attractive, black male versus an old, fat white guy.

But I would love to see an Obama, Newt debate. But curiousity isnt going to send my vote Newt's way. . . . 

I honestly think Newt wants more book deals or tenure somewhere. I dont know if he realized he could actually win the nomination! I think his wife Calista is totally unlikable! She's a mistress and she's rumored to be the reason the campaign staff quit en masse. 

I dont know! Convince me otherwise, reddit!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have an older gentleman that comes to yoga. His doctor recommended him to try out yoga for his back. And his back is SO much better! 

But most of the times, when he does triangle, half moon, and sometimes even warrior III he'll come out of the pose because of his hip. And he comes out of it fairly fast ... like he'll be okay and then all of a sudden it's a cramp?  

What's going on here? I'm not a doctor. Im guessing I should avoid these poses when i see him? Or are there some modifications where we might introduce movement into his hips without hurting though? </TEXT>

If you dont have that experience but have some ideas, share those as well! 

PS. Im a tall girl so pull ups just arent coming easy to me!

	<TEXT> So latest news is Gingrich and Romney are the new frontrunners. And Cain, last I heard, has a woman claiming she had a 13 year affair with him coming on tv tonight. 

So I'm just wondering who the Evangelicals will more than likely vote for? Would they waste it on Bachmann? Santorum? Those guys have no chance of being elected in the general election (imho). I can see them throwing support behind Perry though. Or will they close their eyes as they press Romney the Mormon or Caingrich the adulterers in the voting booth? I dont really know because that's not the type of conservative I am (ie, Im not an Evangelical and hardly care about social conservative issues; however I do care about the integrity of the candidate Im voting for). Im just curious who those guys are throwing their political support behind!

"There's a lot of men and women out here like me, Constance. We've been through this war and we just look at things differently than other people our age. I mean, there are certain bars I don't hang in. The people, the conversations, they're too frivolous. I'm not gonna sit around and have drinks with people who are, you know, *ironic*. Being in a classroom, listening to some teacher theorizing, I can't do it. I also wasn't about to take a job in an office and deal with the politics. I woke up one day and knew that I was never gonna have a college degree or wear a tie to work. I was coming up on thirty years old and I realized, I've fallen through the cracks. But I'm luckier than some people I know. I've found something I like to do. My eyes open in the morning and I have purpose."

Constance pushed her plate, now holding only bones, to the side. "You're either the most complicated guy I ever met or the simplest."

"I'm the simplest."

"You're *smart*. You read a bunch. You should try school again."

"Not gonna happen," said Lucas. "Does that bother you?"

"No."

"But it will."

"Maybe." She reached across the table, put her hand over his, and squeezed it. "It doesn't bother me tonight."

Lucas signaled the waitress. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2011-09-30 04:14:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi. Sometimes I just dont end up getting home until after 7 or 8pm. I eat a pretty large breakfast and lunch because my schedule tends to get me home later. And I like eating light dinners anyways. 

Right now it's 10pm and I just got home at 9. I'm starving! Should I just go to bed and do better tomorrow? Or eat? 

I have about 20 lbs to lose and I would like to lose it. I tend to workout at night and have energy and am hydrated for those. So aside from the little pangs of hunger, I feel alright when I don't eat. And when I tend to eat at night, I wake up feeling (sorry if this is TMI) constipated and like the food just sat there. Even when I eat a large green salad (just greens, italian dressing and vinegar to extend the italian dressing. I can eat plain salads just fine) I feel bleh. And if I eat nuts, I feel gross in the a.m. ...

I have a feeling most people will suggest to eat something small. But I just feel like the food isnt doing anything beneficial if I eat something at 9, 10pm!

Should I eat this late at night or not worry about it? 
If I should eat, what can I eat where I don't feel gross in the morning.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Laurie Garvey hadn't been raised to believe in the rapture. She hadn't been raised to believe in much of anything, except the foolishness of belief itself.

We're agnostics, she sued to tell her kids, back when they were little and needed a way to define themselves to their Catholic and Jewish and Unitarian friends. We don't know if there's a God, and nobody else does, either. They might say they do, but they really don't.

The first time she'd heard about the Rapture, she was a freshman in college, taking a class called Intro to World Religions. The phenomenon the professor described seemed like a joke to her, hordes of Christians floating out of their clothes, rising up through the roofs of their houses and cars to meet Jesus in the sky, everyone else standing around with their mouths hanging open, wondering where all the good people had gone. The theology remained murky to her, even after she read the section on "Premillennial Dispensationalism" in her textbook, all that mumbo jumbo about Armageddon and the Antichrist and the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse. It felt like religious kitsch, as tacky as a black velvet painting, the kind of fantasy that appealed to people who ate too much fried food, spanked their kids, and had no problem with the theory that their loving God invented AIDS to punish the gays. Every once in a while, in the years that followed, she'd spot someone reading one of the Left Behind books in an airport or on a train, and feel a twinge of pity, and even a little bit of tenderness, for the poor sucker who had nothing better to read, and nothing else to do, except sit around dreaming about the end of the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First time doing kettlebell snatches. And I'm really awkward with my snatches and cleans because my elbows can not move in sync or they go too far out or I just dont have the rhythm down or something.

But we did this 10! workout (10, 9, 8 ... ) involving the KB snatches. And mine started out horrible. But during the 4th round, I  heard the crossfit trainer whisper to his partner, "you can see that she's getting better."  And it was true! I was wasting a lot of energy doing KB snatches incorrectly (plus, the kettlebell was slapping against my arm roughly bc I was gripping the kettlebell instead of letting my grip loose as I was transitioning the KB above my head). I dont know, it was just neat. I remember what the trainer told me wasnt really clicking ... but once I started and my muscles were like "WTF IS HAPPENING?!!" I was able to naturally find the better movement bc I was overthinking it during the warm up. 

Have you guys ever done a movement really inefficiently and corrected it mid-workout? What was the movement? 

Sorry this is a random, specific topic ....
I am not quite sure if I just over-think things or everyone has this problem </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Taxing the extremely rich. I need some clarification. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-09-14 18:20:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am conservative but I am honestly not heavily invested in politics (I find it draining sometimes). I dont really know the current tax rate for the really rich or who qualifies as extremely rich. 

I am not really seeing what the bfd is about taxing the extremely rich. The CEO of the small business I work at ... is not extremely rich. I dont think he even hits that tip top of the tax bracket. I've been given the impression by the media that the extremely rich are given tax breaks. 

I just think that the refusal of taxing the extremely rich is kind of an odd thing for the Republican party to keep bringing up . . . . 

Does someone have a grasp on this issue? 

I think I still can be conservative and not give a f*ck about the extremely rich tbqh.  I get the wealth re-distribution arguments ... but I think taxing these really really rich guys isnt going to careen us on a path to socialism. Not taxing the too rich is more of a philosophical argument than a practical thing, in my opinion.  Again, the small business owners (the guy I work for) isnt mega-rich. I'm guessing it's these CEOs that own businesses who are headquartered in other countries to avoid taxes in the first place that we're talking about here.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a huge fan of Dr. Fuhrman who is a doctor/nutritionist who encourages a nutritarian lifestyle. Fuhrman suggests you eat a diet high in GOMBS [greens, onions, mushrooms, berries/beans, seeds (nuts)], and that's about it, if you're curious.

He says that most Americans have an addiction to food. Like if you drank coffee 6 times a day and then the next day you didnt drink coffee, you'd feel bad because you have an addiction to coffee and you're going through withdrawal.

Same with the American diet. When your stomach growls, you get headaches, you feel fatigue, weakness, nausea etc is all "pretend"/toxic hunger to Dr. Fuhrman.  

Real hunger is felt as a sensation in the throat. You have increased salivation and a heightened sense of taste.

He says that while you're digesting food and storing calories, you're in the anabolic phase. When you move into the catabolic phase (where you start breaking shit down), that's when the "toxic hunger" arises. It can cause discomfort ... especially if you have a bad diet in the first place. When you eat, you feel better ... but your body starts digesting again and the process starts all over again. 

I remember him mentioning something about how our brain uses up a LOT of energy.  And it's doesnt want us to break down muscle for energy. So it will cue us to eat again before this happens to an appreciable extent.

Do you guys have any thoughts about hunger? And when we actually need food? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I cannot seem to stop pressing the snooze in the am! I have had the same job for years. And when I started Id get to work at 8am. And now its a miracle to get there by 9. 

 I'd like to get in the habit of waking up earlier (like an hour earlier, at least). 

Last night I went to bed at 3am. Tonightts past midnight and I'm wide awake right now. I struggle to get out of the bed in the a.m. but at night, I'm NOT TIRED! I would think my body would BE sleepy at night if I'm not getting enough sleep or whatever . . . Grrrr. 

Has anyone been a notorious night owl and became a person who gets up bright and early? Tell me your secrets. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Amy Fisher on Celebrity Rehab with Dr. Drew. I need to process this. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-08-11 18:17:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was a little too young to get what the real deal was with when the whole Amy Fisher thing went down.  So I am having an odd time trying to process the show this season. 

The other celebrities (their families) calling her Budafucco Face killer or whatever ... Oh my gosh, it's like these adults are in high school! But, on the other hand, I don't really *get* how this shy, frail woman could have shot someone in the face.  When that went down, did Amy Fisher seek out this woman or was it an argument got out of control and Amy, being shy, sought other ways to solve the argument?

Either way, her life has to be hell.  Other people's judgments have sentenced her. On one hand, I feel bad bc she seems so frail its so unfair! But on the other hand she shot someone; do the crime put up with the consequence. Grow some balls, etc. That woman she shot prob still goes through her own struggles daily as a result of Amy's actions. 

So I'm just trying to figure out how to view her and the situation on the reality show. 

Does anyone else have anything comments on Amy Fisher? Have you tried to dissect her? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I think I did TMTS and have a forefoot injury </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-08-10 07:57:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was definitely a heel striker. Then I wanted to try minimalist shoe running. I started out about 1 mile a few days a week for a week or two with the new running style. Then I went on the trails and this deer was on the side of the trail and I was running a new style and the deer didnt run away the wind was in my hair and it was beautiful and I was beautiful and so I ended up running and I got like 2.5miles in and felt a pain on my right foot, b/n my toes and arch - on that flat part there.  And so I had to walk back. And what's done is done, I know I did too much too soon. 

I understand people here arent doctors. I get that. But I have never really had an injury like this in my foot (and I just turned 30). So I have this pain in my right forefoot (left foot feels fine). Walking, I can feel the discomfort but I don't feel like I'd exacerbate whatever is going on there by walking more or less.  When I push on my forefoot with my hands, it hurts more when I push on the *top* half of my foot and not so much the bottom of my foot. But when Im standing and things where I push off using the forefoot would probably make my foot hurt more (like in jumping vertical and running in the minimalist style). I dont know it just makes me nervous to try again because I don't want to further injure the foot. 

What type of injury might I have? Should I stay off the foot and rest it? Or will movement and weight help it get better faster? I am under the impression it's not going to just feel bad one day and the next day it will feel better. I think it's just going to casually morph into a not hurt as bad. But it's been about a week. Has anyone gone through this? Time frame for heal-age? </TEXT>
