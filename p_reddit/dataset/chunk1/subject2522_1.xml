	<TEXT> You are looking at the problem purely materialisticly, which vastly oversimplifies the issue. The problems that arise from modern wealth disparity in developed nations isn't material access, rather opportunity access. The notion of equality in opportunity is rather new, and has driven the development of both communism and democracy. No one will argue that the poor are materially better off now than they have ever been, instead the argument is about creating a level playing field so abilities rather than resources guarantee success however it is defined.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I would argue that my country, the US, is unfit for such a position. We are a nation built on genocide, conquer and war, and since WWII (and especially since 9/11) we've proven that we do not hold any sort of moral high ground or inherent goodness.

Point to one country that has never killed a large population of people or conquered large areas while slaughtering many? US? Killed the Indians. Russia? Killed the Jews and political dissenters. China? Killed the intellectuals and dissenters. Europe? Killed a lot of people everywhere. There is no moral high ground on the global stage. You are a fool to think there ever was or ever could be such a thing. 

Russia is a shadow of its former self. It has been reduced to a squabbling regional power that can't even keep its puppets in power and instead completely disregard the rule based system they accuse the West of abusing, much like a spoiled child that no longer gets its way. The fact is Russia is not a reliable partner and the West missed its chance of making them so in their actions following the collapse of the USSR. 

Unless China matures it will never be a global power. It has no real allies in the world, and is making enemies left and right. If China cannot manage its economic transition they are doomed to the path of Japan or worse. Demographics are not on China's side either. China speaks of a multi-polar world with varying legitmate modes of governance, but what they truly mean is oligarchy and kleptocracy are fine and the people don't matter. Every nation that uses that type of argument is in support of maintaining the rule of the few of that of the many.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, if you do that then marriage is controlled solely by religious institutions. Marriage doesn't mean jack if it is not recognized by some institution. If the state isn't involved what's the difference between dating someone and being married to someone? There isn't. Marriage is a vehicle for the distribution of legal rights. Law is governed by institutions either the state or religion. 

How do you propose legal decision making happening in polyamourous marriages? Do they have to vote? One person can't have more say than the other if the third is incapable for whatever reason. How does a divorce work if two people want to kick out the third? Is property split 2:1? How does it affect parental rights? It gets even worse the larger the group gets.

	<TEXT> This article is typical Chinese 'academic of the party.' None of these talking points are new and all are unsubstantiated. 

 To some extent, the role of the G7 in global economic governance is negative. The IMF and the World Bank are under the control of G7 members. This is one of the reasons for the low implementation capacity of the G20.

This point is a prime example. How is G7 governance negative? Specifically what actions were negative? What alternatives can the Chinese offer? The biggest difference between current US hegemony and that which China hopes to achieve is that China wants to go it alone, building this East vs West reminiscent of the Cold War while alienating their regional allies. While the US may be  the "sole" superpower it can only claim that title standing on the backs of its allies. China has no reliable allies to combat this and the way the Chinese currently project power, they never will.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I imagine the stock markets would take a hit initially and fluctuate with the post-election rhetoric and his choices for the Fed and Treasury Secretary. If his tax increases go through there will be a major reshuffling of assets right before it goes into effect along with significant market volatility in the short term. The problem with progressive agendas is that markets don't like them very much in the short term because the implementation can be an unpredictable process. Campaign finance reform would probably be one of the first to pass along with massive amounts of litigation. Activist litigation is getting huge with all of the private money sloshing around and so much of it at risk with effective reforms. Foreign policy in general does not change much with the president, much of it is entrenched in the bureaucracy of the State Department and DoD (somethings just get put on the back burner waiting for a more favorable National Security Council). Just look at many of the problems Obama had with his Russia reset and trying to close down Guantanamo. TPP wouldn't get thrown out (the US would lose too much face in the region), but would certainly be delayed at least a decade and by the time anything is ready it may well be too late. Chinese economic policy tends to be more nimble because of central government control. 

Those are just a few of the things I can think of. It is important to remember that the entire executive branch isn't replaced with each new president just the management. There may be new directions, but the people doing the actual work are still the same and bureaucratic reform takes *forever.* Any significant changes wouldn't be noticeable until near the end of a second term, by which time a conservative would probably be elected and rollback at least some of the reforms. The American electorate tends to get tired of progressives because it requires so much more work and sacrifice with many of the benefits in the long term. A good example of this is the election of Harding after Wilson.

	<TEXT> There are a few main fields of engineering to consider that are all very different: Civil, Chemical, Mechanical, and Materials. There are sub-divisions beyond these but they are the core of engineers. Bioengineering or Biomedical engineering are just some combo of the others with biology and physiology mixed in. I'm a materials engineer, specifically polymers, my dad is a civil engineer, and my sister is a chemical engineer. If you like to build structures that improve peoples lives then Civil engineering is great. This can range from working for a construction company on buildings, the government on infrastructure or development NGOs that build projects in underdeveloped countries. In my opinion mechanical engineers are the most versatile, I'm including aerospace here. Anything that moves has had a mechanical engineer design or optimize it at some point. MechEs can do things like aircraft/rocket design, cars, or industrial equipment to name a few. Chemical engineers can be found anywhere there are fluids. These engineers design fluid transport systems for things like refineries, chemical plants, nuclear reactors, vacuum pumps are some examples. Materials engineers work on designing the most elementary part of a manmade object: what it is made of. This type of engineering is much more closely related to science than the other fields of engineering at the undergraduate level but is a good mix of both. These types of engineers can work for pretty much any company that manufactures or designs anything. This is a great field with huge opportunities and flexibility for both industry and academia. From the BMEs I've met in industry when working for a medical device company as a research scientist and during undergrad the only recommendation I have is do another field first then get a masters or PhD in it. Don't get an undergrad BME degree, you just don't learn enough detail. I like to say BMEs know a little about a lot and a lot about nothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Polymer Physicist here. Amorphous and crystalline are opposite terms, there is no such thing as an amorphous crystal. Polymers are long chains of molecules that pack together in either a disordered isotropic manner (amorphous phase) or an ordered anisotropic manner (crystalline phase). PET is a semi-crystalline polymer, but nearly 100% amorphous after processing and very slowly forms crystallites as it ages, which is noticeable by increasing opacity and brittleness. Gas molecules diffuse by snaking through the free volume of the polymer. Free volume describes regions of no electron density in a bulk whereby the gas molecule can fit. Only in the amorphous regions where chain packing is inefficient can gaps exist.

Silica Glass, or any other ceramic glass, doesn't have this free volume, it is a disordered ceramic wherein all of the atoms connect to those around it but don't form a repeating pattern, which would make it crystalline. This is what makes glass so much better then a polymer. 

Glass is not necessarily less reactive than a polymer. For example, the only container hydrofluoric acid can be stored in is a high density polyethylene (HDPE) bottle.

	<TEXT> 

If that standard of evidence is used universally for all manslaughter cases then as long as a group of people all shoot someone fatally, but it cannot be proven who fired the ultimate shot, everyone is not guilty. It seems an odd standard. 

This is an important part of criminal law and the reason firing squads were designed the way they were. If you are trying to determine who killed someone there cannot be any doubt the defendants actions individually led to the death of the victim. There is absolutely no way to determine whether the defendant's shot terminated the victim's life. Would the defendant's shots alone been enough to kill the victims? Maybe they were already beyond saving but still alive? The fact there is any doubt means the defendant can not be found guilty. The entire American judicial system is built around the idea that it is better to let 9 guilty men go free then have one innocent man go to jail. Too often, I think people forget this. 

I'm not saying I agree with any of the actions or the lack of severe disciplinary steps for everyone involved, but the law is supposed to be a cold emotionless bitch and shouldn't be swayed by the fervor of others.

	<TEXT> You are kinda out of luck if you are looking for a single good source. You need to piece together articles on specific topics to see the truth and examine the bias. Some have mentioned the Economist, but it is important to know they embody the very definition of liberal, meaning open up everything to everyone to make their own choices, essentially a more pragmatic libertarianism than we see in the States. If you are looking for straight facts and no analyses you can look at the Associated Press, very good for factual details but can be a little shallow on understanding and context. I like to use Feedly to pull articles from various sources and read articles on the same topic to get a better understanding of the subject. It aggregates everything together pretty nicely for comparative reading.

	<TEXT> I agree with you. His argument fails to mention that such a strategy requires no economic hiccups in China. Chinese authoritarian rule is not absolute and never has been. It requires 'benevolent leadership' derived from their Confucian moral philosophy. The Communist Party cannot maintain its style of rule without the economic growth they have had since they instituted market reforms in the '70s. Especially with Xi's reliance on Confucianism to legitimized many of his policies, the Party will inevitably need to become more flexible as their middle class increases. What that will look like is anyone's guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think you can say it is uniquely 'anti-China' bias. It is more the competition of global powers. Powerful nations always try to stay powerful and one way to do so is by limiting the power of others. Though the US is historically unique in that many of its policies result in the strengthening of other nations. Idealistically, the end goal of US foreign policy would result in the US not being the sole global power, but it wants others to play by a clear and transparent set of rules. This is why the US paid for the reconstruction of Europe and Japan. Every other nation in history  would have just let their enemies continue to waste away so as to never really pose a challenge. The push the US is making with China is to make it act more responsibly as a global power and future superpower. In my opinion the future of China is a certainty, a US policy success would not be in 'containing' China but would be getting them to be responsible stewards of an open global economy. This means pushing China into privatizing its state monopolies. State-owned enterprises is why China is pushing its territorial claims so strongly. National dominance only serves state-businesses, open internationally governed waters better serve private business interests. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see this as a much more one-sided alliance than this article portrays. China has a historical mistrust of Russia I don't see subsiding anytime soon. Many of these moves will only benefit China in the long run. The gas deal is part of China's strategy of securing a diverse energy supply. The military exercise will only benefit the Chinese as the seek to pull the expertise of the former super power. The collaboration on space exploration is another way for China to learn from the much more skilled and experienced Russian scientists. These are all moves of an rising power take the assets of a falling power. Russia just wants to maintain its freedom of influence as long as possible while China plays the long game of building up the expertise to become a legitimate super power challenge to American hegemony.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really it depends on what you think the future of the United States should look like and what level you approach it from. My biggest problem with populism is that it makes national governance personal. The fact is it is impossible to make everyone happy. What is best for a country is not necessarily best for a certain group, but in the long run people will adapt and the whole will be better for it.

His opposition to free-trade agreements is rather short-sighted and too inward looking. Take TPP for example. There is extremely vocal opposition for this mainly from blue collar workers, but in fact helps the US flex its comparative advantage muscles. The US is one of the largest agricultural produces and opening access to various Asian markets will boost trade substantial. In addition it will streamline the international regulatory scheme making it easier companies in every country operate internationally. Since this agreement would cover countries that make up nearly 40% of the global GDP it would also be a powerful rules-based system to balance China's less than transparent policies. Economic integration is one of the most powerful forces for peace in the 21st century. By not supporting this agreement it makes it easier for China to exert economic influence primarily through state-owned monopolies which will allow China to push its political will much more forcefully.

His support for tougher regulation on the banking sector and Wall Street is a more delicate issue. Too much pressure can drive business to more friendly regulatory environments, though only to a certain extent given the size of the US economy and the central importance of the dollar as a reserve currency. But the current size of banks are threatening US sovereignty. Nothing should be too big to fail. That means the power to control the economy is in the hands of a private elite with nothing to direct them but the hunt for profits. Keep in mind that business cannot be expected to act any differently as they are legally required to only focus on bringing profit and value to their shareholders or risk being sued and a board put in place that will. The risk needs to be split like it was before the repeal of Glass-Steagall. The system can still operate efficiently, but needs to be less centralized. 

A single payer system would be the most efficient and cost effective way to manage the nations healthcare, but would require convincing the American population to pay higher taxes while simultaneously tearing down the multi-billion dollar health insurance industry. Doing so would require not only an extremely progressive president like Sanders but also a super-majority of progressives in the Senate. 

Campaign finance reform is huge. The Citizens United v. FEC was a major mistake in my opinion. Correlating money to free speech undermines one of the basic tenets of a representative democracy of one person one vote one voice. This new policy basically eliminates the need for an informed and active electorate to support candidates and instead replaces them with a few ultra-wealthy individuals who promote an apathetic electorate while focusing on a small zealous portion of the electorate to drive their agendas.

	<TEXT> Hello and thanks for doing this.

My question is regarding the Eurasian Economic Union. In addition to Russia's hard power push in Eastern Europe, Russia is pursuing a soft-power approach of economic integration to secure Russian hegemony in the former Soviet states of Central Asia through economic integration similar to the EU, but more of a center-periphery model. If Russia manages to weather its current economic crisis  and enables growth both domestically and through this EEU partnership it may attract other Central Asian countries to sign on. How do you think this will affect Sino-Russian relations vis-a-vis China's one belt, one road policy with the New Silk Road? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a person is willing to risk their life for an opportunity across the sea and die a pointless life along the way, they should focus that desperation on fighting the reason they left.  Fight against the oppressors, sacrifice your life for your society you claim a part of. Leaving only makes the oppressor stronger because you leave behind people more unwilling to challenge the status quo. Every wealthy country had people fight and die to make their country the way it is. They didn't all just leave. How many Chinese had to die to get where they are today? How many Americans? How many Frenchman? How many Indians? Progress is a struggle against time. Instead of bringing these migrants into our society we should work to make theirs better, but it must start with them. They need to actually want it. Egypt tried and failed. Libya tried and failed. The whole Arab Spring failed except for maybe Tunisia. People weren't fighting against injustice and tyranny, they were only fighting for themselves. Society can only make progress towards egalitarianism when people stop fighting for themselves and fight for everyone.  </TEXT>

As such, the early days of NATO and the Cold War were more about offsetting Soviet influence, while today it is about creating stability through liberalization.

She can maintain the same lifestyle (ie same exercise and food intake) and still blow up like a balloon, but the weight falls off once she is done with the cycle. She has to drastically curtail her caloric intake to slowdown the weight gain as increased exercise beyond physical therapy is not really possible.

These types of comments always make me super sad. I hate when people put education solely in terms of monetary costs and benefits. There is so much more to it than that. Soul searching is important and difficult, but it is the key to discovering what success means to you. It requires a lot of internal reflection and self-criticism. You need to learn you strengths and weaknesses.   Find not what makes you happy but what satisfies you. Search for what gives you that little twang in your heart that makes you feel alive and significant. That is what college is about. 

Edit: Wow down voting. I feel bad for you...you must live a sad empty life only focusing on money.... :( </TEXT>

The quality that is really going down is the experimental sections of papers. All too often research groups won't list all of the little things they do to make a process work. This is due to a combination of length restrictions from editorial staff and to prevent scoping in a hyper competitive field. In my opinion this is what slows scientific progress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would disagree with you on the quality of this article. It fails to take into account many of the on-the-ground realities the US is currently facing. The political will in Europe supporting military expenditures has been declining in the decades after the fall of the Berlin Wall. The result is complacency in their security capabilities, while overly relying on the US to support them. This is an issue the US is facing all around the world currently. The article speaks of Europe as the most important region in US policy at the moment. This myopic view belies the fact that Russia is still an important player in many of the challenges the US is facing in the Middle East including the Syrian Revolution, IS, and Iranian nuclear negotiations. 
    Adding permanently stationed troops along the NATO periphery would be a massive escalation in tensions that would completely eliminate any productive dialogue in the Ukrainian war. [ An agreement](http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natohq/official_texts_25468.htm) between NATO and Russia was made as one of Gorbachev's final acts as head of the USSR stating that NATO will not station troops in former Warsaw Pact states as an act of goodwill and a sign of mutual desire for peace. Though recent Russia doctrine has cited NATO expansion as a primary threat to Russian security, complete abandonment of the agreement is rather unsavory to the Europeans and particularly Germany as it would signal a return to a Cold War era style dichotomy of East vs West. Germany wants to avoid this at all costs as it would be quite bad for business.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By, CANZUK I assume you mean Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK. Honestly, I don't think it would ever happen. First off, they are too far geographically, and there is no political will for that to happen. The UK has the most advanced economy of the bunch, while Canada and Australia are major resource exporters and NZ relies a great deal on tourism. The political and economic mood would just make it seem like the old British Empire again. Australians aren't too keen on that, especially with what they did to [John Pillger](http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/oct/23/gough-whitlam-1975-coup-ended-australian-independence). Another issue would be the location of the capital. Who gets to host it? It is financially impractical to have a rotating capital like the EU (which itself is a colossal waste of money). There just isn't anywhere near enough political capital in such an idea to get anyone seriously talking about it.  

Economically, it isn't particularly viable either. The expansion and reinvention of their welfare system would be immensely expensive. There would be a sudden devaluation of the pound since the Australian and Canadian dollars are worth much less. Restructuring the sovereign debt of the countries would be good for everyone but the UK. Free travel would add anything since it pretty much already exists via automatic visas. 

But say all that happens somehow and goes fine. The next step is reconciling the regulatory schemes of all of the countries. This would drastically increase market risk and has potential to tank the economies as money moves to more stable regulatory environments. If everything is taken very slowly and the integration happens over 20-30 years the risk can be mitigated along with any negative economic impacts.

If you want to suddenly form a federal union over a short time then it will be an economic meltdown. If taken slowly and carefully without any global economic hiccups then it might happen. Politically though it would never happen. The UK would form a union with other non-EU European states long before they reached across the world to remake their old empire.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with your last statement. Brazil is in a unique position in South America being the only nation there to speak Portugese. With this and lacking the revolutionary history of many of its neighbors, there is little culturally Brazil can do to bring others into its sphere especially with how cozy they are with the US and the huge anti-US sentiment surrounding them. I think in the long-run there is potential, but it will require 20+ years of extremely strong growth like China before anything significant will change. Basically, they can only bring others into their sphere economically and they don't have a large enough economy for them to throw around their weight.

	<TEXT> You definitely took away the wrong point from the failure of the Occupy movement. It is not that they were nonviolent. Look how Gandhi led India to independence. Their real problem was a lack of central leadership. There was no cohesive force pushing the message of the movement. No one for those in power to negotiate. The Occupy protesters wanted a diffuse decentralized structure, but that was ultimately their downfall. Violence just begets more violence. Hatred lead to hatred. If you really want to create a cycle of hate and violence then go ahead, start attacking the police, try to lead people to their definite death that can easily be justified by the government. Violence will get you no where but a bed in the cold hard ground.
