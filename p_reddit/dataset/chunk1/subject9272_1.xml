	<TEXT> In second grade I was in Spanish class and we were playing jeopardy. One girl went up and answer correctly and me trying to express my happiness in the situation yelled " I LOVE YOU" only to milliseconds later realize what I had just said. I ran out of class and was to embarrassed to come back so I acted sick and left. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when I was a Senior I broke up with a girl I had been dating for about a month. When we broke up we agreed that it would be a mutual breakup and we would be fine without each other, or so she told me. A little backstory, I told her my garage opening code 3 days before we broke up. Here is why that is relevant. 7 days later I was on vacation so she decided to break into my house. So when I get home we discover that both TV's at my house, my laptop, my dad and sisters laptop, my mom's iPhone 5s (brand new at the time) are broken. All of our upstairs mirrors and windows on the second story of our house are broken. She even decided to throw my cat outside for a day before we got home. Justice was served because she scratched her name on the wall in one of the bathrooms and we now knew it was her. She went to jail for 1.5 months and had her college application declined.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I had a Tablet when I was 10. Every single night after my parents went to bed I would sneak downstairs in a certain pattern of stairs that didn't creak and walk into the living room. Then I would take its case off make it look like it was charging (this saved me so many times). Then going back upstairs in the same pattern. And watching YouTube until 2 every night. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly I would rule the Roman Empire because...

1.) They have a huge territory and basicly rule the Mediterranean Sea.
2.) They have a established roadway system for transport.
3.) They were the most technologically advanced society of the time.
