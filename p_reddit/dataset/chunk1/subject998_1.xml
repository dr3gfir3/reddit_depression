	<TITLE> HP printer is full of shit. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-23 20:26:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My family has an HP 4625 Deskjet printer   scanner. This fucking thing refuses to work in any sort of capacity for longer than three minutes. I apologise in advance if this post is unclear or lacking information, which is very likely because this goddamn printer has been driving me insane for over a year.

What we want is the following:

* The printer should connect to all our PCs via the house wifi network.
* It should be usable from any of our PCs, primarily a Win7 laptop, Win8 laptop, Win8 desktop, and Win7 desktop (in order of priority).
* Both printing and scanning should work, to/from any of the above-mentioned machines.

What has happened throughout the lifetime of this godforsaken printer is that it refuses to be accessible through the network. In every case, we give up and settle for installing it to the Win7 laptop as a USB printer/scanner and sharing it over the network, but even that is extremely temperamental - scanning almost never works, and printer sharing is unavailable half the time too. Furthermore, the Win7 laptop frequently leaves the house for work, which means the rest of us can't print.

I've now factory-reset the printer and uninstalled all its software from the Win7 laptop. I'm attempting to reinstall, and already I hit a problem: the install process is able to find the printer on the network, but it cannot find it using "the typical network discovery method". It suggests that maybe the problem is the firewall, but I have *disabled the goddamn firewall* and still this error persists. [See here.](http://i.imgur.com/SGdPsJj.png)

I'm not willing to proceed with setting the printer up using a cable, because the fact that it's already giving me bullshit network-related errors tells me that the networking functionality is extremely likely to not work later either.

We've tried in the past to set the printer and the laptop to fixed IPs, but that didn't work.

The primary system's specs are as follows:

* Samsung 530U laptop
* Windows 7 Home Premium SP1 (64-bit)
* 4GB RAM
* i5 3317U
* 1TB HDD (with 700GB free space... how do people *not* fill up their hard drives? Amazing)

Wifi is provided by a Netgear WNR3500. If need be, I can get access to stuff like the router password if this is going to require advanced configuration.

I just want the fucking product my parents bought with their genuinely hard-earned money to *fucking work*. Is that too much to ask?

Sorry for the excess NaCl. Eternal gratitude if one of you grossly incandescent folks can help me sort this out. I'm tired of banging my head against this particular wall every other month.

EDIT: Thanks for all the brilliant suggestions and advice! Unfortunately, this printer does not have an Ethernet port, so that invalidates what pretty much half of you have suggested. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking to pick up my first tank </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I want to add a new champ to my pool, and recent LCS games have made me want to try my first tank. My desires, ranked by priority:

1. I want a champ who is a true tank, a beefy frontliner who brings disruption and utility to the team. I want them to be playable in top. 
2. It would be doubly good if they can also be played effectively in the jungle. I'm eyeing the tank jungler changes with keen interest, and I figure it's a good time to learn a new jungling paradigm. 
3. It would be triply good if I could play them with any measure of effectiveness as a wacky off-meta support. 

Let's hear your suggestions!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why don't I see more level 2 ganks? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-02 14:01:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Background: started playing around August. Placed Silver 2 just before season ended. Got straight demotions to Silver 5. Placed Bronze 3. Got demoted to Bronze 4, then today went 2-1 in my promos so I'm back in B3. I'm more or less a support main, but the two victories were playing jungle Fiddlesticks. 

I'm not a great jungler. I end up just farming all day. So in my games today, I tried to change that, and went for level 2 ganks. Both times, I managed to burn a flash from the enemy top laner. The latter game, it resulted in a kill for my top laner two minutes later. 

Why don't I see more people doing this? You can clear Krugs or Gromp for instant level 2, then immediately head to lane to gank before the enemy dings 2. On Fiddlesticks specifically, that means you have full health and access to either Terrify or Dark Wind, both of which make escaping harder. Plus you have more damage   health from being higher level. Common wisdom is to ward river after 3:30, so you can even get there unseen. 

I never see players at my level doing this, and I don't see it in LCS either. What gives?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A cheat sheet for those who are still learning :) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-27 11:11:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I made this champ cheat sheet when I was still grinding to 30 to help me learn the various champs. Recently I've come back to it and added some more columns (including attack range) as it helps me to learn some nuances of the game. Hopefully you guys will find it useful.

I recommend you click Data - Filter views - Create new filter view. This will allow you to filter by champ, attack range, damage type, etc. When you go into a match, filter the champ column to show the champs involved in the match. This way you can easily see most of their important stats at a glance.

This is still a WIP - many columns are missing things. Please, if you see an improvement I could make, leave a comment on the sheet! Especially with regards to the last two columns.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> You have a single-use time machine that will give you one round trip visit to a date of your choice in the past. You are to visit a creator - artist, scientist, inventor, composer - and show them one of their greatest works, just for kicks. 

Your time machine will provide power for any devices you take with you, and it also allows for Internet   mobile connectivity to the present in case those things are needed to display the work. You're allowed to take other devices like speakers with you (if for instance the work in question is a recording of a musical performance). 

You get to choose the stage in the creator's life where you visit them - it can be during childhood, a particularly difficult time, etc. 

Your time machine will wipe the creator's memory of the encounter, but only after you leave. While you're there, you can also display the work to other people; their memories will also be wiped. The purpose of the visit is solely to get a kick out of showing someone the awesome shit they get up to later in life. 

The time machine emanates a psychic field that helps people understand the situation, preventing you from being lynched for being a witch. 

EDIT: You can also elect to show the creator a work by someone else that derives from their own. For instance, you might wish to play Schoenberg a piece of noise music, or show whoever came up with the atomic model an SEM photo of an atom.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does Karma counter Gnar? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-15 10:11:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've played a lot of Karma, and yesterday I decided to try her out in toplane. My second game I was laning against Gnar.

Having seen how terrifying the little bastard can be, and knowing I'm inexperienced in playing Karma in top, I opted for flask start.

I outsustained Gnar so hard that I forced him out of lane three times. I managed to take him down twice by proxy - once by a Jinx rocket and once by a Zed gank.

It got me wondering: is Karma a surprising counter to Gnar? She pokes so hard, she can really punish him when he's in Mini Gnar form, and can shield and RW through any damage he puts out. She has decent mobility from her shield to juke boomerangs.

It just seemed really easy to play a farm lane and get some nice items. (And then TP into teamfights and drop AoE shield on everyone.)

I should note the player I was up against is about as good as I am - similar KDA, slightly higher rank, slightly lower ranked win rate, etc.

Thoughts?

	<TEXT> In the last two days, I've played maybe 3 or 4 games with two ADCs bot instead of ADC + support. Is this a thing or did I just get matched with bad players?

I can't imagine how it would make any sense, you're just dividing your farm between two people. Sure you'd push objectives like crazy once you farm enough, but one ADC plus a split-pushing toplaner or jungler could achieve the same without delaying their power spikes until 30 minutes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Twisted Fate support: Relic Shield or Spellthief's Edge? (Or Ancient Coin?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-03 11:13:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I picked up TF yesterday, for the express purpose of playing him as a support. I usually play champs like Karma   Nidalee - people who poke a lot, in other words. I thought TF's non-skillshot stun, AoE slow, long-ranged poke, vision, teleport,   gold income passive made him a great candidate for a support.

However, I'm having some trouble deciding on the best gold income item for him. My usual go-to item for similar supports is Spellthief's, because I poke *a lot*. Until last week, I always upgraded it to FQC as soon as possible, reasoning that it's a useful item in its own right and getting it sooner means exponentially better cash returns. However, I'm slowly coming around to the more common practice of just leaving it as Spellthief's and selling it later.

With TF, his gold income passive necessitates last hitting, which doesn't work with Spellthief's (until that gets upgraded to FQC, at which point minion kills no longer disable the passive). The boosted income from his passive synergises so perfectly with Relic Shield, but he's a ranged champ so he gets no execute, and the stats aren't core for him.

So which of these is the better option? Or am I being retarded? Should I buy Ancient Coin instead (good stats and a nice active at max tier)?

Please, /r/summonerschool, make me rich! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Diana: Magus or Devourer? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-14 16:03:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing Diana as a bruiser in the jungle, building Magus alongside Nashor's Tooth. This gets me 40% CDR, attack speed to help proc my passive, a chunk of AP, and some on-hit magic damage to round it out. 

However, today I started wondering if Devourer isn't maybe a better option. It would allow me to take Morellonomicon (or Athene's) for CDR and get some mana in the process. However, I would probably leave out Nashor's then, which means I need to find CDR elsewhere. DFG has nice CDR and AP but I don't know if its active is that great for Di. Other CDR items give much less AP. Or maybe I should take Frozen Heart? 

I dunno.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Featured mode idea: SUPER CHAMP BOX </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-04 19:18:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Vlambeer's excellent shooter Super Crate Box subverts traditional shooter mechanics by "punishing" you for getting points. It does this by replacing your current weapon with a random one. 

In the same spirit, I propose this: a 5v5 mode on Summoner's Rift, with the key difference that **whenever you kill a large minion or monster, or get a kill or assist, or destroy a turret or inhibitor, your champ transforms to a random one you own**.

Much like URF and O4A (and the upcoming Poro King), the idea here is simply to cause chaos and make stupid shit happen. 

Your skill levels will persist between champs (with a bonus point in the ult in the case of champs like Karma and Nidalee). This will have some strategic implications: max one ability, or spread them out? Cooldowns carry over proportionally, meaning a Q that had 5 seconds left on a 15 second cooldown will have 2 seconds left if it becomes a Q with a 6 second cooldown. Mana and health carry over proportionally as well. 

Your items also persist. Now, you may think this would result in fairly boring builds that just split evenly down the middle of tank, AD, and AP; but that's because you're fundamentally a boring person. No, just as likely is the risk-taker's approach, where you build according to one role and use minions and monsters to re-roll until you get an appropriate champ.

Permanent stacking buffs like Nasus and Veigar have will persist, though those that interact with specific abilities (like Nasus's) still only interact with those abilities. (Yes, this means you can farm AP as Veigar and transfer it to a different champ...) 

The enemy team will only know who you are while they have vision of you. This allows teams to set up surprise attacks where anything could happen! 

Teamfights will be hilarious melees where getting a kill means forcing your entire team to switch champs, throwing them into disarray and giving the enemy a chance to return the favour. In fact, any objective taken by a team gives them a brief moment of vulnerability while they adjust to their new champs. 

Some unique self-combos will be made possible, especially with champs like Katarina who can reset their cooldowns. 

Udyr would probably be disabled due to his weird skill point system.

	<TITLE> About Azir and Nashor's Tooth </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-02 09:06:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So two weeks ago, I was discussing Azir with /u/Molleckt in another thread. I asserted Nashor's Tooth is a bad buy on Azir; Molleckt disagreed. I said I would do some theorycrafting when I got back to my PC, and while it took me way too long, here are my results. :)

Preface: I've used fairly "standard" runes   masteries. None of them should interfere too much with the test (the most interesting thing there is 10% CDR). The items used are Deathcap, Zhonya's, Rylai's, Liandry's, Sorc shoes. We will compare Nashor's to another AP item that gives 20% CDR, Morellonomicon.

    				w/ Nashor's		w/ Morellonomicon
    Attack speed:	1.353			1.053
    AP:				760.1			787.4
    Soldier damage:	702.07			721.18
    (170 + 70%)
    Soldier DPS:	949.90071		759.40254

From this, we can see that Nashor's does indeed increase the soldiers' DPS by a substantial amount. However, let's take this simulation a step further. Assume an opponent who has average base movement speed (we'll use Xerath), and is wearing Sorceror's Shoes with the Alacrity enchantment (other enchantments give higher movement speed, but are conditional). Assume the soldier we spawn starts attacking when the enemy is 20 units away (ie the soldier was spawned next to them), and they immediately start walking away once the first attack lands. We will apply the slow from Rylai's. Let's see how many attacks we get in.

    Movement speed:	426.4 * 0.85 = 362.44
    Soldier range:	400
    Time to escape:	(400-20) / 362.44 = 1.048
    
    				w/ Nashor's		w/ Morellonomicon
    Attacks:		1.417 (ie 1)	1.103 (ie 1)
    Total damage:	702.07			721.18

Let's try a different scenario. We'll use the same opponent - Xerath with Alacrity Sorceror's Shoes - but we'll spawn two soldiers, and initiate with the slow. Assume Xerath starts walking the instant he gets hit by the dash, and for the sake of not involving too much geometry, assume the distance to cover is still 400 units.

    Speed for 1s:			426.4 * 0.85 * 0.75 = 271.83
    Ground covered in 1s:	271.83
    Speed for .5s:			426.4 * 0.85 = 362.44
    Ground covered in .5s:	181.22
    Total time to escape:	1.353 seconds
    
    				w/ Nashor's		w/ Morellonomicon
    Q damage:		718.7625		735.825
    Attacks (each):	1.917 (ie 1)	1.424 (ie 1)
    Total damage:	2122.9025		2178.185

So in conclusion: Nashor's is unlikely to beat the damage output of something like Morellonomicon **if** Azir is acting alone. Naturally, League is a team game, so you will usually not be acting alone. But by the same token, the enemy team is going to do their best to stay out of range of your soldiers, and just like your allies will use CC to try to keep them there, they will use shields, speed boosts, and other tricks to stay away.

If you ask me, stacking AP is much better. :)

EDIT: In terms of gold efficiency, the attack speed buff is worth 1500 gold. 1500 gold is enough to get you another 60 AP, which I think would do far more to increase Azir's damage output. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The new jungle items aren't out yet, and as a player who plays Diana jungle every chance I can get, I'm going a little crazy trying to figure out which items will be good on her.

In my opinion, it comes down to either Stalker's Blade or Skirmisher's Sabre. For those who don't know, here's what they do:

**Stalker's Blade** lets you Smite enemy champions for:

* 10% of Smite's damage
* a 50% slow
* 2-second duration

**Skirmisher's Sabre** lets you Smite enemy champions for:

* vision
* 6.25% of Smite's damage on-hit
* 20% damage reduction against the targeted champ
* 6-second duration

Now, I would argue that Diana has no problems repeatedly closing the gap. Her E also gives her an anti-escape tool with a brief slow. This leads me to favour Skirmisher's. (Let it never be said that I don't absolutely adore on-hit damage. Nashor's Tooth 4 lyfe)

However, the overwhelming opinion in this sub so far seems to point to Stalker's being almost the default pick for gankers.

But then, I build Di like a fighter, not an assassin, so maybe I should be ignoring ganks and looking towards the mid-late game brawls and teamfights, where the Sabre's damage on hit can really wreck a team, the damage reduction can somewhat hamstring whoever's trying to focus her down, and the vision can let her chase down anyone trying to escape through the jungle.

Bring your best theorycrafting game and let's see if we can find some answers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a question I generally struggle with. As a rule, is it better to build items that patch up the holes in your character, leaving them with limited strength, or to go ham on what you're already good at, leaving you with exploitable vulnerabilities? 

Specifically, this question comes up when I'm deciding how to build my supports. I usually play AP supports (Karma, Morgana, Lux), and I can never decide for instance whether to go full poke, or to buy things like Mikael's that give me access to support abilities I don't otherwise have.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I (plan to) main support, and most often play AP supports like Karma   Morgana. Usually, my first item after Sightstone   Frostfang (  occasionally boots) will be a mana item, typically Athene's. However, I think I'm overdoing it. I play super pokey, and tend to spam my spells (eg Karma Q) early which causes mana problems. I think I then overcompensate by buying powerhouses like Athene's, plus Frost Queen's Claim, plus masteries, plus miscellaneous other mana regen sources.

How much mana regen is enough? I'd love some hard numbers, like x mana per 5 at a certain level/phase of the game. I always max out CDR for max spammage as well.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi everyone. I'm trying to make my site's user signup a bit nicer - specifically when it comes to the social media input fields. I want them to look like this: http://imgur.com/ar6rkgX

The idea is that it *looks* like the "http://www.facebook.com/" bit is a part of the text box's contents, but it isn't really - it's actually a label or something that's positioned to look that way. This way the prompt is dead simple to understand but the user can't actually delete that bit of text. But then I also want the text field to be focused if the user clicks the label, which naturally entails some JQuery or something.

Problem is, I have no idea what sort of search terms to use, and everything I've tried just gives me crappy "social media marketing" results I care less than zero about.

Halp?

I could do this myself, I'm just hoping there's a quick and easy premade solution. Site's built on Rails if it matters.

Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Support concept: pulp hero </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-01 09:04:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> EDIT: Revised signature ability. It's still a skillshot dash, but there's a 1.5 second delay before it fires, during which our champ (referred to as Pulp for now) is unable to move (or if that's too restrictive, he is slowed, like Vi or Xerath while charging their respective abilities). The direction is set when the skill is activated, so some prediction is required in terms of where the enemy will be.

Also, Pulp no longer picks up the first ally he hits. Instead, the first ally to right-click him after activation of the skillshot is the one who will get picked up. The ally must be within close range of Pulp (say 400). If no-one right-clicks him by the time the delay ends, the ability fires anyway and no-one is carried along for the ride.

*****

(If you don't know what a pulp hero is, think of guys like The Shadow, The Phantom, The Green Hornet. Old-timey pre-superhero heroes.) 

Inspired by the scene in Winter Soldier where Cap grabs BW and dives through a window to avoid a grenade, I came up with a cool champ concept that could have some interesting interactions with the current meta. 

Where Thresh and Blitz focus on moving enemies around, and other champs like Lee Sin or LeBlanc focus on moving themselves around, I thought: what about a champ that moves his *teammates* around? I'm not talking movement speed buffs either - I envision his signature (Q?) being a skillshot dash that picks up the first ally he hits and deposits them at the end, perhaps with a little buff to attack/move speed. This champ could save lives by spiriting away squishy mages, or he could drop a Nasus-shaped ton of bricks next to the enemy marksman. 

Other abilities could include: 

* A short, quick roll (visually similar to Vayne's) that 'dodges' (ignores) basics during the animation 
* An enhanced basic with a short stun - the ol' one-two 
* A Batman-style, cape-spread intimidation move - maybe 1s fear in a cone? 
* A 'grab' where he roots a champ by grabbing onto them (during which he can't do anything), increasing the damage of the next attack against them. 

Thoughts? Really the other abilities are just icing on the cake. It's all about the dash. I just think it's a cool concept that would fit well - both gameplay-wise, as it enables new plays and new team comps (and perhaps less of a focus on Flash), and lore-wise, as the game loves 'renegade hero' types. Suggested name: 'Noxus Batman'. (jk) 

This champ would be a support primary, though perhaps he could have a secondary fighter classification if his abilities allow. His stats would be fairly fighterish in either case - decent health, armour   damage. He would be a melee champ, definitely. I have no idea what sort of passive would work.

I imagine a typical build could be something like:

* Face of the Mountain - for the tanky stats and the shield, which would be really useful when transporting allies into combat
* Sightstone
* Mobility Boots - to help him get to allies in trouble
* Frozen Heart
* Locket of the Iron Solari
* Randuin's Omen </TEXT>

	<TITLE> General advice on my current Lux support build? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-26 15:57:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As I make the climb to 30, I've fallen back in love with playing Lux as a support. Before, I never really *built* her as a support - the big AP items were just too tempting! - but now I've given it a good rethink and have arrived at a build that has worked pretty nicely.

It's not perfect, though, and I would love to hear any tips from more experienced players. I'm actually only concerned with items - I don't have money for runes and I'm happy with my masteries at 0/0/21 (I'm level 21).

So, the items:

* Talisman of Ascension
* Mikael's Crucible
* Twin Shadows
* Ardent Censer
* Sightstone
* Mobility Boots

I start with Ancient Coin, 1 health pot, 1 mana pot, a ward, and a warding totem. I already struggle early on to decide between Chalice for mana, boots for mobility, Nomad's for money, and the Sightstone for vision. (I do take Clairvoyance as one of my spells but I'm not comfortable enough with the game's pacing to rely on it fully as an early warning measure against ganks.) The longer I delay the Sightstone, the more I end up burning on wards, but the Sightstone doesn't give me anything useful except for a bit of health, which without armour or MR doesn't amount to much.

If I'm ahead, I tend to rush Twin Shadows to help my team chase down runaways. If I'm behind, I try to get Mikael's for some sustain and defence.

Late game I'll pick up the Ardent Censer once everything else is done, but I feel like it doesn't benefit us much. My timing with my W tends to be late, so I feel like by the time it hits my teammates the need for it has already passed.

I'm also worried I'm overdoing it a bit with the mana - almost all of the above items come with huge mana regen, which might be overkill.

Any thoughts?

EDIT: My playstyle in lane tends to be quite aggressive and pokey, which is part of why I have such a focus on CDR and mana. I'm constantly tossing Qs and Es to try and zone opponents, and on occasion actually catch them out so my ADC can take them down.

EDIT 2: Hahaha, alright, alright, I yield! :D I will find a different champ to play!

Thanks for the input everyone! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi everyone! I recently hit lv20 and started getting some basic rune pages going. I would like to have two pages for now: one for AD-based champs and one for AP-based champs.

I already have flat armour yellows and scaling MR blues. I'm planning to get AD or APen reds for AD and AP or MPen reds for AP (any advice here would also be great).

I'm looking for some tips regarding which quints to get. It would be nice if I could use the same ones on both pages - save me a lot of IP! - but if that's a really bad idea then please let me know.

I mostly play Nasus top, Lux support, Diana mid, and the occasional Warwick jungle or Morgana support. My long-term goal is to main support, maybe jungle as well (since jungling shares some aspects with supporting).

Thanks in advance! 3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I finished school seven and a half years ago. Since then, I've been studying one thing after the other - almost all unsuccessfully - on my parents' dime, while living in a flat they paid for.

Every semester, it would be the same pattern: I'd stop attending class, lie to my parents and my live-in girlfriend about it, and then have a fight at the end of the semester when my results came. Once, I even forged exam results, which hurt my family deeply.

I've been to see therapists, but it never took.

At the start of this year, both my parents and my girlfriend told me this was my last chance.

I finally admitted today that I'd failed everything and that I need help. I packed a bag of clothes and my computer and went to stay with my parents. Everything sucks and I have no future, but everyone loves me and is willing to help.

I wish I could have avoided these mistakes in the first place. My girlfriend is extremely dependent on me for getting to and from work and for buying stuff and keeping the house clean, and now I'm not there to help her. And my parents have sunk so much money into giving me third and fourth and fifth chances, so much so that they've had to dig into their retirement fund - they're in their mid-50s and have sunk a lot of money into two business ventures, one of which tanked and the other one is only going to be profitable enough for my dad to get a good salary in a few years' time.

But all in all I feel good. I don't feel suicidal any more, and I didn't get kicked out onto the street like I was expecting.

	<TEXT> Hey folks. I want to get started with this game but I have a somewhat limited internet connection so I would like to be able to use a download manager or torrent client instead of the Marvel Heroes installer (so I can schedule the download to do bits at certain times). Is there such a method? I did search the sub and found a post about a year ago that said this isn't possible - is that still the case? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always love weapons that have quirky features, and that certainly includes the thrusting swords' right-hand parry.

However, I'm struggling to figure out what the point is. I guess it means you can off-hand a greatshield without losing the ability to parry.

Is that it though? Any other useful tricks you can do with it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> DA BEST

Naw but seriously, I've just had like my 5th or 6th win (on Easy (I'm just trying to unlock all the ships)) with that loadout. Rock B this time.

I just feel like nothing comes close to that loadout. You have the Ion for hosing shields, the Halberd for rekking shit, and the Flak for supporting both. You can consistently break through 4 shields and still cause damage with this, even without hacking. Your charge time is very nicely self-optimised, as the Ion and Flak will fire twice and once respectively, for a maximum of 4 shields down, before the Halberd is ready. And the best part is, it leaves you with 1 slot open (on 4-slot ships), so you can have another more situational weapon to swap in when needed.

Or am I being stupid? Is there a "more optimal" 3-weapon loadout? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still on my first playthrough so no spoilers please.

I'm trying to understand how infusion works and when it is viable. I come from DkS1 where the answer was always "normal path unless high Int or Fth". Now my 32 Str/20 Dex character is not doing as much damage with a +10 Claymore as I might have hoped.

I'm also planning on doing at least two new playthroughs after this one.

So is there a guide somewhere that explains in detail how infusion works, what it does to scaling, which weapons are good candidates for which infusions, how infusions relate to inherent elemental/status properties, etc? I'm not talking about tables of stats - I know where to find those. Rather, I want to understand the things you guys seem to all know. :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been slowly educating myself on gender issues over the last year or two. I consider myself an ally.

However, one thing I seem to be at odds with other feminists about is promiscuity and sexually provocative dress and behaviour, all of which I believe falls under the umbrella of 'sexual liberty'.

I feel extremely uncomfortable about promiscuous behaviour. I think it devalues sex, besides also being hazardous to health (both in terms of STI's and unplanned pregnancy). I feel uncomfortable as well when presented with - and I apologise for using the term here, but it captures my feelings best - 'slutty' dress and behaviour.

However, the message I'm getting from the feminist side is that each person should be free to do with their body what they want.

Why is sexual liberty important? It feels to me like campaigning to be allowed to do something 'bad'. Like, I believe promiscuity is not something we should embrace, so why make it part of the broader scope of women's issues?

I suspect the answers are going to primarily revolve around rape culture, but I fail to see how.

(For reference: I'm a white African male in my mid-twenties, and in a committed relationship of over 6 years.)

Thanks in advance, friends! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A month or so ago, I did some freelance work and promised myself I would get DkS2 when my money came. Today was the day.

I'm coming from the DkS1 subreddit, where there's a lot of negativity and "they don't make 'em like they used to" attitude. But I resisted those negative vibes, just as I resisted spoilers, and man, was I not disappointed.

One minor... queerness about DkS1, for me, was the load screen/character creation music. That music never gelled with the vibe of the rest of the game. A small part of me longed to play the game that that music suggested.

I think DkS2 has exactly the atmosphere that track suggested. It's dreamy and weird and surreal and I love it. Majula took my breath away. Where Lordran is a crumbling, hopeless ruin, Drangleic has something optimistic and beautiful about it. Like none of us know why we're here, but it might all turn out okay in the end.

I'm also loving the mechanics. Movement is much more slick. Parrying is hard as, which is nice because it makes it less OP (and because after several playthroughs of DkS1 I'd kind of 75% mastered it). Dodging is also tough but very precise. I love the new stun mechanics. I love that 100% physical block is (so far) nowhere to be seen. Combat feels brutal again. Healing is less powerful. Everything comes back down to stamina management and battlefield control.

I've beaten the Last Giant, Dragonrider, the three lucerne hammer dudes, and the Pursuer. All were really satisfying. When I met the Giant, I was literally sitting there going NOPE NOPE NOPE NOPE. The Pursuer is just a total badass, I just wish I was fast enough on the uptake to take him on when he first appeared. The three sentinels were really tough but made me feel like an S-tier BAMF when I finally brought them down. The Dragonrider was tough but I beat him first time, though I was terrified he was going to have a dragon-related second phase.

Even the mobs are really cool. I love that two-handing has been made more common among mobs - I really enjoy fighting the Royal Swordsmen.

I just wish I could find a greatsword somewhere!

Basically this game is everything I hoped it would be, and I can't wait to play more tomorrow, and I probably won't read a single reply to this because I hate spoilers hahaha :D

One, it doesn't get stronger as you level up Str or Dex, which means later on, other weapons outclass it quite quickly. Two, and this is the real important one, **it prevents you from learning the game in the first few areas, making it impossible to beat anything later**. Seriously, guys: I invade in the Parish. Normally I would give you a fair fight, but if I see a Drake Sword, I'm getting out my maxed-out elemental weapons. Are we clear?

	<TEXT> I've been invading newbs in the Parish as an SL16 Dickwraith with unupgraded gear. It's a lot of fun, and I lose most of the time, but I don't mind - I just want to give new people another tough enemy to fight (and maybe make them soil themselves a little).

However, dead angling really ruins my day. In part, what baffles me about it is that Dark Souls is otherwise extremely precise in its hitboxes. Frustrating, then, to be killed by a Halberd R1 while I'm blocking and standing behind my opponent.

As a programmer, I understand exactly why dead-angling happens. But I also understand why lag makes it unbearable, and I *also* understand that it would be a trivial fix (whichever party calculates the blocking would just need to take the other player's facing - which it already has - into account).

It sucks that a game with a combat system this good would be reduced to shitty lagstabs   dead angles in PvP.

On Sunday, A and I decided to play a game, with different chars. So we rerolled. This time, we were playing on my desktop and her laptop. We connected via our home wi-fi. It took some finagling, as the firewall settings on my PC weren't great (blame Norton), but we had a good 6-hour-ish session.

Yesterday, A and I wanted to continue our game. Bear in mind, at no point did we make any changes to our network configuration. But we could no longer see each other's games. We tried having her laptop host the game. We tried a different router. We tried connecting the PCs via crossover. Nothing. On one attempt out of 50, we could see the game, but then got "connection failed".

Today, I even tried creating new characters on each PC, as a Google result showed me some people were having trouble starting a game with existing characters, but no luck.

A thorough Google search has brought up absolutely nothing.

	<TEXT> I'm writing a clipboard manager using Python 3, tkinter, pywin32. The hotkey WIN+V brings up the interface. Once the user chooses a clip to paste, the interface minimises itself. At this point, I want to restore focus to whatever program had keyboard focus before WIN+V was pressed.

Chrome is one program I've found that doesn't play nice with restoring focus. If I open a new Chrome tab, click in the search field in the middle of the screen, and then press WIN+V and choose a clip to paste:

* `win32gui.SetForegroundWindow(hwnd)` (where `hwnd` is either Chrome's top-level window, or the child window with keyboard focus) restores focus to Chrome but makes keyboard focus jump to the address bar at the top
* Using `win32process.AttachThreadInput(hwnd, hwnd_my_app, True)` followed by `win32gui.SetFocus(hwnd)` (and subsequently detaching the thread input again) does not restore focus to Chrome at all (again, `hwnd` is either the top-level window or the child window with focus)

I'm using `GetGUIThreadInfo(0, byref(gui))` to get info on the foreground thread into a `GUITHREADINFO` struct, and reading the `hwndFocus` entry of that struct to get the handle of the currently-keyboard-focused window.

Any help?

I'm in the level-up screen, and I'm looking at how increasing Faith would affect two weapons I have: a +2 divine Estoc, and an unupgraded Astora's Straight Sword.

Currently, my Estoc is at 86+6 physical and 105+17 magical. If I increase Faith by 1, magic bonus damage goes up to +19. A second point makes it +21.

A *third* point makes it +22, and *increases* my physical bonus damage to +7. A fourth point reverts it to +6.

What the glob?

Astora's is even weirder. It's sitting at 80+23/80+13. One point increases magic bonus damage by 1. A second point increases it by 2 and *decreases* physical damage bonus by 1, where it stays even if I put more points into Faith.

	<TEXT> I'm trying to get a handle to the window that currently has keyboard focus. At first, I tried `GetForegroundWindow()`, but I realised soon enough that the handle returned by this doesn't necessarily correspond to who has keyboard focus - specifically, it gives me the top-level window that's active, but not a handle to the child window with focus.

I then tried `GetFocus()`, but it's returning a null result and I think this is why (from MSDN docs, emphasis mine):

 Retrieves the handle to the window that has the keyboard focus, **if the window is attached to the calling thread's message queue**.

I don't understand these concepts too well. I get that there's a message queue which passes things around like WM_PASTE, but I thought the message queue belongs to the OS, not to specific windows. And threads are something with which I have no experience.

It's starting to look like I'll have to hack together several API calls just to get a dumb ol' handle to the currently-focused window, but that seems dumb. Surely there's a single function I could call that will give me what I want?

Any aid appreciated.

	<TITLE> A new type of challenge </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-27 23:15:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Dark Souls is immersive like few other games I've played. But if there's one mechanic that detracts from that, it's the 'carry around awesome gear for every possible situation and change armour in ~5 seconds' nonsense.

To fix this, I introduce to you the **Ultimate adventurer challenge run**.

Rules:

* You can only equip or unequip items at a bonfire.
* You must decide ahead of time what gear and spells you want to use. In the event that some of those items are not available, you can temporarily substitute whatever is available. You can only replace a substitute with a nearer substitute. This is harder to define but it's up to you. (Example: if your final weapon is to be a Gargoyle's Halberd, you might use a Battle Axe to start with, then trade up to a Halberd. You may not switch down from the Halberd to the Battle Axe.)
* If you obtain an item that is part of your target build, you must equip it the next time you visit a bonfire *and* have enough carrying capacity that it won't put you over 100%.

The aim is to kit your character out like someone who has to travel on foot and fight, and stick to that loadout. So either you plan to use Havel's set from the very beginning, or you can forget about just plopping it on for Four Kings.

Additional details:

* Descending and re-enchanting weapons is not allowed! If you want a divine hammer for skeleton bashin', you have to include that in your build from the get-go.
* If a weapon breaks, you may not equip something else 'just until I can get to the bonfire'. That's why you get four weapon slots.

Optional rules:

* Swopping rings as needed doesn't quite strain suspension of disbelief so much. You may choose to allow swopping one or both ring slots as needed; after all, some areas in the game require use of specific rings. You may still only change rings at a bonfire.
* Spells are also arguably something that might change with the situation. However, I recommend against this rule; it alters the spellcasting game quite a lot, making high Attunement suddenly a lot more attractive.
* Hotbar items are quite situational. You may allow all (or perhaps some) slots to be changeable at a bonfire.
* You might want to allow using a light source just for the Tomb. I don't think you should - it's perfectly doable even if you can't see - but this is your challenge run, after all.

In closing: think like an adventurer who doesn't want to carry around tons of loot. And if you plan to do this challenge run, post your build up front and let us know how it goes. :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Why did Renaissance dueling swords evolve almost exclusively into thrusting weapons? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-17 17:51:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The Medieval arming sword was used for both cutting and thrusting. The later spada de lato and espada ropera were similarly balanced, though they perhaps canted somewhat towards thrusting attacks rather than cutting. Wikipedia says the spada de lato was "ideal for handling the mix of armored and unarmored opponents of [the late 16th century]."

At the time the rapier evolved from the aforementioned swords, armour usage was in decline due to the proliferation of firearms; and in a civilian duel, your opponent was unlikely to be armoured anyway.

However, my understanding has been that cutting attacks are more effective against unarmoured foes, and thrusting attacks are more effective against armoured foes. (Support for this claim includes: shamshirs used mostly for slashing at unarmoured foes; the Polish army adopting the szabla in response to their enemies not using much heavy armour; estocs being developed solely to deal with heavily-armoured opponents.)

Why, then, did the rapier (and the small sword, and other dueling swords of the 16th century and later) evolve as a thrusting weapon, when in fact the targets it was intended for were virtually all unarmoured?

EDIT: Thanks for all the illuminating answers so far, everyone! I will respond to all when I have time. :) </TEXT>

The name Gwyn means "white" or "blessed" in Welsh   Cornish. This is pretty straightforward: Gwyn is the "lord of lords", and also the Lord of Sunlight, so the association is clear.

Gwyndolin means "white/blessed ring/bow", which could be taken to be a reference to the Moon (as in a white crescent). (A tongue-in-cheek bonus: the guy's pretty fond of rings, giving you one as himself and another as Gwynevere, and requiring a third to encounter him in the first place.)

But best of all is Gwynevere. Gwynevere means "white/blessed fay/ghost/enchantress". Her name is straight up telling you she's not real!

	<TEXT> I'm trying to register a system-wide hotkey using pywin32 that will trigger some action in my Tkinter program. I'm using [this](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/catch_system_wide_hotkeys.html) as reference. When I run the code from that link, it works fine. What I'm struggling with is integrating the loop there with the event loop in Tkinter.

The Tkinter loop needs to periodically check for the hotkey being pressed. This should be trivial, using `root.after()`. However, the program doesn't seem to pick up on the hotkey being pressed at all, not even when it's in focus.

[Here is a succinct code example](https://gist.github.com/subject998/a5541d5b3dbc7573aecc) - it's as short as I could get it. It represents my attempts to modify the code from the link to play nicely with Tkinter.

One quirk I've noticed is that if I set the first argument of `root.after()` to zero, the GUI doesn't draw correctly and Python sometimes ends up crashing.

EDIT: It turns out I had a typo! `ord("v")` should have been `ord("V")`. D'oh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, for one measly ol' power, you get a thing that can almost completely nullify an enemy drone, and even occasionally destroy it.

A stock drone control system can run two of these without breaking a sweat. My last few Flagship victories went so much easier in phase 2 with these little guys.

	<TEXT> One of Dark Souls's great strengths is its flexible character system. However, I've often felt that the ability to wield a weapon (not a shield, ranged weapon, or magic focus) in the left hand is kind of pointless.

Do you ever wield a weapon in your off hand? For what purpose? PvP or PvE? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Trying to implement system-wide shortcut key on Windows </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-25 23:29:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm writing a tool in Python 3.3 using tkinter. I want to implement a keyboard shortcut - say, WIN+Z - that will open the main window and give it focus, even when the app is minimised or does not have focus.

I've Googled the problem, and the only thing I can find is a function in wxPython called [RegisterHotKey](http://wiki.wxpython.org/RegisterHotKey). This seems to be what I am looking for (if we ignore the issue of whether the Windows key counts as a modifier), but I'm hoping to achieve the same in tkinter rather than abandoning what I've done so far.

What strikes me as interesting about the wxPython example in the link is that it uses pywin32 "for the VK keycodes"; this suggests to me that the keycodes could be made available to tkinter in the same way; however, as far as I can tell, tkinter's Tk() class does not contain a method similar to RegisterHotKey.

Any help?

EDIT: I just found [this](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/events.html) which seems like it offers half the answer, but I don't understand it well and would appreciate some enlightenment.

EDIT 2: From the same site as the above link, it seems I've found my answer! [Catch system-wide hotkeys](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/win32_how_do_i/catch_system_wide_hotkeys.html). Now I just need to figure out how to integrate that behaviour into tkinter's main loop. </TEXT>

I'm giving Engi B a shot, because I'm trying to unlock all the ships. I've heard nothing but complaints on this sub about how crap the ship is, but I've been extremely lucky so far.

I am right in the beginning of sector 5, playing on Normal difficulty, AE.

Here's the situation: I have a decent amount of scrap, and I've hit a store that is selling one each of Ion Blast, Ion Blast II, and Heavy Ion. I'm rocking a Heavy Ion and two Heavy Lasers, with no combat drones. That loadout performed very well when enemies had one shield, adequately when they had two, and now I'm starting to run up against enemies with three shield bubbles and even with hacking, it's tough breaking through (and that's if they don't shoot down my hacking drone etc).

However, I'm lacking crew. I actually already bought one of the crew the shop was offering (a Slug with shield   combat experience), which brings me up to... two crew. :/ I lost two crewies in a pretty bad fight a few jumps back. I still have my two starting drones, and I haven't been able to justify selling them since I'm so short-staffed.

So my question, reddit, is: what do I buy/sell? What will give me the best chance at survival here?

If we need to specify goal priorities, my first goal would be to reach sector 8, and beating the flagship is a close second. So if it comes down to balancing the best chance of surviving to the last sector vs actually beating the flagship, I'm inclined to choose survival.

The gun lover in me wants to swap out a Heavy Laser for another Ion weapon, hopefully one that can stack nicely with the Heavy Ion. But I've never really had the opportunity to really test-drive multiple Ion weapons so I don't know if that's a worthwhile choice. Basically, I don't really see another way to increase my firepower at this junction; by 'firepower', I mean 'ability to actually crack through shields'.

I'm *also* tempted to try switching out the Heavy Ion for a Ion Blast II; I get the sense from [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/ftlgame/comments/1xjb1q/can_anyone_explain_in_detail_how_ion_weapons_work/) thread that an Ion Blast II on its own will fire fast enough to actually accumulate damage.

TL;DR: look pictures. see shop. wat buy </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Need some help with audio routing :( </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-09 12:02:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi guys. I'm trying out this LP thing. I don't have $$$ for stuff so I'm using what I have/what I can find for free:
- Loilo Game Recorder
- Virtual Audio Cable
- Alesis io2 interface (similar to an Mbox)
- Shure SM58
- Sennheiser HD-280

If I don't use VAC, everything works just fine, with the one exception that my recorded VO is only in the left channel. Since Loilo mixes everything down to a stereo mix, I can't bring the VO out to both channels in post without ditching the right half of the stereo mix (which I'd rather keep).

I've gone back and forth with VAC trying to find settings that can somehow distribute my mic input to both channels, with no luck. Confusing the issue is that Loilo does some of its own internal routing (recording the default playback device's output into the file along with the default recording device's).

What I *think* I need to do is set a VAC as the default recording device, then somehow use VAC and/or Audio Repeater to pipe the mic's input into both channels of said VAC, but I can't figure out how to do this.
