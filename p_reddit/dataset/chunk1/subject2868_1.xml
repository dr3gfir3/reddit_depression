	<TEXT> Quick question RE: your advice on the cross collar. Just had someone give me this advice in class the other day as well (i.e., just immediately get up in base). 

Just a point of clarification: are you assuming that they did not already use that collar grip to break your posture? I.e., would you stand up in base even if they had you broken all the way down? Apologies if this is a dumb question. I find that standing up against the grip can get me bent too far over - though it's not too hard to compensate by dropping my hips low to get my center of gravity back a bit (usually has the effect of lifting them off the mat slightly) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't want to bring up the "different styles" thing because I honestly don't want to come across as a hater. 

But in my (completely subjective) opinion, I think this video showcases how the typical 10thP setups that involve entangling your legs actually end up locking down your own hips in a way that's really easy for a top-level black belt with good fundamentals (base, posture, pressure) to smash right through. 

Again I don't mean to hate because in the past I incorporated some of those same setups with some success. But to me what's really on display here is the number of holes in 10thP system when pitted against the typical fundamentals of top-level competitors.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This question is absolutely not intended to be snarky at all: I am genuinely interested to know what you think is "wow" about that training session? 

I ask because people talk about this video a lot and I honestly don't see what's exceptional about it. Maybe it's because Marcelo seems much more dominant in this video than with other black belt rolls he has posted. But that's not too surprising considering that Eddie hasn't been actively competing and Marcelo is on a completely different level anyway. 

I'd direct you to Marcelo vs. Rafael Lovato or Cobrinha for what I feel is truly exceptional.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of great advice in this thread, but a lot of it is too late to make a difference if you're not controlling properly from the start. 

When getting their arm isolated for the omoplata, especially if you have an overhook, place your feet on their hips and use that leverage to pop your own hips up into their armpit as if you're bridging against them. 

This will tend to put your whole thigh up over their back, making them carry your weight (destroying their posture) and preventing them from squaring up (keeping their arm isolated). 

That way, when you actually go to finish you will have an easier time doing the stuff people have suggested in this thread (e.g., extending your legs and sitting up hard) because they never had a chance to build base and posture in the first place.

It took forever to heal. Like 8+ months the first time and 6 months the second time. I think it was ligament vs. bone because I assumed that bones were supposed to heal faster than that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> College clubs are very different from any halfway decent gym. Speaking from experience (not trying to sound harsh):

Pretend that it is your first day of grappling ever, and assume you know basically nothing - more appropriately, assume that you have bad habits that should be relearned. Try to be a blank slate and keep an open mind to (re-)developing your fundamentals. 

I started out in a relaxed college club and as a result was tapping higher belts from day 1. But ultimately I think this hindered my progress - even knowing I had bad habits, it took forever to replace them since I had so much well-intentioned but lower-level instruction under my belt.

	<TEXT> Most likely you popped a costal cartilage. It's really unlikely that you fractured or bruised a rib. 

However, this type of injury takes stupidly long to heal because there is very little vascularization (blood flow) to your cartilage soft tissue. Take some L-Lysine (amino acid) to speed up healing. 

Sadly you are better off resting this because even coughing and heavy breathing will delay healing as well.  </TEXT>

yeah, holding the guy's belt is way different - the grip gives your arm structure to protect it, plus a lot of control over his body (note that he is truly dominating the top guy's crossfacing arm).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> the top guy's right arm is completely free to post in this situation - where could you possibly sweep him?

he literally has 5 things to post off of - all four limbs plus his head. he can also rotate in either direction - either counterclockwise to the mount to finish the kata gatame (as he does in the video) or clockwise to north/south for a kimura or armlock. 

IMO the only thing you should be doing in this situation is trying to get your arm back into a defensible position.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great advice. 

#2 is my favorite. It took me so damn long to learn. I cant tell you how many times I got smashed from not realizing this. 

The flipside is that now I exploit this - even against very advanced purple belts, I can promise that if they let me get a legitimate crossface from half guard or side control, I will get the pass and mount 99 times out of 100.  (And yes, they are letting me get it, or else I'd have no chance). 

Regardless of how good you are, it is extremely difficult to do anything if your cervical spine is twisted in the opposite direction from where you need to go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As many people have said, absolutely do not do this. 

If one does a straight ankle lock correctly, the stress on your ligaments is very much like a heel hook or toe hold. They dont have to switch to another type of leglock to make your knee explode - the straight ankle lock will do it if applied correctly. 

With your current mindset, I promise you that somebody who knows what they are doing will destroy your ankle and possibly your knee as well with a straight ankle lock before you realize what is happening. All they would have to do is choke up slightly and clamp down on the outside of your heel, and your knee will explode just like with a heel hook or toe hold because it is effectively the same pressure. 

You are better off pretending you never had this insane idea.  </TEXT>

Let a white belt sink a RNC on the best black belt in the world and the black belt still taps. The belt isn't magic. 

Also, going harder is the opposite of what you should do. Why not ask for details on how he did it? How about drilling that position with the same guy? He'll probably tap you again; learn to love it. Stop trying to "win the roll" - you'll be a much better grappler in the long run.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's awesome. Personally, I have never thought of that as a sweep in itself. When I work from bottom half guard, I am exerting that kind of pressure the whole time.  

Sometimes people will yield to it and get swept, but much more often it works as a setup to spin back the other way (e.g., to deep half guard). You can also use that pressure to extend them and transition to a kneebar on their other leg. 

IMHO, if you aren't exerting pressure like that from a knee shield, you're begging to get crossfaced and flattened out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's cool - don't sell yourself short. I had a lot of success with it as well when first starting out, including against blue belts. But guys with a better sense of posture and pressure are much harder to threaten with it relative to more standard techniques, even if they've never seen it before. 

I still hit it if people just give it to me, but IMHO you're better off going for an omoplata instead, and really learning the ins and outs of the omoplata as a position in itself. 

For example: how to lock it in and finish, how to come up on the sweep, how to finish after re-rolling to counter their roll, how to switch to toe holds and wrist locks, how to counter their jumping over you, etc. Lots of good options.  </TEXT>

Slowly and carefully turn the corner so your hips twist his arm into kimura range, then sit next to him, as close to the shoulder as possible.

I find that when I drop a heavy crossface and base far out with my other hand, even experienced guys will reach way up my back and try to use that underhook to bridge. From there it's very easy to trap it between my knee and elbow and finish the monoplata. 

Does anybody else have a relatively unorthodox move that works better than their fundamentals? Do you think it's because people just don't see it coming or don't have standard escapes?

/u/jiujitsulab has a great post on this. He mentions that what is considered fundamental or high-% depends on the "metagame." E.g., the brabo used to be a novelty and is now quite common.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Technique was well applied. I've trained no-gi for many years, and more than any other technique, I've caught higher belts with the Carni most often.

Done right, I think it cuts off people's most practiced and automatic escape routes (posture up or roll through). It's the only move with which I've tapped my former instructor, who is infinitely better and more experienced than me. So does it work sometimes? Yes. 

Do I still go for it? No. Just as it limits your opponent's options, I feel it traps my own hips in such a way that if I don't get the tap, I end up in a very bad spot.  BJJ is a game of probabilities and I feel I am much better off going for things that leave more good options open. 

The best moves for me are the ones I can more reliably impose on people at will even if they have an attribute advantage and/or they know exactly what you're trying to do. See Marcelo's guillotine, Langhi's spider guard, Roger Gracie's mounted cross choke. 

So in summary I am simultaneously not surprised to see the outcome of this fight and yet still of the opinion that the Carni is trash - for me at least. I would trade every tap I got with this for 5 minutes of shrimping drills.  </TEXT>
