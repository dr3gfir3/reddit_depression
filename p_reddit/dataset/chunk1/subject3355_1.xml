	<TEXT> This is literally the plot of 1984, and also literally the plot of Minority Report.  

Ugh, why can't the writers think of original plot lines anymore? I swear, the first 220 seasons of *America* were solid, but lately it feels like they're trying too hard. They're stealing story arcs from literary classics and are even rehashing their own. Like, Nixon's character was realistically flawed and the Watergate season was compellingly written, but this Trump guy, and his Russia thing? No finesse in the script whatsoever.

Shame, too. For awhile there it was the best series I knew. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Congressional Republicans are lucky to have gotten the ACA. If dems were better at voting off-year and all votes were equal (electoral college/gerrymandering), there'd be a constant democratic majority and we'd have gotten single-payer under President Gore. 

Instead, they got a free-market solution that *they* demanded, knowing full well that their "compromises" would allow premiums to continue rising annually. 

Tbh, I'm *loving* how far they've backed themselves into this corner. If my health weren't on the line, it'd be the most beautiful schadenfreude I'd ever witnessed.  </TEXT>

That and "paid protesters" seem to be the republican means of discrediting the social movements against Trump, yeah.  

And even *if* his argument held any water, I fail to see how it's a worthwhile criticism. First, it's not like the women who didn't vote can go back in time, and second, in what world is political engagement of women a bad thing?

This whole blame game is useless.  </TEXT>

Can't understand nuance, attack the voters and their genders. 

White women did show up to vote.

Helluva Freudian slip. 

And literally every single demographic had low turnout this election.

Accept the responsibility instead of marching after the fact.  

I gladly accept responsibility for my actions. I accept responsibility for canvassing on behalf of a senatorial candidate, phone banking on election day, voting early, and helping organize rallies. 

Do I "deserve" to march? 

Grow up. That kind of divisive rhetoric is the biggest challenge America, and more specifically, the democratic party, have to face going forward. 

Quit blaming and start doing  take a lesson from the women you're berating for taking action.   </TEXT>

Reading comprehension, how does that work? 

Edit: also, yeah. It sucks that Trump had to happen to get people to wake up to their civic duty. I wish it hadn't taken a (hopefully only metaphorical) nuclear bomb like Trump's election to get people engaged. But I'm going to take the engagement as a silver lining, not another reason to blame a huge group of people for something with nuanced and complex causes. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Cymbalta to Pristiq  what's going on? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-16 05:52:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I (21, F) was on 60mg cymbalta for about six months and it worked wonders for my depression and anxiety, but the fatigue and lethargy never went away and I was severely unmotivated to do anything but sleep. I went to the doctor and he's having me try 50mg pristiq instead. 
I've been taking it for 5 days and my tiredness has gotten worse, plus I feel woozy and just, idk, off since I started it. Plus when I spend any time out in the real world, I feel totally wrong and get emotional when I get back home, crying and anxious, the whole bit. 

Idk what's going on, I feel horrible and alone, and I just want to feel normal. Even typing this out has me in tears and I hate it. Is this just because I'm switching meds, and will it all go away? I hate being tired all the time and this switch was supposed to help that, instead it's made it and everything else worse. 

If anyone has any experience with this kind of thing or with switching from cymbalta to pristiq, I'd appreciate your insight. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Music is a really important therapy tool for me, and after my best friend took her own life this summer, I found solace in it. I built a playlist of songs right after the funeral to help me cry things out and I think it really helped me work through my emotions. If anyone is interested, here it is (warning: all of these *will* make you cry. For me, that was the point): 

**1. [Through My Prayers  Avett Brothers](https://youtu.be/ZiwVmUDWkkQ)**

Painfully accurate description of grief, regret, and the hard lessons of losing a loved one. The Avett Brothers are incredible lyricists and I also recommend "Winter in my Heart," "Laundry Room," and really all of their music. 

Every night after and every day since

I've find myself crying when the memory hits

Sometimes it knocks me down,

Sometimes I can just put it away.

**2. [Pictures of You  The Cure](https://youtu.be/-56h8d3gLgk)**

I spent a lot of time looking at old pictures of her since she took her life this summer. This song expresses how it feels to obsess over whatever you have left of that person, remembering the happy times and sad, and wondering what you could've done differently.

The Cure was her favorite band, and so they hold a special place in my heart. This one and "Lovesong" both tear me apart. 

If only I'd thought of the right words,

I'd could've held onto your heart.

If only I'd thought of the right words,

I wouldn't be breaking apart.

**3. [Transatlanticism  Death Cab for Cutie](https://youtu.be/jErtD0Gi-i4)**

This song describes an insurmountable distance between the singer and someone he loves. I bet we all know the feeling.

I need you so much closer...

Really, most of Death Cab's album Transatlanticism could go on this playlist.

 **4. [The Beacon  A Fine Frenzy](https://youtu.be/G-T3pn5shcg)**

A girl fighting for a loved one that wants to commit suicide.

You say your time has come,

You're tired of waking up.

Don't be obscene, 

I can't conceive

Of living without you.

**5. [Resurrection Fern  Iron   Wine](https://youtu.be/2QyVfs5G2uA)**

Frankly, the lyrics are so metaphorical that I have no idea what it's about, but it's truly beautiful. Same goes for all of Iron   Wine's music. 

**6. [Hear You Me  Jimmy Eat World](https://youtu.be/537v5Avw_mU)**

Heart. Breaking. A raw and honest expression of pain, gratitude, hope, and love to someone gone before their time.

And if you were with me tonight,

I'd sing to you just one more time,

A song for a heart so big,

God wouldn't let it live.

**7. [The Brightest Bulb Has Burned Out/Screws Fall Out  Less Than Jake](https://youtu.be/6qyJ4iiuwU8)**

I've known this song since I was 11, and I'd always liked it. I hadn't heard it in years until I broke out my old iPod just after the funeral. This song came on shuffle as I was walking to work and it broke me. It's like the writer had listened to one of the many conversations she and I had over the years. 

So I'll let you know, 

If you need somewhere to go,

I'll be listening when you call 

And I'll be there if you fall off.

If you need someone to believe in you,

I'll let you know, 

I will.

**8. [Mary  Scissor Sisters](https://youtu.be/6h5SQhcNY8A)**

This song has a sad backstory. The writer and singer befriended a woman over a phone chat line when he was struggling with his sexuality. She was very obese and wanted to get a gastric bypass but couldn't afford it. He told her that if his band ever made it big, he'd get it for her. Of course, the band made it and he paid for the surgery. She died due to surgical complications. This song is about her.

Cause I'd give everything I have

Forget all the things that bring me joy

If you could have one day

Of pure and simple happiness

**9. [A Better Place, A Better Time  Streetlight Manifesto](https://youtu.be/JXdnYgJy4fs)**

Begging, pleading, trying to convince his lover not to take her own life.

And when you wake up

Everything is going to be fine

I guarantee that you wake up in a better place

And in a better time.

**10. [The World Has Turned and Left Me Here  Weezer](https://youtu.be/B_nuZ4cPBrQ)**

Pure, unadulterated grief.

The world has turned and left me here

Just where I was before you appeared

And in your place an empty space

Has filled the void behind my face. 

If anyone else has others I'd love to get suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand the curiosity. Really, I do. But making the process of rooting out evidence of hacking public is a stupid thing to do and the agencies know it. If they tell the world exactly how they investigated and found the evidence which led them to their conclusion means Russian hackers will know too. They'll be able to circumvent the probing process and fuck with us even more. 

The 17 agreeing intelligence statements *are* the evidence. That's how it works. People need to learn the difference between healthy skepticism and anti-intellectualism.

	<TEXT> I'll list a few of the things that Reagan accomplished, and I encourage all of you to add to the list. 

-**His tax cuts for the wealthy caused a huge economic crisis.** Turns out, cutting taxes across the board doesn't help the economy after a period of massive inflation,  *even when you make sure to cut the top bracket by 70%!* Who would have thought?


-**Double-dealing in the Iraq-Iran war and failure to condemn atrocities against civilian populations**. Reagan supplied Saddam Hussein's Iraq with weapons during the Iran-Iraq war, knowing that the Iraqi soldiers were using chemical weapons on civilians. When presented with a U.N. agreement to condemn Hussein, he vetoed it. He was *also* supplying Iran with weapons concurrently.

-**Iran-Contra** too complicated for me to type out, [here's a link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair?wprov=sfla1) to the Wikipedia entry. Basically, he gave weapons to terrorists in trade for releasing hostages (which didn't work) and to fund "freedom fighter" death squads in Nicaragua. 

**Supported the South African Apartheid government**. After passing easily through Congress, the Anti-Apartheid Act was vetoed by Reagan. 

-**Ignoring the AIDS crisis**. Reagan never acknowledged or attempted to help during this plague, which killed *millions* of Americans, because it mostly affected the gay community. He even proposed funding cuts for AIDS research.

	<TITLE> Weird wave sensation on my brain... If anyone else has felt this and didn't die of it, please ease my mind, I'm freaking out. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-01 10:47:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, my general info - 

I [21F] have been diagnosed and on medication (Adderall 20mg IR 3x daily) for ADHD-PI for one year. Last week, I began counseling and have been diagnosed with dysthymia, GAD, and hypochondria. I will be starting antidepressants within the next 2 weeks, and I've been taking St. John's Wort for a month. 

So here's what happened: 

I was sitting on my bed, just out of a hot shower, and I suddenly felt this weird wave of pressure inside the front right side of my head. It's hard to explain. The best I can do is it felt like someone gently pressed the bottom of their hand on my brain, then rolled their hand down to the front right side, or like the right frontal lobe was falling to the right while the rest stayed still. It only lasted a few seconds, and it was very intense but not debilitating. All I could do was sit there and think "this isn't good." It didn't hurt at all, but I've had a slight headache that comes and goes by my right temple in the hours since, and I've been dizzy and unfocused. I haven't noticed any cognitive issues; I can still talk, walk, type, and see, which were the first things I tried to do after I regained my composure because I needed to know I hadn't just had a stroke or aneurysm.

Of course, being who I am, I Googled possible reasons. I'm not on pharmaceutical antidepressants, which was the most common search result, so I kept searching, which was not a comfort.

Logically, a few things might have caused the weirdness. I had taken my ADHD meds before getting into a hot shower, and my heart rate might've been a little elevated, plus I haven't eaten in probably 11 hours (depression-related appetite problems). None of the online results had anything to do with Adderall by itself, though. Another possible cause mentioned was quick, repetitive back-and-forth eye movement, and I'd been skimming my Netflix lists for 20 minutes or so before it happened.

I'm probably overreacting. I'm a hypochondriac, and this was a horrible new sensation. I worry over minor abdominal pain (it's always gas, *but what if this time I'm wrong and die??*) so this got me spiralling. I'm freaking out, worried I've got MS or I'm about to have a neurological disorder named after me. I can't stop worrying about it. My mind is going 600 miles a minute, back and forth between telling me I'm dying and trying to come up with reasonable explanations, then rejecting them immediately because I'm so sure I've got a tumor or or AVM or blah blah fuckety blah I'm tired 

Sorry, got off-track there :/... has anyone else had that feeling? Does anyone know what it is? Is it anxiety-related? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Even if we weren't blood, we were family.  My parents loved you like a daughter, and I loved you like a sister. I got the call while I was on vacation, riding in the back seat while my mom pointed out places she and my dad had gone when they first started dating. The sudden change in my voice from happy to numb during that one-minute phone conversation scared them. They needed to know what was wrong. 

I told them. Mom broke down. Dad kept his composure until we arrived at my aunt's house, where we stood in the driveway in shocked silence. I've witnessed my father cry twice in my life: the first was during his eulogy for my grandpa; the second was in that driveway.

I flew home early for your funeral. The last time I had seen your loved ones, we were in high school. Sitting at the kitchen counter, laughing and gossiping while we ate homemade frijoles and fresh tortillas faster than your mom could make them. All of my memories with your family were happy ones until that day.


I saw your brother first. When he looked at me, he started to cry. "I didn't want to see you here," he told me, "you remind me of her too much. She was so happy when you were around, she loved you." He hugged me as we wept, and I finally understood that you were gone. Seeing him made it real.

Then I saw your mother. She stood up to embrace me and collapsed in my arms. I held her up and guided her back to the seat. She was in a hundred million pieces, and had been unable to eat or sleep since you died. All she could do was cry louder than I thought possible, with more pain than I though humans could withstand. Your father remained stoic. His wife needed someone to lean on. 

Your sister cried so hard that she physically couldn't anymore. Her heartbreaking, beautiful eulogy was spoken in a wavering voice, and she was constantly on the verge of losing her composure. Through my teary eyes, she looked just like you. 

My parents came home a few days later, as we couldn't afford to all come back early. They'd found the pictures you took on that disposable camera during our first trip to the mountains together, your first time seeing snow. We made a snowman and you sat next to him, grinning like a fool and flashing a peace sign for a picture. It's now framed and sitting on your mom's bedside table.

All four of your parents cried in the driveway of the house we had sleepovers in every other week, holding a picture of their late daughter, happy, in the snow. 

Today, one month has passed since we stood in the cemetery holding roses for your casket. I wish you knew how much we loved you. You died because you didn't want to burden us, not knowing that you'd never be a burden.

We all miss you so much.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You ended your life one month ago today. In a week, it will have been one month since we buried you. 

I had my old iPod on shuffle while I was walking to work today. It played a song I haven't heard in years. I'd always liked it -- the lyrics are beautiful and full of love -- but I had never had an emotional connection to it. Until today. 

It said everything I wanted to say to you before it happened, and it resembled our conversations in the months leading up to your death so much it was uncanny. It even got your age right. 

It knocked the wind out of me and I started crying. I miss you so much, babe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew A was depressed. She had been for years. When we met, we were in seventh grade and she cut herself. She told me, the day after she had been caught sneaking out of her bedroom window to meet her boyfriend, that she would rather kill herself than face her parents. I told her not to, I was there for her, and she lived through her parents' disappointment and punishment. 

The number of times she cried her eyes out with her head on my chest in the two years of middle school, I don't even know. 
We went to separate high schools, and lost our closeness and contact for a year. Because of a boy, of all stupid reasons. But we came back together. Of course we did. No one could make me laugh the way she did, and no one understood her better than I. She told me that she had attempted suicide within the last few months. She downed a bottle of sleeping pills, or most of one, and woke up the next day feeling like human garbage. But she was alive. I told her that she needed to see a professional, but she didn't want to. She thought she should be able to get well alone. Seeing a psychiatrist would make her weak. 

She went off to college. She was brilliant, a natural scientist, and wanted to major in genetics. We talked occasionally. Sometimes we were happy, sometimes we were trudging through shit, but we still talked. She called me whenever she felt overwhelmed, and I told her how strong she was and how amazing it was that she tried so hard. Everything seemed like it was getting better. 

Then she met her husband. They got married fast -- too fast, I think. He was enlisted, and would make more money as a married man than singly. He had anger issues, and he was possessive and became abusive. But they were married, and that was that. She felt obligated to make it work with him. The calls became less regular. 

I got a text from a friend at 4 in the morning today, saying "call me." I looked at it and promptly fell asleep again. Six hours later, as I was driving doing vacation things with my family, my (other) best friend called me. She told me that A was dead, but she didn't know details. She just didn't want me to find out by reading some stranger's Facebook obit. A's mother told me she committed suicide, and I had this horrible crystalizing moment. Of course she had. Her secret marriage to an abusive man, her crushing sense of inadequacy, her conviction that she was worthless, and God knows what else she hadn't been telling me about... 

I'm a mess. I can't help thinking I should have been there. I could have stopped her. 

Why didn't she call me? </TEXT>
