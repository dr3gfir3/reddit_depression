	<TEXT> I think he was really disappointed in his brothers. Davos, Edd and a few others just got support from the wildlings right and not from the crows when they were confined? I mean why didn't rest of the watch rebel against Alliser, by what right did he execute a Lord Commander ? So who's to say he won't be murdered again if he stays ? He has lost all faith in his brothers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reminded me of Jamie and how it snowed in the riverlands :
 When morning broke the snow was ankle deep, and deeper in the godswood, where drifts had piled up under the trees. Squires, stableboys, and highborn pages turned to children again under its cold white spell, and fought a snowball war up and down the wards and all along the battlements. Jaime heard them laughing. There was a time, not long ago, when he might have been out making snowballs with the best of them, to fling at Tyrion when he waddled by, or slip down the back of Cersei's gown. *You need two hands to make a decent snowball, though.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Needle was Robb and Bran and Rickon, her mother and her father, even Sansa. Needle was Winterfell's grey walls, and the laughter of its people. Needle was the summer snows, Old Nan's stories, the heart tree with its red leaves and scary face, the warm earthy smell of the glass gardens, the sound of the north wind rattling the shutters of her room. Needle was Jon Snow's smile. He used to mess my hair and call me "little sister," she remembered, and suddenly there were tears in her eyes.  </TEXT>

What is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms ... or the memory of a brothers smile? Wind and words. Wind and words. We are only human, and the gods have fashioned us for love. That is our great glory, and our great tragedy." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They why part is a bit difficult, but all the evidence pointed Jeoff. Actually it was not explicitly stated but both Jamie and Tyrion came to that conclusion each deducing separately. Actually Littlefinger said that the dagger was his and he lost to Tyrion in a bet that Jamie would loose in a tourney, but that was a lie because Tyrion was not there in KL and nobody could disprove it, later Tyrion tells Catelyn that he never bets against his family, he actually bet the dagger for Jamie and lost it to Robert (who always hopes to see Jamie get embarrassed). So now during the Winterfell visit the dagger is in Robert's possession. Tyrion confronts both Jamie and Cersie and they tell him they didn't sent the Catspaw, because it would be too risky and they thought Bran won't live anyway. Tyrion now bases his suspicion of Joffery on two things -i)Jeoff talks about killing wolves during one of his conversations at Winterfell ii) Jeoffery receives a Valyrion steel sword during his wedding and says he is no stranger to Valyrion steel, when Tyrion tryies to probe into that, he gets really angry and cuts the book Tyrion gives as a present, which was a gesture to say that Tyrion's days were numbered. Thus, Tyrion concludes that it was Jeoff. So the answer to "why" is, Jeoff is stupid and wanted Robert's attention because Robert once mentioned that Bran be ethunized. He didn't know about J+C </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think it is better to make a good character wait for the right time than make him look ridiculous by unnecessary screen time. Peter Dinklage is a great actor and those scenes didnt do him justice, instead they could have used that time for developing intrigue </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a battle between Dany and Jon can be avoided by the reveal, because he will have to bend the knee if there is no reveal if northmen don't want him to do so, he will have to fight Dany. In case his parentage is proven, Dany can easily form an alliance with him, because both Jon and Dany want to avoid violence as far as possible. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok I see , but I think all stark kids will get what they wanted, remember Jon wanted to be the lord of Winterfell since when he was a kid (he was overcome with emotion when Stannis made the proposal to him, he remembered how he had charged at Robb once while sword practice shouting winterfell, and Robb had said you can't be that). Arya wanted to be a warrior like the dragon sisters, she is definitely on the route, Bran wanted to be a knight and he will be the last hero right ?, the hero of the doomsday fight, Sansa will be a queen I think maybe at Casterly Rock with Tyrion...Ahh too much wishful thinking </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, i agree that the writers miss out on the inner struggles of the characters (Arya's 'hole where her heart was', Dany's 'if i look back i'm lost', Jon's 'kill the boy') but the guy in the video seems to think that the show is somehow tarnishing the spirit of books and that's going a bit too far imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It makes sense when you say it, i agree that "the pack must stay together" is enforced more powerfully in Arya's context by GRRM. She is a leader, i don't doubt that either (the way she leads lommy, hot pie, gendry in riverlands). But, I always think of her as a rebel and a free spirit. Also, she can't advertise herself as a faceless assassin to get respect from the North, Jon may have it because he was the Lord commander, and is a proven warrior. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok i agree with Dany and Jon being the key protagonists, but the case can't be argued with Meribald because it is not complete in the books yet, maybe later in the books someone destroys the gravedigger's haven and he returns to his old ways (or a path of revenge) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, I came across this in the first book in a Bran chapter where it is described how Hodor used to carry Bran in a wicker basket - " Hodor seemed to like it too, though with hodor it was hard to tell. The only tricky part was doors. Sometimes Hodor forgot that he had Bran on his back, and that could be painful when he went through a door."... So hodor always forgot to hold the door for Bran, lol makes me wonder how many clues grrm has hidden in plain sight ! </TEXT>
