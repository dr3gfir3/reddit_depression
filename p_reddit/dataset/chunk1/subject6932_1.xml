	<TEXT> I get it. Reddit doesn't like Republicans. I'm not a fan of the party either, but y'all are really stretching the intent of this sub.

[This](http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2015/05/democrats-havent-moved-farther-than-gop.html) article was fine. It's headline is quite obvious to pretty much any American.

[This](http://chron.com/news/houston-texas/texas/article/Republican-senators-only-like-federal-relief-when-6292025.php) article really isn't okay for here. This isn't something that is obvious, it's just being posted to further someone's message. Also, I suspect, if the headline read "Democrats Don't Care about Gun Owners Except in their Own States", it wouldn't have been posted, never mind getting to the top. 

I'm not in favor of banning political posts, as some really are appropriate for this sub, such as " Campaign heats up as Election draws near", "GOP wants to dismantle Obamacare", "Democrats plan more taxes, more gov't spending", " Treasury Dept Concerned with Stability of Dollar", or indeed the actual article mentioned at the beginning of this post. Nobody can force you to look at both sides of an issue, but at least try and think if the headline is actually obvious before you post.

Thank you for reading through this. 

And for those that didn't, TL;DR: Don't just shit on Republicans, see if the article title is actually obvious or if it just confirms a bias that you have.

	<TEXT> A few years ago I went on vacation with my family, and one of the places we stopped was Wall Drug, SD. I'm not sure why that part is important, but that's where we were and I'm not going back to rewrite it. Anyway, we were in one of the restaurants and a French-Canadian family was seated next to us. (I assume they were Canadian because French people typically don't make a road trip to South Dakota. On a related note, that's why the fact we were in Wall Drug was important.)

Now, I don't like to generalize like this, but typically when a group of tourists are in America speaking something other than English, they tend to speak it loudly, confident that nobody will understand them and that nobody will call them out for it. This family was certainly not an exception; if I recall correctly there was a heated debate over how much to tip and how they were going to split the bill. It was quite annoying, and quite drawn out.

As we were getting ready to leave, someone told some joke and my uncle couldn't stop laughing. The Canadians were giving us dirty looks and I felt the need to apologize as I went past.

Dsol I said Je sais qu'il est pnible quand on peut pas couter  son propre penses.

Roughly translated that's *Sorry, I know it's annoying when you can't hear yourself think.* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking to pick up a hobby and buy a bike because I figure that it'll give me something to do and also save me some money on gas in the summer. However, I don't have a whole lot of experience wrenching and I want something that won't be too intimidating to work on. I only have two main requirements other than that: I have a budget of around two grand and the bike must be able to do interstate speeds comfortably.

If anybody knows of a better place to ask this, do let me know. </TEXT>
