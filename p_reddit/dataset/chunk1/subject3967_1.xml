	<TEXT> Congratulations! I am going to make the last payment on my student loans this month! Then, it's all about making my wife's debt disappear (married last October). 

Go out, celebrate, bask in the freedom. Seriously, this is no easy feat and something *worth celebrating*.

Cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been on a cut for about 2 months now. I'm thought I was handling my diet pretty well, but I'm really disappointed in the loss of muscle that came with the loss of fat. I didn't think it was noticeable until this morning. I feel like all that hard work I put in during the winter bulk is gone due to my cutting process. Fuck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I do want to point out, however, that treating such an account as play money - you have Stock Picks written in your list, not Sound Investment Strategy - is counter productive to growing your wealth. This is your money and its purpose is to make you more money.

Sorry, yes I understand this. I bought some stocks about 5 years ago. Since then, I've reallocated to mostly index ETFs and large-cap dividend payers. I stopped the trading casino years ago! I'm a bit more passive with this account than I was when I first started!

 Just realize that if you do this before getting out of debt, everything you spend money on will cost more by the amount of the interest rate on your debt. You would be paying a premium to do this while in debt.

A fair assessment, and something I didn't factor into the cost of the trip. I'll have to do additional calculations and possibly scale things back if it's too detrimental to our finances in the near future.

Glad to see someone else who has taken extended time off to travel. We've fought, debated, and struggled this topic so much (which is kind of a first-world problem if you look at it...). Basically, we can save money now, have a stable retirement, THEN travel the world at 65. However, I want to be able to hike, bike, walk, and climb around the world at the limber age of 30. At this point, we're sacrificing a (potentially significant) amount of money in our future to do so.

Blegh, I've rambled on, but thank you so much for your input. Means a lot.

	<TEXT>  Depends on the rate. Her interest is tax deductible, which essentially works out (within applicable limits) to a discount on the interest rate equal to your marginal tax bracket (e.g., if your interest rate is 8% and your marginal tax rate is 25%, you're "really" paying only 6% interest). If the interest rate on the loans is less than what you expect to gain on your IRA, the IRA is a better choice.

Thanks for that breakdown! I forgot to take into account the tax-deductible interest. With that, it might actually make more sense to contribute to my IRA at that point.

 "I" (since I was the breadwinner at the time) paid off my wife's student loans. But it wasn't really "me" doing the paying anyway, since the money was hers as much as mine.

Absolutely, this is how I view it as well. This helps to justify our mindsets.

 What I like to do is to figure how much interest I could save by using the money to pay for debt instead, and tacking that onto the cost of the trip.

I will definitely do this when I get home to the budget! This will put things a bit more into perspective, especially calculating *true* losses because of the trip. Hopefully, it's still worth it, but I've already stressed to her that I'm not going to "go broke" for this trip.

 Do you have new jobs lined up afterward? I would not be comfortable with both myself and my spouse quitting at the same time -- for whatever reason -- without a clear plan for what we do next.

I'll be completely honest, she will probably lose her job and I will be able to take a 3-month sabbatical. However, I want to be prepared for the both of us being unemployed. Fortunately, I'm in an industry where it isn't super hard to find work for decent pay. I can't say the same for her, but hopefully our emergency fund will cover her income. We also have the added fortune of staying with family rent-free when we return, which has already been established, though I'd like to avoid it!

Thanks so much for your reply!

	<TEXT> You don't have to remove the brake hose from the caliper to swap the pads, but I'll share this anyway:

Last time I worked with the front brakes, I snapped the banjo bolt (connects the brake hose to the caliper). Don't overtighten this bolt, it will snap! If it leaks after re-attaching, there is a copper washer that is supposed to go between the brake hose connector and the caliper. Sometimes, it doesn't sit right. Check that instead of trying to tighten the bolt too much.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 29/M, Married, Advice on retirement, student loans, and travel? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-10 18:10:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll try and keep this short and sweet. I feel like my wife and I are doing pretty well with our finances so far. We have the following:

* Emergency Fund 3mo
* No Consumer Debt
* Contributions to Retirement (Her 401k, My IRA)
* Student Loan Debt (Her $34k)
* A Brokerage Account (Stock Picks, etc.)
* Savings Obligations for a Big Trip

A couple of questions:

I do not have a 401k at my company, so I'm thinking I should max out my IRA, right? Even so, that's only $5500 /yr for the next 35 years (if I retire at 65). By my own calculations, I'll have relatively little to live on in retirement! Is this right? Should I be finding other ways to save for retirement outside of my IRA?

I just completed paying off *my* student loans by selling of stocks in my brokerage account. According to the FAQ, we should be tackling her student loan debt before allocating funds for retirement. Rather than contributing to my IRA, should I be contributing to *her* loan payment? I don't know how many married couples handle paying off each other's debt, but I imagine it's a team effort. Any other advice on this?

This "Big Trip" we have planned is a 3-month excursion from Asia to Europe. I know, we should probably be paying down our debt before saving and spending money on this trip, but we've already decided (after much debate) that this is really the only time we'll be able to do this... Not only does this put us out of income for 3-months, but we will most-likely be leaving our jobs. My question is, has anyone ever done something like this and came out alright? Is a trip like this utterly and completely out of line for our financial situation?

Any insight, experiences, and advice on anything I mentioned would be MUCH appreciated. Thanks so much in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We're not really doing "around the world" like you did, we're hitting parts of Asia and most of Southern Europe. It would be our first long-term international trip though. We plan to stay at least a week in each city, hopefully that's "slow" enough to not destroy our wallets. We've saved a good chunk, somewhat aimlessly ($11k so far). No real budget set at all!

We haven't done ANY research beyond, "Let's hit these continents!" Plenty of work to do there, but I just recently discovered this sub and Lonely Planet (from your post!) </TEXT>

I had the temperature pretty high consistently throughout the process. I kept it roasting well past the first crack. However, I did end up turning down the temperature as things started getting really burnt, but it may have been preemptive...

I also only let it rest over night, which doesn't seem to be long enough. Maybe I'll let it rest a bit longer.

I'll be sure to take more notes as I go. Haven't been writing anything down at all! </TEXT>

The latest prices don't reflect the actual price I paid, since I ordered everything on Black Friday / Cyber Monday. It was just **under $900** !


**My Story**

So, I grew up building computers. My father got into IT in the early 90s and he built computers for our household from spare parts from work and trips to the local computer store. The enthusiasm for home-built PCs has carried over into my adult years.

My first couple of builds started my freshman year in college. Following in my father's footsteps, I took trips to my university surplus sales and put together fairly decent builds from old parts. It was a ton of fun (and a whole lot of learning) putting together "scrap" parts and creating computers that worked fairly well.

Fast-forward to my junior year (3rd year) in university. I landed a decent job as a student doing system administration in various campus computer labs. I saved up money over a year and built my very first gaming rig. It was still extremely budget, with an OC'd Intel E5200 CPU paired with an low-end GeForce GPU (don't remember which one). Pretty good for CounterStrike 1.6!

Fast-forward to graduation a couple of years later. I get my first career job as an entry-level web developer. At this point, I'm making decent money and playing more demanding games. So, I decided to build a mid-range rig with an Intel i7-860 CPU and paired with an AMD Radeon HD 5850. Played all kinds of games with this baby: CounterStrike Source, L4D, Simcity 4, ANNO Series. Noticed it could handle most things, but not everything. Ended up selling this to some high schoolers.

Now, it's 2014. This past October, I got married. Since the pattern for me has been, "Big life event? Build a gaming PC!", I decide to keep it going. I spent a month scouring Tom's Hardware, Anandtech, and /r/buildapc. I felt the rush of mixing and matching parts, increasing and decreasing budgets, and reading over benchmark charts. The research is the most riveting part of this hobby!


I've rambled on, but thanks for reading, if you did! Now, I'm going to go fire up Global Offensive and relearn how to navigate de_dust. Thanks so much /r/buildapc!


**TL;DR - I grew up building PCs. On major life events, I build gaming rigs. This is my latest build.**

This is an evolution of my two previous threads:

[First Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2luc91/build_help_rts_gaming_system_suggestions_650usd/)

[Second Thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2m0i4i/build_help_650_gaming_build_w_ocd_g3258/)

Notes:

* After MUCH consideration and debate, I've decided to forego an OC'd G3258 and just pony up for an i5. Better gaming performance along with the added comfort of easily multitasking if I wanted to.

* There is something really cool about packing a ton of power into a compact box. Other mini-ITX builds on here have inspired me to try one myself.

Questions:

* Is the NZXT PSU enough to power this system? Is it overkill? PCPartPicker says 398W, but maybe some breathing room is good? Any recommendations here?

* I'm also going to get [this low-profile CPU cooler by Rosewill](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16835200057) to save space in the CM Elite 130. Is this worth it? Any other low-profile fans to recommend?

Any recommendations appreciated. Going to purchase next week! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-11-17 11:40:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'll keep this one short, but I could really use some help. I've got an older system I built way back in 2008. I'm thinking about upgrading the CPU and GPU. Also going to throw an SSD in there. It would cost me roughly $300 to get the following:

* Intel C2Q Q9650 (3.0 GHz)
* Gigabyte P45 Mobo
* Power Cooler R9 270
* 4 GB DDR2 800 (2x2) RAM
* Silverstone ST400 400W PSU

What kind of gaming performance would I be able to get out of this? I play some FPS and RTS games (SC2, CS:GO). I'd also like to play stuff like Sim City and Civ5.

Would it be better to pair the R9 270 with an entirely new system with the G3258?

Open to discussion. Thanks so much! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking for some help picking out a small case/tower for my gaming build. I really like this [Rosewill Line-M](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16811147166) case, but it has a top-mounted PSU. I've always seen that bottom-mounted PSUs are more efficient in terms of cooling, so I was wondering if there is a case out there similar to this one, but with a bottom-mounted PSU.

I'm also open to other cases. I'd like it to be relatively small (Micro ATX motherboard). My price range is $60.

Things to note:

* I've decided to OC the G3258 with the stock fan/heatsink. As others have mentioned, I should be fine. However, I'd like to get 25-40% increase in clock-speed (from 3.2 GHz to 4GHz). Will I be able to achieve this on the stock cooling parts without having it burn out in the next 2 years or so? If not, does anyone have suggestions on good cooling without breaking the bank?

* I've decided on the R9 280 (versus my previous choice of 270X). This seems to be the most recommended "budget" GPU. I'm hoping I'll be able to OC the CPU and run this GPU on the Rosewill 550W PSU. Does anyone have experience with Rosewill PSUs? Newegg rates it pretty high (5 stars) and I haven't heard/seen super negative reviews on it, but I could be mistaken.

* On the note of PSUs, PCPartPicker tells me my estimated wattage will be 337W, while the GPU asks for a minimum of 600W. If I OC the CPU with this GPU, will the 550W PSU be enough? It's got 43A on a single 12V, so I'm thinking I'll be fine, but it doesn't hurt to ask. I don't want to fry my parts! On the flip side, would the 550W be overkill?

* I play mostly RTSs and city-sims. Don't know if thats too relevant, considering people tell me that the performance will depend on the individual game more than the genre.

Thanks for all the help so far!

	<TEXT> Background: I'm a short-time lurker on /r/buildapc, but on-and-off system builder since 2008. First build was an Intel E5200 w/o GPU. Second build was an Intel I7-860 w/ HD 5850. I generally enjoy RTS, city-building, and simulator type games, but I sometimes play FPS games like CS:Source and L4D.

I'm looking for an upgraded version of my last computer (2009). I'd like to play RTS and city-sims (SimCity, SC2, Civ-5) at the highest settings, smoothly. I'm guessing 60 fps average?

Things to note:

* I am going to OC the G3258 as much as possible to get the gaming performance I want. I was originally going to go with an Intel i5 4460, but [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/2lsvze/discussion_g3258_packs_a_big_punch_even_before/) made me strongly consider the G3258! I'm thinking I can get good RTS performance from the dual-core, but I'm open to being convinced otherwise.

* Not listed is a CPU cooler. I used an AF Pro 7 in my first build and a CM Hyper 212 on my second build. Any suggestions for an 1150 CPU cooler that will help with the G3258 OC without killing my wallet?

* Will the R9 270X meet my gaming requirements? I was also considering a GTX 760, but the price of the 270X was more convincing for me. Is there any noticeable advantage of picking one over the other other than cost?

I'm open to any suggestions at all on the build. I'm just getting started, but I'm hoping to order during the Black Friday/Cyber Monday season. I honestly can't wait to build my 3rd rig!

Thanks in advance!

I'm trying to find pieces that will go well with my standard outfit (jeans/khakis, OCBD/long-sleeve tee). So far, I've decided on:

I'm looking for another casual shoe that would work well with my outfit. Any recommendations on my selections are welcome as well.

Thanks so much, MFA.

edit: My budget is less than $80 for this last pair. For all three pairs, I'd like to spend no more than $200-$220 on all three pairs. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Heads Up: Parking on Nickerson Street? Someone siphoned my gas tank... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-27 18:29:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I often park up on Nickerson St to visit my fiancee who lives just west of Seattle Pacific University. Came to look at my car this morning and noticed a bunch of scratches around the gas cap and fender. Got into my car, fired her up, saw that the tank was only 1/4 full, yet I had filled up the night before.

Is there any way to tell if people put stuff in my tank?

Thought I'd give a heads up to anyone else who parks (or plans on parking) in the area. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey XJers!

I was wondering if you guys do anything to prevent stolen/broken-in vehicles with your Jeeps. I was thinking of getting a club (old steering wheel bar) and installing a fake LED, mostly as visual deterrents. However, I'm contemplating actually getting an alarm system professionally installed. 

Any thoughts on how much this would cost? Or how easy it would be to do myself? Thanks in advance </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 3.5" Lift - Adjustable Track Bar? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-26 20:31:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Greetings! So, I installed a 3.5" lift (Rubicon Express) on the front of my XJ a couple of weeks back. Now, I'm experiencing some weird steering issues and I think it might be my track bar. When I was putting on the extended sway bar links, I had trouble getting the driver side link to line up well with the stock sway bar. Is there any other way to fully confirm that my axle is off?

I'm thinking that the track bar is the issue, so I'm looking into getting one without breaking the bank. I was looking at this one from Rough Country: http://www.roughcountry.com/adjustable-track-bar-7572.html

Will I need any additional hardware? Is it as simple as a pull off, bolt on?

Any advice/help is appreciated, thanks all!

	<TITLE> Weddings, Parents, and the god damn Guestlist! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-29 07:18:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm getting married this fall. It'll be relatively small (150 guests). I, personally, just want to be married to the woman I love without going into fucking debt. I'm sorry, but I'm not trying to drop $50k on a one-day party for people to come eat a free meal and drink themselves blind in "the name of our love".

My parents want to invite all sorts of people I haven't fucking seen in years and can barely remember their names. Her parents, who are worse, want to invite even more guests on her side. It's supposed to be an even split, but her side has like 10 more because her mother keeps bitching about a bunch of people I've never fucking met in my entire relationship with my future wife.

I know it's common to have weddings taken over by other people (parents, to be exact), but god damn I wish we were planing a small wedding with immediate family only. At the very least, we wouldn't have to break the bank to feed a bunch of freeloading relatives and have our parents bitch about how "John Doe from Podunk, USA once wiped my ass as a child and should be invited to the wedding."

I finally, FINALLY, understand how couples go fucking apeshit over wedding guestlists. This is, by far, the shittiest part of this entire god damned process.

Word of advice to intelligent couples everywhere: have a small wedding or nothing at all. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello fellow XJers!

I drove over some trails over the weekend, nothing too rough, but definitely got to bounce around. I went to start it up one morning and heard a clunking noise right underneath the center console area. It was like someone was sitting underneath the vehicle and knocking on the bottom of the vehicle. As soon as the engine turned over, the sound went away.

It is better on some days than others, but consistent with starting up the vehicle. Went underneath, shook my pipes, drive shaft, etc. Checked to make sure nothing was hitting the crossmember under the t-case. Nothing is noticeably loose at first glance. Any ideas on what it could be? Pebble get into something?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> ZJ (Grand Cherokee) Coils in XJ </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-18 08:25:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, the rear end of my XJ sits a bit higher than my front. I'd like to even this out a bit. I've got 2" spacers in front already, so I'd like to NOT add another .5" - 1" spacer.

Instead, I'd like to swap out the coils, but I'm on a budget. According to Rocklizard Fab (http://www.rocklizardfabrications.com/home_brew_budget_boost.htm), you can use ZJ coils to add 1" lift! 

Has anyone personally done this themselves? Where did you get the coils?

After looking, I found these on Rockauto: http://www.rockauto.com/catalog/moreinfo.php?pk=201281 cc=1315973

Any help is much appreciated, thanks! </TEXT>

Has the benefit of being far cheaper without having to buy or rent a welder. Also, I don't know how to weld...

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey XJers! I'm planning on changing out a bunch of fluids this weekend on my 98 and I wanted to see if I should replace any hardware while I'm doing it. I'm doing the AX-15 tranny, t-case, diffies, motor oil, and coolant (done the oil and coolant before, didn't replace any parts other than the filter).

Since I'm taking apart the diffies, anything I should replace? Bolts? Plugs? Hoses?

I'm actually stoked to be doing this. Something about new fluids in my Jeep that make me feel happy.. lol.

Thanks in advanced everyone! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> XJ Budget Boost Shocks Recommendation </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-03-13 23:47:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey XJers!

I'd like to replace the stock shocks to get a little smoother of a ride and a bit more vertical travel. I've got got a 2" BB on it right now.

I was browsing JeepForum and CherokeeTalk (via Google), and found some old threads on the topic. However, I'd like to see if anyone has any other more 'up-to-date' recommendations.

So far from my research, the top brands are Bilstein and OME. Has this changed over the last couple of years? 

Thanks everyone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey XJers! I purchased a 98 XJ this past summer. I want to repair the fog lamps on it. They are the stock ones located under the bumper. When I flip the switch inside the car, there is no indicator LED. Does that mean I should replace the switch? Is there any way I can confirm this, possibly with a multimeter? I'm completely noob with multimeters...

Where would you start diagnosing this? I don't want to spend money on the switch only to have it be something else! Thanks so much in advanced! </TEXT>

Anyway, does anyone have recommendations on Jeep garages in the Seattle area? First hand experience with the mechanic would be nice. It'd also be nice to know if there are any other XJers out here!
