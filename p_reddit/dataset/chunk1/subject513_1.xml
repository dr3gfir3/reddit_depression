	<DATE> 2016-12-29 16:53:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I keep getting in matches of conquest where over the course of the match one team gets more and more tanks while the other gets none. By mid game the tank team sometimes has 3 or 4 tanks to the other teams none.

This is near gamebreaking. It takes a lot of Assault guys to take out that many tanks with no tank support. I certainly hope this is a bug, because if dice thinks this kind of tank imbalance is a good thing they are fools </TEXT>

We know that EA is going to put micro-transactions in their games, and this is about the least obstructive way to do it. Battlepacks have no real effect on me other than something to do in loading screens.

	<TEXT> Wallace and Gromit memes have rapidly risen in popularity from the /r/me_irl subreddit in the past few days. Do not be fooled by the shit posting however. Memes like Wallace and Gromit show a struggling meme brokers attempts to remain relevant in an evolving marketplace.

Trying to appeal to their main consumers nostalgic pasts, the /r/me_irl meme brokers have revived the corpse of a dead meme with derivative marketing ploys. 

Wallace and Gromit show the destructive effects of a meme broker like /r/me_irl having such power in the marketplace. /r/me_irl and its bad memes must be stopped if we are ever to see a rebound in the economy. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Externships lead to Internships </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It may be a little late in the year to be posting about internships, but I wanted to share some important advice I couldn't find when searching through the subreddit. 

If you still don't have an internship and are looking for one, try checking your career center for upcoming externships. Externships are like business field trips. You tour a company, learn about them, and see their employees in action. You get to hand out your resume while there and frequently get special consideration when it comes to any internship openings the company may have. I know this because its how I got my internship. I went on an externship to a local engineering company. They took notice of me and offered me an internship. 

Take advantage of externships. Going on one has lead to the biggest opportunity of my life.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Red Pill. I am an Engineering Student in his Jr. year. I've know about the red pill for a long time. I'll spare the bullshit story you've read a thousand times, and say I took it eventually. I'm ready to begin the journey.

Due to school, I have limited time. Its hard to date. So after reading here and thinking, I've decided that the years I have left in school are best dedicated to landing a job to begin my profession and becoming the Alpha I want to be instead of trying to balance carousel-ing college women and difficult classes. 

I started lifting at the school gym between classes last week. I have been eating healthy for several years before now, so I'm not an overweight guy. I'm well over 6 foot. I'm pretty average in build though. I feel like I have all the ingredients to be a mother fucking Alpha male. I just need to stick to the gym, my studies, and the red pill. 

I just fear avoiding all but the easiest women for this time will result in a bad lack of game altogether later however.

Any opinions? I know I will stick to the my degree and diet no matter what, its been years on both lol. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Whats the proudest you've ever been of a grade? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-23 03:46:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My proudest grade is the 100 I just got on my Statics midterm.

Statics probably isn't hard for a lot of you and I'll admit that it isn't once you understand it. At the beginning of the semester I didn't though. I was doing badly in the class. After changing my approach, Quitting my full time job,working through extra problems, and constantly being in my professors office when I was unclear on anything, I've turned a failing grade in late August into a C in October. If I continue on the projection I'm on I will finish with a B. The 100 I earned on my midterm today makes me feel like all the effort I've poured into this class over the past month was worth it. 

I've never worked harder to get a grade. My professor is among the toughest and most respected in the ME department at my Uni. The respect I've seen him develop for me as my grade rises makes me the proudest I've been in school so far. 

So whats your proudest grade? Whats "that" C or B that you had to really work your ass off for?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thanks to Kyle and PKA, I've been diagnosed with ADHD and my entire life has changed </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-20 03:22:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So Kyle talking about all of adderalls wonderful effects on pka got me wondering about how it treated adhd. That led to some reasearch on ADHD, and that reasearch led to me asking my psychiatrist if I may have it. She referred me to an ADHD specialist, and after about a month of testing I've been diagnosed with it. 

I take Ritalin instead of adderall (it's almost the same) and it has changed my life. I'm a much better student and do the things I need to do, even little things like washing clothes. I love it. 

I really just wanted to say thank you, because without PKA I likely would have went on undiagnosed and continued doing badly in college. Thank you so very much for getting me curious enough to get evaluated Kyle. I'm going to be a mechanical engineer and without this medicine I may have well failed. I'm not condoning use of these pills as study drugs or anything though, please see a doctor before you take any medication

	<TITLE> Sweet Delivery Justice </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-15 20:26:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I work at a local place, and we got a call for like a 13 dollar delivery to a road I'd never heard of in the middle of the dinner rush. It was a dirt road 7 miles away. Our range is 5 miles, so naturally I'm pissed. I've got to run a triple and this order will put me behind on everything. Boss says I'm clear to tell them we can't deliver to them again though. Potential justice inbound.

So I pull up to their single wide trailer off a dirt road (which was off of ANOTHER dirt road) and a very "unkept" looking couple came out, complained about the delivery fee (lol) and didn't tip me. It wasn't much, but being able to tell them we couldn't deliver to them again and watching them get angry/disappointed was one of the best feelings. The 7 mile drive back to the store was a very happy one.

Any sweet delivery justice from you guys? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-04-12 21:07:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been out of the aquarium hobby for about a year now, but before that I maintained a 20 gallon aquarium for 6 years. It went very well, and my mother maintains it these days. I've also kept several betta fish in 3 gallon or so aquariums. 

This will be the first time I'm approaching planted aquariums. My apartment doesn't allow a tank size larger than 10 gallons (bullshit, I know) so I'm looking ot make the nicest tank I can. I already have many of the things for the tank, left over from the years. Heater, filter, thermometer, chemicals, net, decorations, etc... are taken care of.

I've done a lot of lurking on the sub and read many articles on starting a planted tank. I am just having a hard time figuring out exactly what plants to use. My LFS doesn't have a ton of options, but the owner said that I came on the tail end on a shipment and a new one would be in soon.

Here are the plants my LFS currently has, and will continue to have:

Aquatic Clover

Anubis

Dwarf Sagittaria

Micro Sword

Amazon Sword

Cabomba

Italian Val

Dwarf Pennywort

Corkscrew Val

Dwarf Hair Grass

Java Moss

Java Fern

They can order things specially for me, but it will take time.

I've narrowed my fish decision down to three species:

Cobra Endlers

Dwarf Rasbora Boraras

Cardinal Tetras

What are you suggestions on plants for the 3 gallon Betta tank? What are your suggestions on plants for the 10 gallon? What are your fish suggestions? I'm open to any. I need people more knowledgeable on this topic than me for help. Thank you

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Remember everyone, always research what you read on here as "legal." Laws vary widely by state and country, and what is a laughing matter here could get you life in prison in the wrong area. I myself was guilty of giving legal advice only applicable to my area earlier today. I just don't want to read a post on here about someone getting arrested because they took legal advice off the sub that was not applicable to their area.

Thanks for reading, hopefully I'll keep a few ents from being arrested unnecessarily. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm sure we are all familiar with "Woody Wisdom." It comes on PKA all the time. The main thing that has always stuck out to me about Woody is his work ethic. I hear about it on his channel and PKA all the time. I can't remember what video or PKA this is from, but Woody had one quote that really stuck with me. He was talking about how to make yourself a better person. He said that we should do hard things, "Because no one ever impressed anyone by doing something easy". Bam. I don't know what it is about that phrase but I love it. You have to do something most people can't do. Thanks to Woody, I changed my major to Mechanical Engineering (What I wanted for a while but thought would be too hard) and work full time at a warehouse. I'm doing great in school, and have realized that this is what I want to do. I work a lot and have more money than most people I know my age. I'm happy. To throw in a little Hutch here too, I did esteem-able things. It really does build self esteem. But I have woody to thank for inspiring the work ethic in me. I never thought I could work this hard, but I just keep thinking: No one ever impressed anyone by doing something easy. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2013-11-01 17:32:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Clemson Tigers

Best: Clemson wins out, destroying Virginia, and Georgia Tech like they should, and beating South Carolina at the end of the season by double digits as the offense reawakens and plays to its potential. The offensive line grows a ball sack and the team doesn't give up on the season. Clemson goes 11-1 and goes to a BCS bowl to end the season, hopefully winning.

Worst: Clemson continues on the downward spiral it has been on and plays a close game against Virginia, narrowly avoiding the upset. Clemson loses to Georgia Tech at home before going to South Carolina and getting absolutely embarrassed in a 30+ point blow out. I drink enough to nearly induce Alcohol poisoning. Clemson goes 9-3, finishing in the gator bowl where we pray for a win of some sort.

Realistic: Clemson rebounds and blows out Virginia. They struggle with Georgia Tech for awhile, but pull away in the end and win by double digits. Going into South Carolina, Clemson's offensive line cannot handle the South Carolina defensive line and Tajh Boyd gets rattled. Clemson loses by double digits and the Gamecocks make it 5 in a row. Dabo's seat starts getting hot as we go 10-2 and go to the Chick-fil-a bowl. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, Kyle was right. It is a great movie if you like movies with the gangster feel to them. It has a good romance plot in it, if you like that sort of thing, and there is very realistic action. This movie shows how real bank robbers would operate, and I think you guys should check it out if you have some free time!

Oh and I am just fine with Ben Afflack playing Batman now. He is a very gritty character in The Town. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A Clemson fans honest opinion on the Florida State game </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-10-14 00:52:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm worried. Why? Because I feel like the Las Vegas line is correct. I think we are going to lose next weekend. Clemson is a great team. But some inconsistencies I have noticed are going to cost us if we don't fix them.

**Defense**: This is the side I'm actually not that worried about. They have played great, and do better every week. Our safeties are looking bad though. They bite hard on the play action, and are not the best at coverage period. Our front seven brings great pressure, and stuffs the run pretty well. Our cornerbacks are shaky, but they are much improved from last year. I think FSU will score less points than they think, and I think our defense is very underrated this year.

**Offense:** Now this is where I am worried. Everyone thinks our offense is our strong point. It can be. But this year, we have a glaring weakness. Tajh Boyd is an excellent QB, and a Heisman contender for a reason. Skill positions are remarkable, every one of our wide receivers is a weapon. Roderick McDowell and Zack Brooks are great running backs. Our weakness? The offensive line. I've hoped they would improve all year. But they are regressing. They do not play physical. Our run game is suffering because they cannot get a push. Our pass game is suffering because they cannot pick up even basic blitzes. They looked TERRIBLE against both Boston College and Syracuse. Florida State is going to blitz us all day, and I'm worried Tajh Boyd will become very rattled because of our Offensive Lines inability to stop them. The inability of our Offensive line to push the defense has cost us in the red zone, and it will continue to cost us.

**The Competition:** I do not know enough about Florida state to really judge them. They have played inferior competition in every game I've seen. I don't know how Famous Jameis will respond to an extremely hostile environment. I don't know how good they really are. My gut tells me that they are great though. Their defense will exploit our lack of protection if we can't improve against the blitz, that is for sure. If Boston College and Syracuse can do it, Florida State surely can.

**My Verdict:** Clemson can win this game. I do not doubt it. But in order for it to happen, the Offensive line play will have to improve dramatically. I feel confident in every other area of our game. But the Offensive line is the single most important position group on the field. And if they don't have a great week of practice, and get physical, it is going to be a long game.

Opinions? (Change this drunk guys view. PLS) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its simple really. Stop with the "constructive criticism" especially when it comes to woody's channel. I don't recall ever being asked to give criticism. This sub is for us to laugh at funny PKA memes or gifs or jokes. Its to discuss PKA. It is not to circle jerk everything that is wrong with PKA/Woody's Channel/Wings. So please just chill out. I know I liked things better when the hosts liked the sub, said good things about it, and when woody commented on things. So lets focus on being a funny laid back subreddit again, and move away from being Fucknards in the bad sense of the word. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously, PKA is one of the best things to help get over stuff with. It's nice to listen to Woody, Kyle, Wings, and Lefty shoot the shit. It keeps my mind off things and keeps me happy.
I guess in the words of wings "Don't put the Pussy on a pedestal"  </TEXT>
