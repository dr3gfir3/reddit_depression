	<TEXT> That's a good insight. I wondered the same thing. I've thought myself that (like most real people who experience NDE or OBEs) that this is place is another Astral plane or dimension that parellels the one she exists in already. I've read a lot of books on OBEs and most always they mention Astral Projection. So traveling around Saturn is completely possible in an Astral projection experience. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow what an interesting theory. Hope its intentional, if not - the post production team is embarrassed as hell.

	<TEXT> I see your points, but I think Buck is Rachel because :
1)She is a singer (like Rachel)
2) She/he sees an accident on the side of the road before meeting at the house the last time. There was a red backpack and road flares. Rachel also mentions a similar car accident for her NDE a few episodes earlier with a red backpack.  </TEXT>
