	<TEXT> The main thing I was trying to address here is the old interface; I wasn't here for the start of eoc, but I've seen in videos that this is what the interface looked like, and to be honest I quite like it.
 However after doing the void stares back I don't see why anyone would ever do conquest. It's a pain in the arse and is barely even rewarding </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you say you're fit, you're fit for one particular activity, and, in no offence, probably isn't running, and that's probably why you hit around 90% HR. however if you're doing 90% then you're working anaerobically, so what I suggest, is to train running.
 Source: currently studying a level pe, the definition of fit is to meet the demands of the environment without  undue fatigue.


EDIT; made some grammatical changes </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spoiler if you haven't done the world wakes

Correct me if I'm wrong, but in one of the rooms during the world wakes; might be the first; there's a sword which is said to be a guthixian godsword; so perhaps we could get one, but I don't think so considering guthix is dead

Edit: I'm dumb never mind </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay I'd just like to clarify, I have used avast for years now, there's never been anything wrong with it, so I see no reason to switch, however we do use norton antivirus as well. I've been playing runescape on client for quite a while now, and this Trojan warning only popped up yesterday, now I don't know why it happened, but I reinstalled the client completely, uninstalled it from the system, reinstalled it from website. Now it still doesn't work, so my conclusion is now to play on the browser, but I'm going to see if I can fix the problem, and allow the antivirus to let it run.
 TL;DR got two antivirus', avast only recognised it, reinstalled the game, still happened, going to block it on avast </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is how I done it; I started from 0.
Step 1; kill cows, chickens(bones), mining, woodcutting upto 150k or so, enough to buy full rune

Step 2; kill cockroach soldiers upto 1m or so

Step 3; buy clean harralander and some vials of water, before you ask, this is possible as herblore can be train to level 5. This technique can sometimes double or triple your money, I did this upto my first bond </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to do something similar when training at waterfiends, I'd make the runescape layout old school, and I'd make the screen so that runescape would just fit, and I can then fit the video in, it'd usually be a small picture, but I'd put up with it :3 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Funnily enough I was playing on a desktop with a monitor just slightly larger than my laptop screen, I don't know the actual resolution for my laptop screen but its around 1824x724 or something, and the desktop about 100 pixels wider, besides that, I play full screen like that on either desktop or laptop and the games runs how it should.

EDIT: I changed the resolution from 724x1824 to the correct; 1824x724. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm in dire need of help. I have completed borderlands 2 about 17/18 times now, and the game is starting to become a stretch... I want to play as the mechromancer now, and if anyone knows any speed run tactics please tell me.
 I know there is the speed run archive website but the links only link to twitch accounts which don't have the video uploaded. 
 
Currently I have got:
72+op8 Zer0
72+op5 Maya
56 Axton
50 Gaige
I have numerous under levelled characters but I'd like to restart my Gaige from level 1

I know all legendary drops so if you advise legendaries, I can farm for them. I also have all DLC except the creature slaughter dome. </TEXT>
