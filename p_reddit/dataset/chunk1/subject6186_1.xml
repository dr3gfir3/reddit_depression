	<TITLE> I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life, and I was role playing as Hitler the entire time. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> (No racism or anti-Semitic behavior involved.) 

I just had one of the best gaming experiences of my life on a Garry's Mod server.

A little information to explain:  On Garry's mod, there are a number of servers under the label of DarkRP.  RP servers are kind of infamous on Gmod.  Players can set up little businesses, be involved with the police or crime, or even become mayor of the entire town.  The server I was playing on was a WW2 Occupation themed server, and I just so happened to land the role of The Fuhrer, in charge of the entire Reich army.

How I got this position was merely luck.  Players have the opportunity to vote for positions they'd like to hold.  Each player can vote yes or no on that request.  It gets kind of cluster fucked at times, because people will get demoted for legal and illegal actions in the game.  The basic rule is that Nazis can't fire on Resistance without cause.  If they find a resistance member suspicious, they can search said member and then jail him.  The system is a bit flawed and easily abused, but it works in a weird way.  

So anyway, I nail the role of Hitler, and thankfully I'm already inside the Reichstag. (The Nazi's Base) I start to discuss what we could do as Hitler with the guy who would become my SS Officer.  I decided that I wanted to give a speech and give the resistance a little event to pop a shot at me. 

I have the SS Officer set things up, and I update the agenda with details on my speech.  I also type out a little advert for everyone in the server, giving the resistance the word.  Eventually, the speech was ready to give, and about  15-20 players (There are 50+ in the server at times) followed me out to the courtyard steps as I prepped my speech.

I opened up youtube in steam and mic spammed one of Hitler's speeches, and all the players who were playing German troops started taking pictures of me with the camera tool.  In terms of RP events, it felt pretty legit.

I didn't hear the shot, but soon everyone began to panic.  My SS Officer and Kommandant escorted me from the podium, running back into the Reichstag through the garage.  From the garage, I ordered for my troops to look for the assassin and I initialized a lockdown.  A lockdown is a state of gameplay where the streets are supposed to be cleared by civilians and resistance.  German troops basically institute a curfew and either arrest or shoot violators on sight.
This is where the real meat of the session began.  I began to give more and more orders from my office, establishing a relatively stable rule for the Reich.  This kind of pissed off the Resistance and Citizens outside.  The tone of the server seems very anarchic at times, so with the Reich having order it seemed to really swing things around.  Thing is, a lot of kids come on the server as well.  You know the type, young 12-15 year olds shooting people at random and calling them faggots or whatever.  Thankfully, my SS Officer and Kommandant kept them in line.  I had a lot of requests and meetings as my short time as Fuhrer.  Some were to report suspicious activity, others were just requests for orders.  I eventually began to get overwhelmed and told them to report to the SS or Kommandant for orders.

I didn't stay Hitler however...

At one point, the server crashed.  This meant everyone had to reset their roles.  I lost my role as Fuhrer temporarily, but the person who took it was rather entertaining.  He went by Krieger, and he was a German-Speaking player ONLY.  That's right, we had a Fuhrer that could not speak a word of English in charge of the entire Reich on a ENGLISH server.  The SS Officer and I found this quite hilarious, and tried a number of ways to communicate with our new leader.  We started posting adverts and requests for other German speakers who could translate, but eventually decided that it was too difficult.  The Fuhrer left the Reichstag and started to walk about.  The SS Officer and me began asking random people on the streets if they could kill The Fuhrer.  Most thought we were trying to bait them, but when we explained the situation it led to laughter.

Eventually he was killed and I was placed back in power.  I continued my business as usual.  I tried to be as fair as possible, (I issued lotteries, asked for my troops to request warrants before entering buildings, etc.) but things began to push against me.  I got snippets of information from my Gestapo agent of gathering forces at a bar down the street.  I sent my troops to investigate, and it eventually led to a series of skirmishes in the streets.  A number of battles occurred in the slums and at the bar across the street.

There was one famous skirmish inside a warehouse.  My SS Officer alerted me that the resistance had holed up inside the building, popping shots off at patrolling Nazis.  I gave him permission to assault the warehouse.  During that time, I met a guy RPing as a doctor.  He healed me during a assassination attempt, so I paid him well and kept him close.  He also acted as a spy for me, reporting from the battlefield of the opposition.  I began to trust him, allowing him inside meetings with the High Command.

The leader of this opposition, as far as I knew, was a man by the name of, "The Bastard" (Not his actual name but close.  I don't wanna give anyone unwanted attention.)

The Bastard used shady and rule-breaking tactics to try and get at me.   Unfortunately, it was effective and he managed to gather a number of followers.  There's a "New Life Rule" that everyone is supposed to follow, and he broke it a number of times.  I recall a time where he was imprisoned and one of my guards, against my orders, executed him.  He spawned back in jail, and in good faith I had him released.  He was still in the Reichstag when this happened, and drew his gun the moment he was able.  This led to him being gunned down by 6 of my men, again...

After a while, The Bastard began to get closer and closer towards the Reichstag.  I got reports of opposition right outside The Reichstag as well as rumors of a distraction attack to lure troops away.  Bastard's final push got the best of me though.  I had mistakenly allowed a man, who I foolishly assumed was another Gestapo agent, to breach my inner circle.  He let the resistance in, and I holed myself up in my office with a small group of troops, my doctor, and a personal friend whom I had made on the server.  We three hid in the corner as my troops fought with the overwhelming opposition, but they eventually broke through and killed us all.

So ended my rule as Hitler.  I may go back to owning a Soviet Spy base disguised as a bar.

---tl'dr Played as Hitler in a WW2 RP mod, ran things as a legit leader.  Gave speeches, issued orders and initiated lockdowns.  Eventually killed by resistance.  One of the best gaming times of my life.---


QUICK NOTE:

To those asking for the Server name or IP address, I'd rather not give it out.  I don't have any permission by the admins to plug the server, and I'd rather not give them a reason to handle a wave of people joining all at once.  It might mess with whatever jive they got going.  If you really want to know, just go looking for it on the GMod server listing.  Sorry! ^^

	<TITLE> GTA V focusing on the duo dynamic of Breaking Bad? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-29 04:47:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We've noticed how two prominent main characters have been featured in the media released for GTA V.  There's been the older, grey haired guy, who seems to be already well off in his criminal enterprise that he can afford to spend time with his family(Hopefully).

And then we have the Latin/Black character we have seen running from the cops, driving fancy cars, etc.  He seems like an upstart in the criminal world.  Possibly lowest denominator: Pusher, stick up man, thief, etc.  

Could GTA V be creating a due eerily similar of the one in Breaking Bad?

It would be hard to say Breaking Bad hasn't made an impact on modern crime drama.  The emmys behind it tell true of the popularity and success the franchise has garnered.  It might be safe to assume that Rockstar is taking a heavy influence from this success, using this dynamic to a advantage, familiarity from modern crime fans.  

I don't want to sat GTA V will be a rip off of Breaking Bad, but it seems possible the influence is there.  How would you guys feel about that? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> -Rules-

1. Song can't be a song written about Slenderman.  I'm mainly looking for songs that have the same atmospheric mood or feel to the monster.

2. Try to keep it 1 song per post.

3. Describe why you think the song fits.

Here's Mine:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RaXa9V0nLBE

For some reason now, whenever I hear this song I think Slenderman.  I think its mostly because of the use of static and creepy sounds.  It feels very Slender like.  Plus, a lot of the lyrics, while not about Slendy, have a creepy connection with him:

Like it was a friend.
It is watching us,

And the sky is filled with light
Can you see it?
All the black is really white
If you believe it

Anyway, there's my example.  I'm excited to see everyone's songs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure, it had it's flaws and stuff, and both games had God Awful endings, but I really enjoyed both games, especially when playing split-screen co-op.

I feel like this game series gets a lot of flak because the Jeff Gerstmann incident, and it sucks that IO Interactive gets blamed for the firing when even Jeff himself says they weren't the ones to blame.  Hell, even Jeff kinda like K L 2.  

I find it rare that games let you play as a genuine bad guy.  Sure, GTA IV lets you play the bad guy, but most of the time the main character in GTA games has a moral compass and will act good when the player acts bad. "Sorry!"

Its interesting to play a pair of despicable characters.  Characters that have nearly NO redeeming qualities to them.  Plus I loved K L 2's visual style. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Most would immediately jump to Stannis and Dany for obvious reasons, but recently I've found, thanks to people on Reddit, two more possible contenders.

"When the red star bleeds and the darkness gathers, Azor Ahai shall be born again amidst smoke and salt to wake dragons out of stone."

Now, one user on GoT reddit mentioned that the banner of the man the giant killed at the end of DWD was a red star.  Jon would be surrounded by salt when he is stabbed by the tears shed by the other brothers.  The wound that Jon wretches the dagger from is also "smoking' from Jon's description.  

The other contender would be Victarion.  Now, when Victarion receives his wound to a hand a red priest fixes it.  Victarion is described by having a smoking hand, and being that he is a Greyjoy it would be easy to assume the 'salt' is in reference to the sea.  The Red Star bleeding could be a reference to his wound or some past kill, I'm not sure on that end.

What do you guys think? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In case some of you didn't know, the people behind Game of Thrones shot two first episodes.  1 was a pitch episode (Pilot) and the other was a reshoot that fit in canon/casting with the rest of the series.  They mention the pilot a few times in the audio commentary, including the fact that some footage from the pilot is actually in the reshoot.  That's why some character's hair doesn't match.  One of the big changes apparently was a casting change of Cat Stark.

I personally wouldn't mind seeing the original Cat, puls other changes they may or may not have made.  Would you guys wanna see it? </TEXT>

Problem is, about 1/4 of the steam mods crash my game on start up.  Specifically when I press New Game.  The game will either freeze and just have the skyrim symbol floating around in the background with no options to select, or it will load the game and freeze on, "Bethesda Software Presents."

	<TITLE> Hey Reddit!  Lets fix the History Channel with some awesome show ideas. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-22 07:50:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so we all know History Channel sucks balls now.  But I think there are PLENTY of ideas for History Channel shows that could be successful.  I understand that they are trying to push their reality TV programming, so a lot of those ideas will have that in mind.  Thats what this thread is about  

LETS FIX HISTORY CHANNEL

The ideas start here:


	I like the idea of Full Metal Jousting, but the whole tough guy element behind it is so incredibly stupid.  I think audiences would like it more if the people in the jousts were actually roleplaying as people from history.  That way, each jouster could get a small blurp about what impact they had during the medieval time period.  You could also set up betting and host the whole thing in Las Vegas, make a spectacle out of it.  The betters could even roleplay as kings, dukes and queens.


	Speaking of roleplay and reality TV, there could be an entire show about the decisions of powerful leaders.  You take a contestant and give him a job as a famous real life King, General, Religious Leader, anything  And you give the contestant problems that the actual figures really faced.  These may be comical every man kind of people, some people who dont know anything about history, or intelligent people involved in the community.  The point of the exercise would be to show how some of the most powerful people in history may not have been suitable for the job, or it could show how history could have possibly changed for better or worse depending on the decisions made by the contestants.


	Castle Life: Reality TV show based around the idea of following around people who are roleplaying as people living in medieval times.  Blacksmiths, ladies, bards, kings, lords, etc...  Each contestant would be proficient in their specified field, like a modern blacksmith or steel worker would be given a job as an old time black smith.  Or a modern politician would be given a job as a lord.  The twist would be in seeing how those modern influences would affect the old timey limitations.  The blacksmith wouldnt have his modern technology; the Lord would have more power, etc etc.


	Music show: Basically, the idea behind this one is that you take a modern band/artist in music, say Lady Gaga.  You tell Lady Gaga that she has to draw from a hat.  The hat contains musical genres and music types from the past.  They could vary from the tribal beats of Native America to 1950s rock and roll.  They would then have to write, produce and eventually perform a song meant for that period.  The catch would be that they can only use the equipment, technology and tropes from that era.  Lady Gaga couldnt write about Judas if she drew Native American song, seeing how Natives werent exposed to Christianity until the Europeans came over.


	Trials from History: Participants would reenact famous trials from history.  Salem Witch Trials, murder trials, etc.  We replace either lawyers, jury or judges with real people to see what their take on the event would be.  They could take the OJ trial and redo it, see if they could convict him with a different prosecution.  While this is happening, the audience can learn about the actual trial and see how it would have played differently due to minor changes.

Those are just a few.  Let me know what you think Reddit.

Also, what would Bioware/EA have to do to make you change your stance on the boycott? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A friend and I were talking about this, and he believes the soviet's went too far.  I also believe this, but I also thought in the back of my mind that it was somewhat expected and in a strange way, justifiable for the atrocities Germany committed.

But then we started talking about whether or not the German people could be held responsible for the actions of their government.  On one hand, you could argue that the German people let it happen.  On the other, you could say that they were too afraid to act. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since GTA V was announced a while back, I have been scouring the internet for any and all information regarding the game.  Since no one knows anything about the game save what we can speculate from the trailer, most of what I found was bullshit.  Then I stumbled upon a video by The Escapists Jim Sterling. (Link: http://www.destructoid.com/the-jimquisition-will-grand-theft-auto-v-have-no-balls--215360.phtml ) The video was mainly about how GTA IV and Saints Rows tones needed to be separate so they can be enjoyed by both fans of the realistic and balls-out crazy.  A notion I agree with.  But as Jim continued, I couldnt help but wince at how he viewed the main character Niko Bellic as a, Noble immigrant trying to do the right thing. Ok  Am I the only one who thinks Niko is the most despicable, psychotic and contradicting protagonist in the entire GTA series?

Let me explain.  GTA IVs story was very well told, an interweaving plot that separated into 3 titles within the universe that created this vast, interesting setting with deep characters.  Niko is probably one of the deepest, but I keep reading about how fans think of him as the most likeable protagonist.  Really?  This guy is their hero?  Hell, Cole Phelps was a dork of a character, but at least he had some moral fortitude.  Niko doesn't have that.  He and the people who like him may say he does, but I seriously doubt it.  Let's put this into perspective.

What do we know about GTAs main characters?  Most have a criminal past, a conflict that drives them forward.  You look at Claude for example.  He was a stick up man and was in love with a psychotic woman by the name of Catalina.  Tommy was in prison before the events of Vice City.  CJ was doing petty stick ups and car jackings in Liberty City.  What was Niko doing?  Human trafficking.  Maybe I am alone here, but human trafficking is one of the most deplorable acts a human being can commit.  Its up there with rape because you are embedding in eventual rape.  Niko was also part of the Yugoslav wars.  A war where there was no real good guy.  Both sides of that war partook in Ethnic Cleansing and a little something called, Rape Camps. He was also on the Serbian side, the side that takes most the blame in that war.  And no offense to Serbians, but a lot seem to have this mentality that they were doing heroic deeds during that war.  Right...  I hope you as a reader have enough knowledge of Wikipedia to search what I'm talking about.

But so what?  I mean, everyone has a past right?  Why should I judge Niko as a character about his past, GTA IV is about the present!  Well, not really.  As I played GTA IV I began to see Nikos heritage and past start to creep out from behind the veil of his character.  What do we know about Niko?  Well, he is very critical of Liberty City.  We see his distaste for everything American as soon as he steps off the boat.  In a way, he sees Liberty Citys denizens as terrible people.  Trash even.  I was always confused when I took Niko on a rampage, because the way Rockstar has written him, his noble attitude wouldnt allow him to gun down civilians in the street.  But we can  The direct actions of the player can contradict the story and characters written for us, which I think is one of the most terrible things someone can do in video game story telling.  But I began to look at it on a deeper level.  I began to think back on Nikos past and how he views America and its people.  It all became sensible when I began to see Niko as just Ethnic Cleansing.  By God, Rockstar hasnt created a noble immigrant, theyve created a monster.

But what about all these friends Niko surrounds himself with?  Roman, Little Jacob, and Packie can't all abide by Niko's way.  Someone has to speak up.  Actually, someone does.  Frequently.  Most of Roman's dialogue is trying to convince his cousin to stop what he's doing.  He pleads with his cousin, in this nervously-joking manner, that he can stop his crime-fueled lifestyle and live a life or normalcy.  Niko doesn't listen, but it does paint a sort of picture about where Niko's loyalties lie.  They lie with the American dollar and revenge.  If you think about each character from the past GTAs, none of them tried to hold a protagonist back.  CJ's family was fine with the way Carl was, all they wanted to do was take back the Grove.  Tommy's lawyer Ken Rosenberg was similar to Roman in his nervous attitude, but he was mainly scared of the actions of people against him rather than Tommy.  Claude had no connections at the start of the game, so his path was a blank slate to leave open for the player.  When you see Roman and Niko together, you get a sense that Roman is only sticking by him because he's family.  The moment Niko yelled at Roman for the condition of the shitty apartment they had to flee to after Niko had gotten Roman's apartment and business burnt down, I lost all respect for him as a character.

I don't think this was Rockstar's intent at all, but there's this layer of subtext that I can't help but feeling was placed there intentionally.  Niko Bellic has all these traits, and we're supposed to not question them?  By the end of the game, Niko is a wrecked shell of a human being.  Nothing makes sense for him anymore once Roman/Kate dies, so he seems to wander the city, killing what people he can.  Sure you can bring friends on the normal outing routines, but they never bring up those who were lost.  It's like they know if they go down that road they may push Niko off the deep end.  Maybe I'm looking too much into this, but honestly there's a reason why I left GTA IV depressed and left the other games with a sense of wicked pride.  Niko's actions and yours led to the ultimate downfall of his sanity to a point where there's nothing in his life for him anymore.

tl'dr Niko Bellic is a terrible person, and you should feel bad for liking him.

Here are my questions:

1. How did you first get involved with Hitman?
2. Were you contacted at all on the Hitman movie?
3. Without getting into trouble, can you talk about the Absolution game and why you aren't in it?
4. What were working conditions like with IO?
5. Have you played the Hitman games yourself?
6. What is your favorite moment from a Hitman game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ya know, when I see footage of mothers dressing up their children in "God hates Fags" clothing, and holding up signs, it all seems very close to emotional child abuse.  I know very little of law, but one could probably argue in court that displaying children in this negative fashion would constitute as emotional child abuse.  I could see this being used as a weapon to try and quell some of these parents that think they are infallible, as well as removing children of this hate-spewing environment.

I could see the inherit wrongness of removing said child from parents though.  A child without parental guidance must be a scary thing, but perhaps it could do some good.  I'm sure it would shake up the congregation of the church.  Many probably wouldn't be so willing to go out and protest with the possibility of their children being taken away.

	<DATE> 2011-11-17 05:04:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I hated the Imperials.  I had never played a Elder Scrolls game before this one, so my character was as fond of the imperials as they were presented.  I knew nothing of the lands, people and factions of Skyrim, and I didn't care.  These Romanesque men were about to kill me for something that was obviously no fault of my own.  Damn the Imperials and damn the Empire, I thought, leaving that horrid cave with blade and Ralof in tow.

One of my first thoughts after being freed from my bonds was to teach these vile dictators a lesson.  The Stormcloaks seemed to be the ones doing the teaching, so I made my way to Windhelm.  I was eager to pick up my blade for the good fight, teach those empowering men how the sharp steel of the Nord's feels.  When I arrived at the city, I was greeted with a aspect of real life I did not expect.  Bitter racism towards the Dark Elves.  I looked on in disbelief as the people of Windhelm threatened a poor Eleven girl with violence and rape.  This must be the times, I thought.  Tensions are high, Nords are looking for someone to blame.  I figured the Jarl I had grown to admire would not be so distasteful...

I was wrong of course.  Bringing Skyrim back to the Nords meant freeing it from these immigrants.  I reluctantly chose to join their army regardless, my eagerness within dialogue choices making me somewhat wary.  My character was given two choices.  A resounding 'Hell yeah!' and a 'No.'  I had never known a Bethesda game to be so narrow within choice, giving me such a black and white answer to a matter that was entirely grey.  When I joined, I was given my first few set of missions.  One was to bring a Axe to the Jarl of Whiterun, a good friend whom I protected from a dragon.  I respected the man, a man who teetered between sides, but obviously thought of his people first.

When I arrived, I presented the axe to Balgruuf, hoping to see him to come to a conclusion that favored the Stormcloaks.  He rejected the offering, an act which I knew would lead Ulfric to war.  I fretted this, trying desperately to look for a dialogue option to try to sway the Jarl to Ulfric's side.  There was none.

As I made my way back, I thought of all the options my character would have to stop this push for Whiterun, how my character would make him see through reason.  If my persuade check failed, damn it all I would reload a save.  Roleplay be damned.  When I arrived at Ulfric's side, I was shocked to find no such dialogue option available.  My new soldier of the Stormcloak army followed Ulfric blindly, eager to take Whiterun as much as I.

The battle was ferocious, my character slaying man after man of the Whiterun guard, men pleading with their lives, men who cheered me on when I absorbed the soul of a dragon, who eagerly egged me on to hear the shout of the Dragonborn.  I had betrayed them...  As the city fell, Balgruff surrendered and gave his position away.  He was banished from his kingdom, but not before he gave me a look of complete anger and disgust, offering, "This is not over..." I shuddered at his words, feeling guilty at what actions I had taken.

During the next few campaigns I began to embrace the warrior's life with more vigil.  Ralof was with me, and we fought in many battles together.  We both had stories to tell, and Ralof even admitted the idea of coming to a truce with the Imperials.  This surprised me.  Ralof, a man of honor who was so willing to die for Ulfric the moment he met him was having doubts.  My character had nothing to say in the matter, a blind soldier sympathetic to the cause.

Skyrim is many things.  A game in which you battle Dragons, Giants and Bandits.  It has a simple idea behind it, and it by no means is original.  Yet, no other game has stirred the morality of a soldier's life within me before.  All those Call of Duty games or Brothers in Arms titles never made me feel this.  This moral thought within my mind: Is what I'm doing for the greater good?  I betrayed a friend, killed countless men and even brought a peaceful city to its knees.  What was I doing?  It was my full intention to play my Nord character as a good man.

Later, I was imprisoned within Markarth on a mission to bribe a Squire to sympathize with our cause.  I eventually broke out with the help of the Forsworn.  I had to commit a murder of a innocent man to do it, his cries filling the mines as I brought a shiv down into his flesh.  But by then, murder was the least of my troubles.  Despite this, on my way out, I learned that the Forsworn were the true natives of Skyrim and that the Nords just moved in and took the land.  Ulfric Stormcloak was one of these men...

By Talos, what have I done...
