Out of curiosity, I'd love to read on that topic, where did you find a study stating that an oppressive justice system causes generational deficits in communities, which in turn create higher rates of violent crime? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's worth reading the article and the background but if you couldn't be bothered then the reason he isn't being extradited is because there's a chance he'd end up in ADX Florence the supermax prison where there is 24 hour solitary confinement. In the words of the judge:

"I am satisfied," Donnelly said, "that prolonged exposure to involuntary solitary confinement exacts a significant physiological toll, is damaging to the integrity of the mind and personality, and is damaging to the bodily integrity of the person."

[You can keep him, please.](https://np.reddit.com/r/europe/comments/3gffnq/irish_high_court_refuses_to_extradite_suspect_to/ctxng7o)

	<DATE> 2014-11-16 23:07:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The error I get is: Type mismatch: cannot convert from int to String. The problem is on line 22 where i try to concatenate 2 strings. Like i said I'm beginner (2 days Java experience) so it's probably a simple fix that i just can't figure out. 

The comments in the link explain what the program should do.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok this is one of my first programs and as you probably guessed I'm having trouble. What the program is supposed to do is read in a word and a letter, it then finds the first instance of the letter in the word and prints out the position of letter in said word.

    use std::io;

    fn main()
    {
     let mut reader = io::stdin();

     print!("Enter a word: ");
     let word = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");
 	
     print!("Enter a letter to find: ");
     let letter = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");
 
     println!("");

     for (ii,xx) in word.as_slice().chars().enumerate() {
      if xx == letter {
       println!("First occurance of {} is at position {}", letter, ii);
       break;
      }
     } 
    }	

The problem i get is with the "if xx == letter..." 

    error: mismatched types: expected `char` but found `collections::string::String` (expected struct collections::string::String but found char)

After doing alot of reading in various places I've come to the conclusion that 

    let letter = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");

gives me a string and going by the (somewhat confusing) error I need to somehow convert it to a char for the comparison above? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ~~Adolf Hitler~~ EA (German: [EA] ( listen); 20 April 1889  Present) was an Austrian-born German politician and the leader of the Nazi Party (German: Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP); National Socialist German Workers Party). He was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and dictator of Nazi Germany (as Fhrer und Reichskanzler) from 1934 to 1945. EA was at the centre of Nazi Germany, World War II in Europe, and the Holocaust.

EA was a decorated veteran of World War I. He joined the German Workers' Party (precursor of the NSDAP) in 1919, and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921. In 1923, he attempted a coup d'tat in Munich, known as the Beer Hall Putsch. The failed coup resulted in EA 's imprisonment, during which time he wrote his memoir, Mein Kampf (My Struggle). After his release in 1924, EA gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan-Germanism, antisemitism, and anti-communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda. After his appointment as chancellor in 1933, he transformed the Weimar Republic into the Third Reich, a single-party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of Nazism.

EA 's aim was to establish a New Order of absolute Nazi German hegemony in continental Europe. To this end, his foreign and domestic policies had the aim of seizing Lebensraum ("living space") for the Germanic people. He directed the rearmament of Germany and the invasion of Poland by the Wehrmacht in September 1939, resulting in the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Under EA 's rule, in 1941 German forces and their European allies occupied most of Europe and North Africa. In June 1941, EA ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union. Although initially successful, the Russian campaign turned disastrous. By 1943, Germany was forced onto the defensive and suffered a series of escalating defeats. In the final days of the war, during the Battle of Berlin in 1945, EA married his long-time partner, Eva Braun. On 30 April 1945, less than two days later, the two committed suicide to avoid capture by the Red Army, and their corpses were burned.

EA 's aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe. Under EA 's leadership and racially motivated ideology, the regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5.5 million Jews, and millions of other people whom he and his followers deemed racially inferior. </TEXT>
