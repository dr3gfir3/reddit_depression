	<TEXT>  Uh, so your point is that, in context, this is less worrying? I would say the exact opposite. A person from the main opposition party, with no link to the coup, was executed. That's as bad as it gets.

Uh , so you havent even read the article  what do you think " it is not immidealtly clear" means ?

 " An unknown assailant shot the deputy mayor of Istanbul's Sisli district in the head on Monday and he was in a critical condition, Turkish broadcaster NTV reported.

It was not immediately clear whether the incident was linked to Friday's abortive military coup in which more than 200 people were killed. Turkey remains in a state of high tension, though the government says it has the situation fully under control.

NTV reported that the assailant had entered the office of deputy mayor Cemil Candas and then gun shots were heard. Turkey's main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) runs the prosperous Sisli district. Along with other opposition parties the CHP has condemned the attempted coup "

	<TEXT> According to Mujtahid, Turkish intelligence agencies have received information about some negative collaboration between bin Salman and bin Zayed, but the Saudis have managed to convince the Justice and Development party to rest assured and be optimistic about Riyadh's measures.

He revealed that bin Salman has been trying to convince the Turks to conceal the UAE's role in the coup and has promised a large amount of cash in reprisal.

An attempted Turkish military coup appeared to crumble on Saturday after crowds answered President Erdogan's call to take to the streets to support him and dozens of rebel soldiers abandoned their tanks in the main city of Istanbul.

In relevant remarks on Sunday Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif voiced regret that certain countries, including Saudi Arabia and Qatar, were somehow interested in the victory of coup plotters against the legal government of President Erdogan in Turkey.



"Our foreign minister told a closed session of the parliament today that certain states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar didnt dislike the strengthening of the coup in Turkey, an issue which requires further contemplation," member of the parliament's Presiding Board Akbar Ranjbarzadeh quoted Zarif as saying on Sunday.

Meantime, another MP Gholamreza Jafarzadeh quoted Zarif as saying, "Given the Saudis' stance on issues in Turkey, we conclude that Saudi Arabia has likely been involved in this coup."

	<TEXT> So all these countries  authorities which condemmed the coup are in on it being staged? I dont think so somehow.

Britain The foreign secretary, Boris Johnson, said he had spoken to his Turkish counterpart, Mevlut Cavusoglu, to underline support for Turkeys democratic elected government and institutions in the wake of the overnight coup attempt.

The Foreign Office is advising Britons in Turkey to stay indoors, avoid public places  especially demonstrations  and remain vigilant.

It says: The situation now appears quieter in Istanbul, and the bridges across the Bosphorus are reopening. But there are reports of tank fire and small arms fire in Ankara.

British Airways says it is canceling all flights to and from Turkey on Saturday, but easyJet says it plans to runs its scheduled flights, largely to Turkish resort towns. The budget airline says the schedule will be kept under continuous review.

Natos chief says all alliance personnel and military units in Turkey are safe and secure following the attempted coup.

Nato secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, said in a Twitter post that he had spoken to Natos supreme commander, US Army Gen Curtis M Scapparrotti, who confirms that all Nato personnel and units in Turkey are safe and secure.
The alliance chief also tweeted that he welcomed the strong support shown by the people and all political parties to democracy and to the democratically elected government of Turkey.

Spains acting foreign minister, Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, condemned the attempted coup, telling Spanish national television that his government completely supports the Turkish government headed by President Erdogan.
He said: Without a doubt we support respecting the constitution and democratically elected institutions, and we condemn all coups without reservation.

Garcia Margallo spoke by telephone from Mongolia, where he is attending the ASEM Asia-Europe Meeting.
Syrian opposition The exiled Syrian opposition congratulated the Turkish people for halting the attempted military coup.

The Turkey-based Syrian National Coalition said Turkey has protected its democratic institutions in the face of dark and desperate attempts that sought to take control of the popular will.
It says the Turkish people value democracy and will not let a group of putschists take it away in a desperate attempt to restore military rule.

Turkey has been one of the main backers of the uprising against the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, and is hosting 2.7 million Syrian refugees.

In the early hours of the attempted coup, celebratory gunfire broke out across Damascus. The government and its supporters view the rebels as terrorists and consider Turkey to be one of their chief sponsors.

Hamas The Islamic militant group Hamas has congratulated Erdogan for quashing a vicious plot to overthrow him.
The Turkish leader has been a staunch supporter of Hamas and a fierce critic of Israel. Hamas says it remembers Turkeys wise leadership in supporting the Palestinian people and their cause and working to lift the blockade on Gaza, the coastal territory ruled by the group.

Hamas supporters took to the streets in several places across the Gaza Strip to celebrate the failure of the coup, raising Turkish flags and posters bearing Erdogans image.

Turkey recently restored ties with Israel after a six-year lull following a deadly Israeli naval raid to stop an activist flotilla aiming to breach the Gaza blockade.

Qatar The Gulf nation of Qatar, which has close ties to Erdogans government, was quick to condemn the military coup attempt.

It called the attempted coup a violation of the constitutional legitimacy in Turkey and said it supports all legal measures the government takes to maintain security and stability.

The official Qatar News Agency said the ruling emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, has spoken with Erdogan by phone to express Qatars support.

Qatar and Turkey have grown increasingly close in recent years, and share similar stances on their support for Syrian rebel groups and the Muslim Brotherhood. The two countries agreed last year to establish a Turkish military base in Qatar.

Iran said the attempted military coup in Turkey was doomed to fail.

The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the brave defence by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government.
He said the events in neighbouring Turkey prove that coup dtat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region.

Pakistan An aide to prime minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan hopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey.

Tariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkeys foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkeys government and democratic institutions.
Pakistans main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup.

Sharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008.
Afghanistan President Ashraf Ghani expressed support for Turkeys elected government, saying in a statement that democratic elections are the most effective means for peaceful transfer of power.

Militaristic options will only undermine democratic institutions, stability and development in the country, the statement from Ghanis office said.

Azerbaijan The president of Turkeys neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup.
President Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and welcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilise the situation, spokesman Ali Hasanov said.

Azerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as one nation, two states  a phrase later echoed by TErdogan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Strange why would Turkeys four main parties all condemn the coup if it was staged ? 

Turkey's four main political parties condemned the attempted military coup in a joint statement on Saturday, marking a rare departure from usually fractious politics.
 
The four parties, which run the gamut from the right-wing, Islamist-rooted AK Party founded by President Tayyip Erdogan to the left-of-center, pro-Kurdish Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP), said their stance was invaluable for democracy in Turkey.
 
The statement was read aloud in the assemby the parliamentary speaker

The foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, was quoted by the official IRNA news agency as praising the brave defence by the people of Turkey of their democracy and elected government.

He said the events in neighbouring Turkey prove that coup dtat has no place and is doomed to fail in our region.

Pakistan
An aide to prime minister Nawaz Sharif condemned the attempted coup in a statement and said Pakistan hopes that peace and normalcy will be restored in Turkey.

Tariq Fatimi also said he had contacted Turkeys foreign minister to express solidarity with Turkeys government and democratic institutions.

Pakistans main political parties have also praised the people of Turkey for foiling the coup.

Sharif was himself overthrown in a 1999 coup led by Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who ruled Pakistan until 2008.

Afghanistan
President Ashraf Ghani expressed support for Turkeys elected government, saying in a statement that democratic elections are the most effective means for peaceful transfer of power.

Militaristic options will only undermine democratic institutions, stability and development in the country, the statement from Ghanis office said.

Azerbaijan
The president of Turkeys neighbor Azerbaijan condemned the attempted coup.

President Ilham Aliev was concerned about developments in Turkey and welcomed measures taken to prevent the attempt at a coup and to stabilise the situation, spokesman Ali Hasanov said.

Azerbaijan is a Turkic nation and its late president Geidar Aliev once described their relations as one nation, two states  a phrase later echoed by TErdogan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two Turkish majors, a captain and five privates have requested asylum in Greece after landing in a military helicopter. Greeces defense ministry has said a Blackhawk helicopter carrying seven Turkish military personnel and one civilian landed in the city of Alexandroupolis earlier Saturday. The passengers asked for asylum and were arrested for illegal entry into Greece.

Eight Turkish military personnel who sought asylum in the northern Greek town of Alexandoupolis have removed all insignia from their uniforms, making it impossible to know their ranks. 


We are in the process of sending interpreters in order to be debriefed, one insider said. We are also in touch with the Turkish embassy. It is vital that we know what is going on.

Another said it was highly unlikely that the eight men would be granted asylum.

Turkey and Greece, though Nato partners, are long-time adversaries, with Athens closely watching events in Ankara.

As such, a defence expert said, this was the first time a Turkish military asset had landed in Greece with a view to seeking asylum in the country.

The land borders between the neighbours have been reinforced but customs officials are clarifying that while the crossing between Greece and Turkey remains open (even if cross-border traffic has been reduced to a trickle), that between Turkey and Greece remains firmly closed.

	<TEXT> Fethullah Glen: who is the man blamed by Turkey's president for coup attempt?

The accusation by Turkeys president, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, that US-based cleric Fethullah Glen is behind Friday nights attempted coup is part of a familiar rhetoric and a long-running rivalry. So is there any truth in it?

It is probably worth pointing out in the first instance that the traditional rivalry in Turkish society has been between secularists (including those in the army) who look to the modern states founder, Kemal Atatrk, and Islamists  not least Erdogans AKP party.

The AKP has itself provoked a number of coups or attempts in Turkish history. And in many respects, Friday night looked to be another event in that tradition: a military coup driven from within Turkeys armed forces. By Saturday morning Erdoan had reasserted power and it was announced dozens of senior colonels and generals had been removed.

The military has long seen itself as the guardian of modern Turkey, and the movement lead by Glen occupies a sort of murky gap between the two sides, secularist and Islamist.

Glen, a cleric living in reclusive exile in Pennsylvania, leads a popular movement called Hizmet. It is a hodge-podge that at times has appeared cultish  spawning thinktanks, businesses, schools and publications across the globe, while building up substantial wealth and influence in the process.

Action taken to reinstate constitutional order, human rights and freedoms, say armed forces

According to some reports, 10% of the Turkish population is estimated to support Hizmet.

The centre of growing tension in recent years between the Glenists, Erdoan and the AKP has been Erdoans blaming of Glenists in the police and judiciary for anti-corruption allegations in 2013 that targeted senior supporters of the president, including his son Bilal.

The allegations were seen as retaliation for Erdoans moves against Glenist schools as the president attempted to limit the growth of the movement (an effort that had also seen Erdoan invite Glen to return from exile to Turkey).

The rivalry culminated in a purge of perceived Glenists including senior army and police officers, as well as those in the media accused of Glenist links.

As the coup attempt unfolded on Friday night, a lawyer for the Turkish government, Robert Amsterdam, said there were indications of direct involvement of the Glenists, adding that he and his firm had attempted repeatedly to warn the US government of the threat posed by Glen and his movement. Amsterdam cited Turkish intelligence sources in claiming that there are signs that Glen is working closely with certain members of military leadership against the elected civilian government.

The Alliance for Shared Values, the US arm of Glens Hizmet movement, was quick to deny any involvement in the coup, calling such claims highly irresponsible and insisting that the group did not support the military intervention.

	<TEXT> The Turkish military says it has taken over after Turkey's PM said a military faction had been involved in an attempted coup.

Prime minister Binali Yildirim has called for calm, saying security forces are doing what is necessary to resolve the situation.

Turkish broadcaster NTV is showing footage of tanks at the entrance to Istanbul's Ataturk airport. 

Military vehicles are blocking two bridges in Istanbul, while military jets have been heard flying over the Turkish capital, Ankara. 

Some media reports have said ambulances were seen in front of Turkey's military headquarters.

Mr Yildirim has warned that those responsible for this "illegal attempt " will pay the "highest price."

 And by the way, the Muslim religion is passed down from the father. If your father was a Muslim, you become one by default in accordance with the religion. And if this guy wanted to disavow himself from Islam, he would have been murdered. Because that is what Islam does: it commands those who leave the Muslim faith to be murdered.
 So yeah, he was a Muslim. Not a strict practicing one, but still a Muslim.

	<TEXT> Interesting, thanks for the input .Yes its all down to what works , maybe. However the question we need to be asking does it work?

Is society heading in the right direction , why is there so much hate around at the moment ( racism) , people piled high in debt , etc etc.Obviously iv just highlighted two negative scenarios in the current society ( from my perspective ) . As you say we are stronger as a group and individuals do die off who distance themselves to much from that group.However i do feel that most scientific and social  advancements need a mind so individual, which sees what others can  not see  to have major advancements. History is full of these individuals.Now that mind may be criticised and suppressed, however it is down to individual will to push that belief/idea which is been squashed by the group.

That idea as so often throughout history  has made people wonder and think and changed themselves and others for the better.  

Of course there are bad examples as well of these individuals who promote hate, division and greed for their own selfish reasons.We should be cautious of that and question.I feel what we need is a respect and balance for individual thought which promotes news ways of thinking , which indeed may be against the norm of society.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The motive of most of these deaths is still unknown*. When the police investigate them, the investigations soon get bogged down and are obstructed by corrupt officials. Impunity is, more than ever, at the centre of a vicious circle of violence against media personnel and journalisms chronic depreciation.

The circumstances of these murders are usually very similar. The victims are often radio hosts or local correspondents based in regions far from major cities who cover crime, corruption or sensitive social issues. They are gunned down by sicarios (hit-men) near their home or workplace and in some cases they had been warned in advance about their reporting.

If there is any room for doubt, the police and judicial authorities quickly rule out any connection between the murder and the victims work as a journalist. They often try to cast doubt on the quality of the victims journalism and even go so far as to suggest that the victim was linked to local criminal groups.

	<TEXT> Barack Obama on Thursday said US police departments needed to move more quickly to reform.

The US president offered condolences to the family of the black motorist, who was killed by a Minnesota cop, and insisted the country had seen "tragedies like this too many times".

Citing a litany of evidence to show that non-white Americans are more likely to be pulled over, searched or shot by police, Mr Obama appealed to white Americans not to see this as a fringe issue.

This is not just a black issue. It's not just a Hispanic issue. This is an American issue that we should all care about," Mr Obama said in a hastily arranged statement on arrival in Warsaw for a Nato summit.

"All fair minded people should be concerned.

"It's incumbent on all of us to say we can do better than this. We are better than this."

The use of force by police against African-Americans in cities from Ferguson, Missouri, to Baltimore and New York has sparked periodic and sometimes violent protests in the past two years, and has spawned a movement called Black Lives Matter. Anger has intensified when the officers involved in such incidents have been acquitted or not charged at all. </TEXT>

I accept that it's your interpretation and that of the authors of the article, but you've failed (either through disinterest or incapability) to indicate where the claim is justified in the Chilcot report. Perhaps you struggle with basic comprehension? Do you think that "presented with a certainty that was not justified" means the same as "deliberately exaggerated", yes or no?


Its a 2 million plus report which has took 7 years to bring together by various professional people.The claim of the "deliberately exaggerated" is presented in the report and  the above articles.Now if you have a comprehensive report which you can show with as much detail  which proves otherwise , then show it here.If not keep on believing in Tony Blair and have a great day.

	<TEXT> The Iraqi man who was filmed attacking Saddam Hussein's statue with a sledgehammer when U.S. troops stormed into Baghdad in 2003 said Iraq was in a better shape under his rule and George W. Bush and Tony Blair should be put on trial "for ruining" it.

Kadhim Hassan al-Jabouri was speaking on Wednesday as British former civil servant John Chilcot released a long-awaited report criticizing Britain's role in the U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq.

The report said that "policy on Iraq was made on the basis of flawed intelligence and assessments", and that claims that Iraq posed a threat by possessing weapons of mass destruction were "presented with unjustified certainty".

It said that the turmoil unleashed in Iraq since the invasion should have come as no surprise.

"I regret striking the statue," said Jabouri, a Shi'ite who lost more than a dozen relatives under Saddam, a member of the Sunni Muslim minority. He said they were killed for opposing the Iraqi leader, who was hanged in 2006.

The 12-metre statue of Saddam was pulled down by U.S. Marines shortly after Jabouri and other Iraqis attacked it on April 9, 2003. Images of it being ripped from its plinth were broadcast live around the world and came to symbolize the overthrow of Saddam's ruthless quarter-century in power.

"I wish Saddam would return; he executed many of my family but he is still better than these politicians and clerics who got Iraq to the way it is," he said, referring to the Shi'ite religious political parties that took over after the invasion.

Jabouri, 58, owned a motorcycle repair shop in the Karrada district of central Baghdad at the time of the invasion.

The mainly Shi'ite neighborhood was hit by a huge truck bomb on Saturday night, claimed by the ultra-hardline Sunni group Islamic State, which killed about 250 people. It was the highest toll from a single bombing in more than a decade of chaos following the war which toppled Saddam.

Blair and Bush "must be put to trial as they have ruined Iraq with their lies. It turned out there were no weapons of mass destruction," Jabouri said.

"A DREAM COME TRUE"

Others who suffered under Saddam had a different view and several said they were grateful to the governments in Washington and London for putting an end to his rule.

"Overthrowing Saddam's regime was a dream that came true thanks to the U.S. and Britain and all those who say otherwise are liars," said former political prisoner Faris Mohammed, 46, who was serving a life sentence in the southern Shi'ite city of Basra when the invasion took place.

But Abu Yasser, 67, a retired marketing manager at Iraqi Airways and a member of Iraq's Sunni community, said Chilcot's report offered little comfort to Iraqis marking the start of the Eid al-Fitr religious holiday on Wednesday, overshadowed once again by the violence which has plagued Iraq since 2003.

"Their investigation will not change our situation, it will not restore our Iraq and the people who are gone," he said. "The war came and then the sectarian violence ... and Daesh," he added, referring to Islamic State fighters who seized most of the country's Sunni territories in 2014 and still control the northern city of Mosul.

"Now even the joy of Eid was taken from us in the bombing of Karrada," Abu Yasser said.

Abdul Illah Risan, the Appeal Court General Prosecutor in Baghdad, said he rejected the Chilcot report as "it questions the legality of the war to depose Saddam."

"Yes it is true that the war to oust the dictator has cost the Iraqi people a lot," he said.

"But Iraqis feel grateful to all the coalition countries, and at the top are the United State and Great Britain because they simply gave Iraqis what they wished for and what they were deprived of since birth - which is freedom and democracy.

-This is the reason why George W Bush is the only ex president in modern history who cannot leave his own Country. Because if he did he would be arrested for war crimes. Carter, Clinton and others have been free to travel the world after leaving office, Bush knows he can't and that's why he stays at home where he will be safe.

And Tony Bliar - he's the man that has never visited any orphans in Iraq or given them any of his money but gets given an award from his Best Mates at 'Save' the Children. That sentence is an indictment by itself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And its all  run for profit and greed.Millions died as a result of the war and there is still ongoing terrorism and war because of it. At best, if Saddam was still alive killing people we'd be about break even... maybe.
Blair should take his ill-gotten millions and disappear in shame from all public life, he won't though. His narcissism won't let him.

We illegally invaded and occupied Iraq to gain control of strategic resources such as oil. General John Abizaid, former commander of CENTCOM with responsibility for Iraq said, of course its about oil, we cant really deny that, while Secretary of Defence Chuck Hagel said this in 2007: People say we're not fighting for oil. Of course we are. To round it off, former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan added in his 2007 book: I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows: the Iraq war is largely about oil.

The report, no doubt, will talk about "mistakes" and "things we could have done differently". All of this ignores the fact that, because we weren't in Iraq for humanitarian reasons, things simply couldn't have gone differently.

People often like to say that the initial invasion and toppling of Saddam Hussein was good, but the aftermath - the occupation - was bad. This ignores the fact that they came as part of a package: we overthrew Saddam so that we could occupy the country, gain control of its resources, dismantle its state structure and privatise it.

	<TEXT> Iraqis bear the scars of 2003 but they are still bleeding, as grimly illustrated by the bombings last weekend that killed 165 in Baghdad. The Iraqi prime minister, Haider al-Abadi, backed by the US, presides over the fight against Isis, which occupies Mosul, the countrys second city, as well as swaths of neighbouring Syria. Abadis majority Shia community is in the ascendant while Sunnis are marginalised. Low oil prices, rampant corruption and abysmal public services fuel discontent. Kurds in the north, the big winners of the US-led invasion, enjoy autonomy. Iranian influence has grown. Even if few mourn Saddam Hussein, Operation Iraqi Freedom sounds like a misnomer.Iraq study estimates war-related deaths at 461,000

	<TEXT> It will be interesting to see the comments coming up in this thread regarding how all of  Islam spreads terror.Watch the circlejerk of  racism and hate spread. This is what the Islamic State, also known as ISIS, wants.

This is precisely what ISIS was aiming for  to provoke communities to commit actions against Muslims, The moments after a terrorist attack are often filled with acts of reprisal. In the six months after the Charlie Hebdo attacks in January, anti-Muslim violence and mosque vandalism more than quadrupled compared with the same period in 2014

Extremist groups feed off of alienation, some counterterrorism experts say, and Islamist militants deliberately aim to make Muslims in the West feel isolated and turn against their own communities.

http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2015/03/what-isis-really-wants/384980/

The far majority of victims in this war are Muslims,  as  well as every victim is white, black, asian, across all the world . Note how terrorism spread rapidly after 9/11, and the Iraq war (A war which is questionable at best) as well as attacks against the West. As well as the current refugee crisis. Remember hate fuels the flames of ISIS. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Straight from a Hollywood script , nothing but propaganda to get young men out there glamorising war. While the far more intelligent individuals direct  men thousands of miles away from the battelfield so they get them to have blood on their hands.

Example

More U.S. Troops Died by Suicide Than in Afghanistan Combat in 2012.According to the Associated Press, suicides among active-duty troops reached a new high last year.The suicide rate has been rising since 2001.And last year, 349 service members took their lives, much more than the 295 killed in combat in Afghanistan.The suicide figures are tentative, pending completion of pathology reports later this year.

We saw it 20 years ago in the first Gulf War.We even in some ways saw it after Vietnam.I mean, the issues of medical health, of personal stress, of family stress, in fact, go up after the actual fighting has stopped and the soldiers redeploy, theyre back in garrison, because the force is still under a lot of stress.

And we find now, in fact, that the military is about to get into this phase of downsizing.Probably 100,000 or so Army soldiers and Marines will be leaving the military.There are going to be budget cuts.And all these things are putting great burden on the leadership and great burden on the soldiers on the front lines.

And that accumulates and builds, and it ends up that you have got that group that, in fact, will have  will commit suicide as their expression of that stress.

http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/military-jan-june13-suicides_01-15/

"He cleaned his knife, grabbed some more ammo and then led another Iraqi special forces team into battle," whilst running in slow motion"

"He decapitated the first gunman, slit the throat of second and killed another with a third blow. He then sliced away at three others. The IS gunmen fled in panic allowing the SAS soldier to carry the injured men to safety." Before eating a Big Mac whilst showing off his glistening six pack and his shinny white teeth"

Remember. In war the heroes always outnumber the soldiers ten to one.

	<TEXT>  And none of those countries have large Muslim populations, America has a Muslim population of 1% and Europe 6% so by your stats they are committing a disproportionate amount of attacks. if Europe and America import a sizable Muslim population, terrorism will become the norm.
 Here is just the list from the last 2 years, notice how virtually all attacks are in the name of Islam.

But ( your sources)  reiterates your point that Muslims are the victims in a vast majority of attacks.If you can prove me otherwise than go ahead.Now going by that logic, if the couple of billion Muslim as stated here on this sub are supporters of terrorism/are terrorists there would be a hell of alot more attacks.The problem needs to be solved by Muslims themselves.Not by Westerners creating wars in the Middle East and also people fuelling the fire of hate.ISIS loves this and when racism grows towards Muslims.Well lets say that ISIS number one recruitment tool.Fanning the flames is an understatement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some facts 

 According to the FBI, 94% of terrorist attacks carried out in the United States from 1980 to 2005 have been by non-Muslims. This means that an American terrorist suspect is over nine times more likely to be a non-Muslim than a Muslim. According to this same report, there were more Jewish acts of terrorism in the United States than Islamic, yet when was the last time we heard about the threat of Jewish terrorism in the media? For the same exact reasons that we cannot blame the entire religion of Judaism or Christianity for the violent actions of those carrying out crimes under the names of these religions, we have absolutely no justifiable grounds to blame Muslims for terrorism.

https://www.fbi.gov/stats-services/publications/terrorism-2002-2005

Non-Muslims make up the majority of terrorists in Europe: There have been over one thousand terrorist attacks in Europe in the past five years. Take a guess at what percent of those terrorists were Muslim. Wrong, now guess again. Its less than 2%.

http://thinkprogress.org/world/2015/01/08/3609796/islamist-terrorism-europe/

There have been 140,000 terror attacks committed worldwide since 1970. Even if Muslims carried out all of these attacks (which is an absurd assumption given the fact mentioned in my first point), those terrorists would represent less than 0.00009 percent of all Muslims. To put things into perspective, this means that you are more likely to be struck by lightening in your lifetime than a Muslim is likely to commit a terrorist attack during that same timespan.

http://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/

If you are scared of Muslims then you should also be scared of household furniture and toddlers: A study carried out by the University of North Carolina showed that less than 0.0002% of Americans killed since 9/11 were killed by Muslims. (Ironically, this study was done in Chapel Hill: the same place where a Caucasian non-Muslim killed three innocent Muslims as the mainstream media brushed this terrorist attack off as a parking dispute). Based on these numbers, and those of the Consumer Product Safety Commission, the average American is more likely to be crushed to death by their couch or television than they are to be killed by a Muslim. As a matter of fact, Americans were more likely to be killed by a toddler in 2013 than they were by a so-called Muslim terrorist.

Standard Lifes decision to close redemptions on its open-ended property fund is vitally important and shows just how precarious the situation is right now.

This seems to have precipitated some pretty big selling in property stocks and asset managers, with Legal   General and Aberdeen Asset Management suffering nasty falls this morning. Barratt Developments and Taylor Wimpey are down 5% again.

Investors are getting very nervous now as they fear Standard Life may not be the only fund that will close its doors. The last time we saw this kind of action was in the financial crisis.

	<TEXT> Brexit's effect on the economy is undoubtedly going to be huge. If predictions are right households are going to defer consumption, and more and more firms will delay investment. That, in turn will lower demand for labour and push up unemployment. Britain is going to slip into recession and things are going to get very messy very fast.

The logic is simple  when people are worried about the state of their finances, they stop spending, and when people stop spending, that can signal serious problems on a macroeconomic scale. </TEXT>

As for Trump why would people support a guy who believes in taking a countries resources thousands and thousands of miles away? Are his supporters ignorant or do they believe in taking something which isnt theirs?

Take back the oil. We take over the oil which we should have done in the first place.  And what I would do with the money that we make, which would be tremendous, I would take care of the families of the soldiers that were killed, the families of the soldiers, the wounded warriors that I see. I love them.

What about the Iraqis thats their oil?

	<TEXT> Alfred de Zayas was speaking following reports, based on leaked documents, that suggest the European Commission may treat a trade deal with Canada as an EU-only matter that will be discussed in secret and wont require ratification from member states parliaments.

The stated aim of the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is to improve trading relations between the EU and Canada.

But de Zayas said that in the view of vocal opposition from civil society, a thorough, open discussion should be carried out by national parliaments and referenda should be organised in all countries concerned.




Trade deals negotiated in secret, excluding key stakeholders such as labour unions, consumer associations, health professionals environmental experts and now parliamentarians have zero democratic legitimacy, he stated.

He highlighted that a 2014 European Commission consultation on a similar trade deal with the US, known as TTIP, resulted in 97% of respondents from across Europe opposing a clause relating to investment protection.

The provision would enable companies to sue governments over legislation they claim may affect future profits, including safety regulations, workers rights and environmental protections, in a corporate court.

The same would apply to CETA, but no consultation was ever held, de Zayas pointed out.

He also stressed that both the TTIP and CETA should only be ratified after human rights, health and environmental impact assessments have been conducted.

Disputes with countries like France and opposition from civil society organisations have significantly impeded the ratification of TTIP.

UK campaign group Global Justice Now said today the UK would have to redouble efforts to fight deals like the TTIP following the countrys vote to leave the European Union. In the wake of the Leave vote, the UK is now excluded from participation in the trade agreement.

GJNs director, Nick Dearden, warned that the UK government had pushed for the most extreme version of TTIP in European negotiations, and may look to secure deals with even more controversial provisions now the country is out on its own.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The official Leave campaign had suggested that money saved from contribution to the European Union could be spent on the NHS instead.

Mr Farage was not part of the official Leave campaign and had no involvement with their ads he said.

The pledge was featured on buses, fliers and posters and was central to Vote Leave.

Captions such as "Let's give our NHS the 350 million the EU takes every week" and "We send the EU 350 million a week, let's fund our NHS instead" were stamped on Vote Leave campaign material. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Where are the studies you mention?

Here is one interesting study

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3217592/

3. CHARACTERISTICS OF INTERNET ADDICTS
Shek et al. [15] examined Internet addiction behavior in 6,121 Chinese primary and secondary students in Hong Kong and found that one-fifth of their sample could be regarded as Internet addicted. Fu and his colleagues [16] found that 6.7% of the Hong Kong teenagers display five or more symptoms of Internet addiction. In addition, the Internet addiction symptoms seem to go along with individuals' suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms. The situation in China is also quite serious. About 13.7% of adolescent Internet users (about 10 million teenagers) could be classified as Internet addicts [17]. The situation in Taiwan is also similar. Lin and Tsai [18] found that 11.8% of the senior secondary school students in their Taiwan study could be regarded as Internet dependents. Research also indicated that 4.0% to 8.1% of the university students showed excessive or pathological Internet use [19, 20].

The symptoms of Internet addiction or Pathological Internet Use include obsessive thoughts about the Internet, tolerance, diminished impulse control, inability to cease using the Internet, and withdrawal [5, page 187]. Beard and Wolf [21] have also proposed a set of diagnostic criteria for Internet addiction. The characteristics of Internet addicts are described below, with references to previous empirical studies.

3.1. Excessive Use of Internet

Internet addicts spend almost more than triple the number of hours in Internet use than non-Internet addicts [4]. Young also found that the average number of hours per week using Internet by Internet dependents was 38.5 hours, while the nondependents spent only an average of 4.90 hours [22]. According to a survey by Hong Kong Youths Association in 2005 [23], young people of ages 10 to 29 spent an average of 18.4 hours per week in Internet use. About one tenth (9.9%) of the sample spent 42 hours per week, that is, an average of six hours per day on line. In some sense, Internet use is the most important or salient activity in the addicts' daily life, and they usually stay on line longer than they originally expected.

3.2. Obsessive Thoughts about the Internet

The addict is preoccupied with the Internet (thinks about previous online activity or anticipates next online session) [21, page 379] and is unable to refrain from thinking about the Internet most of the time when he or she is awake.

3.3. Pleasant Feeling in Internet Use

People have a lot fun by using Internet. The Internet exposures of the Internet addicts appear to be pleasurable, entertaining, interactive, and relaxed [24, 25]. Overall speaking, the addicts enjoyed the Internet experiences, and the enjoyment and pleasure would drive them to be addicted to Internet use.

3.4. Tolerance

The tolerance symptom refers to the needs to use the Internet with increased amount of time in order to achieve satisfaction [21, page 379]. This symptom is closely related to the excessive use or overuse of the Internet by the addicts.

3.5. Diminished Impulse Control

The diminished impulse control is related to the reduced emotional self-regulation to control one's impulses to reach a goal. In other words, the addicts tend to lose their control of their behavior. In particular, they are unable to cut back or stop Internet use.

3.6. Withdrawal

The withdrawal symptom of the addicts refers to the unpleasant feeling (restless, moody, depressed, or irritable) when the Internet activity is being stopped or cut down.

3.7. Impact on Daily Life

The impact on the daily life and study of the Internet addicts is usually negative [24]. The addicts may sometimes risk the loss of a significant relationship, educational or career opportunity because of the Internet. They may lie to others because of their overinvolvement with the Internet, and they also use Internet as a means to escape from problems or to settle one's unpleasant emotion such as helplessness, anxiety, guilt, or shame [21, page 379].

3.8. Parental and Family Interactions

Internet addicts spent less time with their parents and other family members and tended to have tension with them [22].

3.9. Friendship and Romantic Relationships

Internet addicts tend to have less friends and romantic relationships [26]. They are more lonely and solitary.

3.10. Health Problems

Internet addicts are less healthy than nonaddicts, and they are also less willing to seek medical treatment and less motivated to develop stress-relieving practices [26].

3.11. Academic Performance

Chang and Law [27] found that academic performance is negatively related to Internet addiction score.

3.12. Lonely Character

Morahan-Martin and Schumacher [28] found that loneliness is associated with increased Internet use. The average weekly hours on line of the lonely people was significantly higher than that of the nonlonely people. Lonely people used the Internet when they felt lonely, depressed, or anxious. They were more likely to make and interact with online friends, and to use the Internet for emotional support [28, page 669]. </TEXT>
