	<TEXT> I want to build something that people actually use, so I'm starting with some user research. I'm building a new analytics tool capable of running queries on massive data sets very efficiently. This opens up a whole world of possibility where I can basically ask anything... now the question is what information is valuable to social media marketers and brand managers like you guys.

What are the gaps in your knowledge around customer behaviour / industry competitors / ? that you want to fill? If you could ask any question regarding social media, what would you ask?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you a researcher, brand manager, or social media professional? I want your input! I want to build something that people actually use. 

I'm developing a new browser tool for social media analytics that can process massive data sets quickly and perform text analysis and sentiment analysis. The queries aren't limited to the customers/users who follow your account, but could be for  entire industries or population segments. All shoe companies on all Facebook and Instagram, for example, or all customers tweeting about politics in X zipcode.

What unanswered questions do you have relating to your brands or customers on social?

If you had access to big social data, what would you want to ask?

Has there been any point recently where there was a gap in your understanding of your customer base on social media?   </TEXT>

Any suggestions for coworking spaces in and around Costa Rica and/or Nicaragua? I need a solid wifi connection for frequent Skype calls. Have any of you worked from either of those two countries?

I saw that there was one coworking space in Tamarindo, but it seems like a new community. San Juan Del Sur seems like a really cool place to visit, but I'm not sure about the wifi. </TEXT>

It's a weekly newsletter that sends our top three posts on social media analytics to entrepreneurs and social media managers.

The goal of the newsletter is to make social media analytics easier to understand -- and share some fun case studies to sort of bring the learning to life. Users can subscribe to the newsletter on our blog.

	<TEXT> I did a case study on what DiCaprio's #PoorLeo meme and Oscar win did to him on social media in terms of marketing. Did it help or hurt the actor? Did he experience an increase in followers as a result? 

I found his lack of interaction with the whole #PoorLeo fandom very interesting. His nonparticipation didn't really dampen anyone's enthusiasm and the entire meme was a massive marketing boom for the actor.

What do you guys think?

Below is the text: 

**Becoming Meme**

Its hard to find a less pitiable man on earth than Leonardo DiCaprio. The actor and environmentalist has achieved stratospheric levels of success. Hes often photographed poolside. And that pool is usually on a yacht.

In the world of film, hes famed director Martin Scorseses favourite leading man and has won awards for his environmentalism and acting. DiCaprio has picked up three Golden Globes, two Critics Choice Awards, and one Scream Award. He even holds two Blockbuster Entertainment Awards: a testament to his long tenure in show business.

Until this year, DiCaprio seemed to have everything but an Oscar.

What did winning an Academy Award do to Leonardo DiCaprio online, and why did the Internet care so much?

The characters DiCaprio played in the early 2010s were often victims of injustice. Young social media users found parallels between DiCaprio and his characters: theyre both unfairly deprived some key ingredient (a family, professional recognition, some sitting room on a giant piece of wood floating in a freezing ocean).

In 2014, when DiCaprio was nominated for his role in The Wolf of Wall Street, the meme reached a fever pitch on Tumblr. More than 180,000 users supported a Tumblr post seething with (mock?) frustration. DiCaprio had been nominated for an Oscar four times, but had never one. On Tumblr, this injustice was too much to bear.

Fuelled by the often-unfortunate characters he portrays, Poor Leo became a popular hashtag on Tumblr with thousands of posts.

Reddit was soon to follow. Posts with DiCaprio in the headline have racked up more than 100,000 upvotes (I stopped counting after the first of many pages of submitted DiCaprio links and text posts).

Still, the actors Twitter account didnt receive much engagement. Leonardo DiCaprio the brand was not as engaging as Leonardo DiCaprio the meme. Between Oscars 2015 and 2016, engagement for the star remained low at 2.3%.

**Poor Leo Goes Viral**

Before Oscars 2016, DiCaprio had what every movie star('s publicity team) dreams of: an engaged, young, and massive following online. Every year, Poor Leo memes grew in popularity. The Poor Leo meme became a sort of Mayan doomsday clock ticking down to the next Oscars. During the show, win or lose, the hundreds of thousands of Tumblr-ers, Redditors, and aggregator readers would react in a huge way.

Every year that Poor Leo lost the meme continued with higher (and funnier) stakes than ever before. In the extremely unlikely event that DiCaprio won, the meme would implode in on itself like a dying star, creating a black hole threatening to break all of social media and do what to the meme himself?

**@LeoDiCaprio Finally Benefits**

For the official @LeoDiCaprio on Twitter, excitement over his long-awaited Oscar translated into a concrete and dramatic spike in engagement. The Crowdbabble graph below shows engagement  likes, comments, and retweets  before and after the show. Can you spot his tweet about his Oscar win?

The giant engagement spike is the response to @LeoDiCaprios post-win message to fans. His tweet about winning attracted 367,729 engagements from more than 100,000 Twitter users within three days. At the time of press, two weeks later, engagement had snowballed.

Engagement with the tweet is now up to 955,465 retweets and likes. Fandom for Poor Leo the meme, it seems, does translate into fandom for Leonardo DiCaprio the actor. The Oscar-winning actor, though, does not participate in conversations on Twitter  even after his win, he was often left out. Mentions of @LeoDiCaprio stayed surprisingly low after his win. Just 20 to 60 tweets per day mentioned @LeoDiCaprio and, as shown above, the account never responded. Perhaps sensing that the actor doesnt tweet himself, Twitter users talked around and about him  they didnt try to include @LeoDiCaprio in the Poor Leo/Validated Leo conversation.

The low number of mentions shows that the meme still operates independently of his official brand. The high engagement for his tweets, however, indicates that his official account was able to capture the enthusiasm generated by the Poor Leo meme. The actor didnt lose a huge number of users between the grassroots fandom and his official account  no small feat for a big movie brand. To compare, Brie Larsons post-win message on her official social account (Instagram) attracted 88,757 likes and comments. Thats fewer than 10% of DiCaprios 1m retweets and likes.

**After the Win, What Now?**

Leonardo DiCaprio has what no other Hollywood actor does: a very special relationship with the Internet. But the little golden statue that solidified Leonardo DiCaprios status as a bankable, talented A-List actor may have also killed his covetable online fandom. Now that DiCaprio has his Oscar, the running Poor Leo joke is over. The thrill is gone: each Oscar run from now on will have much lower stakes. Subsequent awards seasons are unlikely to generate the thousands of meme posts and comments on Tumblr and Reddit that they did before the win.

Between February 28 and March 3 2016, in the wake of his win and almost-1,000,000 engagements, @LeoDiCaprio gained 179,500 new followers on Twitter.

But engagement with DiCaprios account, from March 3 to March 7, is back down to 0%.

Perhaps DiCaprios massive Poor Leo fandom will find a new way to celebrate Validated Leo. The thousands of social media users who enjoyed the Poor Leo meme might wait in suspense each awards season to see if the win becomes a streak. Maybe the actor will begin choosing roles that do not end with unjust horror in candlelit crypts or creepy mental hospitals  characters who get what they want (the dawn of a new Strutting Leo era on screen). Maybe Reddit and Tumblr users will find some other void in DiCaprios life to fixate on, and Poor Leo will re-emerge.

How can Leo take advantage of this big social media following -- particularly on Reddit and Tumblr -- now that #PoorLeo is over? How can he market himself now? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hashtag Analytics 101: Which hashtags should you use, and what are their audiences? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-23 15:00:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys! I wrote a guide to hashtags to encourage social media managers to think outside the #tag #everything box. I tried to represent this in a pyramid visualization, showing how audience size changes when you use different hashtags. 

Here's a link to the full piece: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/hashtag-analytics-101-find-new-followers/

Hashtags can help you find new followers on Twitter and Instagram by connecting your posts to new audiences. Which hashtags should you use to boost your following and find your next brand advocates?

**The Largest Audience: Trending #Hashtags**

 * Risk level: High
 * Reward: Exposure and impressions for your content
 * Audience: General, skewing younger and more engaged
 * Examples: #wastehistime2016 #kony2012 #iloveBAEbut #bettercallsaul

Trending hashtags  including jokes (#wastehistime2016) and breaking news events  have the biggest audience on Twitter and Instagram. If you find one that matches your brands voice on social media, this type promises the most exposure. Trending hashtags will expose your brand to users at the top of the sales funnel: a general audience that might not buy into your brand, but could give you a boost by following you.

Lets imagine that your brand is a bike shop hoping to attract new followers on Instagram. Youve snapped a picture of someone untangling their bike outside your store. A lighthearted trending hashtag could yield a high number of impressions for the post.

You might get buried in the pandemonium. But theres the slim, tempting possibility that your content becomes the favourite and goes viral.

Brand usage of trending hashtags can go very wrong. DiGiornos appropriation of #whyIstayed nearly cost the brand its Twitter following. Its almost always a bad idea for brands to jump on breaking news or sensitive trending topics, unless theyre directly related to the event (unlike Crocs and #DavidBowie).

Jokes and lighthearted entertainment topics, around album releases or music and movie events, tend to be much safer and more rewarding for brands. Trending hashtags should match a brands voice. But when theyre used with others, even lighthearted hashtags that arent an exact match could boost engagement.

**Drilling Down: General Topic Hashtags**

 * Risk level: Medium
 * Reward: Reaching potential customers
 * Audience: Narrowed to region or interest
 * Examples: #cycling #nyc #thesix #justmomthings #fitness

As your hashtags audiences shrink, they become more likely to engage with your brand. Mentions per minute are lower than trending topics, so your content is less likely to get completely buried. 

This post is getting long, so I won't include the explanations for expression hashtags and active community hashtags. You can check out the full piece for those (expression or slang hashtags help you target specific age groups, while active community hashtags are the most targeted and help you find followers closest to the bottom of the sales funnel). 

**Stacking Hashtag Types to Maximize Reach**

How can you make the most of your hashtags?

A combination of hashtags  selecting just one for each audience  will maximize reach without alienating the people most likely to follow you. Plus, you'll #avoid #seeming #spammy. For example: "When you lock your bike to someone else's #wastehistime2016 #icant #biking #biketo" hits different audience sizes without any conflicts or repeats between hashtags.

Choosing a theme and then finding one hashtag from each audience size is a good way to maximize potential impressions. At the same time, you can still connect with customers most likely to buy into your brand.

By combining trending, general topic, expression, and active community hashtags, you will have reached out to a general audience, a specific interest and age range, and a niche community. Layered together, you'll connect with all four audiences while potentially reaching out to your next dedicated customer: the young cyclist from Toronto, for example, who uses every hashtag you've included. You've hyper-targeted your content to the smallest, most niche audience: but it will also be given exposure to the audiences for each type. Win-win. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a bunch of Imgur albums up that are attracting a healthy number of views and some comments: http://subject9409.imgur.com/

Has anyone else here experimented with Imgur as part of a social media strategy? It seems to be a good place to go for impressions, but not to drive traffic to more in-depth content. People who are on Imgur want to stay on Imgur, not leave for more details, it seems.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys! Wrote another crisis management case study, this time on Starbucks' #RaceTogether campaign. It was launched to "start the conversation" about race in stores and on Instagram, and it did not go so well for  the brand.

Full link with data vis here, summary below: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-did-the-good-intentions-behind-starbucks-racetogether-pay-off-d39ffc6ece70#.ax8aj3zcz

**Jumping Into the Race Debate**

RaceTogether was planned as a nation-wide campaign to unfold in stores and on social media from March 17 to 22 2015. The goal? Starting the conversation about racial tensions in America. The effort? Massive.

 RaceTogether was launched on March 17 with an Instagram hashtag via @StarbucksPartners, followed by more than 76,000 Starbucks staff members and fans. Starbucks did not share the risky campaign on its main @Starbucks account. Common was brought on to support the effort; the endorsement Instagram was one of @StarbucksPartners top posts for the week.

**Outrage**

Black Lives Matter gathered outside the Union Square cafe in New York, one of Starbucks hallmark locations, to voice their outrage at the corporate hijacking of a complex problem. Attacks from such a prominent activist group stamped #RaceTogether as politically incorrect, on the wrong side of the issue.

Protests flowed from the streets to the web as the #RaceTogether hashtag was overtaken by critics on Instagram.

Engagement with @StarbucksPartners declined as the hashtag spiralled out of the brands control.

During the initiative, @StarbucksParnters received an average of 1,281 likes per post, down from the 2015 average of 1,827 likes per post.

The campaign began with protests and ended on March 22 angry opinion pieces from Rolling Stone, Fast Company, and others. On the last day of #RaceTogether, Gawker leaked an internal memo from Starbucks with instructions to its baristas from its launch. Headline? Heres the Internal Memo from Starbucks Disastrous Race-Relations Push.

**Effects**

RaceTogether certainly started conversations, but not the kind Starbucks hoped for. Discussion centred on the embattled brand, not race relations. Replies to @StarbucksPartners posts dipped and #RaceTogether posts were the accounts least popular. An initiative meant to deepen discussion had the opposite effect on social media.

During #RaceTogether, @StarbucksPartners received just 30.7 comments per post, less than half the 2015 average.

As demonstrated by the IBM #HackaHairdryer debacle, social media users treat failed campaigns like contagions dangerous to the health of their own social capital. @StarbucksPartners and #RaceTogether became the Typhoid Mary of Instagram: no followers wanted to go anywhere near it.

Fear might take hold internally as well: Starbucks could become wary of undertaking other social good initiatives. The failed campaign could cramp Starbucks willingness to take risks, which would hinder innovation and its ability to grow  plus, the public could lose out on risky initiatives that actually work.

In his December 2014 letter to Starbucks staff, Howard Schultz said staying silent is not who we are. #RaceTogether might have succeeded if it had been allowed to blossom organically from the companys internal efforts  its tuition reimbursement program for low-income students and training programs for unemployed youth, among others. Forcing the transition into a public campaign doomed it from the beginning: there were no obvious benefits for customers or society, so it failed as a social good initiative.

@StarbucksPartners has revived and weekly engagement has now exceeded its 2015 average. 

The failed campaign in March didnt dampen enthusiasm for Starbucks red cups  the big spike in November  or the general uptick over the holiday season. With is brand damaged offline, but its social media engagement bouncing back, #RaceTogether hasnt been fatal for Starbucks.

**Discussion**

What do you guys think about social good initiatives as marketing? Can companies take on controversial issues and succeed? Did Starbucks #RaceTogether campaign succeed, if the goal was starting conversations?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Lessons from the viral sensations of 2015, and the importance of feel-bad-then-feel-good stories </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-11 06:38:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi marketers! I did a case study of viral sensations in 2015. I was amazed at how similar three of the viral star's stories were -- Tim Tai, Ahmed Mohamed, and Sean O'Brien (dancing man) all had the same story arc. I think marketers can learn a lot from them.

Link to full piece over in dataisbeautiful: https://np.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/40f4l9/what_happens_when_you_accidentally_become_famous/

**Intro**

Feel good, especially feel-bad-then-feel-good, stories dominated social media in 2015.

The feel-bad-first stories have the same arc: Ahmed Mohamed was taken to jail for building a clock; Tim Tai was shut out of a protest; and Sean OBrien was mocked for shimmying in public. All three were excluded in real life and then radically included on social media, going viral as a result. For Jim Cantore, the definition of a feel good story, excitement about thundersnow proved contagious.

And then there are oddball outliers, like Emo Kylo Ren  heir to the viral throne of @DepressedDarth.

Do people who go viral for different reasons go viral in the same way? Will any of the 2015 viral sensations last, or are their fifteen minutes of fame collectively over?

**Lessons for Marketers**

Following and retweeting Ahmed, Sean, and Tim was a satisfying way for Twitter users jump on the right side of a hot button issue and showcase themselves doing it. The heartwarming nature of the turn of events for the three sensations  from cruel to overwhelmingly positive  drew in users, if only briefly.

Now, all three are experiencing a decline in followers. On average, every week Ahmed loses 1,026 followers, Sean loses 500 followers, and Tim loses 44 followers. The three cannot recreate the moments that made them famous: their exclusion and subsequent floods of support online by their nature can really only be one-offs.

Can anyone go viral in the same way? If liking you can make people feel part of something that says faith in humanity restored, the answer is yes. The feeling of satisfaction that comes from rushing to the rescue of a person wronged is likely what drove people to follow Sean, Ahmed, and Tim on Twitter. Giving social media users the opportunity to feel like upstanding human beings  when its as easy for them as a trackpad tap  is obviously a key ingredient in virality. Have you guys tried this as a marketing strategy, ever? 

Not everyones viral fame is fading fast: Jim Cantore gains an average of 923.75 followers each week. Emo Kylo Ren is growing exponentially, with 124,002 new followers last week alone. 

Perhaps Jim and Kylo are staying viral because they are able to continue delivering the thing that made them viral in the first place. Jims excited weather videos and Kylos sardonic jokes, like Alex from Targets candid snaps, made them famous and are keeping them famous. </TEXT>

**Disaster 1: Blackberry**

When you think of social media, you might not think of Blackberry, partly because of a gaffe earlier this year. The tech giant was slow to integrate touch screens and cameras, putting itself behind other mobile devices in ease of use for Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. And whats the point of a smartphone if you cant use it to talk to your friends?

Even RIM employees find tweeting with a Blackberry next to impossible. Or, thats the message the company very publicly sent when they tweeted about their integration with Twitter using an iPhone. Whoops.

**Disaster 2: Cloroxs Emoji Racism**

Terrible things happen when brands embroil themselves American racial tensions, whether inadvertently or on purpose. When Apple released a more diverse set of emoji on April 8, Clorox responded with a tweet interpreted as a call for emoji genocide: "new emojis are great but wheres the bleach".

After realizing that the attempt at humour failed miserably, the grovelling began.

**Disaster 3: Bics Think Like a Man**

International Womens Day. A time to celebrate women, or a time to sell stuff? Bic chose to celebrate women by sharing an inspirational quote on its South Africa Facebook page. If only that quote were actually inspirational.

It read: Look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man, work like a boss. Ruh roh. 

After the pens for women debacle, the brand was on thin ice with the girl/lady sex. Telling women to look like girls and think like men (the best of both worlds?) did not go over well. Bic quickly posted an apology on its Facebook page. Apologizing quickly and sincerely is a good strategy, but it had one major pitfall for Bic: users were still angry. Overall, stories created per post declined for the brands Facebook page as women turned away from the brand.

Bic South Africa also posted less as their stories created continued to dwindle. Who would want their friends to catch them liking Bic, which branded itself as outdated and sexist with the womens day post?

**Disaster 4: Houston Rockets Dead Horse**

Heckling the fans of an opposing team is pretty common in the stadium, but it doesnt play as well on Twitter. During a heated game, the Houston Rockets tweeted a horse emoji being shot at the Dallas Mavericks (mascot: horse). As demonstrated by Clorox fiasco, people take emoji jokes very seriously. Tweets criticizing the emoji threat poured in, forcing the teams social media team to apologize.

Some deemed the Rockets apology unnecessary  the joke didnt touch on any hot button issues or target specific groups  but its sincerity, apparently, was appreciated. After April 29, engagement soared. May was a great month, but the brand shifted strategies in June when it ousted the manager responsible for the dead horse tweet. Favourites, retweets, replies, and mentions flatlined.

**Disaster 5: Starbucks Race Together**

In March 2015, Starbucks decided to jump into the debate on race in the US. It attached Race Together stickers to cups, launched a #RaceTogether hashtag, and handed out questionnaires asking customers how many black friends they had. What could go wrong?

Instagram followers had a few problems with the initiative from @StarbucksPartners. The company was jumping into something totally unrelated to its brand, and its lack of diversity in some locations seemed to make the chain a poor choice for the debate.Some critics noted how tightly coffee and the history of slavery were intertwined. The Race Together campaign read as a tone deaf PR campaign exploiting racial tensions to sell coffee.
Despite the criticism, Starbucks didnt back down.

Can a big brand participate in a conversation about a sensitive topic like race? Starbucks Partners account has enjoyed consistently high engagement on Instagram in 2015 at an average of 1,713 likes or comments from users per day, but its average went down to 1,613 from April to August after the campaign. As with the other 2015 blunders, followers stepped away from the brand on social media.

**Disaster 6: SeaWorlds #AskSeaWorld**

Since the documentary Blackfish was widely distributed on Netflix, SeaWorld has had a rough time. In March  was their a collective gas leak for social media teams in spring 2015?  the company opened itself up to complaints with an #AskSeaWorld hashtag.

The crisis might have taught SeaWorld to stay quiet, but the brand didnt apologize. An apology without a change in its policies would have likely sparked more outraged, as Bic experienced on Facebook.
Instead, after #AskSeaWorld, the brand has used Twitter to fight allegations stemming from Blackfish, gaining retweets along with angry comments. After Harry Styles called out @SeaWorld for its conditions, the companys response attracted 4,932 retweets and 5,516 favourites, more than @SeaWorlds monthly average. Its follower growth has been steady, indicating that as Blackfish and the #AskSeaWorld bungle fades, theres some hope that the deluge of irate comments might let up.

	<TEXT> Hi all! Wrote a case study of how the biggest movie of all time (or soon to be biggest movie of all time) played out on social media. I think marketers can learn a lot from The Force Awakens' social media fails and triumphs over the past year. 

If you don't like puns or cringe-worthy movie references, do not read this piece. 

Full case study here: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/going-viral-what-star-wars-did-to-its-new-stars-on-social-media-4507183fe20d#.moqghnnos

**Before the Premiere**

Before the premiere, Daisys Instagram account had reached 200,000 followers and Boyega had attracted 226,000 followers on Twitter. Judging Boyegas account by its size, however, can be misleading; John had an anemic .1 replies per tweet. Boyegas pre-premiere engagement was low relative to his large following.

Daisy, an amateur Instagrammer, fared far better than Boyega before the premiere at an average of 571 comments per post to Johns .1 Twitter replies. Ridley also pulled ahead on Facebook. In December, her Facebook page had a 72% engagement rate (15,072 likes, comments, or shares per post) to Johns 56% rate (7,573 engagements per post).

**After the Premiere**

There was a huge awakening for the stars after the premiere and they felt it on social media. As shown in the visualization below, created in Crowdbabble, Daisy Ridleys engagement spiked on Instagram after opening night (see link).

After the premiere, engagement soared for Boyega: he now attracts .5 replies per tweet and 38% of his posts are shared more than 100 times, up from 30%. Boyega engaged with his social media following with a fun video of him surprising fans, which he tweeted and shared on Facebook. It became his most-liked tweet and Facebook post ever.

Boyega and Ridleys candid posts  like the poorly lit, handheld smartphone video above  are their most successful. The polished movie-star mask? Boyega and Ridleys followers say they dont need it.

Social media is strongest with Ridley: her Instagram following outpaces Boyegas on Twitter by 617,000. The two stars are still learners, but its clear that theyre beginning to master Twitter and Instagram. 

**Facebook Fails**

Growth on Facebook was much slower. In December  when fans were willing to like everything they posted  Ridley and Boyega shared just 10 and 12 updates respectively. As shown below, in a graph made using Crowdbabble, Ridley didnt share anything on her public Facebook page in the critical days after the premiere (see link).

Similarly, Boyega shared nothing on Facebook for six days post-premiere. Thats not how social media works! Ridley and Boyega now boast about 310,000 and 146,000 Facebook likes respectively, but for stars in the biggest movie of all time, the numbers could be higher. The first order of business the week after the premiere should have been to post every day on all platforms, to turn the hype into a lasting following.

**Conclusion**

Ridley and Boyega  and the franchise as a whole  were only partially successful on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram. On social media, there is no try: engagement suffers when posts are infrequent and half-hearted. This seems to be a lesson that the dark side (like Emo Kylo Ren, @KyloR3n) has learned, but the light side has not. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all! Impressions are a very important metric for social media marketers, so I thought I'd post the definition below. Impressions are the broadest measure of engagement on Facebook. 

Definition: Impressions is the total number of times activity related to your Page is seen by people on Facebook, whether they see it organically, virally or via a paid advertisement.

**Impressions vs Reach**

Impressions and Reach (People Reached) are related but slightly different.

Lets say somebody on Facebook sees your post three times in their news feed during the day. You have basically received 3 impressions on your post, but the reach is just 1 person.

Reach measures unique people. Impressions does not measure unique people, but rather the total number of times your activity is seen.

**The 3 Components of Impressions**

Impressions can be broken down into the following 3 components:

**Organic Impressions:** The number of times people saw activity related to your Page directly from your Page.

**Paid Impressions:** The number of times people saw activity related to your Page via a paid Facebook ad.

**Viral Impressions:** The number of times people saw activity related to your Page via a story published by a friend. For instance, if someone likes, comments or shares something on your page, their friends might see a story about your page virally.

	<DATE> 2015-12-17 22:57:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Social media can take up way too much time for entrepreneurs, if they're not careful. Careful scheduled posting can help you focus on your core business and not get bogged down sharing content on different platforms. Below, a primer on two services: 


**Hootsuite**
The Hootsuite platform is a versatile service to help with social posting. Hootsuite is a dashboard that aims to make it easier to engage, publish (with schedules), provide analytics, create social media marketing campaigns, and overall social media channel management. Hootsuite has built in integrations across the platform. The platform typically caters to marketers who use Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn,Google+, Foursquare, MySpace, WordPress, TrendSpottr and Mixi.

One of the best features of Hootsuite is scheduled publishing. You can schedule a whole assortment of posts to take place automatically. It may require a few hours setting everything up, but during peak business hours, small business owners would have little to worry about when both content is being posted during business hours while the business is open, giving small business owners the attention to their customers both online and off. Hootsuite is a freemium service but has a premium plan for $10 a month.

**Buffer**
Butter is a dedicated social sharing platform. Buffers main feature is scheduled posts across all your social media channels. If your only issue is not having the time or remembering to post social content on a daily basis, Buffer might be your solution. Buffer has integrations across Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn.

We recommend using Buffer once a week to schedule your weekly posts. You can still post on all your social media when you are in the moment but Buffer is a great way to manage a social media campaign requiring multiple posts over a period of time.

Prices for individuals go as high as $10 per month and businesses can look at spending $50-$200 a month. A free trial option is available.

	<TEXT> Hi all! I thought the three definitions below might be useful. Once you've formed a social strategy as a small business, you'll be confronted with a lot of service options to make it happen. It helps to understand the three different categories of service, so you know what each option can do for you (Hootsuite vs Iconosquare vs Radian6, for example).

**Social Listening** is how you monitor your digital channels (customers, competitors, products) and come up with a strategy that can potentially influence new and existing customers. Services like Mention are a great way to listen about what people are saying about your business, products, related opinions, the market and your local economy.

**Social Posting** is the act of posting content and updates about your business. This may also include replying to other users who interact with you over social media. Social media services often have apps directly available on the phone to help you post relevant and recent content. However, services like Hootsuite and Buffer allow you to post content that can be shared at a later time, allowing you to strategically plan (and execute) your content over the campaign.

**Social Analytics** is the raw data and insights about your social media. Services like Crowdbabble mine this data for you to provide you an in-depth analysis of your brand on social media, how your customers are engagement with your content and the growth of your followers.

	<TITLE> Crisis Management 101: What can we learn from IBM's #HackAHairdryer Twitter fail? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-14 19:51:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> IBM recently had an epic social media fail: trying to attract women to tech with a #HackAHairdryer hashtag on Twitter, calling for submissions to a hairdryer-themed (FOR WOMEN) hackathon. This did not go over well. 

**Impact on IBM:**

In the month before the crisis, IBM averaged 147.7 favourites, replies, or retweets per tweet. According to Crowdbabble, engagement was low at just 5.8% (a fraction of 263,606 followers engaged with IBMs tweets). Below, a visualization of total favourites, retweets, replies, and mentions from November 5 to December 5 2015.

For the first ten days of December for the year prior, the statistics are similar: 3.2 tweets per day, with 88.5 engagements per tweet. @IBM was growing, albeit slowly.

Then, #HackAHairdryer happened and things got hairy for the brand. On December 6, engagement went through the floor.

Engagement rose the next day as people reacted to IBMs apology. For the first half of December, #HackaHairdryer pulled the engagement rate down to 2.3%  even more dire than the previous average of 5.8%.

The #HackAHairdryer discussion on Twitter detached from IBMs handle, perhaps mercifully, as women in tech used it to vent all grievances relating to misogyny in tech. This negative attention grew exponentially when a much larger group  everyone who did not want to be viewed as anti-women  jumped on board to condemn the campaign and distance themselves from the brand.
Mentions of @IBM were low before the campaign but have stayed uncharacteristically low since the fatal tweet.

**How Not To Be IBM:**

On social media, intent is irrelevant. IBMs effort towards being woman-friendly did not come through in the execution (or conception, or any part) of #HackAHairdryer. What IBM was trying to do didnt matter. The companys lets just paint it pink approach revealed hair-raising misperceptions about women that were more deeply rooted than its hot air about including them. 

Twitter users rush to condemn offensive tweets, so as to not appear to condone them. If criticizing a brand becomes an Im not terrible bandwagon on social media, the brand should act as quickly as IBM did to destroy all the evidence (tweet, website) and apologize. Online, erasing the evidence is impossible, but it has become shorthand for a sincere apology and admittance of wrongdoing.

Brands should check their campaigns for crisis potential before launch by asking: what could prevent our target group from participating? Is there a downside for them? Those simple questions could have helped IBM see that #HackAHairdryer was not a campaign, but a clever trap for both women and the brand. #HackAHairdryer not only sullied the companys reputation as a smart innovator, but made it impossible for women to participate without casting themselves as trifling girly-girls.

**Full article:** https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-ibm-s-hackahairdryer-overheats-db3e190f39fe#.c0rl5ydgt

TL;DR: Do some social media research and ask yourself if there's a downside of a campaign for your followers before launch. And, maybe run the campaign by some of the people it's targeted at before sharing it with your big Twitter user base.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys! Thank you for your positive response to my last post, Facebook Analytics 101: Like Sources. I'm glad that was useful. 

Today, I thought I'd post about how to calculate your Facebook page's virality. This relies on understanding the people are talking about metric (not to be confused with stories created), as well as people reached. I found a basic equation that seems pretty accurate for figuring out how viral your page is, which is a very useful metric to track (for yourself and higher ups, if you're a social media manager).

Lets say that yesterday 500 people saw activity related to your Facebook Page, and 25 of these people created a new story. Then:

**PTAT = 25**

**People Reached = 500**

**Virality of your Page = 25/500 = 5%**

Out of all the people who saw activity about your Page (whether it was in the news feed, as a paid Ad or anywhere else), 5% of these people extended the reach of your Page to their friends by creating a new story.

Therefore, the Virality of your Page yesterday was 5%.

Tracking your virality will help you better assess what works and what doesn't on your page. Here's the full post: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/facebook-analytics-101-page-virality/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Measuring Facebook page likes isn't the only thing page managers should be doing to boost their reach on the platform. To figure out how to increase your page likes, you have to know where they came from. How do you guys track your Like sources? Do you use a specific analytics platform, or do you dig into the API yourself? 

I've tried to make an exhaustive list. Here's all the different like sources you can isolate for your pages using the Facebook API: 

 * **page_suggestion** People who liked your Page through an invite from an admin
 * **timeline** People who liked your Page from the Likes section of their own Timeline or someone else's
 * **ads**	People who clicked 'Like' in an Ad or Sponsored Story pointing to your Page
 * **registration**	People you added to your Page as admins
 * **mobile**	People who liked your Page from a mobile device
 * **wizard-suggestion**	People who liked your Page in the New User Wizard when registering for Facebook
 * **profile-connect**	People who liked your Page on the Page itself or in a News Feed or ticker story
 * **external-connect**	People who liked your Page from an external site using a Facebook social plugin
 * **recommended-pages**	People who liked your Page from a Recommended Pages unit on the right column of Facebook
 * **favourites**	Other Pages that have liked your Page
 * **api**	People who liked your Page through an app developed by a third party
 * **page-browser**	People who liked your Page using Facebook's Page Browser
 * **hovercard**	People who liked your Page from the popup window they get when they hover over a link that leads to your Page
 * **search**	People who liked your Page from their search results
 * **page-profile**	People who liked your Page on the Page itself
 * **ticker**	People who liked your Page from a story they saw about it in ticker
 * **like-story**	People who liked your Page from a story they saw about a friend liking it

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm doing a series of case studies on viral sensations, to see what marketers can learn from them. Below is my analysis of the #alexfromtarget phenomenon -- from the week the teen went viral, to his social media strategy now. I was surprised by the platforms that were currently succeeding for Alex, given that a photo made him famous.


Last November, when teen Twitter set its eyes on Target cashier Alex Lee, the attention could have flickered out almost immediately. Now, with more than 3.9 million followers on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram combined, Alex has stretched his 15 minutes into a very big year. How did Alex from Target go viral? And how did he turn his 15 minutes into a lucrative, long-lasting, and massive following? We used Crowdbabbles social media analytics tools to find out.


Alex was an unlikely viral sensationor might have been considered an unlikely subject for fame before social media. The teenager, whom Gawker described as a babyfaced angel, joined Twitter in September 2014. He used the platform to joke with his friends, complain about his parents, and mostly retweet anything fleek.

Crowdbabbles engagement analysis tells us that before he went viral, Alex tweeted around twice per day and receiving two to three favourites, retweets, or replies per tweet. Then, on November 2, a teen snapped a picture of Alex working at a Target checkout counter in Texas and uploaded it to Twitter (caption: YOOOOOOOOOOOOOO).

On Twitter, thousands of tweets about the unassuming cashier flooded @AlexLeeWorld (then @ac163). It was the Twitter equivalent of thousands of preteens and young women screaming for their favourite singer at a concertno tickets required.
As the viral sensation unfolded online, teens gleefully mashed up images of Alex with other phenomenons to create new memes: #alexfromtarget + The Fault In Our Stars spawned new viral tweets, including i fell in love with the way he bagged my groceries slowly then all at once #alexfromtarget. Alex Lee was the prom king of Twitter.

When #alexfromtarget became a trending topic, news outlets picked up the story and @alexleeworld gained 300,000 new followers overnight. Like student photojournalist Tim Tai, Alexs virality touched the zeitgeist. Alex from Target became a public figure news outlets could use to discuss Internet fame and teen social media habits.

	<TEXT> Hi, innovators! I thought I'd start a discussion around innovation at large companies, as opposed to start ups or R D-focused organizations. I think that staying innovative as a larger business can be a lot harder than if you're solo or part of a small team. 

Does anyone here struggle to keep their department or work innovative within a larger bureaucracy? What helps you foster innovation in that environment? 

I just finished editing a new book called Reinventing Dell, which is focused on how company culture can impact innovation. It's a good case study of how the capacity to create disruptive innovations died at Dell as it grew, and is now slowly being rebuilt.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This month, I've started a series on social media analytics for accounts that go viral that will hopefully provide some lessons for brands. I looked at Tim Tai, the student photojournalist who became at the center of a national news story, and what happened to him on Twitter as a result. I wanted to answer the question: What does a real viral sensation look like? How does it unfold? What can content marketers learn from a real example? 

On November 7th of this year, Tim Tai was turned away from a protest at University of Missouri and a video captured the incident. Before the video was uploaded, Tim was gaining speed on Twitter as he complained about losing his rights as a member of the press and got dozens of retweets from other journalists. When the video was uploaded to YouTube and shared on Twitter, Tim gained thousands of followers overnight.

Basically, Tim did not attempt to capitalize on or take advantage of his newfound spotlight -- and this only drew more followers to him. On Twitter he fully supported how other journalists viewed him, as an unbiased reporter wrongfully turned away from a protest. 

You guys can read the full story here -- I try to break down how he went viral: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/going-viral-how-did-tim-tai-s-twitter-account-actually-blow-up-6a17c9276a12#.3dtequpcz

	<TITLE> Audi's failed approach to content marketing: why did Facebook fans turn away from a series that spotlighted drivers instead of cars? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-11-12 18:03:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This month, I've been investigating the long-term repercussions on social media and content marketing fails for brands with a series of case studies. My latest piece is on Audi's #PaidMyDues campaign, a video series that spotlighted drivers rather than cars. It was a content marketing effort with little short films made about different drivers. Everyone hated it -- the harshest reaction was on Instagram and Facebook.

You can check out the case study here: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-when-doing-something-different-backfires-efda5bd1dce7

It seems that since Audi had a tried-and-true approach (car-focused posts that always did well), it could fall back to that after the crisis and continue to grow without many repercussions. Without that stream of content guaranteed to do well, the brand really would have floundered.

For me, the #PaidMyDues campaign could only happen because Audi had already found a set of content (the car posts) that worked so well, that would get a consistent stream of engagement. Basically, when brands have found content that works, that's when they have the freedom to abandon that approach and do something different. When they're already failing, experimentation is the most dangerous. Do you guys agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This month, I've been investigating the long-term repercussions on social media fails for brands with a series of case studies. My latest piece is on Audi's #PaidMyDues campaign, which spotlighted drivers rather than cars. This was a big departure from Audi's usual approach: photos of slick cars. Everyone hated the new campaign -- the harshest reaction was on Instagram and Facebook.

You can check out the case study here: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-when-doing-something-different-backfires-efda5bd1dce7

It seems that since Audi had a tried-and-true approach, it could fall back to that after the crisis and continue to grow without  many repercussions. Without that stream of content guaranteed to do well, the brand really would have floundered. 

For me, the #PaidMyDues campaign could only happen because Audi had already found an approach that worked so well. Basically, when brands have found something that works, that's when they have the freedom to abandon that approach and do something different. When they're already failing, experimentation is the most dangerous. Do you guys agree? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys! I'm researching social media crisis strategies this month, and have come across a variety. The most interesting, to me, is when a brand chooses to do nothing. Absolutely nothing. 

Telecomm and tech companies, I've found, use the 'no comment' approach if users already use their social media channels for tech support or just to complain.

Do you guys find that your Facebook and Twitter page are being co-opted as customer service helplines? If so, what industry are you in? 

Here's a summary of how Bell Mobility was affected by a fake review scandal, which was publicized on social media: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-did-writing-fake-reviews-help-or-hurt-bell-mobility-202bea441201

Basically, the company did nothing even though ti was found guilty of faking product reviews. Employees had written the reviews and a journalist sniffed them out. Bell was subsequently fined $1.25 million by the Canadian Business Bureau. Do you guys agree with the silent strategy they employed? Have you ever written any fake reviews?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Last year, Bell Mobility was caught writing fake reviews for one of its apps. Turns out that having employees pose as real customers is illegal in Canada and the company has since been fined $1.25 million.

Scott Stratten broke the story and shared it on Twitter. It was picked up by the CBC and went viral on social media. I looked into Bell's analytics to see how its brands were affected: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/crisis-management-101-did-writing-fake-reviews-help-or-hurt-bell-mobility/

I was very surprised to see how it affected them on Facebook and Twitter. Their strategy for dealing with the scandal on the two platforms was also interesting -- they ignored it completely. 

How would you guys have dealt with a big story like that breaking about your brand? Do you agree with Bell's strategy?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been trying to figure out how to measure additional sharing beyond the first share by a brand on Facebook, Twitter, or other social platforms. For example, if I share a link on Facebook and someone texts that link to their roommate and the roommate clicks, I need that info. Seeing the pathways of social sharing is key for me. 

I've figured out a way to measure hidden social media traffic using traceable URLs and by painstakingly setting up Google Analytics to track it: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/the-dark-side-how-to-use-google-analytics-to-measure-and-estimate-your-social-media-roi-by-leveraging-dark-social-activity/

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Up until last week, I had no way of tracking how users shared my content beyond the first step on social media. I could track clicks on links from Twitter and Facebook, but if a user shared a link and that new link generated new traffic (for example), I had no way of capturing that pathway. If I shared the new Star Wars trailer on Facebook, I could track the traffic that generated. If someone I knew texted or tweeted or Facebooked that link to a friend and the friend clicked on it, I would have no way of tracking that traffic.

I've figured out a method for how to do that here, but it's a bit complicated: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/the-dark-side-how-to-use-google-analytics-to-measure-and-estimate-your-social-media-roi-by-leveraging-dark-social-activity/

Do you guys use specific tools to capture interactions on social media beyond the first one? What do you do with the info once you find it?

I'm wondering if there's a more streamlined way than the one I've come up with.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Assessing the impact of a social media crisis on a brand is tough, but I tried to measure it via changes in engagement. Here's what a cheesy tweet did to DiGiorno. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-27 20:39:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last year, DiGiorno committed a big social media faux pas by co-opting a trending topic for domestic abuse survivors to sell pizza. The #whyIstayed tweet went viral and it was picked up by major news outlets as an epic social media fail before DiGiorno could act. I wanted to know how the brand was affected in a quantifiable way and did some digging. 

I tried to assess how the crisis and the brand's strategy to deal with it impacted DiGiorno in the long run via engagement statistics on social media: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/crisis-management-101-how-did-digiorno-bounce-back-from-a-cheesy-tweet-e384a8c0839f#.mzjp10c6p

	<TEXT> I'm writing a series on how big brands bounce back (or don't) after very public social media marketing fiascos. For Smuckers, the initial boost in likes on their Facebook page after the scandal made the rounds in the media seemed positive -- but overall, deeper forms of engagement were down. There are not one, but eight jam/jelly puns in the piece, which I'm quite proud of.

You can read the post here: https://medium.com/@crowdbabble/social-media-crisis-management-101-how-smuckers-facebook-scandal-may-have-helped-its-brand-8b06eecda45b

Has anyone here made a very public mistake in their content marketing? Did it help or hurt your brand in the long run? My feeling is that for brands with smaller followings, a mistake can be fatal, especially if it doesn't lead to publicity that could help boost likes and smooth things over. If your initial user base leaves and there isn't enough publicity to attract a new one, I'm guessing that you're screwed.

I'm working on a second piece now, about DiGiornio's #whyIstayed domestic violence / pizza promotion tweet. If you guys have any ideas for other brand crises on social media that you'd like me to delve into, let me know! Taking suggestions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there! Many of you probably already know how to do this, but I recently came across a blog post with the code for embedding a hidden Pinterest image. http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/boost-traffic-by-hiding-pinterest-ready-images-in-your-site/

Many very successful bloggers do this, like Dale Partridge. All of his images are 100% width, fitting the look of his site, and he hides the narrow Pinterest-ready images so that only those with a Pin It button can see them. Clever. 

Since Pinterest drives more web traffic than Twitter and Reddit, I thought this was a useful hack for bloggers.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys! My site is trying to attract a demographic that's a good fit on Pinterest, so we just figured out this trick for embedding hidden images in blog posts that do well on Pinterest. Before we started doing this, when you clicked on the "Pin it" browser button (most often used by pinners), a sad selection came up. 

I kept noticing all of these Dale Partridge blog posts pop up on the Pinterest popular feed. You've probably seen these posts - total clickbait - sharp images with stylish fonts, and headlines like: "How I made 25 million before I turned 30" and "4 signs you're meant to change the world." 

These images don't actually appear on any of Partridge's posts, though. When you click through to his content marketing, they don't show. He keeps the design integrity of his site and hides code for his Pinterest-ready images (narrow, tall) in the site's back end. Here's the code snippet you have to embed: http://www.crowdbabble.com/blog/boost-traffic-by-hiding-pinterest-ready-images-in-your-site/

Since Pinterest apparently drives more traffic than Twitter, this is a good trick to learn if you cater to suburban/rural women or women with families.  </TEXT>
