	<TEXT> Marinate the chicken wings in whatever you like but I went with onion powder, garlic powder, soy sauce and salt. Then coat with some corn starch and a little oil. I used the air fryer (360 for 15 minutes) but you could shallow fry as well till it's crisp enough for you.  The sauce is fresh minced garlic, scallions, and jalapeos toasted in oil. Toss sauce together with wings and add more salt and pepper.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I seriously love my air fryer! It works really well for things that have light dryer coatings. It does take up a lot of space but it's worth it.  </TEXT>
