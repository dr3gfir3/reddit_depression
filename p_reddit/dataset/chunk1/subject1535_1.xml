	<TEXT> I wonder if Catriona might be involved with bringing Vanessa back in some way? Especially since the Mummy has just been brought back and Dracula is still out there too?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I might be wrong but wouldn't Tony's friendship with Hannah have warranted him a positive mention on the tapes, kind of like Clay? (Especially since she clearly trusted him enough to leave the tapes with him?) Or did Clay got a mention because she had a crush on him and felt bad that her experience with Justin had caused this rift between them?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it's such a surprise because we're all so focused on what Clay is going through and what the next reason that we don't notice that Jeff is ONLY present in the flashbacks. Which is a pretty good twist, but also a little out of nowhere because at no point do the parents or teachers inquire about how the students might be doing after a SECOND classmate has died within a few weeks.  </TEXT>
