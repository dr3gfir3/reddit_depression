	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In May of 1986, there was a massive one-time coast-to-coast fundraising event in the USA, for the benefit of the hungry, homeless, and poor. Over six million people participated, although the event was somewhat controversial for some of its omissions. Here are some lyrics from the theme song from that event: "...across this land I love, divided we fall, united we stand..."

	<TITLE> iPad (first generation, 32GB, WiFi + 3G) battery replacement saga, part three (conclusion) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-05 00:36:16 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Part one is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2ni95o/ipad_first_generation_32gb_wifi_3g_battery/)  [Part two is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2o71e4/ipad_first_generation_32gb_wifi_3g_battery/)

I was pleasantly surprised by a call from the Apple Store today to let me know that the replacement iPad had arrived just one day after the service call.  I went in with my old iPad.  The Apple Store technicians restored the replacement iPad to its factory settings (which might have been redundant), moved the SIM card from the old iPad to the replacement iPad, and got me started on restoring from my iCloud backup.  Once the iPad moved to the final stage of restoring -- namely, re-downloading my purchases -- I went back to the office and let it finish there.  All seems to be well so far; I've only had to re-enter some WiFi passwords.  I'm typing on the replacement iPad now.

My use cases and financial situation do indeed make it worthwhile for me to spend $99 on a battery replacement in a first-generation iPad.  Thanks for all the support, especially from /u/Hrhnick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Part one is here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/ipad/comments/2ni95o/ipad_first_generation_32gb_wifi_3g_battery/)

Because of the comment from /u/Hrhnick in that thread, I went back to the Apple Store for battery replacement again.  **They again tried to charge me $249!**  But thanks to /u/Hrhnick, I was armed with [this link to Apple's website](https://www.apple.com/support/ipad/repair/battery-power/), showing that it should be only $99 ([this link may also be useful](http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=servicefaq geo=United_States product=ipad)).  The Genius Bar employee went to discuss my contention with other employees and finally came back, agreeing that it should be $99.

The replacement iPad should arrive in five to ten business days, and I'll update then.  Of note is that I have performed an iCloud backup of my iPad, for obvious reasons.  I have also turned off "Find My iPad" based on directions I received from Apple in the process of setting up my Genius Bar appointment. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My four-year-old first-generation iPad (32GB, WiFi + 3G, received as a gift) has been having severe battery issues recently, and the Apple diagnostics agreed with me that it needed a battery replacement.  I made a Genius Bar appointment and took it in to the Apple Store only to find that they wanted $249 for the privilege!  I'd get an entire identical reconditioned first-generation iPad for my trouble, but what's the point of that?

I have a lead on a possible third-party repair shop that will replace the battery much more cheaply -- will update as the saga continues. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-11-19 15:06:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last night I went to a restaurant to get carryout food for dinner.  This was the first time that I had eaten this particular dish, and it was delicious.  This dish is associated with one specific country of origin: guess the country for 500 bits.

In each round, one guess per person.  Along with your guess, please submit a question that you'd like me to answer to give everyone a hint for the next round.  Each question I choose gets a bonus of 100 bits.

Round 1 begins with no hints... now!

Edit: Round 2 begins with the hint that the country is **not** in Asia... now!

Edit: Round 3 begins with the first ingredient hint for the dish -- egg -- now!

Edit: Here's another ingredient hint -- chicken.  Let's hope for the next hint to be about the country itself.  Round 4 begins now!

Edit: We've found out that it's a Northern Hemisphere country; let's hope to learn more about it in Round 5, which begins now!

Edit: We've found out that the country is **not** in Europe -- Round 6 begins now!

Edit: The country is a democracy, on to Round 7!

Edit: The country is "little", that is, it is **not** one of the largest 90 countries in the world by area; on to Round 8!

Edit: We've learned that, in addition to chicken and egg, an ingredient of the dish was a large, thick wheat-flour pancake -- on to Round 9!

Edit: We've learned that one color of the country's flag is a shade of blue -- on to Round 10!

Edit: We've learned that there is only one other color on the country's flag -- on to Round 11!

Edit: Finally, in Round 11, /u/va243 successfully guessed Honduras.  The dish was [baleadas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baleada), large, thick wheat-flour tortillas filled with mashed fried beans -- and, in this particular case, chicken, egg, avocado, and crumbled cheese. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Two reasons for this thread:

* I had a tip not go through, with the message "Tip Delivery Bug" on ChangeTip.com; on mouseover, the pop-up "There was a problem on our side delivering the tip" appeared.  Your website might automatically report these to you, but in case it doesn't, I wanted you to know.

* The error message should tell me whether I need to re-tip or not to get the tip to go through.  I did re-tip (and if the tippee gets two tips, I'll live), but doing that was just an educated guess on my part.  Edited to add: It turns out that I didn't need to re-tip, so the tippee indeed got two tips. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Here are my two personal problems with Bitcoin.  

* I'm lazy, so I don't want to go through a lot of work to manage my own Bitcoin holdings personally.  

* Even though I have a lot of faith in people in general, I'm slow to trust in, well, the trustworthiness of every single necessary person involved in managing my Bitcoin holdings for me.  For liquid holdings in U.S. dollars, I don't have to trust anyone except the FDIC and the NCUA.  ChangeTip is great, and I have no reason to think that they represent anything other than the best of humanity, but I'd still be a little leery of storing large quantities there.  

I'm not sure if other people have the same problems, but for people who are interested in overcoming barriers to Bitcoin adoption, this is one example of the barriers Bitcoin faces. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 400 bits to the first person with a top-level comment, 300 to the second, 200 to the third, 100 to the fourth.  Sorry, nothing to the fifth.  (In a perfect world, the sixth person would tip *me* 100 bits, then 200 and so forth... heh.)

Yes, as per rules of this subreddit, you must have flair to qualify. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 50 bits to the first top-level comment, 40 bits to the second, 30 bits to the third, 20 bits to the fourth, 10 bits to the fifth.  A bit, in this context, is one-millionth of a Bitcoin.  0 bits to the sixth top-level comment, sorry.  (Seventh top-level comment ought to tip me 10 bits, eighth ought to tip me 20 bits, ... heh.)

Edit: Mini-giveaway is over, sorry! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Research for me: who suggested that you only need to say the Pledge of Allegiance once? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Somewhere on the Internet within the last couple of months -- could have been reddit, Slashdot, or elsewhere -- someone made the following point.  If you pledge allegiance to the flag of the USA once, you shouldn't ever need to do so again, because your pledge is still in effect.  Yet many schoolchildren in the USA -- including myself, way back when -- recite the Pledge of Allegiance every week or even every day.

I can't find the place where I first read this idea; if you find it, then I'll tip you 500 bits.  If you find another place where this idea was mentioned (before the creation of this thread), but it doesn't happen to be the first place I read it, then I'll tip you 100 bits (maximum of five such tips, and doesn't apply after someone claims the 500 bits). </TEXT>
