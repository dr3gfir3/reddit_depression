	<TEXT> I'm proud of you for recognizing that you need help.  There is no shame in needing help.

My aunt never felt quite right until she started taking the correct meds, and now she says she's never felt better.  She wished she knew it was possible to feel like she does now.

Mystery mama, I really do wish you all the best, and I hope some day you post again and say that you've turned things around 110% - because you are strong enough to do it.  I already know that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is often a frequent lucid dream of mine, and it's a signal to me that it's a dream.  For example, I will be in my parents' kitchen, but the colours and dcor is off.  At this point I start looking all around the house, outside, at what was my old room to look at the clothes, I even look in the mirror to see myself.  Some of the alternate worlds are quite sad (my brother died at age 18 in one, for example) but some of them are interesting (my house was literally on the beach and I could see the ocean from my window.)

I've heard some people think you can travel to parallel universes in dreams, so who knows?  That's why once I realize what I'm doing, I try to explore and look around and see what's different. </TEXT>

Zipping up my coat and unfurling my umbrella as I headed out the front door, I breathed a sigh of relief.  I just got off work for the day, and it was a tough one.  Being an EMT can be extremely rewarding and extremely draining.  Most of the time Im lucky enough to get to where I need to be in time and save the day, so to speak, but of course other times Im not so fortunate.  Those are the hard days.  Today was one of those days.

My last call of the day was to a car accident involving a blue SUV and a black sports car.  The cars driver left the scene pretty banged up, but at least he was alive.  The woman in the SUV was not so lucky.  I remembered glancing at the forlorn carseat buckled in the backseat of her vehicle.  At least she didnt have the kid with her.  Idont like to think about that.  Those are the days that I open up the hard liquor.

My thoughts turned toward my own mother then.  Shes been gone now maybe 10 years.  A long time.  But I still miss her.  She died in my arms.  She was sick, so it wasnt unexpected, but I was little more than a teenager at the time.  I needed her then.  Days like these, I needed her now.

I made my way to my car, folded my umbrella down, and tossed it inside.  I got in and started the car up, turning the heat up to full blast.  I fished my new cell phone out of the glove box.  I kept it there so I didnt worry about it during my shifts.  After all, there was nobody who would really be calling me.  I lived alone, and I wasnt dating anyone.  So I was quite surprised to see that I had 2 missed calls and 1 voicemail.

I didnt bother to check the call logs.  I dialed right to the voicemail.  I hoped it was someone getting in touch with me about another job Id applied for a couple days ago.  I checked my mirrors and prepared to drive home when the voicemail finally went through.  My blood ran cold when I heard the voice.

Hi, Daisy.  I was thinking about you today.  Wondering how youve been so I thought Id call and check up on you.  I just wanted to say Im proud of you.  I dont know if Ive said that enough.  Ill call again, chirped my dead mothers voice.

I stopped in my tracks and tore the phone from my ear.  I pressed replay, wondering if Id have heard wrong.  No, that was definitely my moms voice.  I would know it anywhere.  I had longed to hear that sound more than any otherand yet now that my secret wish had come true, I was wishing Id never asked for this.

I checked the missed call log and saw that somehow the call had come from my moms cell phone number.  I stared at the entry: Missed call from Mom Cell :) Yes, my dead mothers cell phone number was still stored in my contacts.  I couldnt bring myself to delete it.  Hell, I couldnt bring myself to cancel her number.  I still paid the bill every month.  I kept her old phone in a drawer in my bedroom under my socks.  Funny how we hang onto the weirdest things, isnt it?

I decided to shrug it off.  Today had been awful enough.  It must have been some glitch; it must have been a voicemail that got lost in cyberspace or wherever cell phone voicemails come from and it had only now been delivered.  I didnt receive any more strange phone calls, and I put it out of my mind for a while.

*****
A few weeks later, things were going better.  I had actually met someone!  We had gone on 2 dates so far and we were getting along well.  Obviously too soon to tell, but I really felt good about this one.  And my partner and I were being recognized at work next month for our exemplary actions and response time.  I was especially proud of that because Id been trying for a promotion, and this would be a great example of how dedicated I am.  It was the kind of day I wish I could share with my mother.

Once again after work I pulled my cell phone from my glove box.  (Old habits die hard.)  And I saw 2 missed calls, 1 voicemail.  I assumed it was Greg calling to confirm our dinner plans for that night, so I glanced at the call log.  Imagine my surprise when I saw Moms Cell :) in the call log.  Twice!  Shaking, I dialed the voicemail.

Hi, Daisy!  I just wanted to tell you how proud I am of you!  Getting recognized at work.  Meeting that new boy.  I really like him.  He reminds me of your father.  I know you two will have a fine future together.  Ill call again, she sang, cheerful as ever.  As if she wasnt dead and buried in the ground and incapable of making this phone call.

I threw the phone down on the passenger side seat and decided to do a sanity check.  I drove home.  Though my drive was short, it gave me plenty of time to curse myself for falling victim to a possible scam.  P-Mobile seemed too good to be true.  All this unlimited data for so inexpensive.  I rolled me eyes.  Did I really think my dead mother was making calls from beyond the grave?

I got out of the car, stuffing my cell phone into my back pocket.  I let myself in and marched myself right up to my bedroom.  I pulled open my top drawer and searched under my socks for my moms old cell phone.  The familiar weight of her Nokia in my hand, I breathed a sigh of relief.  I studied it, saw that it was completely dead and uncharged and incapable of making any phone calls.  I was about to chalk it up to another extremely weird glitch when suddenly my cell phone started to vibrate.

I reached into my back pocket and checked the display screen.  Moms Cell :) was clearly displayed.  I glanced at her old, dead, uncharged cell phone in my other hand.  My finger hovered over the Accept Call Button.  I held my breath.  I had to know.  I hit accept.

*****

UPDATE.  Now that I've had some time to collect my thoughts, I just want to briefly mention what happened.  It was my mom, alright.  Sounded just the same as she did my entire life.  Asked the same "mom" questions.  Whenever I tried to ask how this was possible, she laughed and said that phones have existed forever, this isn't new technology.  When I asked her where she was, the call would kind of, I don't know....fuzz out.  When I asked her rather awkwardly if she remembered being sick, she paused and responded that yes, she remembered but she got better and moved away to a milder climate to help alleviate some lingering pain.  It was just...surreal.  We're supposed to talk again in a day or so.  I don't why; I can't explain it.  But my mom is somehow back... </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, this happened a long time ago.  I must have been at least 18, no older than 20.  (Am now 33; Reddit didn't exist back then, but now I am discovering so many awesome boards where I can post about things!!)

I was sleeping on my back in my bed in my parents' house where I lived, when I suddenly woke up from a deep, dreamless sleep.  I opened my eyes and a male, humanoid shadow seemed like it pushed itself up from *laying on top of me.*  It seemed surprised that I woke up, interrupting whatever it was doing.  It wasn't anything sexual; if anything it was, not sure how to describe it...like, "feeding" or "scanning me" I guess makes the most sense and I know both of those are sort of at odds with each other.  It swooped back at me in a rush and I fell back asleep instantly.  I woke up about 2 hours later than my normal wake-up time and I felt okay, just a little sluggish.  I never saw it again.

Um, what? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 6am comes and my Spawn wakes up crying b/c he's peed through his diaper.  My husband actually gets up to check on him and comes back to bed, telling me Spawn is soaked through.  Okay, did you change him?  Oh...no.  I really need another 30, can you deal with it?  (Am slightly annoyed, but I honestly don't mind b/c he has a much longer commute that I do.)  But I do need his help to hold Spawn while I change his soaked through bed sheets.  "Why don't you just put him back to sleep on the dry end?"  Okay, that made me mad, but I figured at 6am we're not fighting; I will address it later.

Back to sleep for another hour or so.  When.  "I don't have any clean socks."  Yes, you do.  They are in the bottom of the laundry basket.  I haven't had time to fold all of the laundry, so there are neat stacks of clothes on top.  Just take the stacks off and get your underwear/socks.  Apparently that's too hard to do, so he starts cursing.  And throwing the stacks on the bed, right on top of me so I have to wake up.  He knocks one of the stacks over which breaks the closet door.  At this point I'm struggling not to laugh in his face as he's throwing a temper tantrum.

He starts screaming that he has no clean shirts (he does; I had no idea the 5 or so remaining are too small for his fat ass) and why didn't I get them from the tailors?  (Uh well I didn't have extra money b/c your fucking asshole self hasn't paid any of my credit card THAT I BOUGHT YOUR ENTIRE FUCKING FAMILY'S CHRISTMAS GIFTS WITH) so there's that.

Now doors are slammed and he's purposely pounding up and down the stairs almost like he *wants* to wake up Spawn at this point.  I'm just kind of staring at him b/c if I say one word I will literally start laughing at him even though I'm furious.

Snatches his jacket up off the hook, slams out the door w/o saying goodbye.  Tears out of the driveway.  (I hope he crashes.)

I am cruising a hot wave of hate right now, and I honestly don't care if he sees this b/c I am just so fucking angry/annoyed and I can never put it into words, never DISCUSS it b/c he throws a tantrum like he's fucking 3.  Please give me reasons not to plot his murder.  x_X

UPDATE:  He called and apologized profusely...Said he wasn't really mad at me, just w/ some stuff he'd been thinking about with work, etc.  Still reserving the right to murder at a later date ;) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Cell Phone Service Is Fantastic </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-14 23:27:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My cell phone was not really holding a charge anymore, and my wifes camera took grainy photos.  We both seemed to have a lot of dropped calls for some reason, too.  I wanted to surprise my wife with a new phone with an amazing camera so she could take better pictures of our new infant daughter to post on FaceBook.

I researched several phones online, as well as several cell phone carriers, but unfortunately, I couldnt find anything we could afford.  I sighed, because I knew this phone would be everything to my wife, and honestly I needed it as well because I relied on my phone for work.  Im proud to say that I drive full time for Uber, and part time for Lyft.  It pays the bills, but there just isnt enough for any upgrades right now, especially with my wife out on maternity leave.  I let the thought of new phones fade into the background of my mind for a while.

A few weeks later, or maybe a few days(its really hard to tell, sleep deprivation will do that to you and you quickly learn all about that when you have a newborn) I happened to be awake at 3AM surfing the Internet.  It was my turn to take care of our daughter so that my wife could get a little bit of sleep herself.  I must have been dozing at my computer chair, because Im not sure how I managed to bump my speaker volume up to full.  I was startled awake suddenly to the sound of an excited ad  NEW CELL PHONES, GREAT PRICES!!  NEW SERVICE NOW IN YOUR AREA!

I looked blurrily at my computer screen as I fumbled to turn the volume down to a less-baby-waking level.  I glanced at my daughter, magically somehow still asleep in her Rock n Play, then back to the wildly flashing ad.  Thoughts of new phones for me and my wife bubbled to the surface, so I clicked on the ad and was brought to a pretty basic yet modern looking website for a cell phone company called P-Mobile.  I smirked a little, but I clicked around a little bit.

Turns out I would not only be able to afford two new Androids, but also a better data plan.  I almost thought this was too good to be true.  I may have been sleep deprived but I wasnt a complete fool.  I noted the physical address of a shop the next town over, and I decided Id drive over the next day and check it out for myself.

The next day I happened to pick up a quick fair that took me close to the new P-Mobile store, so after I dropped him off I headed there.  The front of the building was again simple, professional, and modern.  Inside was more of the same, and the salesperson helped me so efficiently, was so friendly and informed, that before I knew what had happened, hed switched me over to the new carrier and I was heading out the door with two brand new Androids.  He even promised wed never have any problems with dead zones again.  Well, my wife was definitely going to freak out when she heard this.

I surprised her the moment I came in the door and she was beyond happy.  She started taking pictures of our daughter immediately.  I was glad I could bring a smile to her face.

I sat down and started looking through the app store, downloading what Id need for work.  As I scrolled, I saw one Id never heard of before  [Life Is Beta](https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5pmu3w/my_strange_experiences_with_an_app_called_life_is/)  but it didnt sound like something Id be interested, so I just passed it by.  At that moment, our little daughter decided to awaken from her nap with a loud cry that could only mean she needed a new diaper.  I put the phone down and said that Id take care of her.  My wife smiled gratefully.

I took our daughter upstairs and prepared to change her when I discovered we only had one clean diaper left!  I changed her quickly and brought her back downstairs.  Honey, I have to go to the store for a minute to pick up more diapers.  Were all out.

Oh dont worry, Im actually about to head out anyway.  I need to pick up something for dinner, she responded.  I smiled and acquiesced, knowing that she valued time away from the house.  She slipped her coat on and headed out the door.

About 45 minutes later, my wife texted me.  Bad accident on Main Street.  Going to be delayed.  I love you xoxo.  I responded that it was no big deal, but to hurry as it was nearing my time for me to leave and drive for Uber.  I will really try to be home for you, she replied.

Twenty minutes later, she still hadnt turned up so I called our neighbor and asked her to come over and sit with my daughter so that I could leave for work.  When the neighbor arrived, I thanked her and assured her that my wife would be here soon.  I said my goodbyes and switched my Uber app on.

Almost instantly I received a notification for a pickup.  It was close by Main Street, a few roads over.  I drove toward the fair, squinting as I passed the intersection over Main Street and seeing flashing lights in the distance still.  My fair was glad to see me.

Im glad you arrived so quickly!  That accident is pretty bad, I thought I was going to be late to work because nobody could get to me.  Apparently, some jerk in a sports car cut off a woman in an SUV.  They say the woman was killed instantly  My heart leaped into my throat but I didnt really want think about it.  Plenty of people drive SUVs.  My wife drives a blue SUV in fact, but she had been texting me.  She texted me *after* the accident.  No way it was her.  I sighed and drove my fair a few blocks down the road.  As he was leaving, my phone rang.

It was my wife, and I released a breath I hadnt realized Id been holding.  I pulled over to the side of the road and answered my phone.  Hi, babe, are you finally out of that traffic jam? I answered.

Well yes, but it turns out Im going to miss dinner.  Im really sorry.  I should have been more careful, I should have looked both ways but I just wanted to get back to you guys, she sobbed.

Honey, calm down.  We can have dinner when you get home, the time doesnt matter.  Just let me know so I can head home myself.  Our neighbor is with the baby.  My heart started thudding in my chest again.  I felt uneasy.

I cant go home anymore.  I have to stay here now, but its okay, the cell phone service is amazing.  You sound so clear.  I will probably be able to call you often!  My phone beeped; call waiting.  Oh, you probably want to take that call, hon.  Its important.  But dont worry.  Call me back.  She hung up.

Dumbfounded, I answered the phone.  It was the police, telling me what I guess I knew in the bottom of my heart.  My wife was in a fatal car accident today on Main Street. </TEXT>

But how do I know what's happening with the trophy?  I have one from a previous win a long time ago.  How do I know where I "placed" - like what number correct guess was I?  Will it change colour, or will it say x2 CHAMPION, something else?  Will it change at all?

	<TEXT> 1.  Does SimC/Pawn take the procs or special abilities that trinkets have on them, or do they only look at the hard stats?

2.  Does SimC/Pawn look at tier bonuses, or just the stats there as well?

(Asking b/c I got a new trinket and a 2-piece last night, but they aren't showing as "upgrades" even though it is a fresh sim I had.  If you are interested in more details I can post them, but I'm asking generally right now.)

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Dear Diary,*

*I got a new job.  Me.  Finally.  Its perfect for me.  I work nights, so I can sleep in!  Haha.  Whatever, its empowering, but Im not going to be a hoe about it.  I have some standards*

I sighed and closed my diary.  I sat cross-legged on my twin bed in the near-dark.  The only light was coming from a small pink desk lamp on my second-hand end table.  Well, I may not have much but at least I will be able to pay my rent and afford a small car payment.  And its all anonymous, at least.  

*****

Id had a decent night at work.  I made an extra $500.00 more than my usual haul of $200.00 or so.  All for pretty much just talking.  Sure, he asked for more but I have never done things like that and I never plan to.  He was okay with that.  Most of them are.  I did my private dance for him and we talked a bit.  Every once in a while you get a creep that expects you to do more, but in that case I would just whisper that Id get another girl whod do whatever it is hed wanted.  If he wouldnt take no for an answer, I would press the button for the bouncer to come.  That only happened once when I first started about a year ago, and I didnt know how to look for warning signs.  Ah, ignorance.

The other girls at the Kitty Kat Lounge said I was a fool.  That I should do the little extras to be able to afford a nicer life.  After all it was just me, and what should I care?  I did care, because despite my poor little flat that I lived in and my old Prius, they were mine and I owned them.  I was dreaming of a better life, sure, but I was going to make it my own way and not by being something I wasnt.  My attitude was considered funny, so they teased me.  Candy, the Sweet You Can Never Taste.  It really was just teasing, nothing catty at the Kitty Kat Lounge.  Believe it or not, the 5 of us really stuck together like an extended family or something.

After closing I changed into a plain white t-shirt and jeans.  I pulled on a black hoodie and I headed to my car.  I opened the door and slid inside.  I slipped the key into the ignition and I took a deep breath, trying to decompress.  I looked forward to my 45-minute drive.  Its my way for me to relax and unwind and symbolically leave Candy behind me.  I can transform myself back to Mary.  Just Mary, the good girl.  The one whod never be a stripper.  Well, I almost had enough money in my savings now to go to back to school like Id always wanted to do!  I went over in my mind again the nights events.  Standard, except for the last guy.  It was nice to just talk sometimes.

A few minutes later I pulled out of the parking lot and onto the lonely road home.  I glanced at my cell phone sitting forlornly in the cup holder, 2:30AM.  I glanced up and noticed a car behind me pull out as well.  Strange, because I hadnt noticed another car in the parking lot with me, but that didnt mean anything.  It could have been one of the other girls, but I was not really paying attention as I left.  Id been thinking about the extra money.  I glanced down again and saw my phone light up, but I didnt pay much attention to that.  I generally dont answer the phone this late, anyway.  I figured it was one of the girls from work, but they know I dont answer the phone while driving.

I drove on for about 5 minutes when the car behind me suddenly turned up its high beams.  I sighed.  I really hated it when people did this.  I mean, I drive the speed limit, but I dont speed.  Safety first!  The lights kept on steadily so sped up a bit and they turned off.  I continued on and the car behind me sped up; flicked the high beams on again. 

I tried to look into the rearview mirror, but I could see nothing in the glare of its halogen bulbs.  What the heck was this guys problem?  Now I was doing about 10 mph over the speed limit.  My mind flitted back to the man, the last man in my private booth.  Hed be a little awkward.  Thin greasy hair on top with a bit of dandruff.  Glasses, overweight, smelled like BO.  Id been nothing but my candy-coated self the entire time, and even though I did get a slightly weirdo vibe from him, I didnt press the bouncer button.  

Hed just wanted to talk about his wife a little, about how she made him so mad that he wanted to kill her, just to get away.  He said I was so nice and understanding.  That I reminded him of how his wife was before she became a mean-hearted shrew.  He asked me out to dinner, and he shyly asked me for some other things right there that I said flat out no to, but not unkindly.  He had let it go at that, but did I miss the signs?  Did I miss anger in his eyes?

I sped up even more and fumbled for my cell phone.  The car behind me pressed on, kept the high beams blaring, tailgating me.  I glanced away from the road and dialed 911.  I wasnt dealing with this.  My mind started to race.  I swerved a little as I dialed, but I was able to correct.  I heard my bag of extra clothes hit the door with a dull thud.  When the dispatcher got on the line I burst into tears.

Please help me, Im trying to drive home from work and there is someone behind me, following me!  Im scared, I begged.

The dispatcher was kind and calming.  After telling her about where I was, she gave me quick directions to a parking lot where I should pull into.  She assured me that there would police waiting for me.  I hung up and really laid the pedal to the metal.  I couldnt quell visions of the greasy man attacking me when I pulled into the parking lot.  I cried harder, but I made it the parking lot, mystery car hot on my tail.

It felt like an hour, but it was really only 30 seconds.  Three police cars pulled into the parking lot behind both of our cars, lights blaring.  They swarmed in and at the car behind me.  I cautiously put my car in park and glanced into my left rearview mirror.  I saw them pulling not the greasy man from earlier that night, but Diamond from her car!  Now what the heck was my coworker from the strip club doing following me like that?  I

Movement in the corner of my eye and I twisted around.  It was a good thing I did, because looming up behind me from the backseat of my car was Mr. Greasy himself, wielding a wicked-looking butcher knife.  See, I just wanted to take you out, he whispered, leering at me.  You remind me sooo much of my wife

I screamed and somehow managed to open my drivers side door.  I fell out of it and ran toward the police officers, a hysterical mess.  I was screaming and pointing to my car.  After a moments confusion, they ran over to my car and found Mr. Greasy in between the center console with his wrists slit by his own hand.  I didnt care if he lived or died then I dont care now.

Diamond ran over to me as I bawled on parking lot ground, gravel digging into my palms.  She put her hand on my back.  Honey Im so sorry, I didnt know what to do.  I saw him in your car but you didnt answer your phone and I guess you didnt see him.  I followed you and flicked the high beams on.  Whenever I did that, he ducked back down behind your seat!

Of course I didnt see him, Id be lost in my own little world.  Thank you, Diamond.  I looked up then and noticed that were we in an old church parking lot.  Stressed as I was, I snorted laughter and pointed to the building.  Diamond smiled, too.

I took the hint from the universe.  Enough was enough.  I quit the next day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am asking this for a friend!!

"My friends have 2 cats.  When they brought their first baby home, the cats peed all over the floor our of jealousy.  The carpets were never fully cleaned, just some spray put on the spots where the cats peed.  The cats have stopped peeing on the floor now, but the house still really smells like cat pee.  Now, almost 2 years later, their kid is walking around and playing on the floor.  Some of her toys are right where the offending cat-pee-spots are.  So, I thought maybe it would be a nice thing to do....When they go on vacation this spring, I will go into their house and clean their carpets and try to get the smell out as a nice surprise."

Do you think this is a good idea? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The Friendship Lamp </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-25 23:39:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Forgive me, Redditors, for coming here and crying to you, but I need to talk to someone.  Anyone.  Would talk to a pet, if I had one, but Im allergic to most animals so thats not an option.  Im also incredibly shy yet I fear being alone.  Its a little weird, but its me.  At least this way I can be anonymous; that is the wonder of the Internet.  I can be anyone, or I can be no one.  Ok, so the reason why Im here.  I really need to get this out.

My best friend committed suicide this morning.   I didnt see it coming.  I dont think anyone did.  I wonder if this makes me a bad friend.  It literally makes me alternately mad at myself for not noticing and mad at her for leaving me here, all alone once again.  She was probably the only real person in the world that I was friends with and I couldnt help her even though shed helped me so many times in the past.  Its just.so wrong.  It all feels wrong.

Our meeting wasnt anything special.  My parents were in the air force and often stationed all over the world.  Every couple of years or so Id be uprooted.  So there I was a Sophomore in a new high school, and she was assigned to be my student ambassador.  I hated that some schools did this, because usually the ambassador didnt want to really be bothered with me, since I barely spoke.  Anyway, she showed me around for the first week.  She was all blonde hair, green eyes, athletic body, bubbly persona.  Me?  I was all dark hair, dark eyes, slightly chubby, incredible introvert.

I dont really know why, but Shauna took a special interest in me.  She still would walk up to me in the hallway after our week together was up, and ask how I was going.  I barely was able to mumble replies to her as she stood there wearing the latest fashions and expensive perfumes while I, in contrast, stood there in faded black jeans.  I thought that eventually shed get bored and move on but she stuck with it.  It took her a month or so, but eventually she asked me to hang out with her sometime.  I reluctantly agreed.

Shauna came to my house and my parents were floored to see an actual person had come to see me!  An actual friend, a girl my own age.  They knew enough not to ask any strange questions, though, so we headed up to my room.  I had a poster chart of Morse Code on my wall, and a couple Air Force logos, but other than that my room was pretty sparse and maybe a little odd, especially for a teenage girl.  She didnt judge me.  She sat on my bed and talked about everything and nothing.  This became our weekend ritual every Friday night.  For the next three years.

Needless to say Shauna and I became best friends.  She was a closet nerd, and I just felt super comfortable around her.  Though I was truly shy, I could tell her anything, and she would tell me anything, too.  Our senior year was when it got weird, I guess, now that Im thinking of it.

We were about a month away from graduation, and Shauna couldnt stop talking about this boy she met online named Mike.  So cute (he was), so nice (his texts seemed nice) but he lived a couple of states over.  She was planning to meet him after graduation.  I was happy for her.

That month flew by, and I got ready to give Shauna what I thought was the coolest gift ever  Friendship Lamps.  They were these 2 blue matching lamps that looked like stained glass.  The edges and base were black.  When you touched one, the other would light up no matter how far away they were from each other.  I synced them together and had them both set up to show her yesterday.

She came over, I showed her, but we got into an argument about Mike.  Some of his texts seemed a littleoff.  He wanted her to come out to see him, he had something so great to show her.  It was going to be a surprise so he was going to pick her up at the train station.  That was why he wouldnt give her his home address. Ookay.  He couldnt wait to feel her hand in his, to hug her closeI dont know, I cant describe it, it was just a vibe I was getting, okay?  Anyway she left in a rage, and forgot her present.  She left early the next morning.

And later this afternoon, Shaunas mom called and told me the terrible news.  She didnt give many details, only that theyd found her at the train station, and that shed taken her own life.  I let this news sink in and headed upstairs to my bedroom.  I looked at the Friendship Lamps that would never work; that wed never get to play with together.  I thought coming to Reddit to tell my story would help my grieving process, so typed this all up.  I fell asleep staring at the lights.

I woke up around 3:00 AM.  I saw one of the Friendship Lamps was lit on my computer desk.  I thought that strange, because its twin was sitting right next to it, dark.  I walked over to them both, when the lit lamp began blinking in a seemingly erratic pattern.  The air chilled.  I felt it get colder.  I shivered.  I blinked twice, then realized the light was not blinking randomly.  It was blinking in Morse Code.  I grabbed a pencil and sheet of scrap paper from my desk and began to write.

.. - / .-- .- ... -. .----. - / ... ..- .. -.-. .. -.. . .-.-.- the light said.  It wasnt suicide.

I set my pencil down and stared at the message.  I couldnt believe it.  I read it over twice.  The light stopped blinking.  Shauna, I dont know what happened.  But Im going to find out.  With this thought in my mind, the air abruptly resumed its normal temperature.  The chills faded.

This is my chance to repay her for her kindness.  So, I am posting this here.  As hard as it is to ask you strangers for help.  Does anyone have ideas as to how I can start looking for information?  I already plan to talk to her mom more about what exactly happened in the morning.  I want to see what I can find out about Mike.  If thats even his real name.  I know Shaunas password to her computer.  Maybe I will check that out.  Because I believe that message. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Firstly, I just want to thank each and every one of you who has helped me in the past.  I really appreciate your input and thoughts.  Yes, I Google a lot of things, but nothing really beats personal "real people" experiences, and your opinions/perspectives, especially if they are different from mine are really helpful.  I feel like such a dork sometimes asking things that seem like they should be common sense.

So, (idk how closely you guys follow everything that goes on here) as you may or may not know I just switched my son over to table foods, whole milk, and some watered down juice.  The only time he gets a bottle w/ formula is for bedtime, and that's going to go once I'm finished with all the opened formula containers.

Now, how can I tell my son is getting enough hydration?  B/c for example today he had milk with breakfast, watered juice with his snack   lunch, then milk with dinner.  Then he was CRYING and saying "cup, cup" like he was begging for something to drink.  After about 30 min of almost non-stop whining I gave him cup of water, which he drank completely and he seemed happier, at least he stopped crying.

Go to change his diaper and it was completely dry (the yellow stripe turns blue when it gets wet so that's how I know for sure) - this diaper was on him for about 3 hours...is this normal?  Am I overreacting, lol?

Ehh the next new chapter of my kiddo's life e_e  Just when I was adjusted to the bottles/cups of food - something new comes up.  I guess at least #2 (if that ever happens!) will have it a lot easier lol!  Anyway thanks again!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey all!

My son has recently started taking lots more table food and it's working out great.  However I am not much of a cook and we don't get home during the weekdays until 6:30-7:00 so prepping dinner in time for my son's bedtime (8:30) can be a little hairy.  What are some easy (yet relatively nutritious) fast things I can give him?  Can I make him sandwiches?  (Ie jelly, lunchmeat, etc) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Dog Keeps Eating Socks and Baby Toys...*Sigh* </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-17 19:21:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My husband and I got our dog, Dax about 4 years ago.  He is a Beagle/Bulldog mix.  He is "my" dog in that he was always closer to me, from puppyhood to adulthood.  I have always been the one to feed and water him and do the "deep cuddle sessions" with him.  (On the couch or him sleeping next to me in bed.)  Dax would occasionally eat my socks or undies, and while frustrating, it was really only once in a while.

NOW, a year after we had our son, Dax is losing his mind.  He is not interested in the baby at all.  Which is fine, he has never been aggressive toward our baby, and he is ALWAYS supervised when with the baby.

But Dax keeps eating the baby's toys and my socks....seems like more and more each day.  Dax has gotten to the point where he will go the hamper and work out my socks/undies through the little vents in the sides!!  ONLY MINE - never my husband's.  Dax will sneak off with some of the baby's small toys and chew them up, sometimes long after the baby is asleep, sometimes when the baby is playing with a couple parts but that's less common.  It's happening now pretty much every day.

I still feed   water him.  I still do the cuddles, and if anything it seems like Dax eats socks/undies/toys MORE when I cuddle him.  We're at a loss and I'm running out of $ to keep replacing my unmentionables.  Please help!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my story.  I thought I could handle this myself, but I cant.  Im glad I found this place b/c now I can talk about it, and I know people here will believe me.  Maybe, if Im lucky people will read it and someone out there will be able to help me.  At the very least, its not about mushrooms at all.  So, theres that.

I was excited to be going away for the weekend with my Girl Scout Troop to the mountains for an indoor waterpark adventure and hiking.  I wasnt really friends with any of the other 13-year-old girls, but I was hoping that maybe this weekend would change everything.  I was going to really try to be cool, gnarly, whatever.  I wanted to fit in in the worst way.  As my mom helped me pack my bags, she was going on and on about being careful, being smart, dont do anything silly.  Yeah, mom.  I get it.  I sighed.

One of the reasons why I wasnt popular is because I was very bookish and shy.  Other girls giggled about makeup and New Kids on the Block (or whatever, I dont know what fashionable music is.  I listen to classical), while I thought it was kind of lame.  I preferred fantasy stories and drawing to these activities.  And Id clearly been excited about this trip, because Id been researching hiking in the library.  What kind of snacks to bring, what clothes to wear, etc.  I even did a mini-presentation at the last Scout meeting before we left.

Anyway, the Troop left the following Friday after school.  Everyones suitcases were packed into one of the four cars of the lucky moms that were coming to help chaperone.  As our little caravan pulled onto Highway 7, I sat in the front seat of the troop leaders car with a paperback because nobody wanted to sit next to me.  It wasnt a big deal though because I really wanted to read more of my book.  A story about a girl who was really a princess but she ran away from her father and now was living in the forest with this magical deer as her companion.  And I could probably finish it, because that highway was always crowded.

The commute was standard, nothing exciting.  Everyone divided up the beds in the three bedrooms and went to bed early in order get up early for hiking in the morning.  (I was on a pull-out couch in the corner.)  Even the next days hiking adventures went over well.  I managed to chat with every girl for a couple of minutes without having anyone laugh at me, and one girl, Kim, even complimented my suggestion of trail mix as a snack.  She even invited me to come to her bedroom that night to hang out with the rest of the girls.  I might have just wandered in anyway without an invite, but this--!  I smiled and I agreed, mentally promising myself I wouldnt say or do anything silly while I was there.

We all returned home and had a simple dinner.  The whole time everyone was chatting easily.  It almost felt like I was really fitting in and I had managed not to say or do anything too weird.  I could feel myself relaxing, not being so worried.  Eventually the dishes were cleared away and it grew dark.  Girls started slipping off to the master bedroom to hang out while the adults relaxed in the main room.  I was the last to make my way there.  All 10 pairs of eyes turned to face me as I walked into the room.

Oh hey, Danni, come on in here, called Kim.  I smiled shyly as I sat next to her on one of the cots and let my eyes wander briefly around the room.  There was 1 full-sized bed in the middle of the room and 2 cots pushed up against walls leaving most of the room open.  Everyone was sitting on a bed or cot.  Girlish chatting resumed for another 15 minutes or so, when suddenly Kim clapped her hands together.

Alright, its 10 oclock so nows the time.  Who wants to go first? Kim whispered.  My eyes widened.  I had no idea what she was talking about, but of course I didnt want to admit that.
I will! exclaimed Karen.  She was one of the cooler, popular girls in the troop.  I blinked, relieved that I would be able to watch whatever it was that was about to happen.  Karen, a little blonde wearing a purple Hypercolor t-shirt stood up and went to the middle of the room.  Kim got up and stood behind Karen, a little off to the left.  Karen took 10 big, deep breaths.  She held her breath.  Kim reached over and put her hands on Karen, where the shoulder meets the base of the neck and started pushing.  Eyes as wide as saucers now, I gaped.  I could see some of the girls watching me out of the corners of their eyes to see what I would do.  I sat on my hands and leaned forward, debating calling out for a parent.  Was this a test?  Was this a prank?  Kim slowly counted down from ten to one, and released Karen.  Karen took one step forward.  I held my own breath.  Karen laughed.

Nope, nothing happened!  everyone started giggling.  I exhaled loudly.

II, okaywhatwas that supposed to be? I cried, barely holding back tears.  Cursing myself for those tears.

Oh, its a GAME, silly.  You do this and youre supposed to pass out or something, Kim scoffed.  The mocking was back.  That foolish feeling.  Were all going to give it a go, and you should too, if you really want to be cool.

I was too shocked to talk, so I just mutely nodded.  I tried to think if it was even possible for you to pass out playing this game and where it might have come from.  I was half paying attention as we went around the room, each girl taking the breaths and Kim holding their throats.  Nothing happened, everyone laughed.  And then it was my turn.

Are you ready? Kim looked at me, honestly curious to see if Id go through with it.  I again couldnt find my voice so I nodded.  I took my position up in the middle of the room and took 10 deep breaths, holding the last one.  I could feel Kims hands, her cool palms pressing into my skin.

I woke up on the floor, scratching my head.  Kim?  Why are you in my dream?  We already drove home and the trip is over.  Wait.  No.  Whathappened?  I pushed myself up into a sitting position.  Kim was looking at me, terrified.  The rest of the girls were staring at me open-mouthed.  Great, I thought.  What have I done now?

Y-you are such a FAKER!  That is NOT how you play!!  Its just a game thats supposed to scare you, its not real!  Kim shouted.  She must have realized how bewildered I looked myself, because she lowered her voice and spoke again.  When I let you go, you fell forward on your face and didnt move for almost a minute.  I almost got my mom!  You scared the crap out of us!  Diddid it actually work?

II saw something.   I thought it was part of the dream.  I saw a line of cars.  I saw clothes floating in the air.  I saw some people running.  And then you were there, I whispered.  I shrugged and stood up, unsure of what to do.

Kim stared at me.  Are you going to tattle?  I shook my head no, and headed for bed.  I wish I had tattled, but I dont know possibly would have come from that.

My dreams were restless that night, and have been ever since.  I kept seeing terrible things.  Bad accidents.  Murders.  Things I didnt often dream about.  I chalked it up to an overactive imagination and didnt think anything of it.  Everyone avoided me for the rest of the day.  Business as usual.

A few weeks later, I was home alone after school one day.  I wandered into the kitchen, preparing to make myself a snack.  I flipped on the TV and to my horror, I saw the image from my dream.  A line of cars, clothes fluttering on smoky wind, and a few people running in the opposite direction of where the smoke looked like it was coming from with terrified expressions on their faces.  I gripped the side of counter.  My phone rang on the wall.

I jumped almost 10 feet in the air, but I went over to answer.  It was Kim, speaking so softly and almost kindly.  It was a tone Id almost never heard from her before.  Though she wasnt necessarily a friend, she was a life raft in my sea of terror at this point.  Danni, are youseeing this?  Its on all the channels.  Some crazy terrorists set off a huge car bomb on Highway 7 during rush hour.  Didwas. this what you saw?

I was silent for a long time.  What game were we playing?  Where did you hear about it from?

I-I dont know, I thought I just made it up!!  Weve played before at slumber parties, but it has never worked like that before!  Was it what you saw?? she demanded.

Kim, youve got to help me. yesyes it was what I saw, right down the colour of the shirts.  And, Ive dreaming ever since.  How do I know what else will happen? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> FFS, Can You Back Off...[MIL RANT, Long] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-11 17:50:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My MIL is a really nice lady, and I really do like her.  She helped me out a lot when my son was first born.  She stayed over our house 2 days a week overnight to take care of the baby at night so my husband and I could get some sleep, and I'm forever grateful for that.

But.  Yes there is always a but.

Long story short, MIL was in Florida for a while, but now she's back in NJ and wants occasionally watch our son during the week.  Sure, it's great b/c it saves on babysitter costs.  Except...I MUST LIST ALL THE ANGER.  B/c I have specifically TOLD her not to do these things and I know she's f*cking doing it anyway.  Wait until you read the last one.

* Constantly holds son pretty much ALL DAY.  Almost no floor time.  Which messes up AJ b/c after 2 straight days of being held he thinks we're going to do that too, but we aren't.

* Refuses naps.  I explained MORE THAN ONCE that AJ needs 2 naps, and about the times he should be put down.  She puts him down, but if he whimpers even once, she decides he's not ready and plays with him even more.  (He's literally whining for sleep.)  It got so bad at one point that AJ was waking up every couple of hours at night that I said if you don't give him naps, you can't see him anymore b/c JUST NO.

* Feedings.  We are weaning AJ from formula/bottle.  I said he gets 2 bottles, 1 morning, 1 dinner (then 1 at night but she's gone by then).  She tries to give him another bottle in between morning, lunch, and dinner.  NO.  Most recently, I told her that AJ should only have Breakfast: 1 bottle, cereal.  Lunch:  Fruit cup, Dinner:  1 bottle, Veggie/meat cup.  As much watered down apple juice in his sippy cup as he wants.  NO SNACKS, NO OTHER FOOD.  (B/c he's taking an antibiotic that gives him the poops and I explained this to her.  Patiently.  Three times.)  Come to CATCH HER stuffing PEAS into AJ's face last night as I was getting his tub ready for bed.  ("Oh he's crying b/c he's hungry" -- NO HE'S NOT HE'S CRYING B/C HE IS TIRED.  Also, he can choke on peas, like....WHYYYY.)

* Weirdly opens toys that we have put away until he's older.  We have several toys that we have put away in his closet to bring out later, to rotate toys or b/c they are too old for him right now.  They aren't easily visible.  She goes in there and digs them out.  _

* Laundry holy hell.  Changes AJ's outfit like 4324239 times a day b/c he gets 1 tiny food particle on him.  Or he "messes" and then complains that my drawers are organized in a confusing way.  (Have also explained the drawer layout several times.  Patiently.  Twice.)  So he grabs all different pieces of his ALREADY MATCHED outfits and he looks messy af.  Yes, I understand sometimes you have change him if he gets poo on his clothes but OMG WOMAN HOW ARE YOU SO MESSY THAT IT HAPPENS ALL THE TIME.

* Let's Cook Dinner.  (I work full time.  I barely cook.  If I do it's quick, healthy.)  "Oh well let's FRY ALL THE MEAT and make all these incredibly starchy foods - what do you mean you can't eat them, what do you mean you don't cook huge meals every day?"

I don't want to deny her seeing AJ, but I am considering just saying she can only watch him 1x a week.  I would literally rather pay the babysitter to watch him than have her there.  It's so freaking frustrating and when I try to talk to my husband about it he gets all weird b/c it's his mom.

Ok wow this is so long but damn I feel better venting.  Thanks.

TLDR - MIL making me crazy. T_T e_e </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When my son was born, I wanted to breastfeed in the worst way and I tried so hard, so damn hard.  In the end it didn't work out b/c he couldn't latch.  When he tried to nurse it hurt so badly and he wasn't getting enough so after a month of struggling to pump even 6oz after a full day, we switched for formula.  I had asked in the hospital when he was born and when we went to our first couple of well-baby visits if he possibly had lip ties, and I was told constantly no.

WELL HAHAHA.  My son had his first dentist apt on Thurs and I asked the dentist.  GUESS WHAT.  He has an upper lip tie.  (She doesn't want to do anything with it for now, to see if his teeth grow in properly, etc.)  BUT NOW I KNOW I WASN'T A FAILURE.  I just wanted to celebrate thisssssss 3 3

	<TEXT> Hello, all.  I am a long-time lurker, so I'm sure nobody here really may recognize me.  Anyway, one of my New Year's resolutions is to do things that scare the shit out of me, but I've always wanted to try.  (Within reason, I haven't completely taken leave of my sanity.)

So, I wrote and submitted my first story to NoSleep.  I'm wondering if you kind readers of this forum can take a look at it, and give me some constructive criticisms and comments on it?  Tell me what you liked, what I did right, and where I missed the mark, or if I should just give it up.

I don't want that single story to be the only one submit here, but I cannot grow if I don't ask for assistance, either.  (And btw, the asking *also* scares the crap out of me.)

Story:  https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/5mgr90/fires_in_the_distance/

And if this isn't allowed, I'm really sorry - can someone point me toward where I can find help for this from people who generally aren't tools? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Fires in the Distance </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-06 23:42:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was in my 2014 RAV 4 LTD.  A gift from my husband last Christmas.  I hadn't asked for a new car, but he had purchased it for me a surprise because we had a child on the way and I needed a "family" car.  A black Chevy truck wasn't going to cut it with a car seat.  He was right.  And besides, he specifically found a car in my favourite colour  Deep Red.

My husband was driving us down a dark, unlit road through the part of town where the farms were located.  My town, East Depton, was big enough to be almost totally houses and business, but about a third of it was still farmland.  They do call New Jersey the Garden State for a reason, after all.

It was fall and the cornstalks were growing on either side of the road.  I loved fall, the smell of fresh air and fires faintly burning in the distance.  Neighbours having bonfires next door, farmers cleaning up their fields.  The multi-coloured leaves and the crunchy noises theyd make when you stomped on them.  Sweater weather, cold enough to cuddle but not so cold that you couldnt stay outside for more than few minutes before you really started to shiver.

I wasnt worried about it being so dark.  The headlights on my SUV were brand new, and besides wed been down this road so many times before.  He was chatting about something, work, I think.  He was up for a promotion, and he wanted to have another child.  He loved our son, and he wanted our family to grow again.  With this new promotion, wed be able to comfortably afford it.  He was excited.  To be honest, I was only half listening.  I wasnt sure I wanted another child.  I thought I wanted four, and though our son was a great baby, I didnt know if I could handle the emotional stress of everything all over again.  Those first couple of months of practically sleepless nights almost killed me.  I almost lost myself.

I had cracked the window in the passenger side of the RAV 4 to smell the autumn air, the fires in the distance.  Everything was silent, other than my husbands chatting.  Suddenly there was a sharp report, a few seconds then silence.  I laughed to myself, thinking it sounded like some kind of gun fire.  I turned to mention this to my husband, when I realized the silence was total.  He had stopped talking.  He was slumped in his seat.  The car kept on.

I gasped, as we came up over a hill in the road, cornstalks giving way to charred fields, fires and houses burning on the horizon, skeletons of trees smoldering.  I could see tiny holes in the roof of the SUV over my husbands head, but I refused to look to closely at him.  I could see what looked like a helicopter swooping out of site.  Soundless.  Impossible.  My husbands foot slipped on the gas and we began to accelerate.  I gasped.  We approached a t intersection.  I grabbed the wheel, unable to stop us, hoping only to control us.

We crashed through the intersection, through a field of burning corn.  My mind clouded, hazed with smoky indecision.  Did I try to jump from the car, or try to crash into a burning tree that was quickly coming up in our path?  What do they do in movies?  Whats the safest way?  Should I just tuck and roll?  My thoughts swirled.  As the tree loomed closer, I made my choice.  I held my breath, unclicked my seatbelt, threw open the passenger side door, and jumped from the car.  As I rolled through the smoldering corn and the car crashed into the tree, I had enough time to wonder if my son had been in the back seat of the car before I passed into oblivion, the smell of fires in my nostrils, on my clothes, on my skin.... </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Insurance </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-04 22:54:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am on my husband's plan as well as my own plan through my work, so basically I have 2 health insurances.  We did this b/c we were planning a baby and wanted to avoid as much out of pocket costs as possible.  I made all the phone calls, ensuring that each insurance company knew about the double coverage.  All of this was taken care of before we even started trying.

Prior to delivery I filled out all the forms carefully and provided copies of BOTH insurance cards.  After delivery I again provided all of this information.

FLASH FORWARD to now, just over a year later.  The insurance companies are STILL arguing with me over the bills.  I have called and explained this already 6 times.  The last time I called the hospital (a few months ago) they said I owed nothing.

So ummm...I'm not really sure what to do now.  At the time of his birth my son was "grandfathered" for a month under BOTH of our insurances.  WHY do I have to keep calling, and how long do I have to keep this up?  Should I just wait and see when/if the hospital will send us a new bill?  WHY IS THIS SO STUPID - we have insurance so we don't have to pay huge bills...Thankfully we are generally healthy so our insurances almost never have to pay anything out for us - ANGERRRRR.

Please someone help me lol. </TEXT>

My current SS messaged me to say he received it, but he did not post to the gallery.  (I am currently "pending" my shipment verification.)

Here are my questions.  Aren't you *supposed* to post to the gallery?  Since neither of them have bothered to do it and I provided verification, I will get my credits back right?  Has anyone else had their giftees not post their presents? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made a paladin with full plate.  She lives in and has grown up in the jungle.  The other PCs berate me (somewhat seriously) for doing this b/c they claim plate would not work in the jungle.  I hadn't see any rules about this, so I'm not sure *why* this would be?  If I had went with lesser armour, wouldn't I have died quicker as I was to be the front-liner fighter?  I argued that since I grew up in the jungle I was used to wearing the armour.  It actually almost ended in a "real" fight that it shouldn't be allowed, it would be too hot, etc.  Like what?  Pretty sure as a 1/2 elf I already wouldn't be "realistic" soooo....can anyone give me some insight? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure how to simply explain this without going into too many details, so I will try my best to keep this short.  My husband is agnostic.  I was raised Catholic but I have relinquished that title and now would probably be qualified more as pagan, if anything.  Both of us don't believe in organized religion.  (But hey if that's your thing, we are totally respectful of it!!)

My parents are pushing us to baptize our son.  At first I was open to it, but then I thought...where will it end?  Will they push the issue of confession, confirmation?  It's one thing if my son says he wants these things, or is curious about them when he's older...

My mother has claimed that she will "just take him and do it without us" - like what?  (This is even more amusing b/c she only goes to church on Easter and Christmas...)

I don't know what else to say, other than we want to raise AJ to live by the "be excellent to everyone" motto.  If he has specific questions, we will answer him.  I...I don't even know what my original question was, I guess how do I deal with this?  I'm so stressed and upset about this :/ </TEXT>

On Tuesday my Santa said that he'd [shipped my gift](https://www.reddit.com/r/secretsanta/comments/5i68s0/its_coming/), but hadn't provided me with a tracking number so I'm not sure when it's actually coming.

Today I when I get home it's dark except for my porch light and Christmas lights...so, I can see but not really.  I check my mailbox and I see a pink, foiled package inside.  My stomach flops with excitement!  I'm hype.  I feel like I'm 5.  I stuff the package under my arm and carry in my bags and other stuff.

The second I'm through the door I throw the bags to the side and hold up the pink, sparkly envelope...only to see that it's my Ipsy order.  I died a little inside, then started laughing so hard my SO came upstairs to check on me.  Well, RIP - but tomorrow is another day :D

TLDR - Saw sparkly package in mail.  Thought was gift.  Was not, in fact, gift. </TEXT>

1.)  When I have to m1, the stiches are very noticeable.  Is there some way I can reduce this?

2.)  The part where the stitches are split on the needles is REALLY wide even though I'm tugging them closer together.  It's not so wide that the stuffing will fall out, but it doesn't look pretty.

	<TEXT> Is it me, or has tab targeting gotten a bit wonky lately?  I used to have little to no problem tabbing in melee.  It would choose the next reasonably close mob in the pack and I could keep attacking w/ little interruption in my rotation, but now it seems like whenever I hit tab it targets a mob 1/2 way down the hall and nowhere close to the action.

	<TEXT> At the end of the month, my LO will be 1 year old.  From what I've read and what my pediatrician has said, lots of things will be changing.
* No more pacifier
* No more bottle
* No more formula (he's EBF)
* No more nighttime bottle
So, I'm just asking for how you handled the above.  Here's what I *think* will work...plz feel free to give advice.
* No more pacifier - He doesn't use it much, only when tired.  So I will start by only giving it to him at nap/bed time for a month, then just bedtime, then after another month, stop all together.
* No more bottle - He's already using a sippy cup somewhat.  I think I will give him all milk in this throughout the day, then a final nighttime bottle.
* No more formula - I'll begin by transitioning...his morning cereal will be mixed with milk   his morning bottle will be milk, then after a week I will replace his lunch bottle with milk, then another week all 3 of his bottles will be milk.  (Is that *too much* milk?  I'm not really sure.)
* No more nighttime bottle - Okay well I have no idea how to swing this one.  He gets 7oz before bed.  Maybe drop it 5, then 3, then none?  :/

Thanks, parents!! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-21 16:06:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was (until recently) on a pvp server that was very Alliance-heavy.  Now it seems that we have been secretly merged with a couple of servers that are Horde-heavy and now we are vastly outnumbered.  So here's my questions about server merging in general:

*When Blizz merges a server, why don't they dissolve server A and B and create server C?

*How does Blizz decide what servers merge together?

*Does Blizz always announce what servers are going to merge?

*Is the entire game now cross-realm?  (Maybe my server hasn't been merged at all and they've just made it this way?)

*Does Blizz merge servers to give players more of a chance to interact, or b/c it helps keep their systems from working too hard, perhaps preserving their resources? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Entering Return to Kara Bug...? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-14 18:27:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last night I was trying to finish up Kara.  (We only had Viz up, idk if this matters.)  We formed the group, and whenever the tank would try to zone in, he'd die instantly and be ported out.  He was automatically released and then had to rez, then it would happen again and again.

It took us 3 tanks before we figured out a kind of work-around.  You have to enter literally 1 step at a time until you get the loading screen.  That is, the tank couldn't just run into the instance.  He had to walk One.  Step.  At.  A.  Time.

Anyway, has this happened to anyone else while trying to complete Kara, or any other instance?  I wasn't sure if it was a bug somehow related to my lockout or just Blizzard in general, or some other third thing. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-10 17:23:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been going to the gym for about 6 months.  I've been lifting and running and I've lost a good amount of weight.  I had been feeling so confident that I bought myself a pair of long, wide legged pants to wear to my office.  Well, getting all dressed up took a few extra minutes so I found myself running behind and that I was going to miss the bus unless I seriously hustled.  I saw the bus coming down the road.  I decided that now would be the perfect time to start running.  As I started moving, I felt really good.  I was going to make it!  I wasn't even winded or breaking a sweat.  I'm at the corner now, just have to cross the street and I will make the bus!!  UNTIL.  My foot got tangled and caught in the wide bell of my pant leg and I fell --no, I dove head first into the middle of the road and skidded to a stop.  I disentangled myself from my pants only to look up and see the bus HAD to stop, or else I was going to get ran over.  (RIP)  I picked myself up, pulled little pebbles from my palms and, well yeah, at least I wasn't late for work.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This has been an ongoing discussion with my Monday night group.  One player claims that you can take 20 on anything.  Search checks, heal checks, spot checks, etc and that you will be successful in the end, so it's worth it to take the extra time.  Now, he's not *totally* wrong, but if you're searching for a trap, wouldn't a "1" mean you've set off the trap?  Or if a character is at -8, taking 20 to heal would mean the character would die before you've had a chance to sufficiently heal him, wouldn't he?  Please share your opinions on this...

The customer chuckled softly to himself.  "So, the women's brains cost less.  I expected as much.  Men are so much smarter."

The sales clerk looked to the customer, a confused expression on the clerk's face.  "No sir, you misunderstand.  Women's brains cost less because they have been used." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ever since Legion came out, I'm at a complete loss as to how to Enhance Shaman.  I'm having a hard time with the power bar I have to fill to cast more powerful spells.  (This is why I am not a rogue, I wasn't into this style of play.)  But, I like the class so I'm trying to make the best of it.  I've read IcyVeins.  I've changed a couple talents, and now I have gear (852 ilvl) but I only average about 170k dps.  I have WeakAuras, things are enchanted/gemed (except my neck I will admit, I'm too poor for a 20k+ enchant right now, heh).  I feel like I'm missing something, but I don't know what.  (Tried talking to the other Enhance Shaman in the guild but he completely blew me off.)  So, I turn to you...was anyone else in this situation?  Were they missing something simple?
