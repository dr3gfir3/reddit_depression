	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, so since I last posted here a lot has changed for me. I'm getting paid to write, someone asked me to ghostwriters a book for him and things like that. 

So over the last 3 weeks I've managed to write exactly 0 words out of the last 25000 that remains for the book. 

It's due on Friday. I keep promising that I'll be done by then. I still haven't written a word. 

I wish I were dead. I'm stressed the fuck out. I'm down to my last options and all I keep thinking is, crushing a bunch of Ritalin and doing rails of it. Or getting drunk to help with the writing "process". 

Idk what to do. I'm scared I'm gonna get sued for breach of contract or something.  

Help me help myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been doing something a little weird lately and I'm not sure if it is good practice. 

I've been offering clients a 10 to 15% discount if they sign a contract with me that promises that they will hire me for another job that bills at least 75% of what the cost of this job was, within the next 3 to 6 months. Obviously, the contract gives them an out which is slightly more than the discount I've given them should they say yes and then later decide to back out. 

Is this a good practice. I'm really trying to do things that give the client the belief that they are getting a discount but actually results in more billable time for me. So i have work that I can count on in the future. Sure, the whole if they decide to be scumbags and not follow thru on the second job thing is an issue and I'm sure that it would probably be rather annoying for me to file a lawsuit to collect on something like that I gave them a $100 dollar discount for promising to work with me in the future but they didn't and as such they owe me either the kill fee of $150 or the 750 for the second job that they promised. But you know i figure if someone signs a contract they'll  be more apt to follow thru and that will lend me more jobs in the future. Also I promise up to 3 revisions with any of my work tho If they need more I usually just do them for free unless they decide to completely change the concept. 

anyway what do you think? 

Also how do you get more work from a client (other than the whole doing the best damn job thing, which I always try to do anyway). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We aren't very close so it would be really weird if I were to just randomly fb message him saying something about his sexuality.  Also I myself am not Pentecostal, I'm Lutheran our church does teach it is a sin but I'm either a terrible Lutheran or something but I feel like everyone sins so none is worse than another so just love everyone. 

Just don't want him to be depressed or sad. But it would also be really weird if a 32 yr old  cousin started talking to a 15 yr old about how it's okay to be gay randomly.

Anyway I hope this isn't too rambling. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so like I'm drastically overweight. 
I have been trying to lose weight because I've got PCOS and i read somewheres that losing weight can help you get fertile again and manage the symptons. Also I want a butt like the girls who twerk (lol)

But i haven't had any luck so far. 

I'm going to talk to my doctor about maybe trying metaformin but i wanted to know what everyones experience was with it. Did you lose weight? how long did it take to get preggers? any sideeffects i should be worried about. and should i try something else first?

I've tried "lots of banging",
temping and all that,
ovulation kits, (which is hard as shit when you don't get a period)
and for weight loss i've had a nutritionist and a trainer since January i've not lost much weight. 

so experiences please! Thanks

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, yesterday someone contacts me online asking if I'd help them with a cookbook. I say sure, a cookbook should be easy work (should be). After locking down some of the details, I guess I should ask what they're looking to pay first, I write up my initial proposal for the work (they want pictures, ePub formatting and obviously writing).

Proposal Rejected. Why? Too Expensive, way out of budget.

So, I suggest, a decent deal, I'll throw in the pictures for free, for actual credit for the photography in the book, and some free advertising on their part for my services. Mind, I'm still ghostwriting this thing and doing all the research, but I figure I have to make the dishes anyway so might as well put my DSLR to good use and take some photos for free advertising.

Proposal Rejected. Why? Still too expensive, way out of budget.

Fed up, I finally ask "what is the budget?"

How much did they expect to spend for 50 desert recipes, the research to create those recipes, and 50+ photographs?

150.00 USD

I wished them good luck with finding someone willing to do all that work for less than a penny per word. Not to mention photos.

The sad part is, they'll find someone to do it probably. The writing will be atrocious, the recipes all a work of fiction (completely untested), and probably filled with a bunch of terribly composed photos taken on someone's iPhone (i hope). And someone will be duped into buying it on Amazon. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-07-01 22:52:34 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Don't do it!**

I'm not going to drink today and I got hung up on by my aunt when I called to ask where my grandfathers funeral would be. It's safe to say my entire family hates me. And not cuz of anything I did while drinking. I even tried to do a ninth step with them and that went over about as well as trying to apologize to your cats butt. 

Additionally, the last conversation that I had with my grandfather went essentially like this :

Me: I want to apologize for being a jerk and yelling at you, and making life difficult when I was a teenager, it was just that so-and-so abused me and I couldn't deal with it. 

Him: I don't believe that ever happened cuz you waited too long to say anything about it. 

Me: Why would I make something like that up? (Ithink I also said whatevers about that anyways that I'm just trying to apologize for my part in everything which is what you're supposed to do with the 9th step and then I said something about how I just always felt like no one loved me)

Him: You were a difficult child and hard to love. 

Me: Well, I did my part *hangs up phone*

So, not only do I have a terrible memory of the deceased. My last convo with him went terribly. And I'm pretty sure no one in my family wants me to come to his funeral (but also i'll look like an asshole if I don't go)

But nevertheless, I didn't drink today, don't plan on drinking today. And I don't plan on drinking tomorrow. 

**tl;dr: If I can go thru this terribly unbelieveably wtf I need a drink type shit, without drinking, so can you** </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I go to my grandfathers funeral? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-29 19:41:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **tl;dr: had a fight with man who raised me, became estranged, tried to reconcile but it ended badly, and he died, should I attend the funeral**

I've posted about this in /r/offmychest that I'm not really mourning my grandfathers passing. Maybe the permanency hasn't hit me yet or maybe I just don't care, I don't really know. The most I'm upset about is that he died on my birthday. 

Some back information: I was orphaned as a child and at first my aunt had taken me in but there was some abuse and she blamed me so my grandparents ended up taking me in from the age of about 9 or 10. 

Life existed. things happened. I grew up. I'm not saying I was the model teenager. I had a minor drug problem which is probably related to my PTSD from the abuse, but whatevers. 

Anyway, my grandparents and I had a huge fight because when hurricane sandy destroyed my neighborhood (my house was fine we just had no power, no food, and no heat), I asked if myself, my husband, and autistic son could come over for a few  hours so we could have a place with wifi, lighting, and heat and water so we could figure out what to do next. They said flat out no. 

On fb I said, i felt like no one cared about me because who tells someone something like that. They were pissed, we stopped talking since then. 

about a year ago, I tried to make my peace with them and apologized for any hurt feeling that i might have caused. Then he tells me that they've always done stuff for me and that I acted stupidly and they've never done anything to hurt me and essentially that I was being a massive jerk for telling people on fb that they wouldn't give me shelter during the hurricane. So I mentioned how no one ever did anything legally about the guy that abused me and then he said that I took too long to tell anyone and that they think i had made it up. The last thing he said to me before hanging up was that, "I was a difficult child, and hard to love" 

Anyway, while I care that the man is dead. I think that one since most of my family hates me because of the fight and since I'm not particularly sad that I shouldn't go. But worry that if I don't go that will make me look like an asshole and they'll hate me more further reducing the chance for me to ever reconcile with anyone in my family.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I have managed to get a few decent jobs out of elance, but i'm kinda getting tired of having to explain my value to people who want things for way less than it's worth. 

After some lengthy negotiations with someone about Questions for a Language and Grammar learning application or software, they then said my prices were too high and they could get questions for cheaper. They got me down to $5 dollars per question, which I thought was a great price considering that I was including the passages that that the questions would refer to. 

All this is to say, where do you guys find more better paying jobs so that you don't have to deal with this kind of thing.  </TEXT>

My grand father died, on my birthday, and I'm not sad about his death at all. I feel no grief about it and honestly am only kinda pretending that I'm sad so i don't seem like a heartless person. I'm more pissed that he couldn't wait to die til the next day. 

The last thing that he said to me about a year ago was "You were a difficult child, and were hard to love"

I've posted on facebook about how sad i am and when talking to family members (who all kinda dislike me I'm the black sheep) I try and pretend that I'm genuinely concerned but I really am more concerned about getting work done.

I'm basically trying to figure out why God is allowing this to happen. I don't know what I did wrong to make us go thru such a rough time. It sucks being all poor and going to foodbanks and stuff. We were supposed to get paid this week but there was some hiccup with the payment (again) and inspite of my reservations i made a purchase of a few comics to relieve some stress. But now i totally regret having done so because he's not going to get paid until the 20th (hopefully)

I know Matthew 6:26 says "Look at the birds of the air; they do not sow or reap or store away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not much more valuable than they?" 

But you know it is still stressful as all get out. Basically just looking for some silverlining or maybe just venting. Idk prayers would be appreciated.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm working on setting up a script for a comic about a world where the supervolcano has gone off and the world has been thrust into an ice-age. 
The main character is a woman who lives in Staten Island New York and likes to drink, who goes around with a coyote. 

I don't really have a good idea about what I want to happen but I know the overwhelming goal of the woman is to get to Quito, Ecuador because she figures it'll be warm there. 

There aren't a lot of people around because many left when it became winter and stayed winter, and it's always darkish, never really bright outside. 

Does this sound like a good story idea. 

And also is anyone interested in collaborating with me on this, i'm not an artist by a long shot.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have this terrible freelancing job where I basically summarize news from legit websites and then link to said articles in an effort to get more clicks on our website but the website is kinda annoying and i want to quit but after a 1 month trial at 105$/week I'll get 16$ an hour for 1.5 hours per day 7 days a week. I can use the money for my crippling comic book addiction (and bills). 

Here are some facts:
1. My husband is on workers comp right now (and they haven't started paying yet)
2. My husbands normal job is as a postal worker
3. We live in rent controlled apartment where our rent is like 1/4 of his pay) 
4. We don't pay for utilities and stuff
5. Our other bills are like 120 for insurance, 220 for cell service, 200 for internet and cable, and food is approximately like 300 a month. 
6. I don't have to work, but I'd like to have something to do with my time all day
7. I also do their twitter feed. 

so make my choice for me Keep the shitty freelance job to keep myself in the market/ in play or quit it which will probably make it a bit harder for me to find freelance work.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I ended up not only not losing weight but gaining about 25lbs in the process. At first i lost about 10lbs and then I gained about all that back plus some I was on a 40-30-30 plan where i had 40 percent protein. I was eating about 2000 kcals a day and working out at least 2 times a week at the gym.

I really need to lose weight I'm at like 300lbs and we're going to Disneyworld in 6 months and I want to be able to get on the rides. What do I need to do in order to lose about 60lbs by September? 

I'm desperate for advice, and horribly discouraged about my recent efforts. I've taken to giving up and just eating whatever I want because it seems like nothing i do works. I just want to see some results. Any advice will be appreciated and I'll attempt to not be an argumentative beeyotch.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was in an accident, the insurance adjuster decided that my breaks being destroyed is not the fault of the other driver but crappy work from the shop that fixed them. The guy at the shop i found said he'd give me a break cuz of my bad luck and i'd only have to pay 200 but I don't have the other 100$ right now. My husband get's paid on Friday but he said if i don't pick up the car by Monday I'll have to pay storage fees and the full price for the job of 300$ which will balloon into 500$ because the cars been there since the 1st because of the problems. 

I don't like to ask for help. I'll pay it back by the 19th when the hubby's check clears. And if you're at all worried I'm full of shit, i'll pm you the name and phone number of the mechanic shop and you can call them and pay it by phone. 

My son has autism and i kinda need the car back to get to his various doctor appointments. Which is one of the reasons why the guy gave me a 100$ discount. Cuz he said he too ask a kid with autism but he can't just do jobs for free. So if 10 people can give 10$ a pop i can give a request via bluebird amex and then i'll repay you all plus an extra 2$ for each 10$ by the first week of August or alternatively I can just give the 100$ to someone back by the 19th.

Thanks in advance. 

**edit** *I was able to get someone to pay me to clean their home so I only need 60$ now. I can also do things like cross stitch, i make some pretty cool handmade cards and bookmarks and i have my own cross stitch program and can make you patterns for 5$ a pop* </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 90 days today plus a problem </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-15 12:15:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So today hits 90 days. I no longer have any desire to drink myself unconscious. I'm going to discuss with my therapists the idea of moderation management. **or smart recovery or something else**

This is mainly due to the disgusting interactions with people from AA I really do want to rethink some things about what is acceptable and permissive in terms of sobriety.

Moat recently, my former sponsor and the head elder in my church, yelled at me and became very verbally abusive when I asked him a question about the prayer thing at meetings. According to my churches teaching one is not supposed to join others of different faiths in prayer. And also as a hold over from my atheism I do not feel comfortable praying in public outside of my own home or the church. So because I asked him these things he said I clearly just want to drink, called me a stupid bitch, blasphemied, told me I don't know shit, that he's older than me and been sober longer than I and that if I don't do things exactly how he does them that I'm obviously trying to drink. 

And then he proceeded to call me over and over again yelling and cussing at me so loud that my husband who I joke with about how he's going deaf could clearly hear him. And he txted me and txted me over and over again so many times that I had to beg him to stop.

I don't know what to do or think. And the worst part is everyone is taking his side. None care that he was verbally abusive to me. Not even the members of my church. I'm sick of the whole thing. And everyone wants me to apologize to him for asking him a question.

Edit: I wrote this at 5 am after a panic attack and forgot to finish my original statements about alternative programs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stumbled across this article about the meaning of Sobriety and what it means to recover from Alcoholism. You can read it here: [Reason.com Article on the meaning of Sobriety and Recovery](http://reason.com/archives/2014/03/22/alcoholics-recovery-and-sobriety-meaning)

I had been thinking about this lately as I had an argument with someone about my decision to take part in communion and as per my profession of faith we use real wine in communion (however it's not really wine once it's been consecrated but that's a convo for /r/Christianity or something) and I take communion at least 2 times a week. The person said I was fooling myself by calling myself sober. 

However, after reading this Reason.com article, i'm thinking maybe it's true there isn't one strict and fast definition of sobriety. Thoughts? </TEXT>

Private Confession and Absolution
Lutheran Pastors in general
My pastor in specific
Communion
Seeing my son baptised today was awesome, I wish i had been baptized in a Lutheran Church. 

And just everything in general. 

Just wanted to let yall know. And much thanks to all of you for pointing me in the right direction all those many months ago when i asked you all about the faith and such.

	<TEXT> **i figured i should post this here cuz i post here too**

I woke up this morning at 4:30 am still drunk from the night before. I was still tired, still wanted to go to sleep. But I was afraid that if I were to go back to sleep that I would most certainly die by choking on my own vomit if I were to do so. Over the course of the night, i had drank way more than i had drank in my life, yes even as an active alcoholic i never drank as much as i drank in one night as i did last night. I think i drank enough to kill a small human.

I woke up with a vague recollection of some things, that i had to piece together by asking other people and txt message logs and shit like that. I was quite seriously out of it. I had only ever blacked out or browned out once in my life (tho, if it was more, would i really know?). I drunk texted someone who is like a co-sponsor, the person who got me to even think about quitting drinking. And he's quite pissed (i'm always worried that he's pissed but this time i know it's serious). I've pissed off a quite understanding Pastor friend of mine, who is in the program and is not the kind of person who gets angry (he's a lutheran pastor and they are seriously just happy that someone asks for help).

Why did I drink? Well, It started with a panic attack on wednesday night, i awoke at 3am with an intense pressure in my body, the same pressure i've had before when having panic attacks and didn't want to go to the ER at 3am. So i took what was handy which were some percocets that i got from my MIL. Yes, i know, i need to stop taking pills from her. I'm working on that. So I took some and went back to sleep cuz they mellowed me out. Then went about my day, things went great, i did some big things with church and stuff was very happy felt the best i had in a while, was so happy to have turned a corner. Later that day, i was sitting at home and decided to for no reason in particular to take a handful of percocet. woke up sick, took a few more, went about my day. woke up sick, went to therapy, felt like a dick for using, told 1 friend.

That one friend said i need to come clean. Asked around the webchat on sunday, was told i need to come clean about relapsing. Didn't want to have to go in and say, I FUCKED UP. Especially since, someone in a meeting (my former sponsor) told me I was going to relapse because I wasn't doing it for myself so it was going to happen. This was in response to me saying that, I didn't want to drink but was afraid I was going to relapse. I don't want to give them the satisfaction that they're right. I didn't. So upon stress due to the pressure of having to be truthful, I drank. And I drank more than ever before because I couldn't deal with all the AA and shit that i've got going on in my head. It took a lot to get me past that feeling of guilt and shame.

But now i know, this shit will fucking kill me if i don't get it together. I can't drink like i did before going to meetings, because the first place i go is guilt. And it'll just be harder and harder because i'm driving away the people that want to help. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I made a meeting this morning, it went really well. All the oldtimers were saying how they love seeing me at meetings and one guy gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek. (I relish any kind of positive approval from older men). Got like 25 days or so. My sober date is 2/6/14 so idk if 3/6/14 makes 1 month or not i'll leave it up to someone else. 

But in the past few hours i've had this killer headache, it's kinda faded a bit now but it's still there. And i just kinda miss using and drinking. I suppose it started with me wanting to take some percocets for the headache (and wishing i had some available). The headache has lasted mostly for like 3 or 4 days. I think it's stress related but Idk what I'd be stressing about. 
I just know that if i took like 4 percocets right now I'd have no headache. I guess maybe i just feel lonely and shit. I don't even know why. Who the fuck knows.

	<TEXT> So I'm all done the waiting period since my uterine surgery and we're going to start trying. I've read some articles and stuff and I'm just trying to figure out how necessary the Ovulation Predictor Kits are? Do I need them right off the bat? Should I just start going at it at first or start doing the temperature first?
I've just stopped the progesterone pills that i had to take the doctor said it shouldn't take very long for it to leave the system but that it depends so there's that too. 

Any advice? Books I should buy things like that. Just so much questions and the doc was basically like it depends upon me but to just try that the main problem was probably the fibroids and such before as he didn't see any problems when he did my work up but we didn't do the more invasive tests because there was the fibroids/adenometriosis that was going on before so we're supposed to try and then see where we're at in a few months, but I really wanna give it the best shot so any advice is good. Thanks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been using this [CleanTime Counter](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ru.topot.cleancounter) and it's okay, I enjoy it. But I was wondering what kind of apps you guys use for your sobriety? The CleanTime app counts days, minutes, seconds and stuff like that and you get notified of cool day count markers like if you hit 111 or 666 or something like that supposedly. 

I also had an [AA specific app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.deanhuff.companion) but it isn't installed right now. But that one is also pretty good. 

what other apps are out there and are cool as it relates to getting sober and staying sober.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If you read the story in [John 9:1-3] it's this story of The disciples asking God why someone was born blind. So what does this mean? Does this mean God purposely makes peoples children disabled cuz he thinks its a good idea? It seems like it's massively terrible for god to do something like that. 

  As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth. 2 And his disciples asked him, Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind? 3 Jesus answered, It was not that this man sinned, or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in him.

edit: because i'm stupid and thought the verse bot would do it for me.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In January when I was still using a friend offered to give me some of their pain killers next time they saw me. I haven't seen them since and as such I've cleaned myself up (11 days today) and started going to meetings again and such. 

I saw them yesterday and they were like "Oh, here's those pills I promised you". Before I even realized what I was doing I was holding them in my hand and putting them into my jacket pocket. Until I realized No subject4454, We can't do day Zero again. We can't do this anymore. So I resolved I was going to take them to the pharmacy and give them to the pharmacist. But god help me i don't want to. I obsessively counted them things thinking about how many days I'd have and then went down the road of what I'll do next, when they run out. They gave me what to them should be a months supply. so I can't go back in 5 days and ask "you got anymore?" they'd give them to me if they had them for sure but they'd wonder about me. Just going thru my head of all the things i'd have to do. And if anyone else could hear those conversations, they'd think i was crazy. 

And yes, i get that I should tell her that I have a problem so this doesn't happen again but Shes one of those people that believes that "addiction is a personal moral failing" as opposed to a disease so she'd just look at me like some kind of loser. 

Idk why i am posting this. Maybe it's to get enough voices to drown out the voice of my addiction. Or maybe once I see it all written out, i'll realize i'm being a massive jerk and get it together and flush them. but I really don't know.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So sometimes I get asked to do the closing prayer at AA meetings. My faith prohibits me from engaging in multifaith prayers. Like not even different denominations of the same faith. 

I usually just say, 'no thank you, I don't do prayers.'
But I'm afraid that it comes off as kinda mean or judgy or like I think I'm better than everyone else. And I don't want to do that.

If possible please let's not have this digress into a whole let's argue about religion thing. Just stick with the whole what do you say if you don't do pray and such. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **TL;DR: do shit for yourself once and a while even if you have very large responsibilities or you'll look for the easiest and not always healthy way to reduce your stess**

So I failed at my mark but technically it wasn't like i planned it. I had a tumor (it was 12cm) had 2 surgeries to remove it and the pain was pretty hardcore and after taking painkillers since November to deal with the surgeries and stuff i became used to feeling like that. And then i felt like a failure for becoming addicted and drank a bit one day. 

But I learned something, 1 I like the feeling because my life is hard, i have a very difficult like. Not saying no one elses life is difficult but many of the things i deal with are very rough that most people don't have to deal with. Because I have to deal with difficult things (my son has autism and theres other shit going on too) i end up putting the people that need more ahead of me. And so I don't do stuff for myself. I basically ignored the tumor for 2 years til it got so bad i was in constant pain and very ill, because i didn't want to take time away from my responsibilities. 

The only way i've found to relax and yet remain always there was by picking up a drink or a pill. Nothing ever is very healthy about that. And I do show up, Even when drinking all my responsibilities were met, i wasn't going above and beyond but i was meeting my very difficult responsibilities. 

But I realized, i don't do stuff for myself. Of course my therapist has told me this, my husband has told me this, and other people have told me this, but i'm always extremely concerned with making sure things are taken care of. 

I didn't even want to buy myself a winter coat because i didn't want to spend the money on myself when i could spend it on my son or debt or some other thing. And about 2 weeks ago it was so cold that they canceled school because of extreme cold. My husband basically just forced me to buy a coat. He had to force me because I often will return things that people buy me and then get something for my kid. 

But I realized by not doing regular things for myself, like buying myself nice clothes, going to the doctor, splurging on something fun, going out with friends, my only way out did become something quick like a beer or a pill and really everyone needs a way to get stress out and i basically refused because I didn't want to do for myself because i'm so concerned for my family.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was having an argument (and what is reddit for rather than to assist in solving disputes) about how Classical music does the same themes as other more popular genres. 

Basically the argument went that Classical music isn't about anything (or only about jesus or something to that effect) because there are no words where as Pop and Country music can be about anything including adultery, fighting, revenge, getting drunk, and heartbreak and thus is superior for that reason. 

Everything that I could think of were Operas but if you can think of any especially songs without words that were about any of those things I'd greatly enjoy it.  </TEXT>

"You're hard to feel," he said.
The girl looked at him, she was uncomfortable, and unsure what that meant. To ask would mean to admit she didn't know something, but to just stand there was painful to her. She stood there looking into his brown eyes, saying nothing.

"Can I have a cigarette," she asked.

"Sure."

"Thanks. Can I lay my head on your shoulder while we wait? I'm a little tired."

"Sure."

They sat down on the hard cement ground, backs against the side of an empty brick building and waited. He tried to rub her shoulder casually, but she moved her shoulder til he stopped. She smoked her cigarette til it was done and then lay her head on his lap and fell asleep. He stroked her head then, cuz she couldn't stop him. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I've achieved something that i once thought was unattainable. Ninety days! 

Tho, now my worst fear is realized. All the old timers at the AA meetings would say that once you hit 90 days that they make you start speaking (mainly cuz no one wants to speak). And yes, I was asked to speak at a meeting next week, thankfully, i get a week to prepare. The old timers told me that they'd basically force you to speak the day that you got your 90 days. 

So I'm nervous about that a bit, but I Aced the heck out of my public speaking class in college so time to put that into work. lol now to try and remember what I learned. Something about being in your underwear, idk i'll figure it out later. 

Also just want to give a big thank you to all the people that I owe for this feat, all you magnificent people who dealt with me when i was being an insufferable bitch and helped me when i couldn't help myself. And that's why I'm not all boned today. 

Thanks.  </TEXT>

And attempting to at meals tho, i did forget constantly. 

Now, I haven't read my bible in a week, and I never remember the pray and even when i do i'm like meh about it. Plus I still enjoy debating christians who hold what i feel to be bad theology. (like ones that wish that god visits bad things upon you for disagreeing with them)

	<DATE> 2013-09-29 21:08:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So... I visited 3 separate churches (you may remember that I was at one point an atheist and i started visiting, had a few questions and such)

Church 1, was nice, the pastor was nice, he seemed genuinely concerned. In terms of the sacrament, They listed the creeds and such and then say, "If this is not your belief, you may come forward with your arms crossed over your chest to receive a blessing"

Church 2, was nice, a fbfriend invited me, I really enjoyed it, it was kinda far, but that was okay with me, In terms of the sacrament, they stated "Communicants are those who are confirmed members of Holy Trinity or another congregation of the LC-MS"

Church 3, was okay, I didn't particularly like it tho, a few phones went off during the service and i was a bit peeved for those peoples lack of respect, you can silence a phone. Their communion practices kinda bugged me. Their little booklet stated: We invite all baptized Christians who are truly sorry for their sins and believe that the bread and wine is Jesus' true body and blood to partake of the sacrament.

I settled on Church 2 because of their closed communion beliefs and i liked the pastor and how things were done. 

I've started the classes, i've been a bit concerned because i do have doubts in regards to my belief in God, because you know, i was an atheist from a kid with a minor veer off into mainstream Christianity post 9/11. I don't know if I should mention anything to the pastor about my doubts because idk if it's a temporary thing or an ongoing thing. 

Also while I know that the church teaches that the communion is the real blood and body of christ, I can't help but be concerned that I as a recovering alcoholic will have some issues with drinking even a sip of wine, and i'm a bit scared to mention it to the pastor as i worry that he'll think ill of me or something. 

Idk anyways that's about it. I still feel weird at church cuz my son is autistic and makes a bit of noise and laughs inappropriately during the service at times. And my weekly excitement for it has lessened significantly. Also I forget to pray continually, in the morning, at night, at meal times, idk how to remember and such. 

idk... just wanted to up date you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've got 47 days today! and such. For the past week I had been depressed in a funk and what not for no particular reason and had been considering drinking and using. So I told some friends we'd not be talking for a bit and stopped going to meetings because I "didn't feel well". (I honestly hadn't felt well, I got a wisdom tooth pulled and it's not healing right so It's kind of the most terrible thing ever). 

Any who. So this morning I was gonna sleep in having been unable to sleep until almost 3am. But while I was sleeping I dreamt I was at an AA meeting with two of my favorite meeting buddies saying "meeting makers make it" and "when i feel like that, i get my ass to a meeting." so I woke up realized i'd only be a few minutes late and got my ass to the meeting.

I guess being sober and the things I do to stay sober have become such a part of me that if i don't go to any meetings eventually, my brain will just make one up for me to go to. 

I hope everyone is having some good success with their sobriety, if you aren't give it time, one day at a time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm an atheist (I'm totally going to have my atheist card revoked) but I've been talking to this Lutheran pastor dude that is a friend of a friend and he said that I should attempt to attend a service at a missouri synod lutheran church. and So I want to try one out, since i had wanted and answer to my questions about God, Jesus, the Universe and everything.

But what exactly is a service like? I've not been to one, I've only ever been to a very contemporary christian church where they played like Jeremy Camp music and a very culty Pentacostal church where they just did stuff until like the "holy spirit told them to stop" (which was very annoying as you'd end up listening to someone ramble on for like hours). 

So anyways, I want to know what it's like. My son has autism and I suspect he might not be very quiet for the service. should i go without him? Also do i have to dress up, I don't dress up, i even got married in casual wear. Do chicks have to wear skirts? Do i need to cover up my tattoos. I don't want to be disrespectful but I do wanna just be myself.  </TEXT>

But where does it stop at what point are we living in a world where you can never say anything bad about anyone or anything. Is it libertarian to think that a person can say whatever they want? I mean supposedly you can't yell fire in a crowded theater (but shouldn't adults be responsible for making sure that's a credible threat before freaking out and trampling people to death?)

	<TEXT> Where I live it's basically just masturbation to attempt to get a libertarian voted in, as most of our politicians are either Democrats or Democrats lite. And all of them big government types. So I was wondering from your perspectives. What's the best way to enact the change towards more libertarian ideals? 

Would it be infiltrating a Republican or Democrat committee and starting to get them to agree with Libertarian positions. 

Or just go all out trying to slowly teach people what Libertarianism is all about and why they should go 3rd party. And then wait 20 years for that to happen?

Of course there are probably other options I'm not thinking of and I would like to limit this to local politics over national as I think the whole national politics is basically a long drawn out American Idol President edition anyways.  </TEXT>

But I just don't drink  today and then try it again tomorrow. 

Was it easy these 30 days? No, my car got towed and booted. Wanted to drink. Had to deal with all manner if the issues that come with raising a child living with autism. Dealing with all manner of marital issues and guilt from drinking. So it wasn't a Rollerblade thru the park, nor a walk.
But I got thru it by doing today and then trying again the next day. 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I brought the Oreilly book Learning Python to learn python i also have a Python Essential Reference book. but I'm unsure if either of these are the best way to learn Python. 

I've learned things like excel by working a book that had exercises before but I really want to know what worked for you. Also is there a good way to start with theory? like how programing works and the whole like benefits of what things do and why they do them?

	<TEXT> I'm dealing with the just consequences of my drinking days. I had a bunch of parking tickets and i didn't pay them and because I didn't pay them in a timely manner my car got booted. It's abotu to be towed cuz I didn't have all the moneys that they wanted. 

I also have some other issues with the car that need to be fixed, which are due to me texting and driving. *word to the wise: don't text and drive*. 

Also I relapsed and i didn't want to say a damn thing about it because I just wanted to get that magical 30 days coin and somehow that would keep me sober, even tho i wasn't sober. So i lied about it to my friends and sponsor. 

My sponsor is none to thrilled with me. my friends are beign very distant. And it makes me very sad.

I don't do sad, i don't do feelings. All i want to do is drink or use drugs. but if i do that my friends will remain very distant and even just straight up not be friends with me. I don't have many friends. So the 2 friends i do have are like my bestest friends in the world. They are both in recovery so I see why they'd be like this it's understandable.

I've taken to engaging in self-destructive non-substance related behavior to deal with my emotional pain. It's probably not the healthiest thing but I just don't want to drink/use drugs and I honestly dont' care that i'll have to deal with the consequences of that behavior. 

Hopefully this story stops someone else from drinking and ruining their lives.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Today is my 30th birthday. 
I've gotten no card, no birthday dinner, no present.
I got a half ass hug in the morning and the obligatory fb wall posts. 
My parents didn't even call to say what's up. 

This in addition to the fact that everyone always thinks everything I do has some sinister motive and that my face is swollen due to emergency oral surgery yesterday. 

I'm in pain and nauseous. 

My cars suspension is fucked, and that costs a few whole paychecks worth of money to fix. I lost my favorite thing in the world recently and I won't be able yo get another til late August. 
And I'm turning 30 and have accomplished none of the things I set out for myself. 

I can barely think of a reason not to drink or use drugs. Cuz I'd enjoy this emotional pain to go away. 

I'm 30, a failure and a loser and I don't know why I'm posting this. I know if I reset my day count I won't go back to a meeting, so I'm hoping this stops me somehow.

**edit: thank you to whomever gave me the redditgold, that brought a nice smile to my face this morning. And I didn't drink, you're right it wont make anything better. ** </TEXT>

This is a feat especially since 24 hours earlier I was ready to get high because I lost my FitBitFlex. I loved that fitbit flex, it shall be missed.

	<TEXT> Today while driving my steering wheel started to shimmy back and forth. There's a loud creaking sound. When I press the breaks there's a loud knocking sound. Occasionally it does this when driving at speeds over 35 mph or if the road is bumpy. 

If I go over speed bumps it feels like there is no shock absorption. 

This just started today. 

Prior to this there was a squeaky sound and a weird vibrationy sound that I thought was a wheel problem. The mechanic said there's no tire or wheel problem. 

Any ideas. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just some jerk who only has 3 days but, I've gotten to this point where I'm starting to realize that people places and things is really important. 

And I am usually a very negative person who gets stuck allowing bad thoughts to live rent free in my mind. I'll let others and their issues control my feelings. But right now I'm really working on thinking about my higher power and how he thinks about these things. 

And I just want to be around the people, places and things that make me feel like a better person or that I can be a better person. 

So if you are struggling try to go out of your way to avoid negative people, places and things. Also when those thoughts come try to think about if they are a reality or if they even matter. 
Also remember that, who you are inside is what helps you make and do everything in life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> my addiction is making me into a liar and a terrible person. I am treating someone who went out of their way to help me and care for me like crap by constantly breaking their trust. 

I don't want to be that person anymore but I think i may have nailed the last nail in that coffin. I've even hurt/ruined trust with people from AA meetings that i've just met.

I gotta get it together. I don't know how and I lack the ability to do this on my own. I am happy that I am at least in a place where I know that I cannot do this myself, and that I need something greater than I to stop this before it destroys everything. 

But i just want to undo the hurt i've cost this past week while i relapsed.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Went to two meetings yesterday on a promise. After the second meeting All I was thinking was how, I was jerk for looking down on people because of their religious beliefs and how because of this, I should drink. 

I didn't drink. I went home. Got stuck in behind a beer truck on the way home for 30 minutes in traffic. Just looked at it getting thirsty. Surely, I thought, I could drink just one beer. I didn't drink. Got home, made dinner, by them i'm all angry at life, it's pouring outside, i had to run back to the car to get the spaghetti sauce I left in the trunk, i got soaked, kept thinking, running out in the rain is totally an excuse to drink. But I went in the house, made spaghetti and looked at the big book and didn't drink. 

Kid goes to sleep, husbands at work. I'm all alone on a friday night, felt like Every single tv show i put on was talking about drinking. 

Texted a friend asked, "Will you hate me forever if I reset myself back to day 0." was hoping for a no, then it would be okay if i drunk. He texted back, "No, but i'll be mad at you for a while." used my numbers to make it thru til i was sleepy and watched some Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood (it's the new version of Mr. Rogers Neighborhood). The positive messages of that show, and others got me thru to Day 2. 

Those were honestly the hardest 48 hours i've had in a long time. 

**tl;dr:** *if you're struggling and you feel like the whole world wants you to drink. use the phone a friend option, and a kiddie show.* </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I went because a friend asked me to. I was not fond of it. As I'm very Judgy and didn't think I would ever be seen hanging out with those people if I had a choice. 

Before going I was nervous that everyone would think I was a loser for going to AA, then I was worried that I wouldn't be enough of an alcoholic to be at AA and they'd all be mean to me. Then when I got there I was like I'm way better than everyone here.

And then I started rationalizing because I can have just one drink if life necessitates it. Plus I'm kind of a dick when it comes to people who believe in god because I think its childish so then i put people in a box. 

I've promised him that I'd go to another meeting tomorrow and try not to be so judgy. 

Idk what to do because while I know I'm going nowhere drinking it still seems like the best way to deal with all my problems.

I know the drinking doesn't fix the student loan debt that I have and can't pay and I know that it won't get me unfired. And it won't magically improve my writing. But damn it feels good to just forget. 

Any advice is welcome.

	<TEXT> I'm sure my life is much less than it could be if I didn't drink. I'm sure I've lost a job at one of the largest companies and most well known companies in the world because of my drinking. And I'm sure that it isn't normal for me to drink like 6 drinks a night and barely feel anything. 

And I've recently developed the problem of when I have my first beer of the day my hands get shakey until I drink more. But not before. Its weird Idk if that ever happened to anyone else. 

My question is does it get better. Will I ever get over the stink of my past job ruining past. If I stop drinking and things don't change what's the point. I'd be living a shit life with no distraction. 

So basically anyone who ever screwed up big time were you able to get back to where you should have been? Or better. 

I probably sound like an asshole. And I am one because I am holding on to alcohol like it is some kind magic that will keep my life from sucking. </TEXT>

My car is making a weird noise once I get over 30mph. The video above is the car on the highway at 40 to 50 mph. 

Its a Plymouth voyager 2000. 

It started making this sound about the time I ran over a rather heinous pot hole. 

I think it may be a CV joint problem or possibly the tires are unbalanced buy before I spend a lot of dough I wanted to run it by you all. also one of my front tires has a dent in it. I think it may be a bubble. 

Any feedback is appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm trying to get out of here, NYC by the end of June to not have to pay July rent. I'm looking for apartments on line but I'm scared to 1) sign a lease over the internet and 2) getting screwed. 

So far most of the rentals that I've liked are by cpm. I'm trying to spend the least for a 2 br. I can until I find employment over there. I think 700$ is a good price, I'm not 100% on that. 

I'm trying to find apartments or houses for rent that aren't long leases so if it sucks I'm not in roachville for 12 months or hood island for 12 months. 

I am willing to pay someone to inspect the apartments but in the meanwhile does anyone know where one can find rentals for Omaha? I'm looking for a 2 br. In a neighborhood that doesn't have constant shootouts </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in NYC (the land of high taxes, annoying jerks, and so many hidden fees). And have had a hard time finding work for the past year or so. and since we were all done with our college and we hate NYC anyways we started trying to decide to leave the area. 

I read an article about the 20 best cities to start over again in this economy and out of all of them Omaha seemed to be the best one. It beat out Idaho Falls, Idaho and Columbia, MO as well as Jacksonville, FL (my spouse loves Disney and wanted to go to Florida for that). 

However, I've never been there and my kid has autism. i read there was a very good private autism education and supposedly Federal Laws guarantee special education so that should be okay. 

But I'd be moving there with one 1 week trip to go find apartments and such and with none of us having any jobs. 

So my question is, Is it A) hard to get a job in Omaha? (I know that unemployment is at 3.7% over there or 4.2% or something but is it easy for someone with a degree to find a job, any job). and B) is it nice over there? Anything you hate? and C) is it easy to find apartments? is North Omaha really as bad as they say? Keep in mind I'm from NYC and have lived in some sketchy neighborhoods.  </TEXT>
