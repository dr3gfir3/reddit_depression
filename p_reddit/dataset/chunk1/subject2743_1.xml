	<TEXT> Is this pay to win or what?

Like many others I've followed the development of this game for a long time, hoping it would be a zombie survival game that blew DayZ out of the water and confined games like WarZ to distant bad memories. But having read player reviews and viewed streams it seems SOE went against the original stand point and airdrops seem to be game breaking and reinforce the view this is pay to win.

As this EA I'm hoping SOE will tune it to make it more fair but before I dive it and buy it can I have some less hysteric opinions on H1Z1 and if it really is pay to win? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not about the game so much, more why I should pay for EA. Maybe I phrased it badly.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know it will be far from polished, as I say I played DayZ sa for a fair bit. I just can't get my head round paying to make a game better for people who will play for free eventually. I was hoping for some kind of badge at least ;) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Convince me to buy EA and not wait for it to become F2P?! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I played a fair bit of DayZ SA until I got bored with its limitations and have liked the look of H1Z1 since I first saw it announced. But I can't work out why it's worth paying for EA when eventually it will be free to everyone. 

I know you get the enjoyment of helping to develop and drive the game forward but will those who pay get any advantages or bonuses when the game moves to full release and F2P.

I really want to get it but just can't see why I should pay when it's ultimately free in the future. </TEXT>
