	<TEXT> I think the fact that "intelligence" can be interpreted differently by different people is a prime argument as to why diversity wouldn't necessarily suffer.

	<TEXT> Not to be unnecessarily going against the movement here, but I feel as though important discussions should not occur here because we aren't inherently notified of them happening. The benefit of modmail was that you'd get a notification knowing when an important discussion was happening, whereas now we'd have to rely on checking /r/futurologymoderators daily to see if something comes up.

It's a standard push (modmail) vs pull (r/futurologymoderators) argument.

I think having imp. convos here would dramatically decrease involvement. Am I missing something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it all comes down to ingrained beliefs. As humans, we have this fundamental understanding that our lifespan is finite..there is a start and an end. The notion that we can somehow "solve" a natural biological process is a belief that exceeds what the average person is willing to consider possible.

But at the end of the day, once people are able to live enhanced lives..I think the general population won't be able to resist themselves </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed, but whether or not that would be considered "bad news" depends on whose perspective you are looking from. Would it cut jobs? Absolutely. But that same cut in construction costs could also lead to a boom in development and ultimately stimulate the new creation of tons of jobs elsewhere, including new types of construction jobs that we haven't even imagined yet.

	<TEXT> This was a great suggestion :). I think maybe I'll explore this structure next time.

Only issue that I foresee though is that other people's original comments will get scattered throughout, and 75% of the people won't even realize how the structure has changed. So instead of having 1 comment with all links that rises to the top 50% of the time, the order might unfortunately end up something like...

1. Discussion around article 1
2. Witty remark about drones
3. Someone asking where the hell all the sources are?
4. Funny comment that everyone upvotes
5. Discussion around article 2

etc  </TEXT>

If it takes a certain level of "mumbo jumbo" to help get critical science and technology research into the mainstream eye and ultimately push additional funding, I see no problem with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The image is custom created, it's not a "watermark" that is slapped onto something that someone else made (like 9Gag). It's quite simply the same as attributing credit to the creator. The "logo" has been there since the beginning, and the reference to the site is because I have received 100+ messages from people who want to receive the images via email. Something that Reddit does not offer.

Finally, my top link every single time has a link to every single source as well as every single Reddit conversation about each story. Unfortunately I can't fit the url for every story in the image itself. I had linked to a clickable image for a while, but unfortunately people got upset at linking to a page on the site and so now I just link to a jpeg. 

Again, if you have issues feel free to message me and I'm sure we can work them out :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey there, you seem to have a major issue with this so I'll just clarify a few things for you :).

1. I don't take the posts from the "front page". They are sourced from across the internet, many of which are on Reddit and don't have more than a handful of upvotes.

2. I don't "make money" off this. I link to a jpeg file on my site, where this is no branding, ads or anything. Hell the entire site is very cashflow negative and doesn't make a penny. Actually that's not true. A guy once tipped me $5 via Coinjar or w/e it's called. That was a good day.

3. There is a "futurism" brand at the bottom to simply signify who makes it. Some of the other times it's filled with other cool stuff, like links to video versions of the content. Why is there a problem with getting recognition for custom created content, especially when it's not being monetized at all? 

Happy to have a 1 on 1 chat if you'd like to resolve it. Just PM me :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I couldn't agree with you more. It's interesting because if you do the research, you'll find that a vaccine was actually developed a while ago, but due to some clinical issues it's pretty much only been in use by the military. </TEXT>

It was my mistake to have not clarified this, but I have edited it now :). I am always open to people proof-reading my work, and if you'd be so willing I'd love to have your help. Feel free to message me. </TEXT>
