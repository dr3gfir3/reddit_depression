	<TEXT> Once, In a random game on day 1 these 3 people started harassing another player saying they were evil, this person was town and got lynched which annoyed me, so i was vig and shot 2 of the three people doing it,
First one was jester and 2nd was mafioso
Was i throwing?
Because no town would rando lynch someone
EDIT: I did this after the person lynched explained in their will these people were using skype and targeted them after calling them out in another game. </TEXT>
