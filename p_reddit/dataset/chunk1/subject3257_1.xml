	<TEXT> Vapes are solid, but I don't know if it would be the most effective way. For serious pains I think you'd be better off looking into edibles or oils. Only real downside is it could get pretty expensive  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Issues with my game? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I've been playing RCT1 again and I've been going through the basic game scenarios just fine. However today I got around to installing the expansions and got around to messing with them. 

I completed one of the Loopy Landscape scenarios (Arid Heights), saved the game, and then quit to the main menu. I had a new level unlocked, as usual. So I turn the PC off and come back to play again later and notice my newly unlocked scenario is now locked and it says I haven't completed Arid Heights. 

Any idea why this is doing this? My save files are still there... but my career progress seems to reset whenever I quit the game

edit-
I'm running in Windows XP. RCT1 basic still works fine, just the expansions I'm having issues with

EDIT 2 - PROBLEM RESOLVED

Sorry to post a thread asking for help and then figure it out so quickly after. I have actually been messing with this issue for a while though haha. I also had it happen on another computer a long time ago and never figured it out. If anyone else is having this issue:


I ended up going to the 'Data' folder and found file "CSS0" (apparently this is career progress). I renamed it by just throwing an extra letter into the filename (made it "CSS0b" to be exact).

Closed the folder, opened my game, and noticed that all the missing information was now there and my old information was also still there. I loaded the Data folder back up and noticed it made another CSS0 file.. but still, all seems well. I've exited the game and relaunched it a few times now and the data shows up each time </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I got an older PC for free and would like advice on where to begin upgrading </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just got a free PC from a family member. It runs Win XP 2002 SP3 and it rocks a Pentium 4 CPU 200GHz 1.99GHz (unsure what that means) and 256MB of RAM. Also, it only has a 30gb hard drive. 

I think those are the basics that I should focus on but if anyone has any other ideas and wants to know other specs I'll try to figure them out. 

Anyway, any advice on what part I should consider upgrading? The cost to performance boost is what I'd be most concerned with, but I also want to try to spend as little as possible because I tend to be broke a lot. All I want to use this computer for is browsing the web and downloading things (I can do this fine but it can be laggy switching windows a lot), playing older PC games (I have Roller Coaster Tycoon 3 and it's a little buggy. I want to see how 1 runs), and making music (just really want to run a simple DAW, nothing too extreme) </TEXT>
