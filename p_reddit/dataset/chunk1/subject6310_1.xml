	<TEXT> So here's the trend i've been seeing since this years ToO launched. Guardians begging and pleading for a win. Messages such as...  
 nbsp;  
"we've never been to the lighthouse before, can you let us win so we can get there?"  
"just looking for a quick run through, could you guys jump off and let us through to the next match"    
"we're on our 8th win! never gone flawless before! could you please give it to us?"    
 nbsp;    
is this what its coming down to? I've replied to them with a courteous "sorry but we're also trying to get to the lighthouse"  and get messages back like     
fuck you  etc  
is anyone else getting these messages? are you ok with it?  
 nbsp;  
I know the difference of teams that have gone flawless letting people through when one of the other team's players disconnects but that decision is based on that team.   Asking guardians to step aside in the Trials of Osiris is not how its supposed to be.
