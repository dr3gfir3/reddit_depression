	<TEXT> He wasn't born! It was his uncles and aunties that got sent to death.

My grandad was imprisoned by the nazis but forced to work as he was a strong 17 year old. They kept him prisoner for four years, fed him next to nothing and beat him. 

He was a pretty crazy guy after. Drank a litre of vodka a day and smoked 20 cigarettes. He just was obviously deeply traumatised. But in them days you were expected to just get on with it.

Wasn't all bad though! It's a lovely story of how he met my grandma and they had a long and happy marriage  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of my dad's side of the family died in auschwitz. It is unimaginable that people can be so wicked. 

There was a comedy sketch i think it was Fry and Laurie that had the soldiers in SS style uniforms saying "look at the skulls on our uniforms, are you sure we are the good guys"

And like ISIS today. When they are there killing innocent people, like the nazis packing the gas chambers.....how on earth can people become so poisoned to believe such heinous acts are ok.

	<TEXT> I am a single dad to two girls.

Here are some things I had to learn (fast):

1. Youtube is a godsend for learning how to do girls hair. I have always shaved my head so had no idea how to do it. Now I can do pony tails buns and plaits

2. Periods. When they start its horrific.  She was too embarrassed to say, I only found out cos I went in the bathroom and there was blood everywhere she had obviously tried to clean up. I went to the shop, and after getting a basket full of sanitary towels like some sort of pic and mix, I just asked a woman in he aisle for advice on what to buy.

3. Enlist female help. I luckily have a sister who can help.

My eldest is also autistic so it's really hard sometimes. But you can do it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For over 20 years I have loved Stephen Kings work. However it is mostly disappointing how they put it into film.

The original Shining,  whilst a decent film, was not enough like the book. The remake miniseries was more like the book but with less likeable casting. 

Carrie, I like both the original and the remake! 

Under the Dome was so boring to watch...

Hearts in Atlantis the film just had no real feel of the book to me.

I cannot wait to see It when it comes out...the trailer does look good!

I would love to see -

A good adaptation of Insomnia, Dr Sleep, firestater A The Talisman  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Watched one the other week,  called cruel summer.

Its basically a true story of an autistic boy who crosses paths with some horrible people.

It disturbed me. Maybe not a typical horror, but psychological horror... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys, 

I don't really like MC as a whole, and can't believe I wasted so much money upgrading the farm...but I have almost made the money back. 

Here is what I do. Do two runs of stealing supplies (i just steal a merry weather helicopter and it takes a couple of minutes. This usually gives between 2 and 4 bars of supplies. I then sell this usually for 60-70,000. I do all deliveries in public sessions solo. I have only had one delivery destroyed!

Completely agree the delivery missions in vans and bin wagon are completely awful. Why would a motorcycle club use the slowest vehicles???

Rockstar should allow you to sell your business if you don't want it!

	<TEXT> Literally the best revenge film ever is Dead Man's Shoes in my humble opinion.

If you have not seen it. Prioritise seeing it. It is british film at its best. 

And some of the revenge dished out is insane. The script is fantastic with so many memorable lines </TEXT>

The meal we have at around 12 noon,  we call dinner or lunch. 

And as it is the north. It is correct.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its so annoying. I would say 9/10 i have issues connecting or staying connected to sessions and just comes up saying Rockstar Server error.

Thought it was my internet so tried a range of other more demanding games for Internet usage and no problems whatsoever.

	<TEXT> Im two years separated now...i have two kids. Seriously my relationship with my kids has grown spectacularly since not being with my ex.

When I lived there i couldnt bear to be around her so isolated myself with my computer in a different room, avoided going home and that sort of thing. 

Best thing ever to separate. All parties involved are happier now! </TEXT>
