	<TEXT> Andre, can you use the street smarts you gained from the wire to help me with my problem?

I was in a crowded train station and I really had to use the bathroom (#2). I hated to do it but I had no choice. I went in the gross bathroom and began my business. Then some guy kicked open the door, took a picture of me, and said it was going on the internet! Then he said to give him my email and he will give me the link. I thought if I knew where it was I could tell the police the address so I gave him my email address. I didn't want to risk my wife or family or coworkers to see it! He sent me an email that said he changed his mind and wasn't going to post it as long as I gave him a bunch of people I knew's email addresses. He said so he could sell them Herbalife products. I figured it would be better that they got a spam email rather then see me on the toilet so I gave him a list. Then he sent EVERYONE on the list the pic of me on the toilet, including my wife and children, my friends and coworkers and my boss. There was also a fake audio clip of gross sound! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can code a program that will help me with my workplace bullies? I work in a somewhat hostile workplace. It's an office setting but I think it is unusual in the large number of bad people who work there. One morning I woke up and decided I wasn't going to take it anymore, so I set out to make things right. The first bully was Walter. He bullied everyone by hanging out in the mens bathroom all day and making horrid noises and odors. Every time I tried to use the bathroom he was in there. He told me once that he had an irritable bowel, but I know he thinks it's so funny to make people hear and smell gross things. Sure enough he was in a stall when I came in. I figured, if he wants to be in the stall, he should have some reading material. I banged on the stall door and he asked what was the problem, so i said "i got the newspaper for you, hot off the presses!", then I lit the newspaper on fire and threw it over the stall door and ran out. Next time he wants to hang out in the stall all day, he'll surely remember this incident. The next bully was Greg. Greg was the work gym bully. He is 60-70 years old but insists on standing around naked in the mens locker room, forcing everyone to see him nude. It's a real passive aggressive bullying behavior. Outside the gym was a pile of pulled weeds that some gardeners were working on. I took a large handful of weeds and dirt on my way into the gym. I went into the locker room and he was just getting out of the shower. I yelled "hey Greg, welcome to the garden of Eden!" And jammed the handful of weeds in his face! He started yelling and lashing out at me so I ran out, bullies can turn to violence to abuse others and I didn't want to risk injury. There were more bullies I stood up to, but I don't want to make a wall of text. Thank you. </TEXT>

All of a sudden I see some shadows moving in an alley. Three assailants rushed out at us, they were armed with semi automatic weapons. I drew my weapon and fired 4 shots in 1 second. The three assailants went down, each with a head shot. The fourth bullet hit their getaway driver, disabling him. </TEXT>

There is very little chance that a legitimate situation to be carrying a gun will arise, but they wish to carry them anyway as it makes them feel powerful like a real soldier in a war zone. Of course, they are too scared to be actual soldiers. </TEXT>

I checked ur proof pic and noticed you have very batlike features. Not unattractive, just more similar to a bat then I would expect from random chance, especially the eyes. Considering you are also a bat researcher, it seems like to much of a coincidence. Care to reveal any genetic testing/alternations/hybridization that you may have underwent? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi PF, I'm interested in buying a upper floor condo in a very hip downtown area in northern NJ. It's in high end area popular with young go getters, and has lots of nice amenities. The cost is $800,000. I'm 26 and make about $200,000 a year base salary, plus up to 20% bonus. I am also given a car and most meals, so I can save a lot of my income. I also have a brokerage worth about $100,000, which generates another $5000 per year. I have about $100000 in cash for a down payment. The area seems like it will only continue to improve. Does this sound like a good investment? </TEXT>

The president of FX Crate came into the office and slammed the sales report on the saleswoman's desk. "We haven't sold enough FX Crates this quarter!" His muscles buldged as he yelled. The saleswoman stood up, and her large breasts were evident. "I don't care about FX Crates anymore, only our love!" she yelled. The two embraced, and the foundation of the building rocked with their passion. A crate fell to the ground near their feet. An order form fell out, it revealed that they had sold enough FX Crates.
