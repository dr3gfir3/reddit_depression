	<TEXT> I was impressed by this episode when it originally aired it because it was willing to take a comedic look at differences in beliefs at Christmas and poke fun of people's prejudices without much fear.

Plus, the resolution of the show was hey, even though we believe different things, we can all come together to beat the crap out of bully douchebags, including Anthony Michael Hall.

This show is consistently solid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm all for dumb fun, and good mindless disaster popcorn.  But if it's an actual produced movie and not a YouTube video of stuff falling over or exploding, I'd like some semblence of a cohesive plot and maybe some acting for my 10 bucks.  

You know all that hype about the Mayans and the prophecy and 12-21-12?  They focus on that heavily for about an hour... then throw it out completely.  Turns out the world doesn't end then, it's really like late summer or something, whenever the Olympics are taking place.  The Mayans aren't even mentioned the last 90 minutes of the movie, the whole premise of the movie that they put on the posters and all the promotional materials is completely abandoned for shitty acting, reaction shots, and of course, saving a puppy.

All foreign characters are cheap ethnic stereoypes.  The whole thing drips of American arrogance throughout.  I was ashamed watching it.  Makes Michael Bay look subtle and skilled in comparison. </TEXT>

Mind you, they are archaeologists who painstakingly assemble a massive collection of artifacts from throughout the globe and then position them perfectly... so that every last one of them is destroyed when their ship takes off.

Awful, awful script. </TEXT>
