	<TEXT> When I was at my worst stage of depression - actively suicidal, apathetic to the world, and detached from how other people felt towards me - I felt it was so, so very selfish of my parents to try to keep me living. To tell me that *I* was selfish for considering suicide was insulting. My entire mindset of the time was the product of a deep depression, where I was turning my thoughts inward so much that I became self-absorbed and unable - not unwanting - to care about how others would feel if I were to die. Yet, now, I've a lot more stable from therapy, meds, and exercise, and I mostly disagree with what I used to think. I guess what I'm trying to say is that the desire to commit suicide  can overpower your normal idea of morals and rational thought.


**TL;DR** Depression sucks. Suicide, even if you mull it over for a long time, is a decision by an unhealthy mind and isn't rational in the end. :( </TEXT>
