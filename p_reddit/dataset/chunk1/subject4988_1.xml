	<TEXT> In fact, a slap of caffeine is what truly defines a power nap.  It does work well, but make sure you don't oversleep!  Also, I'd recommend either chugging at least 4 cups of coffee or drinking an energy drink instead of just drinking one cup of coffee.  You'll want 200mg of caffeine (or more, if you're fairly tolerant to it like me), and all the fluids + diuretics will make you really want to get up and pee when your alarm goes off--as was mentioned [before](http://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/xz7uy/when_you_have_to_get_up_early_in_addition_to/).

EDIT: I think I a word there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do physicists have a good generalized method for modeling the trajectory of something as complicated as ssDNA?  If so, that's amazing--I've always regarded biophysics as too complex and inelegant for me to understand, but I guess in theory... it seems pretty cool! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Should I care about the fundamental theorem of linear algebra? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I've taken a basic linear algebra and self-studied matrix algebra before that. I understand the importance of linear algebra and quantum mechanics--but what about the fundamental theorem? I recall that it was extremely *elegant* and such, but I could never quite grasp the beauty of it.

If it is important, anybody care to give an explanation of why, and how it is applicable to physics?  Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You certainly have a point. If you know that the situation is turning awkward, you'll want to hide it--I generally try to stay calm and make a decent amount of eye contact and smile slightly. But still, I don't think I would have tossed in that last statement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I second this.  Look ahead to where you're going... the farther you look, the better.  Note that you'll need to have an okay sense of balance (for the drink you're carrying).

My mom taught me this and a bunch of other tips since she used to be a waitress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For example, I went up to two girls to chat with them about their choice of Starbucks drinks a few days ago.

I told them, Hey I really think youre the two most interesting looking people here. I mean you even have an interesting choice of drinks there.

At this point, I ran out of things to say. I could feel that this was going to be uncomfortable but I presented an aura of calmness in my lack of certainty. I decided to tell them, See, awkwardness isnt so bad when you allow it to happen as it is without judging it as awkward. They smiled and nodded. I basked in the awkwardness comfortably and told them that it was nice meeting them. I had to get going.

I'm not really sure if I would label this "conversation" a success. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will probably get buried, but I woke up inside a U-Haul with two passed out friends.  When I asked what was going on, he lifted an eye, muttered, "We're going to Mars," and promptly passed out again.

It turns out that while drunk, I had agreed to go help my friends buy and move a piano the next morning.  I live in Pittsburgh, PA, and we were picking up the piano in Mars, PA (about an hour away).  The piano was only $20, and we bought it from an old couple so I think they were simply trying to get rid of it without having to pay for transportation costs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm also interested in group theory! Though right now, I'm reading Pinter's *A Book of Abstract Algebra* since I know next to nothing about this stuff.  I'm about to enter my senior year of undergrad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will it be hard?  Sure.  Too hard?  Not if you work harder.

Honestly, staying busy and on the tip of your toes is one of the best things you can do in college.  Be careful not to burn out and lose interest in any of your commitments, but I think you'll have a much more fulfilling experience than if you sit around with tons of free time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that it would be better to learn about classical mechanics first.  You'll need to know some basic calculus, but I highly recommend this lecture series: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL189C0DCE90CB6D81 feature=plcp

After that, Susskind continues on a second series about quantum mechanics. </TEXT>
