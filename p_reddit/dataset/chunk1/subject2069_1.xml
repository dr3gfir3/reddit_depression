	<TEXT> It was madness! When me and my girlfriend did the viewing it was winter and nighttime (in Scotland, this means it's DARK outside). So when we went in, every room had lights on except the bedroom which just had a shady little corner lamp. We asked her why this was and she said "oh the bulbs have gone" - no worries we thought. So when we bought the place I looked up and thought, wait a minute - that's a chandelier with like 6 bulbs, what are the odds all 6 have gone? But, I gave her benefit of the doubt and went out and bought 6 bulbs and (obviously) still no luck.

I phoned her and asked why she lied, she hung up (she's in her 50s/60s btw) and then my phone rang and it was her son saying we're lying and to stop accusing his mum because she definitely didn't say the bulbs were out.

I said to him that:

1. He wasn't there.
2. Both myself and my girlfriend were there.
3. Why does she even have an unwired light and light switch in that room if not for the purpose of tricking perspective buyers?

He got more hostile so I just gave up as it just seemed like a case of he said/she said.

Luckily that's the only issue I've had with the house since buying it... Touch wood. </TEXT>

Are there no grants for people in your situation? 

I know it sucks but genuinely I think the older you get you realise that your parents just happen to be normal people who you happen to have been given birth from. They're equally as flawed, stubborn and (at times) stupid as your friends, your neighbours, your enemies, etc. Obviously it sucks to not be close to your parent, but them not accepting who you are is no different than, say, a stranger. Bigots will be bigots, IMO. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha sorry for the confusion, what I mean is;

Yes, ceilings (not roofs, my bad, I wrongfully use those terms interchangeably) are flush by definition, but I mean when I unscrewed the chandelier the previous owner had on the ceiling it was still flush, there were no wires, no holes to a cavity containing wires or any electronics, etc. She'd literally bought a chandelier and just screwed it arbitrarily to the ceiling to give the appearance of having working lights.

Similarly when I removed the light switch in this same room there was just a cavity behind it, but no wiring of any sort - again it was for show.

Does that clear up what I mean? If not, tell me and I'll try again! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bought a house and the bitch (previous owner) had screwed a chandelier to a flush roof (no wiring) and I took the light socket off the wall and there was no wiring there either.

Got a quote from a joiner but it worked out cheaper to just buy a hue system; so far I have:

Bedroom: light strip and bloom
Living room: 4 downlighters and whatever the bigger bloom one is called
Kitchen: 3 bulbs in hanging lights

I really like it. The 3 bulbs in the kitchen I set to blue, yellow, blue and as they hang down it almost makes the light fixtures like an ornament.

As I had no light switch in the bedroom being able to turn lights on and off from my phone, as well as just having lighting in general in the bedroom is awesome.

The downlighters in the living room I keep on white (could have bought the cheaper bulbs there!) but let me tell you, since installing these bulbs we never use the big overhead light, white light is so much better and airy feeling than normal yellow bulbs.

Yes, they were expensive, but if they last the 10/15 years quoted, I'm more than happy with them.  Would definitely recommend.

	<TEXT> From a non judgemental point of view, it sounds like you're insinuating that because we can't explain those things that it's logical to just assume that one single entity created everything.

Remember that hundreds of years ago people couldn't explain gravity, the sun, illness, and similarly attributed it to the will of some higher power.

That's not to say God isn't real, but I feel like religion came around at a time where people were more lawless and were perplexed by the world around them so had to create something to explain the unexplainable and keep their peers in check. Now that science has advanced by light years, we still hang on to these archaic beliefs. </TEXT>

Bearing in mind when a computer "sees" a song it'll see a single wavetable, what you're speaking about would entail accurately dissecting this into its individual components, like unbaking a cake back into its constituent ingredients. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This game could have been so good - set in the same world as the phantom pain (don't even really need to generate new maps) but you're a team of 4 soldiers who need to build a small jungle style base. Occasionally you get tipped off guards are surrounding your encampment and need to survive as a team. Sometimes you need to go break into other facilities and steal equipment without being seen or, at least, without being followed back.

One member of the team could optionally/rarely be recruited by cipher (for bonus points) and they have hidden objectives to sabotage your missions or even try slyly kill a member. There could have been a mechanic where there's a way to mark someone as a traitor but it has dire consequences if you're wrong, so not everybody just does it all the time. </TEXT>

Also, Konami just need to get David Hayter back in for a decent length cameo, say snake almost does rescue them but the team believe it's not actually snake and evade him, and they'd be quids in.

At this point, the zombie trope is done to death. </TEXT>

People will have a lot more efficient training regimes and diet plans in modern times as we have a much better understanding of the human anatomy.

There will of course come a time when times get set that can't be beaten, but I think another factor is that these athletes train for years with the current world record in their crosshairs as the time to beat so push themselves to beat it, which means as time goes on athletes are pushing themselves harder than the previous generation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apologies for the bad example.

What I'm trying to say is, I'm not speaking about transphobic people who would flip about and become violent, nor am I speaking about trans allies who are fully accepting and understanding.

There is a middle ground of people who are nice to everybody regardless of sex, race, sexuality, but perhaps who would not choose to have sex with a trans person knowingly.

Let's not forget that the definition of a bigot is someone intolerant of people who hold different opinions - which in this case, would be you.

To some people a transgender persons gender is open to interpretation - genetically you're born one way, emotionally you're born another - it's not your decision which camp they fall into, although in an ideal world everyone should be accepting.

I think my ramblings can best be summarised by what someone said above: the key to informed consent is all parties being informed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not at all like that, though. The underlying issue is that not everybody views trans people as their preferred gender - whether that's right or wrong is another issue. But it means that, without disclosure of their trans status, a man could find out he's just unknowingly had sex with a "man" (mtf transgender) - which would make him feel like he's just had gay sex.

This isn't something that I agree with, but you have to appreciate that everybody has different moral stand points. 

It's akin to telling a devout Christian you've legally married them to have sex with them but you didn't actually file the correct paperwork. Sure, both sides are having consensual sex and may enjoy it, but finding out about something after the fact could cause somebody extreme emotional distress. 

I think it's hugely important that everybody accepts trans people for who they are, but it's equally important that trans people accept that not everybody does and that it's their decision to make. I'm not saying you need to go about telling everyone, but surely if you're about to have sex with someone they deserve to make an informed decision? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Firstly - As stated, I don't agree with the law - quite the opposite, I've said I disagree. Im just looking at it from both standpoints.

Secondly, the things you've mentioned are things that a person may oppose in their partner. But sleeping with someone transgender MAY cause a person to morally violate them self.  As strongly as transgender allies believe transgender people are the sex they desire to be, imagine someone on the opposite end of the spectrum unknowingly had sex with someone transgender, they will feel like they've had sex with someone outwith their sexuality. 

Just having a balanced debate here!

	<TEXT> I do see your point, and your point is valid - however, I think it's slightly different.  

The issue isn't that transgender people have (or have not) had surgery - it's that not everybody's ideologies align and some people would not knowingly choose to sleep with somebody who is transgender and wouldn't therefore feel wronged if they did so unknowingly. Obviously not everybody feels this way, but impossible to know in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do agree with you all that this is unjust, however I can almost see what the law is aiming toward.  

I appreciate that while transgender individuals may be at peace with their gender, however people who you sleep with may be less so. The choice for consensual sex should always be with respect for both parties and with all cards on the table.

However, I do understand the flip side of this - that it becomes like nazi Germany with the Jewish having to wear the Star of David to identify themselves to others.  Where is the middle ground?

I think it shouldn't be classed as rape, however, if you fear that telling someone you're transgender may put them off sleeping with you, then perhaps that person is not a good sexual partner in the first place? Obviously that's difficult to know in advance and your safety is the paramount concern here. 

This is a tough one  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My biggest concern that is putting me off buying the game is that, with randomly generated planets, won't there be a lack of exploratory depth compared to say, fall out 4, for example? 

Is there some payoff to the grinding, or is it grinding for grindings sake?

Congratulations on your success for making your vision a reality and for the huge sales you'll undoubtedly achieve.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, sexuality, like gay, straight, bi, etc. Like, growing up, if someone male was effeminate it was assumed they were gay, it really wasn't ever talked about that they could be trans, etc. 

Then, watching that Louis Theroux documentary with young kids, I realised "oh, there's other possibilities and attributes out there". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anyone know how to clean a wooden table? I had a BBQ and the next day there was a bottle cap shaped black mark on my kitchen table. Not sure if it had been in the fire and was heated so it's burned into the table (unlikely as someone would have had to carry a hot bottle cap), if it was wet and this is some sort of water stain, or if it's rust or some other chemical reaction between the wood and metal?

Cheers! </TEXT>

Even though I didn't get it before but feel I understand better now, I've never been against peoples' freedom to choose who they want to be, it's sad that some people try fit everyone into their idea of normal.

I'm fairly happy though as I had the oil job straight from university so I'm going to use this opportunity to broaden my horizons and learn new skills. Oil won't last forever, can't hurt to make contacts elsewhere. You can always jump back into oil when it picks back up? Or even try this new job and if you hate it then quit?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You mistake me - I have no issue "admitting" I'm gps spoofing, I am and that's why I'm providing gps coordinates as it's the only reference I know for these locations. You are insinuating that I'm encouraging others to do the same - I'm not, I'm simply providing locations of Pokemon for people to use as they choose, I'm not saying everyone should visit all 3 locations, but perhaps there's a Japanese person reading this as well as an American, etc.

I know it can be tempting to shit all over people trying to be helpful when you take your daily excursion out from under your bridge, but if the coordinates are of no use to you perhaps you could have just kept scrolling? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't worry about your lack of friends; I'd say out of my 20 closest friends maybe only 1 or 2 are from when I was your age, the rest came from university onwards. 

For your attention span problem, that's something you'll need to work on yourself - set goals, small at first with achievable targets, and visualise the steps you'll need to take to achieve them. 

In terms of worrying about money - you're 14, most 14 year olds have very little money (pocket money, minimum wage part time job, etc). It's good you have a goal (youtube), but perhaps you need to acknowledge that at 14 you're not going to have loads of cash and, instead, use that as motivation to become more goal orientated so that in future you get a high paying job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair in this situation it sounds like you're being quite petulant - maybe the actual temperature change would annoy you, but a monthly expense change of $14 is very little and, presumably, in the long run you're saving a lot more by halving the rent? Also, trying to tell someone how many plugs to have in is pretty OTT - who sets the limit at what's acceptable? What if they came into your room and saw you had 3 plugged in and told you to cut it down to 2, etc? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha I was on Dragonmaw and I remember this! I remember how insanely notorious he was at the time, so much so that now, ten years later, I decided to google "Bennito is a ninja" and this article came up!

Although, from word of mouth, I'd always heard that he'd ninja looted out of Major Domo's chest.  I guess that's part of the chinese whispers that occur with notoriety.

Good story, man! </TEXT>
