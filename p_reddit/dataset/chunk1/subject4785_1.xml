	<TEXT> Hello bigs, littles, middles, and more! I'm a Daddy from California, 33, white, single. I've been into the DDLG scene for most of a year now, but it's all been online. I finally made a reddit account and decided to join up this DDLG subreddit.

I look forward to learning and growing with you all! </TEXT>
