	<TEXT> It's also largely a matter of public perception, which is fed insatiable tales of mayhem performed by 'addicts', both in every form of popular culture and in the so-called news media. If we spent more time engaging with real problems and issues and less time identifying segments of our population as 'other' in order to create a a conflict, there might be some forward movement towards thinking about the hypocrisy inherent in our current system of worldwide prohibition. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much the same at all Ivy League schools, once you're in you're guaranteed to graduate with good marks unless you're just really lazy, it's because they have such faith in themselves and don't want to cast any kind of bad light on their admissions process, or like, admit they admitted students who could like, fail. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's only a "joke" because it doesn't have a real big diversity of vendors (for reasons you might be more well versed in than I), which means it doesn't have a whole lot of users, which i would have assumed would have been more of a problem back when it was I2P only, which the idiots and dilletantes out there couldn't be bothered to figure out despite it being essentially point and click so long as your brain isn't utterly deformed, and while I agree that support is lacking in many areas, it is more than just a concept if people were willing to have a bit more faith in it, no risk of coins being stolen EVER, and all it would really need are some screenshot-guides for noobs who can't be bothered to ever like, you know, figure something out instead of mashing a button. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Considering how tight the blue wall of silence is with the NYPD, it's not entirely unrational to conclude that anyone whistleblowing MUST be crazy, or at least delusional since to conclude otherwise one would have to realize that the entire department, hell the entire CULTURE of modern NYPD policing is corrupt from top to bottom, with one set of laws for the police and their associates in law enforcement and the military and one set of laws for everyone else. Until until the training and toxic culture of these militarized police departments is seriously examined by people on the outside, there will continue to be a gulf-like divide from the population and those ostensibly serving to protect and serve them.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The thing about LOST was that, we as viewers know we're watching a show with actors and we suspend our disbelief if the fiction is good enough, and especially for the first season, maybe two or two and a half seasons, the show was really great fiction, but like the X-Files before it, LOST collapsed under the weight of its own distended mythology. And what happened was the characters, no matter how fully realized or articulated or conflicted or REAL they seemed, were flailing about in a context which had no internal consistency or plan, which made their actions, and ultimately themselves lose any meaning for the audience. 

Of course, it's the characters stupid, to paraphrase Stephen King, but it's also the context of those characters, and while mystery is interesting, what LOST exposed is that there needs to be an endgame planned from the start </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are these people who claim to be depressed. Okay? Apparently in this land of plenty. This richest nation in the history of the world (we're so proud of saying that). Some super markets have a hundred thousand items in them. We have 19 million americans claiming to be depressed, and some of them take medicine for it. Sometimes the medicine for it makes one of them commit suicide, and that depresses the shit out of the rest of them. Then you only have these people that think they're depressed. They think they're depressed, because they saw the commercial on TV, and the doctor looked like a good guy, the music sounded kind of peppy. And what the fuck? Probably some of these pills would pick me right the fuck up. Totally fucking hopeless mindset - in the fucking pyramid.

Up at the very top we are guna put the people who are truly sick. The terminally ill. Unforchanetly no hope for a lot of them. Hundreds of thousands of them - no cure for what they have. Some of them there's no cure, because no ones looking for one. Aint enough people sick with it, so there's no money in the cure. Then there's people where there's a cure, but they don't have the money for it. Then there's one who can, but they're to far gone. Then there's one who can get the cure, but they have no social means to get to it so these people aint going anywhere - they should be allowed to commit suicide.

Boom!
