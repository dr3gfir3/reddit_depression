	<TEXT> We got to see Levi be badass, that was a fun scene. He seems unaffected by the death of his soldier, but he's still willing to get covered in blood to comfort him in his last moments.
Also love the scene in the Titan's belly, it's the perfect amount of cheesy and Vogel im Kafig may be my favorite song in this series aside from the OP and EDs.

Armin and Mikasa are willing to put their lives in danger to protect Eren, even when everyone else thinks he's a monster (which he is). It really shows the bond between them better than any monologue would. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Adding on to otaku34's comment, he also has a movie coming up called [Yoru wa Mijikashi Arukeyo Otome](https://myanimelist.net/anime/34537/Yoru_wa_Mijikashi_Arukeyo_Otome?q=yoru%20wa%20mij) with a visual style really similar to Tatami Galaxy and the writer of the source material also wrote the novel that Tatami Galaxy is based on. In terms of art style, his other work isn't really similar to Tatami Galaxy as he likes to experiment with styles but they're all still worth checking out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you like moe comedies, then K-On, if you like drama, then Hibike Euphonium and if you like slow slice of lifes and detective fiction then Hyouka.

You can't really judge an entire studio's work based on one series by them, even if they rely on similar settings in most of them, they have different tones. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Caught up with you guys, I forgot how much I used to enjoy this series, I love the scene where Eren emerges and Mikasa runs to him crying. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone else already said what I had in mind (Hyouka ED 2) so I'll go with [Attack on Titan ED1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWUCdTngVjk) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Holden's suffered through some shitty things and he's generally lost and feels cut off from the rest of society, thinking that no one understands how he feels. I think a lot of people around his age can relate to his feelings (aside from the trauma). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you want something that doesn't look at all like a typical anime and can be kinda fucked up at times, then Kaiba. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like most things about Hyouka but I especially love the silly visual metaphors.
I dislike Monster because of how melodramatic it can be and some of the dialogue, I remember thinking sounded pretentious. And I dislike Kuzu no Honkai because the character's decisions only exist to further the drama. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I saw Ghost in the Shell recently and it still holds up pretty well. It's not consistently amazing but it's pretty good. From what I've seen of Akira it looks pretty gorgeous as well. Also, I don't think Makoto Shinkai movies really have good animation though. The backgrounds are what they look the best at and the animation is kinda dull and at times mechanical looking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty much anything by KyoAni (esp. Hibike, Hyouka, Nichijou and maybe K-On) and also, I think Mob Psycho 100 as well. Masaaki Yuasa works generally tend to have good animation as well, I think Kaiba and Tatami Galaxy have consistently good animation. Ping Pong's isn't bad either but it's not as consistent as the other two. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's definitely not a bad episode by any means, I don't think Hyouka has any (even 11.5, which alot of people seem to dislike) but I personally found it a bit underwhelming compared to the other episodes. </TEXT>

Best: The last one
Worst: The one where Oreki and Chitanda sit around and talk about the counterfeit notes when a student gets called to the principal's office. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From what I've seen of Danshi Koukousei no Nichijou, it's pretty similar to Nichijou. Nichijou does have moe but it's also a really good absurdist comedy with great animation and direction (It is by KyoAni after all).
