	<TEXT> Oh yeah I wasn't even considering paid stuff, I would do it for free :) my current choir is non-audition and I would like to join one that is more selective in the future. I auditioned for a couple choirs about 2 years ago and my current one is the only one I got in lol :( one of them was so selective that you had to audition by recording for a chance to audition in person, and the other made you sing an aria in German which I immediately backed out of. That was why I wanted to use O Mio Babbino Caro as an audition song for a selective choir but I guess it is completely wrong for me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They pay you to sing in a choir? I heard that even the Mormon Tabernacle Choir is volunteer and they're considered one of the best choirs out there.

There is a "professional choir" that once sang with my choir and the members were crazy good, but I thought professional just meant the conductor got paid and didn't share it with the members lol. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know Pavarotti started taking singing seriously at 19 (before that he was already singing, just not career driven) and for the first 6 years or so he couldn't land a single paying gig and spent his days selling insurance. And that's friggin Pavarotti. So you may be in for a hard time even if you do become an opera singer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That was my bad, I was responding on an iPhone last night and the screen was small so sometimes I hit voting options with my thumb without noticing. Fixed it now.

So if I work on the legato I should be good, right? My teacher said "this song is normally meant for a dramatic soprano but..." and she listed why she chose it anyway (length, tune, language). I'm not going to perform it live so I think it was just a practice song for fun. The other practice songs she assigned me were more musical theater (Think of Me, I Could Have Danced All Night, Aldonza, Don't Cry for Me Argentina).

	<TEXT> Is it a bad first aria? I've sung Think of Me for her several times before and Think of Me goes higher (Bb, this song only goes up to Ab)  plus she knows I have sung Messiah and Carmina Burana in choir and so I am at least used to singing classical even if my technique needs work.

She says she picked it because 1) It's short and 2) Tune is straightforward, no crazy runs and 3) It's Italian which is an easier foreign language

Here is me trying O Mio Babbino, I am clearly not singing opera-style but I *think* I can get it with a little more training? http://vocaroo.com/i/s0BunGjhvAub </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Once my choir hired these opera soloists for Messiah, and I thought the soprano soloist was very good whereas the alto was bad, but later during our next rehearsals the choir director said "The alto, tenor, and bass soloists were excellent, not going to say anything negative about anyone, let's leave it at that..." and gave us a sly smile.

So how can I tell if someone is good or bad? Do you have examples? I got my first aria in voice lessons this week (O Mio Babbino Cara) and I usually sing musical theater so I don't know what the hell I am doing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Einar was definitely a lot healthier (I mean healthy in the literal sense, as opposed to colorless and dying from losing too much blood after castration). Perhaps I had already seen Eddie Redmayne in too many movies, but to me it just seemed like Eddie Redmayne versus Eddie Redmayne in drag trying to play a transgender character.

I definitely see Gerda loved Lili until the very end, but Lili didn't seem to reciprocate that love after the transitioning started. Especially when there was the scene when they shared a bed and Lili insisted on putting a curtain between them. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Finally saw "The Danish Girl" last week. Mixed feelings about it. Lili seemed more crazy than genuinely transgender? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-08 00:28:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm not a big movie go-er but I love literature turned into movies, and therefore Eddie Redmayne has been cast in almost every movie I've seen. I loved him in Theory of Everything, Pillars of the Earth, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Les Miserables, etc.

So I decided to give The Danish Girl a try. And while there were definitely elements of the movie I enjoyed (Eddie Redmayne's character imitating the movements of the nude dancing girl were very enchanting) overall the movie made Lili come across as crazy with a split personality, as opposed to being actually transgender.

1. I've met people who are actually transgender, and even before they come out you do notice something inherently similar to the opposite sex in their personalities. I knew a boy in middle school who was very quiet and always spoke at little more than a whisper. His very movements--the way he dipped his head when he blushed, the way he collapsed his hands together just when sitting down--everything was very feminine. By high school this kid had come out as transgender and you weren't really surprised because you saw the femininity the whole time. Maybe it's because the movie cast Eddie Redmayne, but all I got was that this was a straight guy who, in the beginning, was completely comfortable with being a guy. Who was perfectly happy with being a guy. Who was sexually attracted to his wife. Female mannerisms did not come naturally to Lili; Lili had to make an effort to learn them. It seemed like more of a fascination with mimicking femininity than actually being female. When the wife says "My husband believes he is a woman inside...and I believe it too" my first thought was "You do? What are you seeing that I'm not seeing?" The only time I saw Lili as legitimately female-brained was when she was selling perfume with other women. The rest of the time, Lili just seemed like a guy with a split personality who WANTED to be female as opposed to legitimately being so.

2. Lili genuinely seemed happier and healthier pre-transition. Happy loving marriage, happy body imagine, happy wife, happy social status. Transitioning into Lili destroyed all of that. Lili caused the wife a lot of heartache, was unhappy with her body, was ostracized, endured a lot of physical agony in the castration process that cost him his life. If this movie was supposed to make the audience more understanding of transgender-ism then it failed miserably. The message it seems to convey is that if Lili had just accepted life as a guy then everything would have been fine and dandy.

3. The wife character was much more fleshed out than Lili. You end up sympathizing with the wife, to the point you start seeing Lili as a person with a sickness.

That being said, Alicia Vikander did a great job playing the wife. Eddie Redmayne is a fine actor, but there was something all wrong with how Lili was portrayed. He could convince me that *Lili* believed Lili was female, but that Lili was just the personal of a guy who had slowly gone insane over the course of the movie. </TEXT>

Another girl I knew in college (roommate) was romantically linked to a boy, one day after they had been dating for a month he told her it wasn't serious, she ended up crying every day, multiple times a day, for a month. Then during a drinking party he went up to her again, made a move on her, they had sex, and the next day he was disinterested in her again. Messed her up bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Could be more than just family problems, maybe you have something like Aspergers as well?

But I do have a story about never learning basic social skills, my social skills were absolutely terrible and I always wondered what was wrong with me growing up. I only knew other kids saw me as annoying. In college I played World of Warcraft and didn't have close friends. One day I realized even people in my guild didn't want to play with me. I asked why.

Woman: Because you make us feel bad.

Me: How?

Woman: Like when we did Violet Hold the other day, we were wiping there for two hours and were already frustrated, and then you found out and said "you're still doing that? Yesterday I did it and finished it in twenty minutes!"

I had no idea that it hurt other people's feelings or irritated them when I gave myself a little pat on the back when I talked because that's how my dad ALWAYS talked, and it took a stranger over the internet saying that before I suddenly realized you have to think about what the other person would feel when you speak. That other people aren't just preprogrammed robots but also have their own thoughts and feelings when they weren't talking. (Yes that is how bad it was - I thought I was the only one who had my own inner thoughts).

The revelation kind of blew my mind because my parents have zero empathy and I just saw insulting people and praising yourself as normal. I was 20 lol ;_;

The good thing about being 17 is you just have to hold your breath for a little bit longer. Avoid going home as much as you can. You will have plenty of excuses about how much you have to study. Your health is more important. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Growing up everyone considered me to be an uptight goody two-shoes and yet I was always doing stuff behind my mom's back because my mom was so damn crazy.

For example, wearing nail polish. My mom forbid me from wearing nail polish because she felt it took time to do nails (5 whole minutes!) and therefore I was wasting my time when I could be using that time to study. Once she caught me wearing nail polish when I was about 15 or so and she picked up the cleaver and threatened she would chop off my fingers if she caught me wearing nail polish again. When I was in college I would wear nail polish and then remember to take it off carefully right before coming home. 

And then there was every single other aspect of my life she tried to control. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Head voice is basically what female opera singers use. They practice in it a long time until it gets very strong. Maybe it isn't the genre for you if you want to belt like Idina Menzel, but that counts as part of your range if you are female.

Here is a good video that I wish I had seen years earlier:

	<TEXT> I was the same as you when I started. I refused to sing in head voice because I considered it cheating and meanwhile I used my breath support all wrong so I couldnt belt. I hated singing in head voice because it was so breathy and out of control. My lowest note was an E, so one note higher than yours (although some people say it doesn't count because it doesn't sound very musical when I get that low). Eventually I learned to use head voice and now my high notes are typical soprano range. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think your natural accent may have something to do with it, certain accents naturally seem more singing-friendly (like very clean Spanish) whereas I was farked in the beginning, my native accent being a specific Chinese dialect that you grunt at vocal fry and pitch through your nose.

	<TEXT> Ummmm your brother is CRAZY. That is nowhere near normal advice. And you won't get away with it, there are so many ways for cops to track you digitally that they will find this very post. Imagine what your daughter will think if you and your brother get arrested. And then there is the issue of killing someone in the first place...no. Just no. The very thought is fucked up.

I would recommend talking to a family   relationships counselor first on your own. They often have advice on how to get through tough times like these. Please do not ever badmouth your wife to your daughter, my parents are divorced and they badmouth each other to me frequently thinking they were hurting each other, but the real person they hurt was me because of the years of toxicity I had to endure growing up. I got diagnosed with clinical depression over my family problems in adulthood so that's how bad it got.

So the real issue is that she cheated on you. I get that you feel horribly betrayed and hurt because of it. But you are not alone - many marriages before yours have ended in infidelity.

My therapist had told me to try to cope with my own issues by writing a letter. Not necessarily sending it out, but writing out why it hurts you, what you choose to do with that letter will be up to you.

Lastly, I have been hurt too until all I wanted was to hurt someone back. I once signed a guy up for lots of spam emails lol. But ultimately it meant that as long as I was angry and planning ways to get back, I was fixated on him, you know what I mean?

Why is your wife cheating on you (not saying there is an excuse obviously but sometimes there is a cause) perfectly happy life and just selfish? Is she suffering from her own issues from her upbringing that caused her to be more screwed up as a person? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly, from my experience even if you ask for a raise you will just get a percentage increase over your current raise. I blieve the standard annual raise at my company is about 2% or 2.5% - I once did a crazy good job and was excessively praised by everyone, including my own manager, CEO loved me, but my salary increase was only 6.5% even though I straight up learned so many new skill sets. Hell I even moved from being a marketing peon to business analyst during that time because of how much Excel/Tableau I learned.

Generally the real salary increase is when you move from one job to another. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-05 06:55:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this happened to me a few months ago but I thought I would share.

I usually sing along to male singers pretty casually when I am listening to a song. I can go down to the D below the middle C so I reasoned I was practically tenor ranged.

I had never sung at a karaoke bar before and decided to try for the experience. I didn't think twice and selected I Wanna Hold Your Hand by The Beatles because I can sing along to them casually at home.

Well, I quickly learned that there is a difference between singing along to a song casually at speaking volume when you're home alone...and singing the same song on a stage, into a microphone loud enough so that it can project your voice over the music. I was going as loud as I could into the microphone, trying to push the sound out (a couple singers before me made it look so easy) and yet you just barely heard a faint muffled sound of my voice over the loud music. I realized quickly that it wasn't working but I couldn't just walk off the stage when so many people were watching, so I kept standing on stage, singing and singing soundlessly into a microphone for a very uncomfortable couple of minutes. Meanwhile everyone at the bar noticed I couldn't sing it out and started singing the song loudly themselves to try to help me out, and so the whole bar ended up singing along I Wanna Hold Your Hand. They were louder without the microphone than I was with the microphone. When the song ended they sympathy-cheered and I quickly got out of there because I was too embarrassed to stay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was born in Scotland, and my Mainland Chinese mom let a friend of hers name me. I therefore got a very unique old Scottish name that no American can spell. 

Then my mother moved to the US, and her friend passed away so I had only conversed with her through letters. So the only reason I knew how to pronounce my very unique Scottish name was because it was how my mom pronounced it.

So thanks to the internet, it finally occurred to me to searchYoutube for a video of how Scottish people pronounce my name so I can hear whether it was the legit pronunciation. Now I find out my name has a dipthong! I always thought you were just supposed to ignore the second letter! Man I've been pronouncing my name wrong my whole life. I don't know if I should correct my pronunciation from now on or just stick with the incorrect one because that's how I know myself. </TEXT>

-The class aspect (tank, dps, heals)
-Detailed graphics
-Magical powers like fireballs and curses, robes, all that fantasy stuff
-Raids/partying
-Warsong Gulch battlegrounds/PvP
-You could make pretty female characters and have them fight while wearing dresses (DON'T JUDGE, I NEED THIS!)

What I didn't like in games:
-Mind numbing quests, I prefer group stuff. When I played WoW I always tanked/healed and spent very little time solo-ing

I stopped playing World of Warcraft because in the later installments they made the game stale and mindless.

Anyway, any recommendations?

Edit: PC or mobile, I dont want to have to buy a console just for the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I was talking to my aunt (mom's sister) and she told me something that I had forgotten. So if you've seen my previous posts my situation with my parents was REALLY bad, I was raised by a single mom who essentially tried to beat my ADHD out of me for many years, plus she did some other crazy stuff after I graduated from college, police got involved and everything.

Anyway, my aunt has been calling regularly to check up on me, and she mentioned this event:

My aunt came to visit me and my mom from China one time and my mom suggested we see a movie. The movie was in English. My aunt can't speak English so she had no idea what was going on. So as the movie was playing I kept turning to her and explaining what was happening on the screen. My mom just sat on my aunt's opposite side and just stared straight ahead and watched by herself. She and my aunt are the best of friends so it wasn't that she was ignoring my aunt intentionally, she just never developed that part of her brain that sees things from other people's perspectives. My aunt was telling me this to try to make me forgive my mom, saying my mom can't help being the way she is because that's just how she is built.

I can talk to my aunt for just half an hour and there's more of an emotional connection in that half hour than what I've had with my mom my whole life. It's crazy how my aunt and my mom have the same parents and were born within a year of each other, but they have such different personalities. I wonder if most of us are here because our parents just lack the empathy gene. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-26 19:31:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I cry on a daily basis, but it's always because of the same thing - my parents. When I am not thinking of my parents I can run around and sing. But the moment I start thinking of my parents/childhood I break down crying.

I was beaten regularly growing up and my parents had an extremely toxic, drawn out divorce on top of that. My Chinese immigrant mom once chased me into the backyard swinging a wooden rod at my head, and I kept catching it and she got frustrated after a while, went back in the house, and started chucking hardcover books at my head. I was actually a really well-behaved kid, I was in my school's Latin club and our academic team won second place in the state, I was a bookworm who was always reading, etc. But both my parents had PhDs so they expected me to be a prodigy and I constantly disappointed them by having a B average at school. They also drag me in between their marital problems, they haven't spoken to each other in years and only communicate once in a while through email, and there have been times where they have CC'd me on emails that go back and forth between them to show me how bad the other parent is.

Anyway, I got diagnosed with depression 3 months ago. My psychiatrist put me on 150mg of Wellbutrin. I took it for a month and still cried every day. He then doubled it to 300mg a day. I took that for a month, I then said I got headaches and nausea but I still cried every day. He still told me to try it so this is my third month on Wellbutrin. Same thing.

I don't think what I have is depression because I CAN get out of bed, I am okay as long as I don't think of my past but it's like this cloud that's always there and keeping me from seeing clearly. It is ONLY related to my parents. I am in a choir and when I think of singing I get really happy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started doing therapy 2 months ago. I think my first therapist was really helpful, he taught me to stop blaming myself and got me to talk to a psychiatrist because he suspected I had depression. Then he got a new job in another city and moved, and so I got a new therapist at the same place and I don't really feel much of a difference since she has come along.

She basically has me talk about my parents until I end up crying because it digs up memories of some bad beatings I got or their extremely toxic divorce, and then the therapist says I am strong for having survived that, rinse and repeat. At my last session I mentioned I am usually fine and only break down crying when talking about my parents, and she told me to pretend they don't even exist for now.

Anyway, I don't see how it's going to help me if I am just digging up bad memories to make myself unhappy. For those of you who suffered depression and improved with therapy, what made things better? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I admitted to my therapist that sometimes I wished my parents were dead. She asked why, and I referenced this time when I was a kid - my dad never showed up at any of my school events because he said I was such a bad student (B student) that there was no point in him going. As the years went on no one at school even met my dad, and one day one of the parent chaperones asked me where my dad was. I didn't want to admit that he was at home drunk again, so I lied and said he was dead because it is easier to act like he was a normal dad who wanted to be there and just couldn't rather than to admit how dysfunctional my family was. And since no one there had ever met my dad they believed it easily.

Now I am not on speaking terms wit either of my parents and they aren't even on speaking terms with each other, and I wished there were some clean excuse for it rather than to explain how fucked up mu family is. My therapist said that maybe for now I should go ahead and tell myself they don't exist. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-20 04:48:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I grew up in an extremely toxic environment. My parents are Chinese immigrants, and my dad used to be very successful in his home country hence getting the opportunity to be a professor in the US. But in the US he was considered a foreigner who could barely speak English so he kept getting passed over things. That led to him developing a drinking problem and when I was a kid he would regularly hit me for crying. Meanwhile my mom had her own issues. She would hit me and lock me out on the front porch regularly for messing up songs on the piano, that happened every few days from ages 6 to 11. I had ADHD as a kid (got diagnosed very young) and my mom tried to beat it out of me because I was a B student. Once she asked me to turn off the stove, I said okay but forgot, and 5 hours later we came home to see the soup was a charred hard black chunk. She forced me to eat it as punishment with plain white rice (it was solid and black and completely inedible) and watched me as I ate. If I couldnt finish it in one meal she made me eat it the next. It went on for each meal for 3 days before she finally let me throw the rest away.

My parents dont have normal empathy for other people. To give you just a small example, one day my dad visited his sister and she told him he could stay at her house overnight instead of booking a hotel. Most people would say thank you, but my dad told her, "see, that's the problem with people like you. You only care about the small money, you dont care about the big money. That is why you will never be successful." Neither of my parents can be reasoned with.

For a long time I just thought this was a cultural thing. But my mom's sister is nothing like that. If my mom were watching tv and I sat next to her to ask what is going on, my mom will say "stop bothering me" and keep her eyes glued to the tv. If my aunt were watching tv and I sat next to her, my aunt would turn to to me and quickly summarize what was happening on the show before I even asked.

I am an only child and my parents screamed at each other just as much as they screamed at me, so they also went through an extremely toxic divorce that dragged on way too long. Each badmouthed the other to me, and would say "You are trash, just like your mother/father." They also built their own little immigrant bubble where they didnt socialize with non-Chinese people.

Anyway, I am fucked up socially. I was considered weird in school because I never properly learned how to socialize, plus my mom had always emphasized that grades were more important than anything else, only trash girls care about their looks, so I would just roll out of bed and show up for class like a complete mess. The other kids avoided me because they thought I was weird so I didnt have anyone to talk to at home or at school. I read lots of books to pretend the characters were my friends and my favorite authors were my real parents.

I started dolling myself up more when I went to college, and so even though I had no social skills there were boys that liked me. I didnt have any feelings for any of them, but I dated them just because I felt normal people date and I desperately wanted to appear normal. I remember having a boyfriend who would come over and visit and then he commented it was weird I didnt have any friends to hang out with. I would date a guy for a while and then find him suffocating. The concept of being in a relationship in general is weird to me.

I was in my early 20s before I finally made a good friend who coached me to respond, "fine, and how are YOU?" instead of just "fine" in a conversation. That is how bad my social skills are.

Anyway, now I am 28. I work in the IT department of a tech company and spend my days staring at a computer screen. I then come home and hole myself up in a room and browse the internet. I do small things to be more social, like joining a choir and a writers group, but even there I cant talk. I just dont find other people relateable. Small talk comes so naturally to some people and I badly want to talk, but I cant make small talk at all. I feel like I never developed social skills during the critical period and now my brain has pruned off those parts in favor of other parts. Either that or I inherited my parents' terrible people skills. I want to socialize but I cant. It is easier to relate to strangers over the internet than anyone in person. I would like to know if anyone had the same problem as me and managed to overcome it, thank you for reading. </TEXT>

I am just paranoid since I hear stories of some teachers being shady. The lessons are 30 minutes once a week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when I sing below the middle C, if I use my normal singing technique it just sounds quiet and airy so I do that thing that women do when they mimic a man talking, and using that voice I can go down to about the D or E below middle C. I've noticed I'm the only one who seems to do that.

Is my voice weird? I should add that when I'm singing higher, people say I sound a lot like Princess Jasmine, and then it DRASTICALLY changes when I get to the lowest part of my range.

Edit: I am female </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember when I was a little kid, I saw a fat lady and pointed at her, then in Chinese I said "Look how fat that lady is!" and my mom chided me saying I wasn't supposed to say that and I was going to make the lady unhappy.

Roughly 10 years later, my mom is all bitching about how fat people are in Chinese right in front of them. "Look at her, she's so fat and yet she's still drinking a soda" it seemed like she regressed with age.

Also when I was little, my mom said girls were just as good as boys (to counter my dad's blatant sexism) and now she always insists all women are idiots except for her, because she's like a man. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I was talking to my therapist about how I struggle with making new friends and we talked about why. I said it was probably genetic and I just couldnt change it, since my dad has even worse social skills than I do and insults people even when they are helping him. I said I am like a wall, where it wasnt until I was 23 or so that a roommate taught me to reply "fine, and how are YOU?" instead of just "fine" when someone initiated a conversation with me. I admitted I have an easier time talking and getting to know strangers on the internet than I do in person.

So she pointed out that when I answer questions with short answers, it makes other people think I dont want to talk to them. She asked me why I am always cutting my conversations so short instead of talking about myself. I said it was because I didnt want to be seen as annoying. She asked me why I thought I would be annoying and I said it was because I got picked on as a kid for being annoying so I want to keep my conversations as short as possible to keep that from slipping out (huge "a-ha!" moment for her).

So she said it's one of those things that I'd learned to cope with by shutting myself down socially. She asked me why I still thought people would see me as annoying now that I was an adult, and I said it was because adults are harder to read, they can act interested in what you are saying and then turn around and talk shit about you behind your back. She asked why I couldn't see things as genuine and it was because my parents would always be nice to someone and then talk shit.

She was saying that I applied stuff at home to the outside world instead of seeing that not everyone was like that. Anyway, just wanted to share. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since this forum is so depressing lately I would go for a funny story instead.

So when I was a kid, I loved chcolate malt balls. My dad bought me a bunch from Trader Joes and I gorged on them. My mom them saw what I was eating and forbid me from eating any more because they were going to make me fat/be bad for my teeth. She made me throw the bag away, and I cried. Once they left the kitchen, I went back and fished the bag back out. I hid the chocolate malt balls under the sink of my bathroom (I had my own). I would go to the bathroom to "poop" but really be snacking on the chcolate malt balls while reading a book.

I eventually ate so many chocolate malt balls that even looking at them made me feel a little sick so I didnt want them anymore. I couldnt just leave them under the kitchen sink forever because eventually I would get caught. I knew I would also risk getting caught if they went in the trash, so I decided to try to flush them away. Too bad chocolate malt balls float instead of going down the toilet. So I try covering them with toilet paper to weigh them down before flushing. It seemed like it worked.

Some time later, I use the toilet and it overflows. I call for help, and my dad uses the toilet plunger while my mom and I stand and watch. Then all these chocolate malt balls, surrounded by bits of toilet paper, come floating to the surface. My parents ask me what they are, so I panick and say it's my poop.

And now my mom is freaking out over the fact my poop is perfectly round little floating things and she insists on taking me to the hospital, and meanwhile my dad looks at it closer and starts laughing because he recognizes it's the chocolate malt balls he had bought me months earlier. My parents thought it was so funny that thankfully I didnt get punished that time.

Anyone have other lying stories they want to share? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The reason I said it was because one of the side effects is nausea and I was so sick yesterday I was bedridden. I didn't want to come across as faking it, so I just admitted I'm on meds and the doctor upped my dosage. But now  I think he might mistake it for something worse like schizophrenia.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I took it when I woke up, at maybe 8am or so. Within an hour I got a headache, not head-splitting but enough where I had to stop what I was doing and lie in bed with my eyes closed. Then the nausea set in and I was on the floor clutching a little plastic bucket feeling like I was going to vomit, that went on until maybe 6pm. Finally at night I walked around for a while in the park and feel better now but still can't watch TV or browse the internet because the movements on the computer screen made it worse. Even now at 10pm if I try to read a news article I have to scroll down the page very slowly to avoid getting dizzy.

I have been in Wellbutrin for a month now. During the first 3 weeks I took 150mg a day and it helped a little but not completely. Two weeks ago my psychiatrist upped the dosage to 300mg and it kicked in and wow I was feeling better than I have felt in many years. I noticed I would get dizzy if I tried to do things on my computer quickly but it didnt get bad until last night and I was bed ridden all day today until tonight. I have a full time desk job so I dont think I can work tomorrow if I am how I was today. Anyway is it normal for my reaction to be this strong? I read somewhere nausea can last weeks, I cant stand feeling awful for that long :(

I also wonder if my depression is misdiagnosed because what other people say about depression doesnt really fall in line with my problem. I had crazy Asian parents who put a ton of pressure on me when I was a kid, I would get hit and locked out of the house on a regular basis for messing up songs on the piano, also got beaten a lot for my grades. Some beatings lasted hours, where I was just curled up in a ball on the floor while my mom beat me with objects. As long as I dont think about my parents or my childhood I am fine, it is only when I remember something that I crash and cry uncontrollably. I feel it falls more along the lines of ptsd than depression but my therapist and psychiatrist both said depression and they are the experts, I dont know... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mom would double the amount of time my teacher recommended I play for, so when I just started playing I played half an hour a day because the teacher recommended 15 minutes. By the time I was 11 I played for 2 hours a day because the teacher recommended 1 hour.

I was supposed to sit up straight and play the same song again and again and again. If the song had lyrics to it and I tried to sing it I would get yelled at so I couldn't do that. If I wanted to make up a song that wasn't the one I was supposed to practice, I got yelled at. Meanwhile my mom would sometimes stand over me and then reach out and hit me if I messed up the song too many times in a row. I would start messing up when she walked up to the piano and stood next to me, because I was so scared my fingers stopped functioning properly.

Sometimes she would even make this sound in her throat when I messed up and I knew it was a warning that I was going to get hit again. I usually got hit 3 times before getting locked out on the front porch, and when I was on the front porch I was so scared of getting hit even more that I would stand frozen in my position and if my legs started to hurt from standing too long I would just shift my weight from one foot to the other because I was too scared to even sit down.

What's funny is after all that I still wasn't that good at the piano. I was about to take the level 5 test before I quit, and after that I wouldn't even go near the piano for years. Now I have a keyboard because I am in a choir and want to learn my part, but I sure as hell won't be learning the accompaniment. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Renting a room out of some lady's house over Craigslist. We didn't sign a contract. Do I still have to give 30 days notice? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my situation is this:

I rented a room from a lady over Craigslist. $200 move-in fee that I won't get back, plus $800 a month. Well, I paid her for the first month, and since then she got a boyfriend who is here pretty much every night. They have sex loudly, watch movies loudly, play music loudly, etc. until early in the morning. I haven't had a good night's sleep for a couple days in a row. Just last night they played music until 2 in the morning, then woke me up around 5 in the morning because of their noisy sex, and then then were up and about by 8 so I barely got any sleep and it's the freakin' weekend.

One day she mixed her antidepressants with hard liquor and started acting creepy, her boyfriend argued with her, and then left the house. She then went CRAZY and started smashing beer bottles on the floor and yelling "yeah!". I was up in my room, wide awake in my bed hearing all those bottles smash downstairs. I didn't have dinner that night because I was too scared to go downstairs.

So of course I want to move out. I already found a place. But do I have to give 30 days notice when there was no contract? Does that mean I have to pay another month's rent? We live in California by the way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So when I was a kid, there was another Chinese American girl in my class. She was my friend, let's call her Maggie. I went home in the 2nd grade and told my parents proudly that I had gotten the second highest grade in the class out of about thirty students. 

Dad: Second highest? Then who was the highest?

Me: Maggie.

Dad: Why did Maggie get a higher grade than you? Your parents have PhDs, do Maggies parents have PhDs? Maggie's a nobody, how can you do worse than Maggie?

After that my parents asked "What did Maggie get" every time I had to take a test, and I was a really honest kid so I'd tell them that either I got the exact same grade as Maggie or she did just a little bit better than me. Eventually I learned to lie and made up stories about how Maggie forgot to turn her homework in or got a C, lol.

Then my school had an advanced program for 4th graders and Maggie got in but I didn't, and I got the hell beaten out of me. To get into the advanced program you had to score above the 90th percentile in every subject and I scored above it in every subject EXCEPT English because my family didn't speak English at home. But since Maggie didn't have that problem my mom would go to the school and demand I get placed in the advanced class, the staff would say no, and then my mom would come home and beat me for it and say I publicly humiliated her. My dad had never so much as met Maggie, whereas my mom had met her maybe twice.

Now I'm doing pretty good for myself and I wondered whatever the hell happened to Maggie. I decided to google her name, and it turns out she designed an app that got featured in the New York Times, lol, I can never win. </TEXT>
