	<TEXT> First, if Hillary were president, Fox News would NEVER be kicked out. And Beritbart would NEVER be let in. Breitbart was never a news site. It's a neo-conservative political operation. I think that's the great divide in America. Fox News started to blur the lines between news and punditry. Punditry is not news. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's talk about Comcast. In my market, it is a monopoly. Municipal contracts force local governments to lock into a single cable provider. In 1996, there was a DSL explosion which saw a rapid rise of several DSL providers in each market. This happened because the government forced ma bell to open her precious lines to competition.
Then deregulation happened. Now all of the DSL companies have dried up. The technology has stalled. And I can only get comcast for fast Internet. It's little different than when Google tried to roll out fiber service in Nashville and the local carriers fought every step of the way to prevent competition.

	<TEXT> Wife and two kids are my world. I have a son 9 and a daughter 5. Since wife is a teacher, everyone's on winter break. Kids get to stay up late and have fun. Son wants to sleep at grandma's house, ok. Daughter sleeps home. She decides she wants to watch sofia at 10PM. OK. We're all up late. Wife goes to sleep. Daughter watches sofia in bed. Midnight rolls around, daughter still watching sofia. I have to use my phone to change the roku because remotes don't last long in our house. I quickly switch from sofia to her nightly youtube kids music for sleeping. Daughter smiles at me and says, "I watched eight sofias." Everyone goes to sleep. 

Wife and I wake up around 9 AM. Son comes home. 10:50AM. Lovely daughter calls out to mommy and daddy. Yes dear? "I can't open my eye."  Wife is in the shower. I go to my daughter and she's covering her eye. I get some wipes. Go to clean daughter's eye. She's scared.  After convincing her they're just wipes and nothing wrong, she relents. I clean her eye, no crust. She says, "I still can't see."  Wife asks, "do we need to take her to the doctor, is it an eye infection?"  Nope. I tell lovely daughter, "I'll get you a warm compress, it will make your eyes feel better." Get wash cloth, run it under "warm" water. Take it to daughter. I put it on her eyes.  She ragefully yells at me, "TOO HOT." It's not sweetie. I go to the bathroom. Wife is still in shower.  Wife asks what's wrong. I explain lovely daughter has grown up eyes from not getting enough sleep. Light is piercing her skull as we all experience as parents. Daughter hears whole conversation. Daughter wants me to take wash cloth away. I tell her to just throw it on the floor and I'll get it when I'm done in the bathroom. Lovely five year old daughter doesn't like to wait and wants me to get it now. She starts screaming. "OOOOO You're making me angry." Wife and I start chuckling. I explain to daughter her eyes hurt because she didn't get enough sleep. She starts raging more. Wife and I start laughing harder. Lovely five year old daughter screams out to me, "You're a moron!"

TL;DR Daughter, 5, got angry called me a moron

Made my day. Had to share. </TEXT>

I have come to think of so much of consciousness as a burden, a weight, and we have spared them that.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Considering the length of such a free fly, I think it's safe to assume we could have 2.6 inbound imminently. The best tactic could be to give people just a taste of what's coming and then put it on display for sale. I believe something will happen on October 31st. During the recent events we saw what was coming in 2.6. And we saw 3.0 on display. We saw a good roadmap for releases through 4.0 iirc. Considering that CIG is now a well oiled machine, we should expect 3-4 months between point releases. I think Star Marine is going to be finished very soon and we should see those stability improvements we all expect. Buttery smooth motion from the engine. The key evidence is the two specials post-citizen con and the lack of talk about 2.6 during citizen con. It's my hunch, but I've got a good feeling about it. Talk among yourselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I switched to Uniball Air pens exclusively for work because I've been so tired with my pens drying up frequently. I actually went through my first pen completely and it started to skip. Since it was the blue 0.7 version, I decided to tear it apart to see what kind of cart it used. Apparently the barrel unscrews and the cart is simply a dropper fill which snaps in place. And since the pens use water-based ink to begin with... You won't have to ditch the pen until the roller ball wears out.

I was having a quick meeting next to his cube where he was training me on trouble shooting skills. I'm paying attention to him and I kept looking back behind me while he was talking to me. I had no idea what amblyopia was, nor had I ever seen it before. So Milton is going on and I keep looking back. Finally he stops and asks me what I'm looking at. I replied, I don't know, whatever you're looking at. Amblyopia is also called lazy eye. Milton was not amused.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I decided to quickly make night sights for my CCP.  The results are pretty good.

Step one, [get some white acrylic hobby paint in matte white and then get some glow in the dark powder.](http://imgur.com/E7UQ0vF) It's important to use acrylic paint, if you use oil based or enamel, it will eat the plastic in your sights. You could also theoretically use white school glue.

Step two, mix a fair amount of powder into the paint until it's a pasty consistency.  I used a toothpick to mix mine.

Step three, smush some of the paste into the sight holes. Make sure it gets into the holes.  Then wipe away the excess with your finger, clean up the rest with a paper towel.

Here are the sights in the [day](http://imgur.com/3MBo9XQ) and in the [dark](http://imgur.com/7dfqUEm).

I've found this combination to last several years. I made some years ago to paint my ceiling fan pulls so I don't get my hand chopped off trying to turn on the lights. Also works great on light switches. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 2016 Tucson and Android Auto, only for Limited? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-05-29 01:51:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a 2016 Tucson ECO.  I do not have the 8" navigation system which only came on the Limited.  I've got the 5" xm with backup camera system. I'm piecing together information from press releases and the Hyundai website which leads me to believe that only the Limited will receive the Android Auto update.



*From a recent [Verge article](http://www.theverge.com/2016/5/26/11785996/hyundai-android-auto-carplay-diy-update): "and Tucson are eligible, depending on what infotainment package they've got installed"



*From [this Hyundai page](https://www.hyundaiusa.com/myhyundai/manuals-and-how-tos/getfaq?faqid=8 category=vehicle_releases): FAQ's
Are Android Auto and/or CarPlay available on the 2016 Tucson?

Android Auto and CarPlay will be available on the new Tucson but both systems currently have a delayed availability.



*From [this Hyundai page](http://www.carolinahyundai.com/blog/when-will-the-2016-hyundai-tucson-have-android-auto/): The 2016 Hyundai Tucson will have Android Auto and Apple CarPlay
And its finally here! According to a May 2016 press release, current Tucson owners can download Apple CarPlay and Android Auto for their vehicles with a USB memory stick or SD card when they log into MyHyundai.com. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uKZ5m4fXEeY) also details how to get the smartphone integration software on your Tucson (finally) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-05-05 22:20:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> so, apologies for this slight rant. I'll try not to devolve into a shitpost. When I started playing this on PC, it was day one and I really enjoyed it. Then I couldn't find any matches for months due to a bug with the jakku expansion.  Then after I fixed that, everything worked great.

I've been in full servers where I normally finish top 3. My k/d has never been great, but I'm beginning to wonder why my shots aren't doing as much damage as is being done to me.

Now a few things I've noticed. And here is where it gets a bit ranty.  I've been in full servers where I normally finish top 3. My k/d has never been great, but I'm beginning to wonder why my shots aren't doing as much damage as is being done to me. I feel as if I've been nerfed as a player. I feel like my shots don't do as much damage as other players shots do on me. It wasn't always like this, just in the past week or so.  I notice when I find a match, there's always one or two players with a really high k/d ratio. And the rest of us are normal. Last night, I was playing walker assault and I was using the ca-87 shock blaster.  From approximately 30ft away, I shot a player 3 times with this blaster and he shot me once and I died while he had over 80% of his health.  And this was the span of three shots of the ca-87. 

And just today I was playing blast.  I shot a player with three hits of the se-14c, at least 2 hit, and then melee'd him in the head. He hit me once and killed me while retaining 25% health.

I wish these were isolated incidents.  These are the norm this past week. Does anyone else have issues like this?  Where no matter how many times you shoot an opponent, they kill you with a single hit? I'm not one to rage.  And I'm not one to question other people's skill, especially since there was a time at least 15 years ago, when I played CS at that level. When I was in my early 20's and did nothing else for 8 hours a day but play CS. 

Am I alone?  I have to question at this point whether I just suck. But given my performance history, I'm not so sure I just started sucking a week ago.  And let's skip the "you just suck" posts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have trouble finding games to join, try this experiment for me.

Log into origin, add the ["free" battle for jakku expansion](https://www.origin.com/en-us/store/buy/star-wars-battlefront/pc-download/addon/star-wars-battlefront-battle-of-jakku) to your cart and checkout.

Then tell me if you can find games.

I couldn't find any games to play and once I did this, it instantly found games like it did on launch.

**UPDATE** there is confusion about this post.  I had Battle for Jakku installed and running since the day it was released.  I installed it from origin under my game tab.  However once I installed it, I couldn't find or play any games with the battle for Jakku expansion selected in the multiplayer tab.  However if I selected main game only, it would rarely find a game to play. By completing this transaction in the origin store, I was instantly able to play all games including battle for Jakku content. It is my belief that this origin store bug might be why the game seems like a ghost town. </TEXT>

When I first stepped out into the public square and saw the city skyline, holy crap.  When I saw a mustang fly 30 feet over my head, It renewed my faith in the CIG team and that elation I felt when I first saw the 300i commercial. I bought this on day 1 those years ago. I never doubt the team can and will do it.  So I'm just waiting, hoping not to spoil the fantasy. Anyone else want to chime in? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you got a fountain pen? Great. Welcome to the club. Now you too can enjoy the illustrious world of fancy pens and colorful inks. But now that you have pens that require more maintenance than shaking, here's a few helpful tips to get you started and potentially save you the time, money and embarrassment of destroying your new pen.

**Things to do with your new pen**

* before inking, flush your pen with cold water

Some pens contain manufacturing oils. A quick flush with plain cold water will help. If you notice your pen feels or looks like it has oil, a tiny drop of dish soap in the cup can help remove the oil.

* make sure you have installed the converter properly before inking

Ink is very saturated and by its nature, it stains most things it touches. It helps if your converter is installed properly. It also helps if you place your ink bottle on top of a paper towel and a foam disposable plate or bowl. That way if you fumble around with doll hands, you have a second to pick up your bottle before it goes everywhere.

* cartridges are easily installed if they're the right size

They come in several sizes. Short International is the most common. There's also Long International and various proprietary sizes as well. Lamy carts are proprietary.

* once you fill your pen,  clean the section with a paper towel and replace the barrel and cap AND REPLACE THE CAP ON THE INK BOTTLE.

Open ink bottles are a disaster waiting to happen. Renters don't take the chance, recap your bottles.

* write write write and then recap your pen

Fountain pen ink is mostly water. It dries. Replace the caps on your pens if you're not writing for more than a couple minutes. This will save you trouble with clogged up feeds.

* clean your pens after a few fills

Some inks are worse than others. After two fills, I like to clean my pens. Some can be disassembled for easy cleaning, others cannot. The easiest way to clean is the flush with plain cold water. If you can pull the nib and feed, a soft toothbrush with a drop of dish soap and cold water works best. And don't forget to clean your caps. Wet q-tips work best.


**what *NOT* to do with your new pen**

* Do not drop it

Fountain pens are delicate precision instruments. They won't work properly if they're dropped. The nib will get destroyed if dropped.  But worse is some pens will also break the feed if dropped, especially with plastic feeds. If someone asks to try your pen, and you agree, give it to them with the cap secured firmly. Then ask that they replace the cap when they're done. 

* Do not clean it with hot water

Fountain pens are mostly made of plastic or metal these days. Some vintage pens are made of other materials like celluloid which will warp or expand in surprisingly low temperatures. If it's too hot for little kid hands it's too hot for your pen. Temperature changes in pens tends to cause expansion or retraction of the air inside the converter. Pressure times Volume is proportional to Temperature. These are very small volumes which is why we see ink in our caps sometimes.

* Do not clean with chemicals

Some vendors make a pen flush. Those are specially formulated for fountain pens. Those are OK as long as they are specifically designed for fountain pens. Goulet pens makes a flush which is safe to use. Don't use anything by Koh-I-Noor. Those products aren't made for fountain pens. They are made for india ink and stylo drafting pens. *Never* use alcohol to clean a pen. It will destroy the plastic parts on any pen.

This post will be updated periodically. Enjoy your new pens and Write^write^write </TEXT>
