	<TEXT> Howdy.

Totally know what you mean.

I've been thru this dilemma many years ago.

Even if you try and rationalize it, like many posts here, that dogs are dogs and its okay to feed them meat, that only goes so far. Because you're still supporting animal agriculture, and that is bad for the planet and climate.

I have since taken to hens, which give me eggs, and Llamas and Alpacas are herbivores, and that is really the dream solution for me. Love dogs, but this was the perfect solution for me. I spend a lot of time and nuture my hens, so they are as interesting as any other domesticated animal/pet, IMO.

Good luck!

Look into whether your wife may be suffering from something like BPD. Good luck. Its not pretty.

	<TEXT> Sent your imgur to my audio store owner. He has been in audio as long as I've been alive.
Here's his opinion (he's too busy to create a reddit account and all that):

 everything has some value:

 The Inspire is from Dennis Had of Cary audio after he sold off and is his personal hand made designs.. Looks like a linestage preamp

 The ther two pieces of tube gear I would have to look inside to see the source.

 The one with three tubes, two under the caps, is a preamp

 The other is a EL-84 power amp, though it looks like a tube or two is missing

 The Carver has a sort of cult following, although I don't like it. If it works sell it on the internet ASAP. they have a tendency to go.

 Klipsch has a cult following; very efficient don't need a lot of power.

 Yamaha decent sounding solidstate amp: again about that age when issues arise: sell n internet.

 Round speakers early 70's/80's omnidirectional sound speakers: Internet

 Bose, 901, unless series 1, (should be on ag on bottom) woofer (9 of them)  foam surrounds have deteriorated.

 You can still sell because Bose has a trade in program for something like $800 for a new pair. Sorry not Bose....Maybe Allison research aclone of the bose

 AR speakers should all have good drivers, They all used cloth surrounds, IIRC. Heavy as hell beaus they used good wood back then

 Microacousics are add on tweeters.should be Ok and there ia amarket. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A lot of good responses so far.

You get opinion from both sides.

You have to decide whether to sacrifice your (and sounds like hers) unhappiness, just to fit the norms of society and the people around you who will judge you. This is one of the big problems with religion. Any religion.

What would make this decision easier, is if one of you did indeed meet a 'soulmate' type of individual, and really got to see first hand, what its like to be with, talk to, and experience someone that 'clicks' with you, on so many different levels.

Then you will see clearly, and feel so much more, that it would be insane to 'just live your life' and be unhappy, until the end, when you will regret your own one time only life that was given to you. Six years have already been spent.

I speak from experience.

Good luck.

P.S. It sounds like she may have /r/vaginismus  </TEXT>

Look carefully at your pic.

The only spot that they can lie in dirt, with no rocks.

So they are all trying to use that spot.

If this was a video, you would see them flapping and kicking dirt around.

Its obvious when you've had chickens for awhile.

Make more spots for them to enjoy, with dirt, and not rocks.

Like I slowly learned to hate Ubuntu, Mint is now being more of a frustration, than pleasure.

Unreliable network printing, unable to recognize Broadcom wifi hardware device, and slow file copy and running out of memory with Mate and Cinnamon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Being Vegan, I had read that dogs can be Vegan, while cats cannot.

I also didn't want to buy, or touch, or deal with any animal flesh.

Even PETA says you can and should feed your dog Vegan.

But that goes again nature. Like trying to make a fish walk or fly.

http://www.dogfoodadvisor.com/canine-nutrition/dogs-carnivores-omnivores/

My dogs eating Vegan, were getting all kinds of skin disorders, and bloody diarrhea, and one even got mange. A clear sign of weak immunity. Had to be on Ivermectin insecticide for 3 months. Expensive vet visits.

I then met a lady at the dog park, and she lent me a book, and told me about frozen raw food.

http://www.sfgate.com/pets/yourwholepet/article/Raw-food-for-pets-Despite-warnings-by-2463851.php

Long story short, it has been almost 10 years now, and my dog has the nicest teeth of any 10 year old, the vet told me, and until recently, has not been to the vet in over 3.5 years. Now that's what you call savings. /r/Frugal 

No more skin allergies, expressing anal glands, smelly poop in the yard, and other horrors.

Good luck.

	<TEXT> From a health perspective, I can tell you from personal experience that being alcohol free, makes your body more efficient. I was alcohol free for years, and then switched over, and had diminished quality of fitness and sleep during my time of imbibing.

You have to remember that your body considers ETOH as a odd source of calories. Fats, proteins, and carbohydrates have a set amount of calories, and then alcohol, and ONLY alcohol has the unique calories/gram out of anything you consume.

https://www.uhs.uga.edu/documents/nutrition_alcohol.pdf

And then there are other concerns, such as:

- dehydration,
- liver disease,
- renal disease,
- gout, arthritis,
- nerve damage, (including brain)
- hypertension, 
- obesity,
- mutagen,
- pancreas,
- diabetes. </TEXT>
