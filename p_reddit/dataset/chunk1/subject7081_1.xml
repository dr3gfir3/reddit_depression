	<TEXT> My humble opinion is that I can't prove anything is "real" about any faith, and you cannot prove to me anything is "fake" about it. If you need it proven to believe, remain an atheist because it makes you content as our faith makes us content. I never debate religion because I feel no need to prove my feelings. There are many faiths, even the lack thereof, because everyone has different spiritual needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My husband and I lost out business at the end of August, and have been out of work since. Losing the business I dreamed about having for 14 years sent me into a tailspin of anxiety and depression. My husband got a great job, and starts training on Monday, but it is 2 hours away and we are moving to the new town hopefully in January. In the meantime, we are moving in with my parents and putting our stuff in storage until we have enough to make the move.

Our kids and I have already moved in to Mom's house because the chaos of packing was causing a lot of anxiety, and every time I plan to go to the "old" house and pack I freak out and can't do it. My Mom and husband tell me it's ok and that by being at Mom's, keeping the kids and dogs out of the way, as well as washing all the clothes and sorting them into keep/store (our dryer has been broken for months and so laundry is much easier here with a working dryer) is helping a lot. 

I have a lot of guilt and feel like I am just being lazy or a coward because I am forcing others to do all the work, but literally cannot force myself to go down there and help. I can't win, and I have myself pretty worked up about it today, the actual moving day. Once the house is empty I hope I can at least go down there and clean.

**UPDATE!** My Mom wanted to go down to the house and get something out of the freezer for dinner and at the last minute I decided to go with her. We got some food, the juice for the girls, and then spent about 20 minutes getting anything else we thought we might want or need at Mom's while we are staying here. It was not as terrible as I thought because I focused on our objective and when I started to 'freak out' we left. I cried on the way back and feel emotionally wiped now, but I'm proud of myself for the small victory! Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was in my early 20's my SO left me for a girl across the country he met on the internet. Afterward I found out he had been lying to and cheating on me the whole 1+ we were together. His parents had co-signed on his car and he had stopped making payments. They gave me his new phone # because he ignored their calls. I called him and pretended I wanted to bury the hatchet and found out when he got to the new state to meet the internet girlfriend and move in with her, he discovered she was a teenager and her father was less than pleased by him showing up, ready to move in. After several phone calls, some of which I was offering honest help to find him a job if he moved back, but  NOT get back together in any way, I found out he had found a job there and was basically living out of his car in the parking lot. 

I got the info to his parents and the car was repossessed while he was at work, with all he owned in this world inside it.

I like to think I am a very forgiving person, and in the years since we have spoken and forgiven each other, but I got an absurd amount of pleasure when he called me to tell me about the repossession and I just played dumb. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We have had our dog Mal for about a month and have been working with him on basic obedience from day one. His former owner had taken him to puppy training at PetSmart (he is 8 mo old) and so he knew the basics so I just practiced what he knew and built on it. I have severe anxiety issues and my Dr and I talked about Mal being my service dog. I have worked in the animal care field for 15 years and feel confident I can train him myself for Service work. We are working on him being focused on me when he is "working" and working on him ignoring distraction. He is super friendly and wants to play with every human or dog we see, so this is a big job. He will not be just a "comfort animal" but will perform functions to help me manage my anxiety in public. His main jobs will be to calm me during an anxiety attack by leading me away from people and distract me with "snuggles" and wanting to play. I would really appreciate input from handlers or trainers of psych service dogs </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Blizzard has always been incredibly helpful whenever my husband or I have had an issue. I personally dealt with a GM who went above and beyond when I noticed someone had hacked my hubs account and already had an authenticater on it and had stripped it while he was on the road. Hubs had the account back and fully restored the next day. Needless to say we both got authenticaters that day. If you have an honest issue, they will almost always fix it in an awesome way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We moved across the country to Arizona in March and she took it very well. We made it an adventure, plus we had been homeschooling her, and although she had a good group of friends in Indiana, one of the perks to her was we put her in a charter school out here and she loves it and made a ton of friends. We lost our business in late August and have been unemployed since then. My husband has an opportunity to get a grant to get his CDL renewed and has a job waiting for him when he is done with the course making twice what we ever made with both of us working. We would be financially secure, I could afford to go back to being a SAHM, and we would still be close enough to my parents for them to be in our lives, which was a big reason for moving here. The issue is we would have to relocate. We would still be in Arizona, but 1 1/2 hours away so we would obviously have to put her in a new school. She seemed fine with it at first, but this morning she was a total mess. She was alternating between crying and giving major attitude, which is not like her at all. We got her calmed down and to school, but I am really not sure how bad this is going to blow up or how to handle it without losing my cool. My husband and I are stressed out to the limit and don't want to take it out on her because she is resisting the one good thing to happen in over 2 months. 
**TL;DR after over 2 months of NO $ coming in my hubs got a great job offer in another town and my 7 y/o is freaking out about moving** again. </TEXT>
