	<TEXT> I saw 8mm years after it came out and it was better than I expected. It deals with some dark stuff, so maybe that's why I liked it. I'm a fan of those kinds of thrillers. Anyway, Nicolas Cage (before he went off the deep end) is a PI looking for the victim in a snuff film. He starts snooping around in the underground porn world and bad stuff happens. Good movie. </TEXT>
