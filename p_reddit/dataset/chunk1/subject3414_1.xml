You need to stand you ground, and say to him, go through my phone, i have nothing to hide, and let him know that its low of him to think you would do that to him. He obviously has trust issues, and a relation NEEDS trust to work. If he cant trust you, he is not worth your time.

	<TEXT> I did A LOT of weird shit when I was little.
So here are a couple that stick out to me.

Around the rip old age of 3, I was at home watching tv by myself eating my sandwich, whilst my mum was outside in the garden. So here I am, cute little me watching Play School all la dee da, when the old guy 'Greg' comes on, and I did not like Greg, so I decided to pull my peanut butter sandwich appart and stick it on Gregs face so I didnt have to look at him, when the camera angle changed i would just smear the sandwich around the tv, causing the tv to have peanut butter and bread all over it.

Another time, once again around the age of three, i was playing in the bath with my navy boat that you could pull in half and it hand little navy seal men inside. I'm playing in the bath, have a good old time, when I needed to fart, so I farted, few bubbles come up, I giggle and continue playing, when all the sudden I notice a little bit of poo floating around. So what do I do, pull my boat in half and trap my poo, why I dont know, but I did. Got out the bath and left my poo in there, it wasnt untill my brother (6 at the time) had a bath and pulled the boat apart to realise there was a little surpise left for him. 

Another time, when renovating our house, there was a massive pile of brown dirt in our backyard, I was at the age of about 5-6, and at this time I had a fascination with getting naked and running around the backyard. So when the renovations were happening, there were a lot of trades men in the backyard working on the extension, I came home from kinder early, to find the pile of dirt was still there, what do I do, strip of ALL my clothes, butt naked, and pretend i'm a dog and dig in the dirt, infront of all the tradies. Worst thing, my mum filmed it.

TL;DR- smudged peanut butter on the tv because I didnt like the guy on tv, trapped a piece of poo in a toy boat, and stipped of in front of trades men and played in the dirt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are really pretty. 
But I thin you need to cut your hair a bit shorter than shoulder length, so you focus on doing that for a start. 
You have beautiful big eyes, if you use some mascara and eyeliner, with a small amount of a neutral colored eye shadow, you will bring them out 10000x's more! 

I hope this helps you :)  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Regrettably for tea last night, I had curry, and today I sure as hell paid for it.
There was a workshop going on in our seminar room, and the students in the workshop had just gone back into the room after their lunch break, I thought this would be a great time to go give my bowels the workout that they so desperately craved. 
As I sat down, got comfortable, and relaxed, just about to drop a bomb when, I hear a noise, the sound of foot step coming towards me, with each step I clenched my asshole tighter and tighter. For a second I couldnt hear anything. I thought yes, a false alarm, time to blow this shit outta my ass, just as Im about to realise the hounds, all the sudden the door swings opens. Never in my life, have I so quickly clamped each ass cheek together. The lady sits down, piss pots around in her stall, and then its quite. That awkward quite of I hope the lady next to me is going to leave, because I really need to poo type of quite. The anticipation of not knowing what to do was killing me, I have a volcano in my ass that is about to erupt, and this chick casually waiting for me to leave so she can do the same thing. When all the sudden, for the first time in my life, I heard another lady poo. But it wasnt any kind poo, this was like a euphoric type of poo. The sigh of relief the lady gave, my god, she was happy to drop her friends of to the pool thats for sure. But I myself was unsure of what to do, do I poo alongside with her? As I thought, it struck me, that it took her a lot of courage to make the first more, and I was impressed by that, so as good sportsmen do, I dropped my bomb as well, it was a strange feeling, but in a good way, knowing we were both releasing the shit from our bowels. As I walk out the stall I was in to wash my hands, the mysterious pooper arose from the stall next to me and says Didnt think I was going to make it, note to self, poo before and not after a bum fuck. I froze. This lady probably in her mid-teens had just got it on with some other student in during their lunch break. My reply was an awkward chuckle, whilst my face had wtf did I just hear written all over it. For the rest of the day, she kept giving me the sup nod. 

Reddit what are some awkward moments you have had at your work? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The more genuine you are, the more likely we are going to be impressed. 
I had a guy come up to me at my last job, and I simply smiled at him at we walked past each other, and about 5 minutes later he came back and said "I just had to let you know that you have the prettiest smile I have ever seen."  We stood around and had a chat for about 15 minutes, he said he would like to see me again, sometime over coffee, and I kindly declined, as at the time I had a boyfriend. 
Long story short, be genuine, be kind, be calm, confident and be yourself and you'll be sure to get a reaction, unless the chick is a bitch, then she doesnt deserve you.

I'm unable to Have any form of communication with my boyfriend for two weeks due to his work. It's only been a week, and it's been like hell each day and is only going to go worse with the next week coming. 
For me, it's so hard to stay positive, I find that I'm in such a negative state. I don't want to talk to anyone, don't want to do anything. I come home from work each day and just sit on my couch and hold back tears. I think it's so hard because I am use to having a Skype date each night and phone calls during the day, and then to have nothing all of the sudden, my goodness I can't describe me. 
Im now in the state where I'm begining to think if long distance is Going to work. Like do I ever get to be with him in the end? I love my job and the place I live so much, but there is nothing for him here job wise, so he wouldn't move to where I live. So what do I do? I feel like I'm somewhat in limbo waiting for a decision to be made. 

That's my rant, my story.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reading through your story, all I did was cry. 
The young boy you were, I am experiencing myself. 
And this is like looking into the future as if this was coming from my current boyfriend. He is exactly what you were. And on the Saturday just passed, i went out clubbing with my brother and his friend as a goodbye to our friend who was leaving, and I got somewhat drunk and kissed a guy. But I am yet to tell my boyfriend because I know how he will react, and he will never speak to me again. 
I dont know what to do, because know i have feelings for the man i kissed, because he is everything my current boyfriend is not. 
Please, if you see this, please comment, i really need help as to what i should do. 
Do i stay with my boyfriend who is now so overbearing that I hate myself for being inlove with him, or do I go for the man i kissed who gives me butterflys when i see he has sent me a text on my phone.
HELP. </TEXT>
