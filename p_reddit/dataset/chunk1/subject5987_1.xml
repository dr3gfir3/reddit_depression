	<TEXT> She's been very vocal, even in tense situations, from what I've seen. The only real exception being that she waited to endorse the winner of the Democratic primaries instead of endorsing Bernie early on, which some people were upset about but I don't blame her for. She didn't want to divide the Democratic Party. But I love her, she's a true progressive and one of very few in government who actually fights for what she believes in, and she gives the people of Massachusetts a voice. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. I think there was some confusion about what the ban actually consisted of, but I think more people are starting to realize how insane it is. I'm hoping there'll be more backlash soon because it's absolutely insane. 

There's just so much terrible stuff trump has done *already* that I think people are getting overwhelmed, we just recently had the largest protest in US history and there's also a protest on trumps muzzling of scientists happening soon. But this is even more reprehensible to me. </TEXT>

If they have relatives living in the US, too bad, they won't be able to see them again. If they just happened to be on vacation in another country, even if they're a green card holder, they're banned from going back home because of the actions of a single bigoted cheeto. </TEXT>
