	<TEXT> Generally speaking, being called for jury duty is typically tied to whether you are registered to vote in your state.

Based on your post, I'm assuming either:
All of your friends, and you, are lucky,

Or many of you are not registered to vote


As per what it entails, after being called you go through a selection process with prosecution and defense attorney where they weed out undesirable jurors (they always call more people than they need).

E.g. If a white guy killed an Asian guy, and you're an Asian guy, the defense is more likely to want to exclude you due to a presupposition that as an Asian you would be more inclined to find their client guilty.

If you end up selected, then it really is just listening to the court case and coming to a verdict with fellow jurors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> UGMA/UTMA are types of accounts where a minor (in this case you) is the owner of the assets and an adult (usually a parent) oversees the account. All transactions must be your benefit e:g. They can't take your money and buy a boat.

When you reached the age of majority (varies by state, usually 18) the money is yours.

That said, your wealth manager should be telling you what to do with the money.  .5% fee based on AUM (assets under management) is a realistic fee but what is their performance? If your investment performance lags the market significantly than you should probably fire them. Again, don't take action until you research this.

Also, based on your funds, you might want to look at roboadvisors. Not to rain on your parade, but in the world of wealth management, you do not have anything resembling a "shit ton" of money. Unless your advisor manages only small accounts, you probably don't get much attention and a roboadvisor program would probably charge lower fees and keep you in something like index funds that hew close to the market returns.

Note: I work for an investment management firm.

From the letter:
Do you really think most of todays art came about because of the Beatles?  I dont believe youre that insane  Paul  do you believe that? When you stop believing it you might wake up! Didnt we always say we were part of the movement  not all of it?"

With this John Lennon comment:
Christianity will go. It will vanish and shrink. I needn't argue about that; I'm right and I'll be proved right. **We're more popular than Jesus now**; I don't know which will go firstrock 'n' roll or Christianity. Jesus was all right but his disciples were thick and ordinary. It's them twisting it that ruins it for me.

	<TEXT> While I appreciate your point, with Singer it is easy to lose the forest for the trees.

His utilitarian views are ones that, for many, are morally reprehensible (even though those views may make logical sense).

For example, most people would agree that it is preferable to have a child that is not handicapped as opposed to a child that is. While this may seem logical, the commentary is viewed in the vacuum of what the reader may define as "handicapped." For example, I'm epileptic, but you wouldn't know that in utero. Do you execute me when you see signs (which BTW was at 13)? Logic is clean, but reality isn't.

While I myself send tend to skew towards many of Singer's points of view, I would be remiss if I didn't say that those same points of view could be corrupted e.g. The Nazis and ANYONE else. 

Practical ethics is invaluable, but if I recite Hamlet to my dog, and the only word he understands is "sit", then I haven't accomplished anything.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I appreciate that, I majored in philosophy (specifically ethics)

Singer has long been "contentious" for lack of a better word.

Positing that we should legalize what other countries have already done is hardly trailblazing, hence my snarky comment.

He is logical in a way that makes Sheldon Cooper look like Russell Crowe in Gladiator when he finds his family dead. 

Yes, prostitution should be legal for MANY reasons in US. My real point was simply that Singer tends to argue for better rights for animals (not including my opinion) or why we should, from a utilitarian perspective, eliminate genetic abnormalities (again, not sharing my opinion)

Him writing this article is like Babe Ruth playing in the beer leagues.  Unless Princeton said, "we need x number of articles per month," this seems to be a waste of his time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Best thing that could happen to America: Calexit.

California GDP is 6th largest in World
California GDP is almost 15% of entire US GDP
Per Business Insider:
The Golden State's ranches and farms raked in $47 billion in crop cash receipts in 2015. It produces over a third of the country's vegetables and two-thirds of fruits and nuts, making California's agriculture industry the largest in the nation.

California leaving the union would mean tens of billions of dollars in losses to US Gov't every year.  That won't only starve the beast, but the people on programs like SNAP, as well.

And let's not forget, as per the U.S. Department of Agriculture, white households are the largest recipients of government assisted food stamps

	<TEXT> While I agree with Singer on this, it must have been a slow day for him as this is a softball topic. I wonder if he has a quota for articles to maintain his position at Princeton?

Usually, he is positing arguments like (to paraphrase): eugenics will be a natural outcome of society with genetic engineering but only the rich will be able to afford it i.e. the rich will have perfect healthy babies and the poor will have genetically inferior children (that the rich would have modified or terminated in utero)

	<TEXT> Rule of thumb with debt is to pay off the highest interest rate first.

Additionally, even though the vehicle is a depreciating asset, by paying it off you are no longer underwater i.e. you can't "technically" lose more money on it (beyond it's loss in value). This allows you to sell it, if need be without concern for an encumberance.

If you dump that money into your mortgage, and the property suddenly ends up underwater, the value of that principal paydown could evaporate. 

Countering this argument would be, are you currently paying an FHA premium or PMI? Would paying that $7,500 into mortgage principal eliminate those payments, and if so, what's the payback date on that?

I.E. At what point does (PMI payment + FHA Payment) * (# of Months of payments) = $7,500 or more.

You could end up saving $7,500 and then some by eliminating those two payments with a principal pay down (depending on your current LTV) 

(Sorry for the seemingly contradicting answers but without knowing more specifics, I'm trying to account for all options. I'm also presuming you have a fixed rate, 30 year mortgage) </TEXT>

I kid, I kid. I am aware of his goal to be President again but my larger point was really meant to be apolitical. Any former foreign leader, and he still is a former foreign leader, is a figurehead with no actual "say."

Sure, other leaders may like his idea and seek to implement it, but for right now he's the only guy saying it, and he has no power.  Hence my comment about GWB.
