	<TEXT> We changed our name to r/POTUSWatch a week ago, that was because we decided we're going to track President Donald Trump's successors too and because other subs have refused to help us due to our name containing the word "Trump" so we didn't really have much choice. We made an [announcement](https://www.reddit.com/r/Trump_Watch/comments/60psbm/were_moving_to_rpotuswatch_a_note_of_transparency) last week which apparently a lot of subscribers here didn't recieve, therefore we resorted to setting Automod to spam this sub until y'all move to r/POTUSWatch (we post there regularly now), so sorry for the inconvenience and see ya there :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Welcome to the weekly stupid questions thread!** This is a place to ask any questions that you may have -- moronic or otherwise.

**Anyone may post a question, and the community as a whole is invited and encouraged to provide an answer.** If your question is more specific to you, we recommend providing details. The more we know about your situation, the better answer we will be able to provide. Many questions get submitted late each week that don't get much traction, so if your question didn't get answered before, feel free to post it again.

**As always, please check the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/gainit/wiki/index) before posting.** The FAQ  is considered a comprehensive guide on how to gain lean mass and has more than enough information to get any beginner started today.

 * This week I ripped my favorite pair of shorts -- it was awesome.

We encourage you all to post any triumph -- big or small.

	<TITLE> Food Club Bets (May 10, 2017) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-05-10 01:03:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A thread for people to casually post their bets, discuss, ask questions, etc.

#Food Club Resources
       
* Place Bets: http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=bet
* Collect Winnings: http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=collect
* Food Club Guide: http://www.neopets.com/~Jawsnapper0991
* Food Club stats (odds, food adjustment, previous round data): http://foodclub.daqtools.info/
* A bunch of Food Club betters: http://www.neopets.com/~Hostia

#Using Tables

/u/diceroll123 speaking! Instead of shorthand *(see header and content below)*, a prettier and easier alternative to posting bets has been made dead simple by me. :D

I've made a simple userscript to turn your [current bets](http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=current_bets) into a formatted reddit table!

If you have Chrome: get [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) to use it! Greasemonkey for Firefox, and I'm unsure about other browsers.

Link for the userscript here: https://gist.github.com/diceroll123/04fb835539530038795e (Press the "Raw" button and it should ask you to add it to your collection of userscripts.)

You'll see a button under your [current bets](http://www.neopets.com/pirates/foodclub.phtml?type=current_bets) table, click that and copy/paste here. [](/slorg)

#Understanding Shorthand

Pirate A x (Pirate B, Pirate C) is shorthand for Pirate A x Pirate B and Pirate A x Pirate C.

Similarly, Pirate A x (Pirate B, Pirate C) x (Pirate D, Pirate E) translates to:

Pirate A x Pirate B x Pirate D

Pirate A x Pirate B x Pirate E

Pirate A x Pirate C x Pirate D

Pirate A x Pirate C x Pirate E

Basically, [FOIL](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOIL_method) it out.

**Step Challenge**

StrideKick allows people from multiple fitness devices to compare steps (Fitbit, Garmin, Apple watch etc.), i've setup a weekly competition starting today and repeating each week. Anyone can join at any point and have their steps synced (ie. Join on a sunday and all your steps will be from the wednesday)

In order to join the challenge, you can send me a message with your email BUT the easiest way is to sign up to stridekick and then add me at a friend at https://stridekick.com/users/Itch0 and then join the challenge. If this is too much of a headache then we'll just do our own respective fitbit/garmin challenges.

Direct link to the challenge: https://stridekick.com/app#/segments/leaderboard?challenge_id=50624

**Fitness Discussion**

Weekly discussion about fitness goals, PB's, accomplishments or questions.

Sharing is obviously completely optional. For example of sharing sake;

I'm 6'5"
102.5 kg
Roughly 20% BF
I want to get to 90 kg
I eat: Fried chicken

This is a good chance for people who may be starting or have neglected fitness related goals to ask questions or just take some insight from other users.

------------------------

**Where the fuck do I start? I fucking want to do something but I really have no idea.**

If you're in this category, feel free to chime in. Or private message me, i've got experience (not professional, went to study medicine but decided I wanted to do graphic design because i'm a fucking moron)

There are multiple people I know on here that are involved in fitness or even just regular footy players who may know a thing or two.

Erath Connect is a social media network intended for use by those in New Erath. Here citizens can post their thoughts and memories with others being able to reply just like any other social media site.

A new thread will go up every Monday at 8pm UTC but you are free to comment on the current thread throughout the week. By default the thread sorts newest comments first and it is recommended to leave it that way particularly if a thread has a lot of comments.

By default any posts to Erath Connect are public, thus visible for anyone to see in the city or even those outside the city. If you wish for a character's post to only be visible to their friends put **(Private)** at the start of the comment.

Remember Erath Connect is a social media network so characters should use and speak on it like they would on any social media network.
