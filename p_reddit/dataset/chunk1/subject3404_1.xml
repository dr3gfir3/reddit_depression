	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I think this movie is one of my favorite animated movies in 2015. I like the voice cast so much. Mackenzie Foy, Rachel McAdams, Marion Cotillard, and Benicio Del Toro were stood out in this movie. I like Mackenzie Foy as an aspiring children who are looking for more adventure in her life. I like Rachel McAdams as uptight mother but slowly open her mind and heart to her daughter. I like Marion Cotillard as a Rose that can show her as a vulnerable being. And I like Benicio Del Toro as a Snake that cunning although his and Marion Cotillard roles were very brief in this movie

From the animation stand point, The 3d and the 2d stop motion animation were blended nicely in this movie and the transistion between two of them were smooth and memorable throughout the movie.

I think this movie is relatively safe and the story was normal but most of the elements in this movie were executed nicely in this movie.

I think this movie is 7.5 out of 10

Here is the [trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fEPqgSNLfK8)

Rotten Tomatoes score is [90%](http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_little_prince_2015/) (It is from 10 Reviews as I write my thoughts)

You can have the discussion here if you watched the movie. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I drunk and I need to talk about how amazing Interstellar (the one with Christopher Nolan, not the Daft Punk one) is. None of my friends have seen it and that makes me very sad. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Holy fuck! Look at that cinematography!**

If you needed one reason to watch this movie, it has to be the brilliant visuals. The use of color to tell the story is jaw dropping. You need to watch the film at least 3 times to start to understand how well the imagery works with the story.

**Why am I crying while watching some mindfuck scene**

No spoilers, but the story behind some of the mindfuck grabs my heart and punches it 3 times. Yeah, the cinematography is top notch and has a Nolan's Mindfuck flair, but how often do you see mindfuck scenes that mean so much to the story. I dated a chick (hell I even married, knocked up, and divorced that broad) who would sleep through all mindfuck scenes in a movie. The man in me thought this was cheesy as the mindfuck scenes were so cool. But as I matured (and possible as mindfuck movies started sucking more), I started to get it. If the mindfuck does not move the plot forward much, it is just ~~mindless entertainment~~ a flick. Not in Interstellar. Fuck no! The mindfuck means something and often it adds so much depth to the characters. If you fall asleep during those scenes you will miss so much story

**Have I talked about the story yet?**

So the story is amazing. You start the film and pretty early, you do not know where it is going. Yawn, kinda unpredictable. The story is amazing because it touches many aspects. From the sprawling dissection of humanity's evil and selfishness through Dr. Hugh Mann (played in an Oscar-deserving performance by Matthew Damon), to the beautiful Oedipal relationship between a father and his daughter. In one film, Nolan manages to explore the furthest reaches of space and time, and ultimately collapses into a blackhole, symbolic of how he has filled a great void consuming modern cinema.

**Some ideals are worth killing for but the best ideals are worth dying for**

The message goes into some next-level philosophical shit. The protagonist doesn't get it at first and neither will you. This is the kinda thing that you have to think about after the movie to fully understand. There is many fucking spoon-feeding here boy, so you gotta figure it out by eat that expositions .

**In conclusion, this is the kind of movie you can love and can make love to**

I am not one for favorite anything let alone movies. I can never name a favorite film, actor, or even burrito. I love many things and can't be nailed down to a single one of anything. But this film me makes think I might be becoming movie-monogamous in my old age (33, yeah, I think I am old already). Seriously, this is thw only movie that I just love.

But I am also very drunk right now. So what the fuck do I know. I think I will eat another burrito and fuck Interstellar over and over again.

Edit: "I drunk" in the fucking title? faceplam </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>  While filming one of the first few scenes for The Martian, Donald Glover accidentally tripped and ate it  not badly enough to cause any lasting harm, of course, but badly enough to cause his colleagues to gasp in shock, and to necessitate an ice pack after the fact. Yet director Ridley Scott plans to leave Glovers fall in the final film, since thatll make the scene feel all the more humanizing.

	<TEXT> According to this [classification](https://np.reddit.com/r/moviescirclejerk/comments/3ee8sc/enlightened_redditor_reminds_us_plebs_that_there/cte3mo0) for the people who watch films, I ended up as the common man.

I admit I do not want to be the common man all the time, but my diet only consists of Transformers, Harry Potters and Avengers. Should I excavate a little deeper into the [mineshaft](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2wasq4/birdman_poster_by_steve_chorney/cop5xhq) of cinema or should I try watch many [films, cinemas, and absolute kinography.](https://np.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/2oo3hg/post_your_top_10/cmox7oz).

I think most of the cinephiles in here know what to do to improve the situation. And I need your help.

Thank you for reading this.

	<TEXT> Before the new Fantastic Four movie some of the people said just because it is from fox, that does not mean it will be bad. And now, most of the people and critics who saw it earlier are said this film is bad.

I know that as a human, some times we are too quick too judge things before any further details. But based on the trailer and the plot, I could see that some people have speculated that the movie will be bad.

I want this movie to be good primarily because I want to enjoy this movie not because I want to prove that /r/movies wrong

So the question is, Do you guys like to prove that r/movies readers are wrong? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> There are 5 types of people that watch films </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-24 12:25:45 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There are 5 types of people that watch films:

* Cinephile Hipsters: People who only watch movies as an art instead of entertainment, who think all film needs to be shot with long takes and with visual storytelling, or with just meaningful dialogue that is very vague that is supposed to make you think, and also only think that older directors are the only directors who knew what they were doing.

* Nostalgia Suckers: These are the guys who only view old movies as good movies, people like these say Tim Burton's Batman is better than Nolan's Batman when clearly that isn't true, or that John Wayne's True Grit is better than the Coen Bros True Grit. Also people who say Citizen Kane is the greatest movie of all time just because it pioneered modern filmmaking and cinematography, it's like saying the Neanderthals made the best wheel even though it was made of rock. Logic and normality doesn't exist wth these people.

* The Movie Lover in Betweener guy: These are the best people, they view film subjectively but also see past the bullshit idea that you have to critique everything when you watch a movie, these people see a movie and realize that being entertaining is also as important as being artistic. Being this person doesn't make you ignorant to film art because if you were, then you wouldn't be able to tell that the Transformers movies suck.
* The Common Man: Goes to a movie to be entertained purely. Art house bullshit is boring for them and film is supposed to keep them from getting bored.

* The Know-It-All: These are the type who think they know movies because they've seen YouTube vids too much or had a film class in high school. They view other people's opinions and taste as wrong. They point out blatant obviousness like it makes them intelligent and also like the cinephile only view movies as what they think they should be. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I saw Minions (2015) and here is my review. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-18 06:02:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I saw the new Minions Movie and although Despicable Me   Despicable Me 2 are better movies, but Minions was entertaining. Here are my thoughts:

* I like how they gave the three main minions, Kevin, Stuart, and Bob some personalities so their character more alive in this movie

* I think Sandra Bullock as Scarlett Overkill did a decent job voicing the villain in this movie but I wish her character is not so one dimensional so the human character can balance the minion

* I think Jon Hamm also did a good job in voicing eccentric inventor and the husband of Scarlett Overkill. But his character also one dimensional.

* I think most of the jokes were funny in this movie and I think most of the kids will understand the jokes.

* Some of the Human Characters were interesting but I wish they had more screen time in this movie.

* I think the movies was good but it still feels empty because you just can't rely on the Minion Characters to make this movie more stand out

Overall, In my opinion, I think this movie still a success from Illumination Entertainment despite the flaws. I think this movie is good if you want to relieve some stress by watching some of the Minion's ridiculous behaviors.

If I have to give score to this movie, I think the appropriate score for me is 6.5-7.0/ 10 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I Just Watched They Came Together and I thought it was one of the best RomCom satire that I've ever seen. There are many RomCom cliches that mentioned in this movie and I liked it. The casts are the people from some of your favorite comedy shows and movies.

Does anyone want to discuss this movie? </TEXT>
