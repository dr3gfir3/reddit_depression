	<TEXT> I'm still not convinced because NASA describes it as a sun dog in my other comment and the wikipedia page you linked to says "but they are not always obvious or bright. " </TEXT>

 NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory produced result earlier than expected when its launch produced visible atmospheric ripples and destroyed a sundog. What created those rocket waves, and why did they destroy that sun dog? Close inspection of this image shows not only a rocket rising near the center, but unusual air ripples around it and a colorful sundog to the far right. The rocket, carrying the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), lifted off two weeks ago from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA into a cold blue sky. The SDO is designed to observe the Sun continuously over the next several years, exploring the Sun's atmosphere at high resolution and fast time scales. The air ripples -- seen about one minute after launch -- were unexpected, as was the sudden disappearance of the sundog after the ripples passed. Noticed and recorded by several onlookers, there has been much speculation about the origin of the ripples. A leading hypothesis holds that the ripples resulted from a sonic boom created as the rocket broke the sound barrier, which then jumbled a thin layer of ice crystals that were aligned to create the sundog. Lingering questions include why other rocket launches don't produce air ripples as noticeable, and why the ripples appeared more prominent above the rocket.  </TEXT>
