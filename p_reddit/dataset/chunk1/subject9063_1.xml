I have about 9 or 10 expansions purchased from native instruments and they all are awesome. It's really sweet because they are ready to go all tagged and in groups. They are expensive but worth it when they go on sale. If you need any tutorials YouTube has tons. Maschine masters and maschine tutorials good ones to start with. Have fun!  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Poor circulation? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-10-22 04:50:23 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am 18 years old, Male and I believe I have poor circulation. In the past four or five months my arms and legs fall asleep alot easier (go all tingly) in sometimes normal positions. Just this past month my cuts have been healing alot slower. Usually my cuts are gone in a few days but I have had cuts now for 3 weeks. They go red and don't fully heal. I also have very shallow breathing alot of the time.
 I plan on seeing a doctor soon but just moved away for school I'm January so my doctor isn't near. It is also hard to find time with work. I also smoke alot of marijuana and I think this might cause my poor circulation. 
My height is 6 ft and I weigh 145 lbs. Also I should add I have depression and anxiety issues so this could be all in my head. Which happens alot but this time I have multiple symptoms so I am a little more concerned. 
Thank you </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Not all audio playing through turntable </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-04-25 14:37:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Posted this to /r/turntables but it's not very active. I have a problem with my turntable. Recently not all the audio is playing. For instance the drums will come through but the vocals and other instruments are distorted and not playing properly. I have replaced the needle, adjusted the weight of the arm and switched the cartridge with my dad's and the same problem still happens. I know my dad's cartridge and needle work because my records play perfectly on his turntable. I will probably end up returning it or bringing it in to be fixed but I work 75 hour weeks and do not have the time right now. Just wondering if anyone else has had the same problem or knows a solution </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let's say you had a budget of $2500 to build a turntable. Would buying a $2400 needle with a cheap $100 turntable produce the same/better sound then a $1500 deck with a $300 arm and a $700 needle? 
Basically, would a cheap deck with an expensive needle be a dumb idea? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Looking to get into vinyl sampling, not really interested in scratching at this point. Il just get down to the main questions. 
1. Does the turntable matter? Or can I pick up an old turntable off my dad and buy a new needle? Or would the quality suffer? 
2. Do USB turntables suffer quality? 
3. If I get a turntable attach it to a phono preamp and then get the adapted to my laptop will I be able to rip/sample right into fl studio or ableton? Thanks for any help in advance I'm kind of new to this! Plus this is my first post on reddit! </TEXT>
