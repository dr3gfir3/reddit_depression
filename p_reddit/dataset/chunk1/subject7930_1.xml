	<TEXT> Take a walk.

Especially for anxiety brought on by social situations- whether it's a large group or a one on one conversation. I've committed to making myself take a walk if my feelings become overwhelming. Separation from the situation doesn't magically solve anything, but it does give me room to breathe and calm down and I often return much more capable of handling the situation and myself.

TL;DR- I'm an introvert dolphin in an extrovert sea so sometimes I have to swim to the surface to take a breath  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In light of the new title reveal, it's still all I can think about. Where are all the other Knights? Did Kylo turn on all of them after they rebelled against Luke?  Do they all have the surname Ren? How were they strong enough to defeat Luke AND all the other Jedi in training? How many Jedi were there? Did any survive? Why didn't they kill Luke too? Are the films implying Luke ran away? Who the hell is Snoke and is he Darth Snoke or Snoke Ren and while I'm hypothesizing, Darth Kylo sounds stupid as hell. 

Sigh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you don't want to take the time to write one, just tell me what you think of mine ('wow ur so dumb") and/or speculate on what could have been ("Revenge of the Sandpeople?") 

Here's mine:

Terror is spreading across the Republic. After decades of peace under the leadership of General Leia Organa, a group of young Jedi called THE KNIGHTS OF REN have rebelled against the teachings of Luke Skywalker. Their seemingly random attacks have left the entire galaxy living in fear of where they might strike next.

In the face of his failure, Luke has vanished. Determined to restore order to the Force, he has embarked on a quest to unravel mysteries of the Jedi that have been unexplored for centuries.

Desperate to find Luke and protect her people, Leia has sent her most daring pilot on a secret mission to Jakku, where an old ally has discovered a clue to Lukes whereabouts..

(PS- this is for fun. Not to incite chaos or anger. 
Anger leads to hate, hate leads to.. well, you know) </TEXT>

One flight a kid next to me was eating a tray meal. She was, of course, playing with her food. Nothing wrong with that, I do the same. She then grabbed her spoon and stared at it. Stared at me.

A minute or so later it finally clicked with the Mom what was happening and she grabbed the spoon and the tray and her kid. </TEXT>

I reached over a row of seats, through the two people standing in front of me, and knocked the spider off her back and to the floor. Everyone looked at me in judgement for awkwardly swatting at a woman- but I knew what I had done, and I was at peace. </TEXT>
