$1000 fine and up to 10 years in prison if a citizen hurts/kills a police dog and if a police officer uses deadly force on your dog you are the one that is in trouble. How fucked up is that?

Throw in windchill and you are talking about -30F to -60F (-34C to -51C) as a normal temp. You can die in that temp in 10min with just jeans and a t-shirt on...add water and you reduce it to minutes.

	<TEXT> I seriously dont understand why cops think they can get away with this shit. Not only are you abusing power you are causing the person to lose faith in the system and un-needed financial cost.

To some people, $6,000 in legal fees to protect yourself from an asshole cop is worth violence over. </TEXT>

It is all metal and very balanced in my hand, not too light or too heavy, and is in a flat black that is not reflective. LOVE IT.

* Make sure to DRINK water, I cant tell you how many times the Bride or Groom (or bridal party) have fainted from being dehydrated on a summer day and the just *BOOM* pass out during the wedding.

* Brides: this is your day AND your husband's, not your mother's, not his mother's, not your family's day, if you want something different put your foot down or else you will remember what you didn't get instead of what you wanted.

* Do not get excessively drunk, it might be something you have done or do but you don't need the family, relatives, and friends to remember you "punching Aunt Judy because she is a bitch"

* Most important: THIS IS JUST 1 DAY, you have THOUSANDS left with your Husband/Wife, remember this is the start to your Chapter  together as a single unit, for better or worse you BOTH will write the chapters of your lives TOGETHER from now on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not talking about that, I am talking about the cops that get caught doing something that is against the law and they get a slap on the wrist. If you are a cop that gets pulled over drinking and driving, most of the time you are just warned and let off. Or the cops that were caught with CP and they get a few months in house arrest (they lost their job so that is a plus). There a thousands of stories where the cop is getting less punishment because he/she is/was a police officer and the citizens that commit the same crimes get the full punishment. That is not true "law enforcement", the law should apply EQUALLY to EVERYONE, not just citizens. 

As soon as cops are punished the same way as the people they are suppose to be protecting, that is when there is true "law enforcement". </TEXT>
