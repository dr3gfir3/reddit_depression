	<TEXT> Having social justice issues being represented to the general public by idiots like this is one of the reasons for the rise of the "alt-right".

Most people that hold progressive ideas about race and gender are more or less reasonable but it is usually the loony idiots that have to hurl themselves into center stage and grab the microphone to spew their nonsense.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a one man business, a sole proprietor manufacturing business in California, I make parts for one company only and I occasionally will make more parts than have been ordered for the sake of efficiency. Occasionally I will be stuck with parts that do not get re-ordered or my customer may change his specs and I am stuck with unsalable stock.

  Can I and how should I express this as a loss on my taxes? Can I use my customers price as the base for this? can I only take off this year what I made this year? 

Any help is much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So I went to a Californio Bridlehorse Association thing </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-22 06:53:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT>   They describe it as "Early Californio skills of the rancho" and it was very different from any rodeo I have seen, there is a strong emphasis on historical equipment such as [rawhide riatas](http://imgur.com/tB30aFu) as well as old [traditional vaquero reining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosal). There is also a general respect between rider, horse, and cattle with the rider and horse moving in a much more fluid almost intuitive style compared to other stockmans competition I have seen.

There is also a strong emphasis on being able to work the cattle gently so as to not spook or injure them or run off any precious weight.

The competition involved a few different sorting, penning, and roping exhibitions and while it was about the slowest and least exciting rodeos I have seen it was also among the most beautiful to watch with many subtleties that I am sure escaped the eye of a non-rider like myself. Actually seeing riders throw figure eight loops so as to catch the steers neck with one loop and a front leg or two with the other was a real treat and seeing real [cattlemen](http://i.imgur.com/sBZgjKk.jpg) some of whom looked as ancient as the hills also added to the beauty of the competition. 

I would very much recommend checking out the [Californio Bridlehorse Association](http://www.californiobridlehorseassociation.com/), reading up on them and seeing their next show. </TEXT>
