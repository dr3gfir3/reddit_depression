	<TEXT> I get lonely. Being left alone with nothing to think about except my failures is torture, and I like hearing other people talk. I like to see or hear someone else's ideas or creativity or desires or passions. I've grown bored of my own and of myself, which I'm beginning to think others have too. It's good you found contentment in being alone though. Thank you for sharing. </TEXT>

I get so depressed I deactivate my Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and block my "friends" from contacting me. Nobody wants to make any effort to hang out or talk to me, even after I've reached out, so they can go to hell for all I care. I need friendship and support and have literally none. Plenty of acquaintances and people who pretend to like me as long as they get something out of it. It's just another cause of my stress anxiety and depression. The lack of genuine friendship in a time of need just makes me question myself even more. Does anyone else do this? Does it help? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was off meds and doing okay for the last 3 years. A couple months ago I felt manic, then an inevitable spiral downward ever since. I have hit an all time low, and it has ruined my career, I'm now unemployed, it has ruined my credit, and is ruining my relationships with family. My parents and spouse all want to fix me and hold me responsible for literally everything and I can't do anything anymore. Im overwhelmed and devastated that I'm no longer the functioning person I used to be. I'm losing everything and can't stop it on my own. I can't see a doctor until the second week of December to get treatment and it has been hell and will only get worse until then. I have no money and no insurance to be seen sooner, my bills and debt are piling up so fast (went from $3k/month to $0) and it's only making everything worse. I wish I could put life on hold but life doesn't wait. If you trip, you drown. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was diagnosed by a psychologist, who then recommended me to a psychiatrist as a psychologist cannot prescribe medications. The psychiatrist agreed immediately with my diagnosis and so have a few others since then. Don't mention medication or any specific drug. They'll gladly put you on depakote or lithium if you're truly bipolar. Mood altering drugs like Xanax or Ritalin or Adderall probably won't be prescribed until you've exhausted the others and they see no improvement. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I smoked recently for the first time being in an extremely depressed and desperate state. My anxiety and depression were so strong and I have no meds or insurance. When I smoked, I got a much needed break from the anxiety and my mood stabilized for the night. I played grand theft auto and laughed out loud for the first time in a month. It helped tremendously as a band aid. I cant smoke 24/7 though, and when the high wears off I'm right back to where I started. No noticeable negative effects for me coming down, but everyone is different. I recommend trying it if you need relief immediately. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as manic episodes go, it's great when you have a good day or week. it becomes annoying when it's ridiculously over the top and energized and you're extremely chipper in situations that call for calm or a more subdued attitude. It's hard to take someone seriously when it seems their positivity and energy seems fake and doesn't fit the situation. Aim for stability, where you are in control of your emotions instead of them controlling you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drinking is a downer. It's going to make you feel worse if you have too much so be careful with that. And as far as telling people, I've told almost everyone I know who is close to me that I am bipolar. I've lost some friendships because they can't handle my personality, and I haven't attempted to fix those relationships for their own sake. It sucks because I liked them, but they get offended or hurt or weirded out if I'm not feeling my best. So if they can't be supportive and understanding, then we don't need to have any relationship at all. You don't need anyone who stresses you out, disappoints you, causes you to feel inferior or like something is wrong with you.. we don't need people telling us we are inadequate because we aren't normal. We do that to ourselves enough. Put some distance between you and whatever and whoever could be stressing you out or causing depression. It's okay to be selfish once in a while and do literally whatever you want to feel better. Medication and professional help is your safest option. I would take advantage of anyone willing to help you out because you're worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm experiencing it now. No medication, no therapy. Just extreme depression and ridiculous anxiety and it's affecting my job, my relationship with family and friends, and my appetite. I've never had it this bad in the past. I find it hard to sleep, I am in a constant state of worry. Your manic episode lasting that long may have not been mania at all but genuine stability and happiness. Have you been diagnosed? If so, what type? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I like your post because I remember being there. Self medicating, using anything to alter my mood if I felt anything other than incredible. I stopped those. I did okay without medication for 3 years. It never goes away, and comes back with a vengeance when the depression does return. I am fighting for my sanity right now actually. I was a high functioning highly intelligent proactive person when I was feeling good. I'm the total opposite now and know I need help to get out of it. But it has to be done the right way and stability is better than swinging from low to unnatural high and back. All we want is stability, normality, and happiness. We don't know what is normal because we aren't. Rely on those who are to tell you when you seem normal. It's the only way we can succeed in this society and be somewhat happy. I remember being in a manic phase how amazing it felt. It's a shame not everyone can experience that forever, if at all. People like me and they don't as well. They like me, but something keeps them at a distance and I am still very lonely. They are entertained by my personality but on a deeper level once they get to know me I become too much to handle. Maybe that's what your friend is going through. Idk. I'm just passing time trying to forget my own complicated misery by trying to figure out yours lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was emotionally abusive when I didn't know I was bipolar. I did and said things to my now ex wife that I don't remember, but when she told me I felt horrible. Never once did I physically hurt her, but that doesn't mean the feeling didn't arise. In a rage I broke things, punched things, threw my wedding ring out the window on the freeway in front of her because of how angry I was, and I don't even remember why. But I never once hurt her. It is a choice. You have to know you will lose everything and hurt so much more if you physically abuse those you love. I lost my wife because of this illness, and hurt for years after the divorce, and not once did I blame her for it. She didn't deserve any of it. The thing I have found that helps me now in angry rages is to separate myself immediately from those I love. They have been forewarned that if I disappear suddenly  to not take it personally and my sudden departure is much better than the alternative. Don't be afraid or too prideful to walk away. </TEXT>
