	<TEXT> It's the fact that my life hasn't  changed much. I always  thought I am making progress and changing myself but now I look back I realize I am still like I was before. I am 19 now and I thought as I grow up, I will stop worrying about littlest of things but I guess it's in my genes to get  worked up and trapped in my mind. I might  have anxiety, I don't know.  Also, I used to  think school was the problem in my life and as soon as I graduate high school I will be  a  different person but I have  fallen back to that same mindset.  I have realized school was not the problem. I was. It was me  who wasn't creative/intelligent/athletic enough. School actually  offered lots of opportunities. I was the one who blew it. Even now, I have some days where I feel everything is perfect then I get days like today where I feel the future is bleak. After so  much introspection, after so  much walking and  wondering in the park, after all the time I have allowed myself to think things through,  I still feel I haven't made significant changes in my life.
I started to think maybe earning money will solve my problem but now I think it won't. The simple fact I have learned is that the external environment is just not the problem. The problem lies with in me. Despite knowing the answers, I fail to implement and execute my plans.
My 13 year old would be  glad I am still going strong and I have proved many doubters  wrong. He would be proud that I am  still trying but he would be disappointed  that I haven't turned everything around  and to learn the fact that external factors were never the problem. It was  all inside him all along. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know much about technicalities of the subject but all I can say is you're not alone in this so don't beat yourself over it. Maybe use online sources? There are plenty to help you out. Get a study buddy who might motivate you  and help you out where you make errors? I  have a  friend who usually helps  me out when I am stuck. Although I don't like  that  I usually have to take the help because it hurts my ego but sometimes  you got to accept you're not the best and seek  help. Sorry if  it is not much help  but that's all I can offer right  now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It gets real hard and especially initially people  are scared because it's all new. Once you get the hang of it and get used to it most people simply realize worrying won't do anything. Even if they worry  they are  good at hiding it because showing that  you're worried  might put other people off  and bring down the morale of everyone else. So, the best thing is to face it and see what happens. Oh, and also, it's not like you're going to be beaten up or anything like that so why worry that much lol </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only way is to practice and work hard NOW! I understand you're quite behind but you know what? I am learning web development and I  am having a hard time with CSS. I feel like I don't belong in  this anymore but even not so smart people can learn graphic and web design. I just realized I don't practice enough and I am not really putting much effort. So, I guess I can be good IF only I start dedicating my time in it  and make efforts. 
I just want to say I struggle with self doubt too so you're not alone.  Just hang in there and realize that studying and practicing is the only way to get a grip on the subject.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am relating to this SO DAMN FUCKING HARD!  I felt  the exact same way when I came to college initially. I am in second year and I feel a whole lot more comfortable  this year  but that spark is just not there. Back in elementary, middle and high school it used to feel so warm and pleasant. I felt real connections with my friends. Maybe, we don't feel so connected now because we are aware people can be double faced and it's just not a good idea to open up too much because that might bring unnecessary drama in your life.  I don't have a lot of solutions for this but I think you just need to make sure you interact with your friends.  Keep yourself open and keep doing things. You might make a friend when you're least expecting it.  This funny thing happened to me. By the time I came to college in my first year I had given up on life and I was merely existing. I was really depressed and burn out due to constant nagging from teachers and stress to get great grades to get into a good college. Turns out all that ridicule by teachers was all a time waste because I proved them wrong and got really great grades. Got into a good college but my troubles didn't end there. Like I said, due to so many negativity at home and in school and so much pressure I got depressed and I burnt out as well. Then I found a  girl(not my gf right now). She was all over me. Like, she told me she has a crush on me but I was depressed so I just didn't give a fuck. We are good friends at the moment and she has bailed me out on many occasions. She has helped me out in every assignment, research paper and  just about everything. I will always be grateful that she showed so much affection towards me otherwise I'd have dropped out due to bad  grades. I have managed to pass all my classes despite being so  mentally fatigued and she had a big role to play in that.  What I am trying to say is,  when I finally gave up on everything, thought it's all over for me and that I merely want to exist now, I found someone who reminded me that I am not a bad person after all. That I deserve affection and attention.  I am hoping something happens out of nowhere and I can feel the pure happiness once again leaving my past behind.  It's really nice to hope buddy. It gives us strength to face the challenges of today.   I just want to conclude that you might find someone or a life changing event might happen and all your worries might go away. Just keep hoping and make the effort for it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have noticed  psychology professors are usually the most stupid. It's kinda ironical. They have studied the human mind and they learn and talk about things like unconditional positive regard, empathy  etc and yet they are  the least helpful among the professors.  
I have  got few stupid psychology professors as well and I hate them so much. I love the subject but those professors have sucked the joy out of this subject. This is why I am learning graphic and web designing as well and honestly web designing seems to be more interesting now  due to these pathetic professors. Also, it's more of a straight forward and to the point subject while psychology is highly opinion-oriented.  I don't know, that kind of a professor is very harmful to the students. I would be tempted to drop the class.
However, don't think about dropping yet. Just prepare the things they'll ask  in the exam and give your best. Then see  where you want to go from there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You shouldn't say that. I fucked even more badly than the OP during my first year but I cleared all my exams and even got a B in Stats exam and my teachers thought I'd fail everything. I am probably the biggest procrastinator this world has seen and will ever see and yet I am here in my second year. My third semester will be completed within 2 more months and then I'll be even closer to graduate. I have improved but I still procrastinate here and there but I will stick it out. College is not supposed to be a cake walk. It is hard and we will  face harder challenges in our working life but that doesn't mean we have to give up. If ranting helps then do it time to time and try harder. That's it. Main aim is to get the damn degree with at least an average-above average grades/GPA. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Man! I totally feel you. I have become an anxious wreck today thinking about all the paper work I have to do.  I am majoring in Applied Psychology(not in USA) and there are so many papers to write  in this course.  I have to write 20-30 pages each for 6-7 practicals and I hate hand written work. Anyway, we have computers and laptops in the real world so why do we still have to write stuff down? We can just type it out.  This is something I never understand about colleges. Like, it was okay to do this in school but in real world, we'll always have access to information and a computer to type all of it so why the hell do we have to write 180-200 pages every semester?  I am also getting a certificate in graphic and web designing and I plan to learn 3D animation and VFX as well. To be honest, psychology seems to be full of women and it's just hard to cooperate with so many women. Teachers are huge feminists. I do not have problem with them but reminding us every second how women are always oppressed is just annoying.  The only good thing is that education in my country is very cheap so I won't go into debt and I can take more than 1  UG degree without any troubles. Also, I can easily afford to get certificates in Graphic and web design and also in a subject like Accountancy.  I can be very flexible with job prospects like that and I won't go into debt.  That is really a relief knowing that I can get my BA  in Applied Psychology by the age of 21 and then I'll still have time to see if I want to do something else. Meanwhile, I can look for  jobs, save up money and see where I want to go from there.  I wanted to drop out during my  first year but now I am thinking I should stick it out, get a BA and see what happens. A big reason why I don't want to drop out is that I don't know what else I'd be doing if I drop it now especially after clearing first year and only having 2 more years to see off. This is the only thing that keeps me going. I am too lazy to work right now so the best bet is to graduate and then see where I end up at. I repeat, being in no debt whatsoever will be liberating and  will give me a chance to be flexible with my work life.  EDIT: I forgot to mention that I am enjoying Web design a whole lot more than Psychology because it is more technical and practical than Psychology. Psychology is way too theoretical and there is too much useless handwritten work. </TEXT>

She immediately smiled and talked to me. I realized it's not really that hard. I just have to say Hello and talk to her whenever I see her. That's what you should do as well.  Talk to your crush and try to make it seem normal at first. Build friendship and then you can go on from there.  I wish I was in your class mate!

	<TEXT> That there is so much to see and discover on this planet even after we have acquired knowledge of space. Like, we know lots of things about outer space and our universe but there are places yet to be discovered on our planet and we still have to discover more about our oceans.   Also it is amazing that sometimes we get worked up about things like a simple class test while there are so many things happening around in the world. I mean, a single human being doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things. Forget about one human being, it is highly possible we as a species don't matter either. Blows my mind.  Also, all the creativity and myths we have seen for so many years. What about Hindu Gods? Also, the legendary dragons? Even if they were imaginary how did people  even think about it?  Human mind has endless potential. This entire thing is so complex. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Wasted one year at college? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-17 19:38:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel like I have wasted one year of college already. I had a terrible depression and severe anxiety during my first year of college. Once I  got  there I have no trouble in talking to my peers and I think they generally liked me because whenever I wouldn't come they'd always ask why I am not coming and when I'm going to be back. 
  The trouble is it wasn't that I did not want to go but whenever I had to go, I'd be severely anxious in the morning and because of that I used to skip classes. However, whenever I went there, I had no trouble in talking to them.  The thing is I skipped a lot of days during my first year and my teachers got angry because of that. I missed out on opportunities and making a new friend circle. I had bad grades(albeit it could have been worse so that's not the main problem).   
  Mainly, I am feeling bad because I think I missed out on a lot of things due to my anxiety. I have two more years to get  my BA and the  fact that this time will not come back kind of feels like a stab with a knife. I haven't got a girlfriend. I just don't  care about anything much now a days but I still feel bad.
Also, my anxiety still hasn't gone away completely so I still skip classes here and there. 
Just want to have some advice and if you could share your college life then that'd  be great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a college student right now and I usually put no effort in useless things.  Don't get me wrong, I put effort when I have exams but in this instance, our teachers tell us to write a rough draft for practical file and then write them in fair.
  I'd love to type it out and email them but they want it hand  written. I put no effort in that and just wait for few students to submit their rough drafts and then like me, most of the class just copies their stuff. Why are some teachers so narrow minded? I'd like to know, do you bother to put great effort in your work/study everyday? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nice to  see that you're planning to tough it out this semester. Believe me, I am in my third semester and I still sometimes think about just ending it all.But then again, what will I do even if I quit? I knew the best time to do college was now because a gap year can either make it or break it. I also decided to stick it out and so far I am doing okay.
I have September to go then I will have a lot of off days for October. I have to go till Nov 11 and then I'll have preparatory leave. My theory exams will commence from 24  Nov. So, it's only few days for me to attend college then I will have some time off and another semester under my belt. 
Then I'll have 3 more semesters to get my BA.
I think I made the right choice  of staying. Dropping out would have meant starting all over so it's something that you always need to really think about.
I am happy you're going to see off this semester but make sure after this semester, even if you do drop out, think about it deeply and never ever sit at home doing nothing. Getting out of the house and meeting people will be important. </TEXT>

I am planning to be a lot more present in class in my semester 4 now. Semester 1 was okay for me. Semester 2 was a disaster.  Semester 3 has been relatively better. I still skip classes though. Old habits die  hard. Even if I just become punctual, I am sure I'll end up with 60-70% or maybe even 80-90% so skipping has been the biggest issue for me.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am the same but the question is even if you go home or dropout then what else will you do anyway? The best time is now. I have seen people saying they are not ready for college and then they just get lazy and spend days inside  their room. 
Those people who do not want to attend college must have a job or be involved in some kind of physical activity. Socializing becomes important as well. 
It's very easy to get lazy when you finish high  school. That is  something we'll have to learn. Self discipline is the key. Easier said than done.
Anyway, just want to  let you know I can relate but sticking it out is   the best option. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stupid parents.
I  hate it when people procreate even knowing fully well that they are not financially stable or have way too many bad habits or they're too irresponsible to have kids.
People just say it's a basic human right but it's stupid. If you can't afford to have kids then don't have them.
I will never have kids until I am ready to provide them a decent life.
My father is the most irresponsible person I have ever seen and I am a lot like him in this regard.  
I will make sure I am qualified to become a father rather than conforming to society's standard of living.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It happened in 2014 or 2015.
I was at my cousin's house and me, my brother and my cousin sister were standing in the balcony enjoying the wonderful night. 
Suddenly, I saw three huge red dots gliding slowly in the sky. They were  really large and we knew it was not an  airplane or an aircraft that we'd ever seen. It was really bizarre.
It was shining very brightly but I didn't have a smartphone during that time so I couldn't take any pics. 
I was taken  aback and kept wondering what it might be. Then it all disappeared and till this date, we don't know what it actually was. 
It happened in Asia.
Also, I would like to add those three large dots seemed very near yet they felt quite far away. Like I said, it was bizarre. 
Not sure if they were aliens or not but that was a UFO for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you an introvert? I am a lot like you bud.I have acquaintances but no close friends in college because I  commute 1.5 hours daily to get to college. I don't mind not having lots of friends. I am still in touch with high school friends and I have got few cousins with whom I enjoy. So, I have never really tried to make a lot of friends in college. I have some people with whom I talk to once I get there. I have no trouble if I have to talk because we can talk about studies, classes,movies and random bullshit. 
You have to realize most people are morons anyway. A lot of them are selfish. As you grow older, people would want to be friends with you for their own profit. 
That is why I am still in contact with high school friends because they're trustworthy and I take a lot of time before putting faith in a person. 
If you really want friends then you can try out meetups. Talk more to the acquaintances. Join clubs etc. 
It's really up to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see you're really sad. You're depressed. Sometimes I feel like I am depressed too but not diagnosed. I don't know how did I spend my last 5 years. I am 19 right now and ever since I turned 13-14 I lost track and got lost. For the last 5-6 years, I have been running away from life. Constantly hating myself for little things. No self believe. Hating my guts. Hating my personality and believing there is something fundamentally wrong with me.
I hate the fact I have skipped 3 days in a row of college. I went there on Monday. I felt good. People loved to see me. I  didn't come across as someone having anxiety or depression. Maybe I don't have it really.
But then I didn't go on Tuesday, Wednesday and today.
I overslept and hating myself ever since I woke up today.
But I will go tomorrow. I will go the next week and will try to make things better for myself everyday. 
I won't give up. I am still young. I have a lot of life ahead of me. I have people who love me. 
So do you OP. 
Hang in there.
You can do it. Find a part time job or get a certificate in something to get a job. Hit the gym. See your old friends. Talk to someone. People love you OP. They really do. No one hates you. 
You are depressed but keep trudging. You'll slowly get there.
One more thing, everyone has to die so why not give it a shot and see where life takes you? Why end it all? It is not good today but it might be great tomorrow. Then you'll wonder why did you even think about ending it all. 
Get a job, decide what you want out of life, go and get a  degree later once you know what you want to do, save up money and know that many people are in the same boat so talk to people. Let them know you are there. Let someone know you'll be there when the going gets tough. Someone needs you OP. Somewhere, someone out there wants you and want you to be happy and help them in their life too. Don't give up. Stay there, go to the park, go to the gym and hope.
Hope keeps us all alive. Hope for a better tomorrow. </TEXT>

Be a man and don't give in to any emotional bullshit.
You'll meet many MANY attractive women in your life so better find someone better than the current one.
It all sounds harsh and mean but I am being blunt about it. I met a super attractive girl in high school and thought she was amazing and my "soul mate"  LMAO! That was  utter bullshit.
She was nothing. She had a terrible attitude and was too proud of herself. I have seen many attractive women since then and it's easy to get a crush on someone new. 
Just don't think high school is the end. Your life hasn't even begun yet.

	<TEXT> I understand some people have ambitions but my college peers(usually girls) freak out way too much and spoil my good mood with their mood swings. I have been trying hard to convince them that they should just relax and take it all easy. They worry about grades too much whereas I know that it ultimately depends on what and who you know later on in life so stop being so damn worried all the time. 
I usually end up getting worried and anxious whenever I talk to   them.
How do I convince them that it's okay to enjoy life and  not be so damn serious about academics  all the time?
I am a male by the way.
EDIT:Fuck off butthurts. You'll are muppets. I have been a topper in high school and still doing above average in college but I am not an idiot to believe that filling out paper work and freaking about it all the time is the way to live your life. People like me for being someone who doesn't follow the crowd. You'll are assuming that they're working hard on something relevant while in reality they're just freaking about damn paper work all the time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is really scary. I blew my second semester off but somehow I have passed everything and I am officially in my second year now. 3rd semester has been relatively easier and I feel in a better state of mind than the previous two semesters. Coming from a lot of violence as a child, it was like I was in a dream-like state during my first year. It all felt so surreal. I felt as if I have come to a new planet because it all seemed so new. It was like I had entered a different world. 
As time passed, I felt more at ease and now I feel a lot better and I feel like I have been kicked back into reality. 
I just feel I wasn't ready for college and should have taken a year off but then again I had been so restricted as a child to go out that I had a fear of everything. I even felt uncomfortable if I had to take a bus or metro. I resented public transport so maybe I would have locked myself indoors doing nothing and probably would have been just wasting my time.
Guess, I made the right decision to keep going through even though this stuff scared the hell out of me and I had to face  some tough and  humiliating moments. But, still, here I am, passed and promoted to second year with a better state of mind right now. 
What I mean to say by that story is that you'll get scared, you'll get anxious and you'd want to take the easy route but if you do stick it out till the end, you might do something you never imagined you'd do. You might surprise yourself and some unexpected things might happen.
If you have  severe anxiety then you'll need professional help. Words won't get that out of your system but if you can control yourself while having anxiety then I'd suggest you to bite the bullet and go through this phase. You'll thank yourself for sticking it out in the future because once you get that damn degree, it'll be so worth it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a good thing to point out. My teacher once told us,especially about me, that this kid right here is not supremely intelligent but he's wise and his good nature attitude has the potential to take him far.(Although now I struggle with self esteem, I do think I have a lot of potential that I haven't realized yet). Feels nice to get a reminder that there's always hope even if you're in doubt. Cheers mate! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't really know what to suggest but remind her that she is in college mainly for her education. Everything else doesn't really matter in the grand scheme of things so education must be her top priority.
I understand that you need to have fun as well so maybe she can try and look for activities outside college? It's not necessary that your life should revolve around college only. You can see if there are things happening around which you can enjoy or find a job on campus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I went for jogging with a friend today. I was quite glad to see him after such a long time but something weird happened. The dude kept talking about himself. He kept talking about how he knows so much about exercising. He has been going to gym on and off from last one year. He is fit but doesn't really have a mind boggling physique. Yet he kept talking about eating right, doing this and that exercise etc. He  even started giving me a lecture about what career should I plan and what I should be doing with my life. Initially, I just thought nothing of it and treated it like a conversation starter but the lad kept giving his lecture about everything in the world all the time we were in park.
The biggest thing that annoyed me was that he was telling me what I am doing wrong with my life and what I should be doing instead. 
Man! It didn't annoy me so much while we were exercising but now since I have been back to home it's really making me mad. </TEXT>
