	<TEXT> Thanks a lot for replying!
- I have an Uhkapian, I was experimenting with stacking CDR, I'll try switching back.
- A lot of what I was unsure about was Leg. Gem choice: I just swapped out the gems I was using on my DH. Do PetDocs mostly use the standard Enforcer/Trapped/Powerful set?
- I didn't realize TGF would proc Trapped - Was about to experiment with Wave of Mutilation or Frozen P. Is it worth the loss of the Nado CC w/ no Flayer?
- I figured my Arcane ammy is going to be tough to beat unless I get very lucky, immunity to jailer is hard to let go for any reason.
- I'll try swapping the dog.
- I have never seen a SMK or Flayer, but I only put in about 200 para levels maining WD, guess I can ride WD lootshare for awhile and see if my luck hits. I don't see pushing too high into +30G without a dagger drop. I found a PetDoc in the top 40 solo leaderboard but he had SMK of course, he was at 34-35 I think... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - Reroll/recraft shoulder and armor + mojo for up to 45% dog dmg
- recraft bracer for fire% to match other elemental boosts

Beyond those tweaks you already have very good gear, nothing is going to give you a significant boost except for TnT. With that you should be able to easily farm T6. I have a near perfect TnT with worse rolls on everything else than you, plus I don't have Flayer, and I still farm T6 comfortably.

Gambling for TnT with a Wiz slightly improves your odds. You could also try Rift-It-Forward community to speed up gambling. </TEXT>

Aside from getting better rolls on rings or a Rheno anything I could improve? Breezing through T5 with ToTD but I slow down a lot on T6 and have to use my Uhkapian.

Kind of weird though about T5, I have trouble keeping FS up, I think because my dog is killing too fast to get many procs? I wonder if I'd be better off with Zuni when under T6... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for the detailed response! What I'm taking away is that elemental is secondary to your basic damage stats (more so than I realized anyway) and that +damage/CC/CHD/AS should be the first priority, elemental will provide a secondary bonus to whatever skill set is chosen, with likelihood that fire is slightly better in T6 due to difficulty of keeping 15 FS up constantly. Sound right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Switched from DoT to Pets - no idea what I'm doing with them... I have fire items so doing fire dogs - beyond that any tips to getting the most out of pets while farming/gambling for gear?

Any obvious mistakes I'm making with build? Suggestions etc?
Can solo ok on T3 but kinda slow - fiddling around w/ swapping Uhkapian for Thing of Deep, Mass Con-paranoia for S. barrage... idk

is this as good as it gets until I fill in gear? </TEXT>
