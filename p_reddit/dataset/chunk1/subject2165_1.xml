	<TEXT> Whenever I want to try something new, I check out Jamie Oliver's site for starting points. Might sound strange, but he does have a lot of basic stuff that you can build on. Other than that, with google at my disposal, you can just think of something you want to try making, and probably find at least one person who has tried it before. I responded to the OP with some of my favourites, too, if you're interested. Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello fellow Canadian. 
Let me start by saying I have links to almost none of my soup recipes from the past (thank YOU burnt out hulk of a laptop). But I intend to address your query with gusto.

Recently I tried Jamie Oliver's [tomato soup recipe](http://www.jamieshomecookingskills.com/recipe.php?title=tomato-soup-1) and it was delicious. I did wind up straining out the seeds, since I like mine smooth.

A favourite of ours around here is beef goulash. I use a slightly modified version of Tyler Florence's [recipe](http://www.foodnetwork.com/recipes/tyler-florence/beef-goulash-recipe.html) with great success. I must recommend accompanying each bowl with a dollop of [kajmak](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaymak) to increase the delicious tenfold.

Last spring I used a frozen hambone (from an easter ham) to make split pea soup. Neither the girlfriend or I were huge fans of the tinned variety, but homemade, as you may imagine, is world's away. This recipe is lost, but was found originally through googling 'how to make soup with ham bone' or some such thing.

We frequently make chicken soup/stock throughout the winter. We use a whole damn chicken (or just a couple saved up carcasses), plus fresh veg and cutoffs from other cooking endeavors that have been preserved in the freezer. Making chicken soup/stock, I find, is as personal a thing as you can do in the kitchen, with everyone having their own method. I started with [Mr. Oliver on this one as well](http://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/chicken-recipes/easy-chicken-stock), and tweaked it for my own tastes over time.

I have made gumbo both in the slow cooker and on the stovetop. The slow cooker recipe I have lost, but [this recipe](http://www.myrecipes.com/recipe/chicken-and-sausage-gumbo-10000000701065/) went over fairly well. You can add a shellfish element at the end, if you so desire....looking at the recipe again now, there is no okra, which I find confusing. Perhaps it is a silly recipe...

In any case, mon frere, good luck with you winter endeavors, and I will see you on the other side of the deep freeze!

ninjaedit addendum: Get yourself a proper stock pot! Don't be caught saying 'This pot I use for every damn thing is big enough!' only to have it overflow with deliciousness all over your stovetop. Your pot should big enough to comfortably wash a small child/sedate cat in! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am sure a lot of people have this conversation/argument around the dinner table, or more likely on a bar stool fairly often. I have to say I am all for it. It gives you a really fresh perspective on a song. Purists will argue that it is ruining the feel or the vibe, and that's fine, but it's all subject to your tastes. 

One problem, if you want to call it that, is when the cover becomes more popular or well-known than the original. Mannfred Mann's 'Blinded by the Light' cover of Springsteen's original is probably the biggest, best example I can think of at the moment (any other good examples?) 

In my case, as a kid I became familiar with some covers before I knew of the originals. 'Heroes' was by the Wallflowers, not Bowie. And being Canadian 'It's the End of the World...' was obviously by Great Big Sea, when did REM cover them?! As an adult I have come to love the original in the first case, but cannot bring myself to enjoy the slower, less fun original in the latter. There other examples, including a well-repressed memory of referring to Zep's Kashmir riff as 'that Puff Daddy song' that my friends never miss an opportunity to mention...

Some other great covers, imho: Johnny Cash's acoustic 'Personal Jesus', Jonathan Coulton's laid back 'Baby Got Back', Bowie doing 'Across the Universe'  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lucky man. 

Had a similar problem in NYC, and it ruined the trip. Almost all the bites were on my legs, and I didn't notice them first thing in the morning. It was winter, crammed my feet into heavy socks and boots for a day of walking around. Thought it was just my new-ish boots irritating my feet. Man, when we got back to the hotem and I took my socks off...big blisters, feet swollen...worst feeling ever. The hotel initially just offered to turn down the room. After a small (notsmall) outburst from me, which included a bare foot going on the reception desk, we wound up with a new room, laundry service (twice) and paid nothing for the three days stay. Absolute horrorshow.

TL;DR Glad to see someone managing to make lemonade out of their lemons! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am no stranger to the dual nature of Coffee Time. Growing up, it was always where the less savoury people in our neighbourhood hung out. Granted, as a youth you don't see the other people in the shop, just the "characters". The stigma was there, even in Oshawa. I guess the cheaper, less pushy style allows people to just hang out there. When I got older, I found out that their coffee was actually pretty good, and their baked goods were head and above the Tim's in the same area (might be site specific, though).

So yeah, I know Coffee Times are perceived, sometimes accurately, as shitholes. But look at what it means to an entire segment of the population in that area. It is what so many cafes would like, I am sure, to be. A rallying point, or at least a meeting point for the community. I don't think anyone will force the store out. Sadly, it will probably just end up being a case of the owner of the property seeing their ability to charge more for the space, and then it is just a matter of time until the lease expires. 

I think it is sad that these people won't have anywhere to go afterwards. And I mean voluntarily. Set up whatever social programs you want, but you won't get all these people under the same roof again.

	<TEXT> Contrary to some of the other posts here, I have a cautionary tale. 2012 we had our camp ransacked. They went through coolers, tents, everything. Grabbed everything they could out of the tents, and found the rental car keys in my friends' tent. Ransacked the car, then tossed the keys (we assume) as they were making their getaway. We spent hours that night and the next morning (Monday) looking for them unsuccessfully. 

For the record, if this happens to you, you have to pay to have the car towed off the property, then pay a different tow company to take you into town, not to mention the cost of replacement keys.

Luckily, someone had found the keys. Since they were from a rental, they thought to send them back (or something) but happily left they're number with lost and found. We called them and they drove 30 minutes back too Roo to return them. Such a fucking relief, but a very scary, potentially very expensive eight hours.

My recommendation to our group this year is, if many people need access to one key, put it under the corner of a tent, near a peg. Don't think the mental giants ripping people off at Bonnaroo will think of that one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a PSA, from someone who's campsite got ripped off twice over five years. You should always have your valuables on you. I know, I've heard people, my friends included, say they just want to wander around with *drug of choice* and nothing else, meeting cool people. That's cool. It's fun! I do it every year. But I bring my keys/wallet/phone/camera/passport everywhere I go. Same principle I use in hostels. Yeah, you guys seem awesome, all of you, but I have no idea who you are outside of this situation. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My girlfriend and I will be in Belgium for four days in June, ahead of our trip to England and Scotland. Neither of us have ever been, and I really don't want to have to go with a travel guide/book/site to know where to sleep, eat and drink. I want to hear it from the people! 

Our rough plan is to roll into Brussels Monday night, then rent a car and drive to Bruges some time on Wednesday, then head back to Brussels to catch a late train on Thursday. 

No hotels have been booked yet, know any really good ones? We aren't rich by any standard, but will spring for a nice place with a glowing review :) Also, food! What's the can't miss local places to eat? Traditional? New? Trendy? Historic? I want to consume them all! And beer! Beeeeeer. I love it, she loves it even more (lucky me). Give me your breweries, your halls, and your brands!

Thanks so much for responding, and helping us getting the inside track on your beautiful country!

EDIT: Yeah, I was just looking for recommendations. Nothing fancy, just "If you are here, you must see/try *blank*." Just excited, hence the format of the post... </TEXT>

She has stopped eating, and drinks sparingly. Despite all this, she doesn't complain, or outwardly appear to be in any pain. My sister is angry that my father and I aren't on board for euthanizing her, claiming for us it is about the money. It isn't, but I don't know if I am doing the right thing. If you've been through this before (I have not), I would value some input. </TEXT>
