	<TEXT> What does it mean to favor men in the example of a job that needs strength. That a woman needs to perform to a higher standard than a man? Hiring more men than women in a manual job that requires a lot of strength isn't discrimination, because it is likely that more men are capable for the job, more men want the job and more men apply for the job. However, why would you discriminate in favour of men? Why shouldn't a woman be able to compete for a job by the same set of standards that a man is held? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should not discriminate based on gender or colour.
 "if it's a strength based job favor the man for the job", no, favour the person who is better for the job, regardless of gender. There are plenty of women who are stronger and fitter than men. This is exactly why you should NOT discriminate. You could employ an inferior male worker instead of a superior female one.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you, but on the other hand, if the building was designed with a higher resale value in mind, it probably would have got fewer upvotes on reddit. The point was clearly to attract attention and turn heads, not guarantee a safe resell. I understand there are risks with that, but as someone looking at a picture on the Internet, I don't care about those.

I hope I don't sound aggressive, I respect your opinion, and as I said, I don't know the first thing about architecture other than what is pleasing to my eye. It's just that when I saw the picture it was exciting to see a building so different and made me want to see it in real life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that some of your points are valid, but "no subjectivity about it" seems silly to me when you're discussing whether anything is good or bad.

Presumably resale value wasn't a priority when you design a building like this. That's like saying a film isn't good because it won't sell to a big audience. What would happen if everyone made their house in the shape of their favourite thing is irrelevant because they don't. 

Again I'm not saying that your points are not valid, but I am saying it's subjective. I don't think something can fairly be judged by rules that it is breaking intentionally. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our basic instincts are set up by an evolutionary drive to survive and reproduce, however in many ways we have taken control of those instincts and we make life our own. For example, the goal of sex is reproduction, that is why it exists. However we have now invented contraception. We use sex to express love, to relieve stress, to have fun. It has nothing to do with its goal of reproduction if we are using contraception, although the goal of reproduction is what shaped our desires at a base level.

With art, maybe at a base level it might have been to demonstrate to potential mates intelligence or creativity, but now many people create art for the sheer love of it.

I am undecided as to whether I want children in the future, but as of right now, I don't want children. It doesn't mean my life has any less meaning. I have been shaped by my genes to survive and reproduce, but I have a mind advanced enough to take control of my life and make my own decisions.

	<TITLE> Are there opportunities to freelance (photography/videography) while teaching English in HCMC? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-27 11:48:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My girlfriend is looking into teaching English in Vietnam for a year or so. She wants me to go with her, and I very much want to. We've been to Vietnam twice and we absolutely love it. The thought of getting our TEFL qualifications and teaching out there for an extended period of time sounds so much fun (and also challenging).

Here in the UK I am trying to establish myself as a freelance videographer, doing weddings, corporate/business videos and music videos.

I am worried that moving to Vietnam would completely halt my progress of this. 

What I was wondering was, are there opportunities to find work as a freelance videographer/photographer in somewhere like Ho Chi Minh City. I would price myself competitively and just use the money to supplement my teaching wage. 

In an ideal world I would spend half of my time teaching English, and half shooting videos or photos for companies (and/or weddings). Is a pipe dream with no root in reality, or is this something that is possible? I have heard that there are many start ups in HCMC, which is why I thought it might not be entirely outside the realms of possibility. I would not be looking for big money from the video work, just to continue working and developing in the field.

Any advice or information relating to my situation would be very greatly appreciated. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think if you are locked in a room against your will, you are not free regardless of whether you want to be there. If a prisoner wants to be be in prison, he isn't free because he doesn't have the CHOICE to leave. I would say that freedom is nothing to do with happiness, it is to do with the choice to do (or attempt to do without restriction from others) the things that you want. </TEXT>
