	<TEXT> Haha true. It still amazes me that - besides technical issues - people prefer D3 over PoE. Honestly two different games to me and I'm a long time D3 player.  </TEXT>

And these are important/helped me a lot:

[Affixes/prefixes](http://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Item_affix#Prefixes)

[Lootfilter](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/1246208)

[PoeTrade](http://poe.trade/)

[PoeTrade ingame Macro/price check](https://poe-trademacro.github.io/)

[Xyzz/Acquisition](https://github.com/xyzz/acquisition/releases)

And the fact that you have two options from the beginning : 

1) Get used to the fact that you are going to start over multiple times because you f*cked up your build OR 2) you NEED to follow a build to the letter to make sure the first statement doesn't happen.

PoE isn't D3. I played D3 a lot and they are two totally different games, to me at least

	<TEXT> Just my two cents but maybe it's waste of time to wait for someone. There are lots of people at lvl 10-20 20-30 and so on to level with when you get there.

It's your own choice of course :-) </TEXT>

Regarding selling stuff later on; is checking poe.trade enough the know what something can be sold for? 

I'll check out the max stats, just to know what they are. I saw some rare rings on Reddit that someone found/created and apparantly they were great and worth alot but I could't instantly see what made them so great compared to other. For that I do need to know that max stats I guess </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So, I just started playing PoE and I'm noticing I'm having a hard time rocognizing when stats on a piece of gear are considered 'good' (or even better for that matter). 

Are there like some standard things to look out for like if a ring had more than 40% res or more than 1-18 added physical damage and so on. 

Thanks all :-) </TEXT>
