	<TEXT> Basically my thinking; It was fun first tme but yeah that doesnt rely on big strategy: Just TP somewhere, tell your team to kill Xerath when you can but other than thet run and kill. Just has like  Baron in the mid that gives only One person the buff. Even Hexakill was more fun although i disliked the game mode. In Ascension I jsut derp around as trollcrank and have fun. But again always I get flamed for having some fun. Some folkes take it as a Challenger promo. But ignore option is my hero 3. I like the map theme thouhg, the sandstorm added to it, thats cool but otherways not that fun again :D 
TL;DR: not so interesting, you can have some fun, i recommend to ignore ur teammates. But for me, URF is love URF is life. Ascension doesnt match anything like URF </TEXT>

Still they can somehow feed their opponent, even when i help them even more. Then when im having a not so good game, maybe like 3/8 or smth my team goes crazy and carry me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Imo he can max crit like 1000 with that AD. I dont know that much, I know im really wrong but: Crits deal 200% dmg normally which means 864 is the max crit. So 250% crit damage means 864 which is the 200% of your AD and then the 50% from the AD which is 216 and i can get here that the max crit is 1080. Can understand myself too how can you crit with 1836 dmg. It's clearly a 8 there too </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well basically I have quit ranked games for a week now and I have made a decision: I wont play ranked until Season 5, I will play and get 600+ normal game wins then MAYBE go back to ranked games and see whats going on next. And I usually mute my whole team to stay focused and I dont flame. Im the one who says like np buddy, we have a chance folkes, unlucky buddy (on a death) :) Not like: You motherfucking faggot go play tetris you little piece of shit
**EDIT:** By having fun in normals I mean: SpeedUp Team, Jumping team, AD fizz, ADC Orianna, AP Nasus, 5 junglers, 5 mid and stuff like that^^ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tryndamere or Akali or Katarina. If Trynda has a 0/10 score he can still 1v3 easily becuase fucking 1000000% crit chance with 700 dmg crits every fucking time. A 5 sec ult what you can cast during being CC'd. Seriously fuck that shithead. Bulshit in one piece. Akali: If she has been up on farming and stuff until lvl 6 she can 1v1 everyone. Easily. Even 1v2. So fucking easy. Katarina: bullshit million dmg ultimate, NO FUCKING RESOURCE just fucking spam Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q Q in lane.

	<TEXT> Im stuck in Silver V and im 99% that without eloboost i wont get anywhere. I quit ranked games because playing or not I will drop down still. I'm just done with ranked. I better have fun in normals than tryhard in ranked for Defeats. Had 2 promos to Silver IV, 2 losses straight in both of them and had AFK every single game. 4 games with AFK. After I played more and 10 games a day with an AFK in in. 10 STRAIGHT 4v5 not fun. So advice to people who want to climb but are stuck in division: Quit Ranked, Have fun in Normals and if  you want to have a better division name hire an elobooster </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So the day before yesterday I got 2 times to Silver IV promos. And I failed both of them, and in both of them i had 2 losses immediately and guess what?! I had an AFK every promo game, 4 games with an AFK. Basically in 50% of ranked games I have an AFK. It's ridicilious. I try my hardest to get to Gold and climb in the ladder but Riot doesn't allow me too. Every game where you have an AFK and enemy team ain't retards it's instalose. 
TL;DR It's impossible to climb when you have AFK in 50% of  you ranked games. And I main support, so I can't solo carry. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-04-22 22:48:49 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! Just wanted to make some things clear. First, when I read the topic of how you pick free champs and there was a point and it said: We take easier champiobs that beginners can handle and put them free for a week. So.. your ingame Champ stats show the difficulty aswell and Orianna, who is constantlty free, her difficulty is rated at 100% by you and same for Zed who indeed is a very hard champion and the same for some more constant free champions also.

I started playing on S3 and to this very moment most of the champs that are.constantly free atleast repeat over 6 weeks, but Janna is almost every week for example but.. now to a new point: some champions haven't been free for 7+ months although I believe that with 15 weeks you should be able to make all the champions atleast 1 time free (15 weeks is about 3 and a half months. 
Sidenote: Yorick last free S2 aka 2 years ago

Thank you all who read my story </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello! First post here for me but that's not the point. Since im not the oldest League of Legends player - played for only a year, I enjoy watching LCS but now it's turning boring and boring every day. You think why? Well here begins the story:
I'm a fan of those champions that are not played that much and are unique and cool, like Poppy and Twitch and Miss Fortune etc. But LCS is getting boring because of those mainstream champions that you see almost every game: Thresh, Elise, Lucian, Gragas etc.
    Today I thought I'd watch some pro player picks and I saw some NA players there that still play and I noticed TheOddOne who is a great jungler in my opinion and then i saw there: TheOddOne picks... Maokai. Then I thought that he plays Elise most of the times in LCS, but when he likes Maokai so much why not play it on LCS? When It's a good champ for you that you can handle why not play it and show it to the world how good you are with these rare champions not with mainstream junglres like Elise or Shyvana? He also likes Jarvan IV as I searched some more information about him. Why not play it on LCS, I just can't understand. Anyway I think you got my point. And if you read it all, thank you </TEXT>
