	<TEXT> Just click the title of my post and it should open either the web app or the desktop app. If that doesn't work manually search on Spotify in the top left "be happy" and look for my playlist. Heres another link in case you can't get there:

You could try asking people over at /r/classicalmusic/ and see if anyone over there recognizes it. It seems like the sound clip is long enough for someone to recognize the tune.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem, I'm a bit of a Nas fan. I did a little more research and according to this the original track was released in 2007. Nas sampled it in 2008. Here are other artists who have used the same sample, so maybe you were thinking of one of those.

	<TEXT> Wow! Thanks everyone for all the great feedback! I created this playlist a while ago mainly for my own listening pleasure. However, after hearing positive reviews from some friends I decided to share it on here for others to enjoy. It started out as a playlist of mostly recognizable rock/alternative songs and then I slowly started implementing some hip hop in there as well. The playlist will be updated regularly to my best ability. I will also be experimenting with more playlists of different genres and themes. Enjoy! </TEXT>
