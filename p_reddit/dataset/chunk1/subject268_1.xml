	<TITLE> Has anyone tried Kali Linux on a Tablet/Phone yet? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So I'm pretty keen to try my had at Kali Linux NetHunter on a tablet but I have a few reservations about this first and I wanted to know if any one out there as already tried and bumped their heads with any issues yet? 

If you didn't know about Kali on a mobile device then check out this link,...

So first of all, it cant be any android device and has to be a Nexus device (it's clean and stock) but is there a workaround for this? 

Secondly the Nexus 6 packs a nice punch and should be able to handle the processor load placed on the it, but would an older Nexus (i.e. Nexus 4) manage? I'm not about to fork out for a new Tab just to try out Kali on it. 

If anyone has any experience with this I'd appreciate it :) (y)
