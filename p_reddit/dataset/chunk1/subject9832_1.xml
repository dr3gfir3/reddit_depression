	<TEXT> I tend to do this a lot when I walk to work because I feel that dying in the sun is a horrible way to go out...and this little guy has nobody to help him, so often I take time to pick up as many as I can and toss them back into the grass..wondering if any other human beings also did this as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Im really upset with wwe 12...its nothing different then smackdown vs raw 11...I love that they added in a create an arena and brought back old superstars but the game at its core is still nothing different. Create a super star is the same. Create a move set is the same. I can't really tell about the new physics engine because for some reason when i think im about to belly to belly someone over the top rope for some reason there's a invisible wall that keeps them in the ring. The gender restrictions is the most absolutely upsetting thing as well. I don't understand why I can't take out a ladder in a hell in a cell match or extreme rules the weapon are so limited(eventually you can't weapons out of the ring ) they use the same animations for wrestling moves since shut your mouth and the animation of doing a move though the cell is the same as 
its been. Wwe 12 is more of an expansion pack then anything. I can't believe th charging people $60 for the game.( the wwe universe is improved but im mostly upset with gameplay) </TEXT>

Try playing as the assault class and just focus on reviving people...it's just as awarding as killing someone( 100 points) and can be way more intense.

	<TITLE> What do you kids want in future Battlefield games? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-10-30 05:43:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know this is a little early but I thought about this a lot. There's talks about Playstation 4 and Xbox 720 and it made me thinking what will a fps look like on those consoles, and how far is this technology going to take FPS games, here's just a short list of things I would like to see in future battlefield games:

-maybe more blood and gore. For me that as real as it can get. Battlefield 3 did great with the blood splatter but I don't feel its enough,so maybe it be possible in the future to see me shoot someone with a tank and they actually explode into several pieces, not just one.

-more player battles for consoles, I can't afford a nice pc to play battlefield 3 on and I'm uber jealous thats battles are taking place right now that have 64 people shooting the fuck out of each other. I would like to see that on future games (if its possible) maybe even bigger battles 100 vs 100 (that would be pretty epic if everyone agreed to knifes only)

-Destruction was amazing in battlefield 3 and I can't wait to think what there going to do with frostbite 3 or even 4.I would like to see more destruction on a bigger scale, multiple story buildings just being blown to shit


I have a ton more but is there things you kids would like to add? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> for me what makes driving in a game is the cockpit view, I think it adds some extra realism and the attention of detail the developers had put into the game. I think it would rather be a nice touch

on the traffic I don't think there was ever enough cars around (unless you were downtown in GTA4) but I like to see that large scale of cars on the roadway, would be interesting to SEE REAL TRAFFIC (so that way if can annoy me in real life and in a video game lol)

I would FUCKING LOVE if they brought back helicopters and planes,maybe even be able to walk around the airplane because you can set it to auto pilot, like have a A380 and one of the aircrafts you can fly ...customization to cars and trucks.. I like gore too

(like a baby..maybe) because sooner then later seems to make sense since talks of xbox 720 and playstation 4 coming out in a year or two and I don't see why they would release a couple months before a new console comes out (even if the consoles are backwards compatible, I would think that more people would be focused on playing new games for the new consoles) my bet is June 2012 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ive been on keto since July and I love the results. Im 6'4 and at the time I was 265, as of right now I'm at 245 and Im going to disneyland this weekend and I thought I might as well take the week off from keto because the call of carbs are to great, and I thought it be a great time to recover because how often I work out and even if keto is so amazing I need a break from it. I was just wondering if other people taken breaks, how it was while you were off and how easy/hard was it for you to jump back on the keto train? </TEXT>
