	<TEXT> Real world concept; the idea of I can take risks and push forward, or play it safe and let my failures define me.

In world:

Naga - the ultimate embodiment of stagnation; they'd rather rage at the Primeval Dragons for the Primevals' past transgressions (Very violent, but why get stuck in the past?) than push forward. Their rage, or stagnation, is manifest in their tradition of surgically crippling their hatchlings' vestigial wings, leaving those in place as a kind of taunt toward the Primevals. Hatchlings that fight against this get thrown off the mountain. Stagnation at its worst.

Dragonborn - the ultimate embodiment of generativity; they'd rather develop advanced camouflage systems that would let them experience the world and pursue their passions with an ends-justify-the-means fuck the methodology approach. This means that others, willingly or unwillingly, often get used by the Dragonborn in their pursuit of their passions. The ultimate extreme in generativity.

Humans - Cultural differences aside, tend to be united in the fact that they can strike a balance between the two extremes, or shift toward one or the other. Unlike the Naga and Dragonborn they use logic to justify or excuse their decisions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever noticed a fellow traveler or citizen that looks...off? Maybe their brow's a bit thick, maybe those rings around their eyes are unusually dark even for someone that's sleep deprived. Perhaps their psoriasis looks weird.

You've seen them?

Did you notice what they were wearing - black leathers?

Those aren't humans.

Those are dragonborn. The leathers aren't clothes - those are folds of skin adapted to help them retain the sun's heat. The humanlike appearance? Come on now, you've seen anoles change from green to brown haven't you? Yeah, its something like that.

Why are they hiding?

Well, if your natural predators preferred to hide in the jungle-mountains but could control thralls via psionic parasites, you'd want the camouflage too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Untitled

Once the Navajko beastfolk, pushed into a corner by the Sajin monks, retreated to a ziggurat wherein they found a legendary jitte. With the jitte and a bit of magic they created a ninety-nine headed hydra. The hydra became the Navajko weapon against the Sajin monks.

The hydra rampaged and the Sajin killed it. Unbeknownst to the Sajin the hydra was a dirty bomb - it released a combination of chemicals that exploded the Sajin monks' lungs, turning their corpses into cultures for fungi and bacteria that, together, created an atmosphere hostile to human lungs but perfect for the Navajko lungs.

And so from this came the Green Inferno, a realm now broken, which is said to pass through the realm of the living every full moon. </TEXT>

Rough List

**Pokemon**

3 Charizard Ex

1 M Charizard Ex (Generations) - I don't intend on going further than locals, so I threw this in for Jolteon Exs.

4 Entei (Ancient Origins)

1 Druddigon (Flashfire)

2 Shaymin Ex (Roaring Skies)

**Supporters:**

4 Blacksmith

2 Lysandre

1 Giovanni's Scheme

3 Professor Juniper

**Stadium:**

3 Scorched Earth

**Items:**

4 Ultra Ball

4 VS Seeker

4 Trainer's Mail

2 Fighting Fury Belt

3 Muscle Band

3 Battle Compressor

1 Float Stone

1 Scramble Switch

1 Professor's Letter

**Energy:**

4 DCE

9 Fire Energy

*

I was thinking Druddigon might be good tech vs EXs.

My Trainers are focused around supporting CHEX as the main attacker, though there's plenty of versatility here that Entei can easily come in and start wrecking it.

The Supporters are where I think I need the most help. Maximizing the tools available and all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I heard this from a girl's friend last weekend. We were out on the town with a group to celebrate something or another. The girl was our designated driver. Her friend was shitfaced drunk and blurted this out while I was with the friend and her S.O. (if you're curious, the shitfaced friend wanted to hit some local burger joint later that night)

My question for the women of reddit - is would you show this kind of...deference, respect or what have you, to someone that you simply considered a friend? The fact that it came from the girl's friend - while said friend was drunk - kind of got me wondering about that.

I wanted to ask because, anytime you hear something from guys with girl friends (as opposed to girlfriends) there's a touch of the friendzone salt there...I wasn't sure if a girl that simply considered you a friend would show that sort of deference or agreeability.

TL;DR:

One of her drunk girlfriends said that she likes me and would do anything I asked - what's that mean? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A few months ago I found out by way of this girl's friend that the girl likes me ("ask her if we can go to Chipotle, she'll do whatever you say!"). I'm not sure just what that entails, but she'd always be down to let me borrow odds/ends and was usually happy to drive me to the bar for parties and stuff. In return I did a bit of housesitting for her, but that's it.


Career stuff kept me occupied for a couple of months. Here recently she showed up at my place to get me to help her with her truck (saying she didn't know anyone else in our apartments). We shot the breeze afterward - it was a bit awkward; I eventually ended the convo with "well, I've gotta go get some work done," to which she replies: "Well, hey, it seems like I'm always coming over here to get your help. If you need anything just come on up. My door's always open."

I'm not sure if there's anything in here to say she's interested in anyway other than purely platonic. Your thoughts, vet sedditors? </TEXT>

Previously we'd been out in a larger group, and one of her girlfriends that got completely shitfaced wanted to go somewhere, came up to me and was all "You go ask [30/f] if we can go to _____. She likes you, she'll do whatever you ask!" So I did, and over the course of the night [30/f] kinda hung all over me/got a little touch (nothing inappropriate).

I'm kind of slow where these things are concerned. So I figured I'd pop in to ask you all. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-09-26 00:47:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm aware of the Entei / Charizard Ex deck. It seems like the engine of Blacksmith + Battle Compressor would be a good foundation around which to build. Going by the Primer at the top of the page, I'll be using Tiernos in lieu of Shaymin Ex, recognizing that I'm not getting the best draw power that I could.

However

It also seems like building an Expanded Format deck with the Mega Charizard Ex box Promo Charizard might be better. You're doing 150 a turn at the cost of discarding a single energy. Thoughts on the staples I should include in an Expanded deck focusing around a Charizard requiring 5 energy for 150 damage?

I realize that Charizard Ex is a better deck, but I wanted to build something more traditional. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Most of the girls I've had success with in the past were pretty forward. One I'm in a class with, I'm not sure how to read.

To my surprise, she goes for the seat next to me rather than the empty one on the end of the row...

There's been a couple of times when she'll ask me about something from the lecture, or if I've done ____ yet. Strange, because there's plenty of people seated to either side that she could ask instead of me.

Being that I'm not used to girls that act nervous, I'm not exactly sure how to read them. Is this the norm for nervous girls that you might have a shot with? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Your Prehistoric Races? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-24 03:44:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Let's post our prehistoric races. Maybe yours are entirely extinct, maybe they're in hiding...either way, post em here.

Mine existed amidst the great struggle between the Primordials and Primevals in a realm whose name translates to "Chance." They were mostly neglected by these two great forces of chaos - left to their own devices, mostly, except for the Forerunners - for it was the Forerunners from which the first Primevals came...

Chance is a land without rules where might makes right. Much of the sky is covered by ashes spewed from the multitude of volcanoes while steaming jungles dominate a savage land populated by four foundling races and a variety of deadly wildlife, including elementals of fire, stone, tar, moss and fungi, the fiery magliz, the reptilian insectoid scydon, crocodiles, the hybrid reptilian/mammalian kangi, and the sabretoothed stormbreakers. 


**The Progenitors**  A race of great apes from which mankind is descended. They are tall, with broad frames and a lean, muscular build. Life in the darklands of Chance has given them a vicious temperament and a pale complexion beneath their coverings of matted brown fur. While the shaman of the race study the entropic magic of the realm, the warriors of the race use the violent nature of the realm to their advantage through necromancy; the warriors also strengthen themselves against the planes microscopic predators by indulging in the blood of those they best in battle  they believe that this practice will bolster their immune system against the diseases one may encounter in the dark, swampy regions of the realm.

The Progenitors were born from the burnwillow groves early in the planes history; they consider themselves the planes response to the Forerunners and their dragon descendants that dominated the plane.


**The Forerunners**  A race of reptilian creatures that emerged from the tar-filled bayous of Chance. They are stocky with long, thick necks ending into tusked snouts filled with lamprey-like teeth; their pale flesh is protected by a natural bonelike armor that develops when they reach maturity. The Forerunners are an atavistic race united in their three-pronged attack style: strip their prey of defenses magical and mundane, engage in magical battle where necessary, and then go for the kill after the opponent has been left vulnerable.

Forerunners are the first sentient, sapient species to emerge on Chance; they crawled out of the rivers of burning tar found in the more mountainous regions. The first dragons emerged from the Forerunners that went into the mountains and cast themselves into the Entropy Storms encircling the ranges at the heart of Chance. Where the Entropy Storms decayed the Forerunners, the extreme heat in the fiery calderas triggered explosive events from which the scattered subatomic particles of the Forerunners were reconfigured into the form of massive winged and scaled reptilians  the hellkites.

**The Engineers**  A race of squat, broad-shouldered green-scaled humanoids related to the Progenitors; whereas the Progenitors are more militant in nature, the Engineers have embraced a life of asceticism in the less volatile bayous of Chance. As the Progenitors become more militarized, the Engineers have sent their oozes to scavenge the battlefields for Progenitors  warriors and shaman alike  lingering at deaths doorstep; from these broken Progenitors the Engineers create legions of half-Progenitor half-fungi Entromancers that harness the natural forces of decay rather than the magical forces of decay used by the Progenitor shaman.

The Engineers were born from the mossy boulders of the ravines that they call home. They thus have an inborn talent for elementalism, often waking elementals from the magically-charged boulders of the ravine in defense of their homes.

**The Splitters** - A race of orange-scaled lizards that live exclusively in the Entropy Storms. They attract the broken, scattered particles of sacrifices made to the volcanoes in the Entropy Storm and recombine the particles in the hornlike fireglands that sweep back from their elongated skulls. From there the fragments experience a final breakdown before being spat out as fire in duels between rival Splitters; this releases the decayed remains of the sacrifices to the fires smoldering beneath the Entropy Storms. From these come reconfigured lifeforms based on the initial sacrifice.

Splitters resemble dragons, but lack the ability to control the thunder and lightning of Chances thunderheads. Whereas dragons are more biological in nature, the Splitters are more elemental in nature, beings of pure fire wrapped in a scaly hide. While dragons tend toward intelligent yet feral, the Splitters are more relaxed, often becoming agitated only in the most extreme of circumstances. Their relaxed nature prevents the Splitters from drawing the attention of the dragons  because the dragons are one of the few creatures to prey on mature Splitters. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I started reading these things in undergrad. They were quick, mostly enjoyable breaks from the rigors of chemistry. I've come across a few really good ones and a load of really bad ones. Let's focus on the positives and list our favorites, be they series or individual books.

The Brotherhood of the Griffin books one through three by Richard Lee Byers

I loved the concept of a mercenary battlemage, so Aoth Fezim quickly became one of my favorite DnD characters. These first three explored a region in the Forgotten Realms called Chessenta and dealt heavily with the Cult of the Dragon. In particular, I especially liked the scene where Chessenta's ruler, a Red Dragon, demanded that a priest of Lathander keep the sun from setting. It was hilariously absurd, yet also slightly terrifying because the Red Dragon had been doing a bad job of keeping his Shade-induced PTSD in check.

	<TITLE> Dragonborn as a Species </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-20 15:21:07 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My goal in designing the Dragonborn is to present my players with a species that is a touch alien, yet still somewhat understandable. 

**The Dragonborn**

The Dragonborn believe that they came about to serve the cause of Entropy. Their earliest records reveal a chaotic world in which Primordials forever warred with one another over petty differences, likely their peers criticism of their geographic creations, while Primevals seemingly mirrored them, albeit in the cosmic expanses above the fledgling world. Amid the chaos is a distinct lack of decay necessary to maintain the worlds stability  without the threat of Entropy, the dragonborn are left without their most essential source of sustenance: emotions.

**Physiology**

Dragonborn history teaches that they sprang from the scales of Primevals, shed, that took over elementals of fire, nature, and rot.  These scales redirected their hosts magical machinery to the development of the fledgling dragonborn. At maturation the dragonborn emerge from their hosts, consuming the remains of the elementals. From these the dragonborn derive the nutrients needed to activate nodes throughout their bodies that contribute to their affinity for magic.

Dragonborn are best described as empathetic vampires that gain sustenance from the emotions of other sentient beings in their vicinity. 

Dragonborn are comprised of three races based on their fire glands and nutritional needs: Rot, Blood, Vital.

*Purger Dragonborn* possess a breath weapon that exerts a subtle influence, cutting through the psychic shields of their prey to exploit the preys fears and deep, unspoken desires. These Dragonborn believe that their ability to bring these less wholesome qualities to the surface in their prey is ultimately holistic, purging their beings of things that would eventually poison them if left to fester.

*Ignite Dragonborn* possess a breath weapon that ignites the harmless, if slightly hedonistic, passions of their prey: be it artistry magical, martial, painting or sculpting.

*Awakener Dragonborn* possess a breath weapon that triggers genotypic and phenotypic changes in their prey; from the abundance of new life that these changes bring about in the prey the Vital Dragonborn derive their sustenance. 

Dragonborn reproduction is violent by human standards. During the height of the Blood Moon the Dragonborn migrate to a particular island inhabited almost exclusively by primordial elementals. Here they select a primordial elemental and engage it in mixed magical martial arts combat. There are two outcomes to the combat ritual:

The Dragonborn may lose, in which case the primordial elemental leaves a fragment of itself in the dragonborns corpse. From this fragment hatches a new primordial elemental that gains sustenance from the Dragonborn corpses vitals.

The Dragonborn may win, in which case they shed scales into the primordial elementals wounds. While all of the scales reach the fetal stage, only the most dominant will emerge from the host as a fully developed Dragonborn. As such, the Dragonborn have no concept of family.

**Personality**

The Dragonborn are the consummate hedonists that travel the world in pursuit of their pleasures. On their own the Dragonborn are impersonal and dont tend to form relationships beyond that of predator to prey. As a chameleon may change colors to blend in with its background the Dragonborn may feign sympathy and empathy in order to remain close to their prey or to gain access to whatever has become the object of their desire. These desires can run the gamut from warlord to mercenary to political advisor to assassin to honorable champion to shaman or to druid.

At the core of the Dragonborn philosophy of hedonism is a belief that the Dragonborn of the ages after the death of the Primevals by their offspring are reincarnations of those slain Primevals. In keeping with their belief that the world exists within a system of thermodynamics, they are the Primevals reincarnated for a new age.

While they possess breath weapons, the Dragonborn primarily rely on physical prowess and their ability to create tools from the world metals. It isnt uncommon to find a Dragonborn that specializes in the production of bullets, firearms, shriekblades, swords, or defensive weapons such as jittes. In the case of non-automatic weapons, the Dragonborn will imbue the metal with the essence of a slain elemental. This lends the weapon magical properties without requiring the Dragonborn to use magic directly. A few Dragonborn even imbue their bullets with elemental magic, effectively creating firearms that allow them to mimic the breath weapons of the Primevals.

	<TEXT> Hey guys and gals. My friends and I are gonna run a funsies league that simulates the pokemon league we used to play in. We're using Base Set to Team Rocket as our cardpool. Since this simulates WOTC's run of the TCG, Bill and Comp Search are not counted as Supporters.

I'm trying to put together the best Charizard-themed deck that I can with these rules. Charmeleon was a really good attacker back then, so I'm not running any Pokemon Breeders. Otherwise...here's what I have:

Pokemon - 18

4 Charmander - Base Set

3 Charmeleon - Base Set

3 Charizard - Base Set

4 Magmar - Fossil

3 Electabuzz - Base Set

1 Scyther - Jungle

Trainers - 22

4 Bill

3 Professor Oak

3 Computer Search

2 Item Finder

2 Lass

3 Plus Power

2 Gust of Wind

2 Switch

1 Energy Retrieval


Energy: 20

10 Fire Energy

6 Electric Energy

4 Double Colorless Energy

Back in my league days I was playing the boring old Haymaker deck. For this league, I decided to do something a little more fun than the same old. Charizard was my MVP as a kid, so I wanted a nostalgic build that uses him in as competitive a way as is possible. </TEXT>

I've read the first novels from Farseer, Stormlight Archives, Dragonlance Chronicles/Legends, Kingkiller Chronicles and Death Gate and didn't find myself compelled to continue with these series.

	<TEXT> This is my spin on the Dragon Stompy game - I love the deck, and seeing how we've got some Mono R Sneak decks cropping up, I think its safe to bring back Seething Song as an accelerant. That said, here's where I'm at:


4 Magus of the Moon

4 Simian Spirit Guide

4 Goblin Rabblemaster

3 Hanweir Garrison

1 Rakka Mar

2 Avaricious Dragon

4 Thunderbreak Regent

2 Thundermaw Hellkite

2 Koth of the Hammer

1 Chandra, Pyromaster

2 Sarkhan, the Dragonspeaker

2 Magma Jet

4 Chalice of the Void

4 Chrome Mox

3 Blood Moon

4 Ancient Tomb

2 City of Traitors

2 Crystal Vein

10 Mountain

SB
4 Phyrexian Revoker

2 Sulfur Elemental

3 Thought-Knot Seer

3 Trinisphere

1 Boil

2 Anarchy

	<TEXT> I'll be frank here - I hit the local lounges looking for a side chick. Hit it off pretty good with a couple, quite a few rejections but hey - ya live and learn there. One of my closes ended with the potential side chick giving me her # (double checked, its legit), telling me to hit her up if I ever wanted to grab a drink.

Would you say that was a close I could chalk up as a success? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We know the players like to name their 3-color decks after the shards. Of all the shard decks in the Modern format, which is the weakest?

I'd say Bant. It has the trick with Knight of the Reliquary and Coralhelm whatsitsname that lets you scry and give a creature flying. Otherwise, Naya and Jund do it better. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Interpreting Textgame in Context </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Context: I think there might be something worth exploring with this girl I know. A while back after I met her, I'd plan stuff with her via text. Mine were pretty barebones; her replies were a bit lengthier than my texts. A couple of times, she'd contact me out of the blue to tell me about a social event and ask if I'd be there.

At the time I was pretty focused on my career/work, so I'd say "yeah, I'll be there," and leave it at that. I'd go, have fun, she once invited me out to a local nightclub with her. Laughed at some jokes and even excused me for being kind of an ass to this one guy that, well, everyone in our circle's kinda been an ass to.

Couple of weeks later there's a major shakeup in my personal life related to my career. We were out, she comes up chats a bit, says she's glad for the changes I'm making to work around this shakeup and tells me it all happens for a reason.

Month ago I shot her text - "Hey, let's get drinks on ____" to which she replied, "We're going to New York this weekend!" When I got the reply, I figured "oh well, ya tried," and went on about my business. 

Next day I saw in snapchat where she and her crew actually did go to New York, so it didn't seem like a white lie intended as a friendly letdown.

This brings me to the present day - about a month since I invited her to grab drinks. I was thinking about shooting her a text to see if she'd wanna catch a movie. Something like, "Hey, I'm gonna catch suicide squad on ______ - care to come?"

Based on the context given, would you say this is an appropriate, simple and open form of textgame to start a bit of pickup?

	<TEXT> I'm the guy that called himself lunkheaded. Scored a date, here's the gist:

So we went bowling.

-Talked about plans for Fall; said she decided to do classes in my current city rather than back in hers

-Asked about where I'm staying; kinda got wide-eyed when I gave her the figures on rent. She said something like "Geez, you really slapped me in the face with that one!" Laughed afterwards.

-We grabbed coffee at the alley's cafe; noticed she was rubbing her neck/clavicle/collar bone area while we chatted.

Whatcha think Master PUAs - safe to do some risque flirting/innuendo?

	<TEXT> So offsite I've made my way into the ranks of the Hillary shills. In discussing Hillary with the shills and her supporters, I refer to her as Hilldog and my posts about Hillary are loaded with emphasis on her negatives, albeit disguised JUST enough to fool the shills.

Am I doing this nimble navigation thing right? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Kinda Lunkheaded, Need Advice </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So in the past I've been pretty dense. In retrospect I've known at least a couple of girls that were interested. At the time I was so focused on getting my career/lifegoals in order that I completely missed their signs.

Anyway, I've noticed that this woman I'm currently talking to:

Cracks grins and laughs at my jokes/remarks (nothing overly loud, more like chuckles I guess)
Touches me on the leg to get my attention
Always calls instead of texts; even for really simple things like setting up meetings.
Usually sits with her body kinda open to me.

So, I was wondering if these little things might mean there's something worth looking into.
