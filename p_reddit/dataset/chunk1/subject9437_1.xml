	<TEXT> Haha; I always wondered the same. Such hypocrites. I think they feel that they have an excuse to postpone their own prayers in order to "promote virtue" among the community and that they are spreading Islam by doing so. Really retarded people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, actually, I am not so sure about this. The ones who forced me in their car to drive me to the mosque were about 3 religious police members and actually 1 police officer who was accompanying them in their car. The police officer did not say anything most of the time but he was just there accompanying them in their car.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My Experience with Saudi Arabia's Contemptible Religious Police </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Dear readers,

I am writing this post to bring awareness to a group of loathsome, vile and reprehensible people known as the Committee of Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, also known as Saudi Arabia's religious police.  I feel that their crimes have not been documented greatly or that there has been little coverage over what they do. It strikes me that such a group for people, with all of the deluded pseudo-scientific twaddle that they espouse in this narrow-minded mentality of theirs, are able to influence many aspects of daily life in this Godforsaken Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.


As a person who visited Saudi Arabia for a while, I have witnessed, greatly a deal, a lot of their contemptible acts that have so far infringed upon the personal freedoms of the people who live over there. A few years ago, I was once standing outside a store when suddenly it was prayer time. In Saudi Arabia, it is an absolute requirement that all shops and stores close immediately 10 minutes before prayer time and that everyone cease any activity that they are doing and head to the nearest mosque to pray. During that time, the religious police roam the streets in order to make sure everyone is praying. So I was just standing there when it was prayer time and suddenly, I find a car driving straight towards me with the religious police logo on it and suddenly, those fat-ass sheep-herding fuckers get out of the car, with their stupid kufiyah on their heads, and immediately question me as to who I am and request ID cards as if what I just did was a crime. They later force me inside their car and keep asking whether I am a Muslim or a Christian and why is it that I am not praying and a diatribe of stupid religious bullshit that they kept spouting. They call their "boss" or something of the sort and tell him exactly: "we have caught someone who just behaved mischievously and didn't head into the mosque when it was prayer time.  What do you suggest we do with him?" I never got to know what they were told. But, then soon, I find them requesting that they record my ID information and then they drive me to the nearest mosque and force me to pray. I acquiesced because I thought it was the safe option given that those are a bunch of brainwashed insane religious nutters who would do anything to make sure people pray. Afterwards, they drove me back to where I was and lectured me on the Day of Judgement and the importance of prayer, bla, bla, bla, and a bunch of other crap. Fortunately, for me, nothing else happened afterwards although I have no idea why they recorded my ID information. According to some of my friends who lived there, people who were caught not praying more than once were detained and held in custody for a while. They actually warned me that if they catch me doing this again, they might consider sending me to jail. But, I was able to leave the country afterwards with no incident and I vowed never to return to this terrible shithole of a country again.


It absolutely surprises me that such nonsense and stupidity is actually institutionalized by the Saudi government itself. The Committee for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice is actually is a government agency that employs the religious police to enforce Sharia law. What kind of country is this? You would be amazed by the other things I witnessed over my very unfortunate stay in this backwards, uncivilized country. For example, all of the malls cater only for families. If you are on your own without any family member, you are not allowed to enter a mall at all. That is because they want to make sure gender segregation is enforced and that people of the opposite gender should not be at the same place unless accompanied by a family member. Now it doesn't matter even how old you are. A friend of mine who is 50 was not allowed inside the mall because he is on his own. How incredibly stupid and weird and infantile that is!! I have never seen somthing like this in my life. You can't even make this up. You just enter the malls and you find those wretched religious fuckers standing there with their fucking protruding beards and their fucking miswak up their ass (actually mouth but then again, what do you call a mouth that spouts bullshit?) and then they are like: " you can't be here on your own. Where is your family?". Well, you retarded fuckwits, I am here to go get some shopping done. But, they are just so narrow-minded and stupid, all they think about is the "risk of individuals of the opposite gender mixing". What the actual FUCK is this? I am enraged at their stupidity. I just lashed at them and told them I am here for grocery. They still kicked me out of the mall and threatened to arrest me if I continue to disobey. This is cringe-worthy. I just can't imagine how people with this stone-age mentality and behaviour still exist in the 21st century?! Even restaurants are segregated into a "Singles" section for males only and another section for families and married couples only. Single women are not allowed unless they are accompanied by male chaperons. And they are both completely separated with a security guard standing outside to make sure such rules are obeyed. Oh and by the way, I was told that even inside malls (which only allow families in), the line-ups are separated with a barrier to separate males and females and the barrier itself is opaque and not transparent so they can't see each other. How cringeworthy and weird that is!


Oh and the women over there are required to dress up in black garbage sacs (a black cloak actually but what better way to describe it, lol). The religious police roam the streets to make sure this requirement is met and if not, they insult the non-abiders and call them "infidel" and even arrest them if they do not obey this shitty dress code.

These people are even really weird. I was once told by another friend of mine who lived in Saudi Arabia, that he remembers as a kid, when once, his religion teacher who was also a member of the Commission of the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice, told them of a story of a time when he was fighting Satan, in a bathroom, but because he did not say "Bismillah", an Islamic phrase thought to protect against evil, Satan was able to empower him and he slipped and fell off and broke his leg. That is the weirdest story I have ever heard? What the actual FUCK?! These people are so stupid; they think Satan is real. In fact, that same teacher told the young kids that Satan dwells in the toilets. The school received complaints by parents the next day that their kids do not want use the toilet because they are afraid that Satan might be inside. Another kid was told by this teacher that he will die soon because he doesn't pray. The kid kept crying for days until he was finally convinced by his parents that he will not die. Now that is child abuse right there.


Being a non-Muslim over there is basically a crime. In fact, any religious places of worship other than mosques are illegal. So, there are no synagogues, no churches, no temples; only mosques. Non-Muslims are not even allowed to practise their faith even in private. I am constantly reminded of this incident back in 2007 when a priest was arrested and deported for celebrating mass in a private residence: http://www.asianews.it/news-en/After-jail,-Christians-pray-for-Saudi-king-Abdallah-14684.html. A year later, a Saudi man, who was also a member of the religious police, burned his daughter to death for converting to Christianity: http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/saudi-arabia/saudi-man-kills-daughter-for-converting-to-christianity-1.124541. And these are just few incidents among hundreds of other hate crimes that are perpetually committed by the religious police every now and then.


Now, as I said before, their actions are instituionalized. Perhaps another example of their pseudo-scientific delusions that they are mired in, can be  demonstrated by this special unit that they set up to fight "magic". (link: http://modernnotion.com/saudi-arabia-anti-witchcraft-unit/). They have an anti-sorcery hotline too! In fact, Harry Potter movies are banned over there and it is a crime to possess them as they "promote sorcery". In Saudi Arabia, sorcery (something that doesn't even exist) is punishable by death. Death sentences in Saudi Arabia are carried out by public beheadings. What more can be said but the fact that this religious police are real terrorists funded by the Saudi government. Why is nobody speaking about this? Why do we continue to support such a repressive, backwards, delusional, fairy-tale believing, and morally repugnant regime as that of Saudi Arabia?!


You can scour the internet for lots of other weird stuff that they do. An incident I am constantly reminded of is the 2002 school fire in Mecca which you can read about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002_Mecca_girls'_school_fire. It was a school fire that occurred in 2002 and killed 15 young girls. The religious police were responsible because they refused to let rescue personell inside because the girls were not wearing the required dress code (the garbage bags I talked about earlier). They even refused to let the schoolgirls leaving the burning building.


Now something which bugs is why the West continues to support such a morally repressive and abominable regime. Where is Amnesty International?! I call upon them to look into the CPVPV and bring awareness to the crimes that they commit! Something must be done. These people must pay for their actions?! They hate the West and the Western culture. Let's not forget the story of William Sampson, a dual Canadian-British national who was arrested by police officers and religious police members and tortured severely for two years in order to confess to a crime he never committed. He never received a fair trial and he was continually beaten and tortured from the get-go. He was sentenced to death but was released 2 and a half years later after British intervention. Why did the West wait so much to secure his release? Why wasn't he prevented from suing his captors when he returned home? You can read his very unfortunate story here: http://www.cbc.ca/news2/background/sampson/interview1.html and here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cn9AGsTrEwM and here: http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/oct/14/saudiarabia-humanrights


We should cut all diplomatic ties with this Godforsaken country. Why is it that the West is not doing anything about the human right abuse issues in Saudi Arabia where floggings and be-headings are a common routine? This regime needs to be toppled and replaced. Western countries should undermine the Saudi regime by imposing sanctions and boycotting oil. I hope that someday, this will happen. The Saudi royal family can then go fuck itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But when things like sorcery and criticizing Islam are official capital offences institutionalized by the government and mentioned as such in their Constitution (which is the Quran, btw) , that's when you know that Saudi Arabia is one of the most repressive, contemptible countries in the world. If you ever visit, Good luck if you are not a Muslim. You will need it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is clearly a link about Saudi Arabia. Why are you guys bringing the US into the discussion. The link is not comparing human rights abuse issues in both countries. The point stands that Saudi Arabia is an authoritarian, repressive, cringe-worthy regime with a fucked up legal system. It is not OK to condone the terrible crimes of Saudi Arabia just because you have another example.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Again, doesn't make it OK for Saudi Arabia to cut people's heads off for no reason. In the US, you can speak out against it and hold protests to condemn this. In Saudi Arabia, you will be arrested and tortured if you speak out against what they do. Protests are a crime. It's an authoritarian regime where you have to abide by their morally repugnant laws without questioning them. Most recently, they sentenced a blogger to 10 years in jail and 1000 lashes just for setting up a blog, calling for a deep reform.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does not make it an excuse for Saudi Arabia to commit its heinous actions. Saudi Arabia beheads people for offences that do not even exist (e.g., sorcery and witchcraft) and for apostasy, idolatry, or sedition. The be-headings are carried out in public by chopping off the head with a sword. That is quite abominable.  </TEXT>
