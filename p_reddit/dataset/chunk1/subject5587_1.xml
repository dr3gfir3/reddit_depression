	<TEXT> Good news everyone! LANified!'s next LAN party is coming up, **LANified! 17: MOBA Madness**, and we would love for you to come have a great time with us! There will be multiple tournaments (up to $800 cash prize pool!) and lots of social gaming!

Doors open 10 am Saturday June 21st and the event runs continually till 6 pm Sunday June 22nd!

**But subject5587, what tournaments will you be running?**

-DotA 2 5v5 - Round-Robin

-League of Legends 5v5 - Round-Robin

-DotA 2 - Ability Draft - Mini-Tournament

-League of Legends - ARAM - Mini-Tournament

**But subject5587, where do I find out more? Can I sign-up, or perhaps buy entrance ahead of time?**

We certainly do have more details, and you can sign-up/prepay too! For the full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/7

**But subject5587, I haven't been to a LAN before, can I come poke my head in the door at the day of the event?**

You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so when we run out you're out of luck!

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team for DotA 2 or League of Legends, what should I do?**

Well if you want to live dangerously you can always form/find a team at the event, but if that's not your bag we recommend you post in/read our team forming thread on our forums: http://www.lanified.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=21 t=84185 or join our STEAM group and talk to others about forming/finding a team for the event: http://steamcommunity.com/groups/LANified

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

By all means, come and join us for plenty of gaming outside the tournaments! People often ask us, why not run x tournament? Well it's simply not feasible to run a tournament for every single game out there, but there are plenty of people that come to the events and play whatever game they want despite that! When people sign up for each event we ask them what games they want to play, we then tally those up and present the continually updated list under the "Game Preference" section of the event details page ( http://www.lanified.com/events/go/14/7 ). It makes it easy to see who wants to play what games. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> litter kwitter difficulty, please help! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-06 17:01:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been trying to get my two cats trained on the littler kwitter. I have a bengal, and a short hair black cat (tuxedo).

Many months ago when I first started training them I was able to get them both to defecate on the toilet, but sometimes urinate on the floor. However I had to stop this training and go back to littler for a few months due to tenant issues, bleh.

I'm back at it, and we have the red stage on the toilet now. Both cats embraced using the littler kwitter on the floor, but when I moved it to the toilet this time, only the bengal has been defecating on the littler kwitter. The tuxedo cat seems to only defecate on the floor around the toilet.

The tuxedo cat is a bit of a chubby cat, but she can jump up and down things without any real problem.

I've tried scrubbing the areas she poos, changing the scent, putting things in the way, picking her up and putting her on the litter kwitter and trying to demonstrate the position she needs to be in, and try to make her comfortable with it.

I'm kind of out of ideas, can anyone advise? </TEXT>

But be aware we only have so many seats, so if we run out we can't simply portal in more space! You can also check out a timelapse video of one of our past events: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DPuaHGpbwlU

**But subject5587, I need help forming/finding a team for DotA 2 or League of Legends, what should I do?**

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

Well we simply cant run a tournament for every single game out there, that's just not possible! But that doesn't mean you can't come and play games anyways. When people sign up for our events we ask them what games they want to play and we put that info in a list on the events page under "Game Preference" so others can find what games you want to play and vice versa!

You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so if we run out we can't simply portal in more space!

	<TEXT> As I tried to fall asleep I had an ultra meta thought.

When I'm playing csgo I have a lot of fun, until I die. Then I'm sitting there all fed up because I can't play until the round is over, which usually takes a while.

As I was trying to sleep, it occurred to me. When I'm on a killing streak, I'm the worst person. Because I'm causing the same suffering to the entire other team. They're having less fun because I'm succeeding.

Is this really who I want to be? :S </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so I have a bunch of 280x's. I get on average like 720KH/s with scrypt coins. I believe I could get 300-350KH/s with vertcoin algortyhms (scryptn?).

By what I'm reading of profitability, I would be making similar amounts between say, WDC and vert if I mined either right now.

So, why should I mine vertcoin?

The pattern is 3x quick beeps, pause, 1x quick beep, pause, 1x quick beep.

I can't find just yet what that pattern means, and I couldn't find anything super helpful in the manual or online resources.

Turninb off the buzzer doesn't stop the beeping, which is annoying, especially when determining WHICH system initially was having issues in my rack.

Any tips/ideas? </TEXT>

Sometimes for new sites it has DNS issues:

 Unable to determine IP address from host name www.website.com

 The DNS server returned:

 No Address records

I have to refresh a few times, and then resolution works for a while. Sometimes for sites i've been to before it "forgets" dns info.

So far as I can tell the host it's on can properly resolve public hosts, so I don't know why it's having these issues.

Any ideas? My googling turned up nothing relevant. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **Alert!** Calgary gaming event **LANified! 16: Reloaded** is only two weeks away!

We're putting together an extremely fun gaming event for you and many other gamers just like you. It runs from Saturday March 8th 10am to Sunday March 9th 6pm, non-stop!

We'll be running CSGO and TF2 for main tournaments with a $800 cash prize pool! We also will be running CSGO/TF2/Quake1 mini-tournaments, and there will be lots of other social gaming (such as League of Legends, etc).

**But subject5587, why should I come to a LAN party? I can play games online!**

LAN parties are great places to meet lots of gamers, and then kick their ass in your game of choice! Not only do you get to win prizes by entering our tournaments and mini-tournaments, but you get to discover new games too. Lots of games will be played, and maybe you'll discover some you've never heard of before! Gaming at a LAN party is unlike gaming online. It's exciting, it's immediate, and it's all around you. You'll hear plenty of other gamers having a great time, and it's infectious. It's an experience unmatched by online gaming.

**But subject5587, why should I prepay?**

Prepaying gets you the best price for entry. Prepay is open only until Feb 23rd 6pm, and space is limited! Prepaying also guarantees you a seat, and we never over-sell prepays. Prepaying is processed instantly and we accept paypal for prepayments at this time.

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

Well we simply cant run a tournament for every single game out there, that's just not possible! But that doesn't mean you can't come and play other games anyways. When people sign up for our events we ask them what games they want to play and we put that info in a list on the events page under "Game Preference" so others can find what games you want to play and vice versa!

**But subject5587, where do I find out more about the event?**

The event page with all the details is at : http://www.lanified.com/events/go/13/12 . But if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to post in this thread!

**But subject5587, I want a bigger event. These smaller LANs are boring, not enough people attend!**

Well, a 50 person LAN isn't as big as the biggest ones in the world, but it still is a lot of people! The best thing you can do however is just attend! We grow by having more people attend. If you want esports and social gaming to grow in Calgary, show your support and get your butt to the event! What are you waiting for? </TEXT>

We'll be running CSGO and TF2 for main tournaments with a $800 cash prize pool! We also will be running CSGO/TF2/Quake1 mini-tournaments, and there will be lots of other social gaming (such as League of Legends, etc).

**But subject5587, why should I come to a LAN party? I can play games online!**

LAN parties are great places to meet lots of gamers, and then kick their ass in your game of choice! Not only do you get to win prizes by entering our tournaments and mini-tournaments, but you get to discover new games too. Lots of games will be played, and maybe you'll discover some you've never heard of before! Gaming at a LAN party is unlike gaming online. It's exciting, it's immediate, and it's all around you. You'll hear plenty of other gamers having a great time, and it's infectious. It's an experience unmatched by online gaming.

**But subject5587, why should I prepay?**

Prepaying gets you the best price for entry. Prepay is open only until Feb 23rd 6pm, and space is limited! Prepaying also guarantees you a seat, and we never over-sell prepays. Prepaying is processed instantly and we accept paypal for prepayments at this time.

**But subject5587, I want to play other games! What about me?**

Well we simply cant run a tournament for every single game out there, that's just not possible! But that doesn't mean you can't come and play other games anyways. When people sign up for our events we ask them what games they want to play and we put that info in a list on the events page under "Game Preference" so others can find what games you want to play and vice versa!

**But subject5587, where do I find out more about the event?**

The event page with all the details is at : http://www.lanified.com/events/go/13/12 . But if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to post in this thread!

**But subject5587, I want a bigger event. These smaller LANs are boring, not enough people attend!**

Well, a 50 person LAN isn't as big as the biggest ones in the world, but it still is a lot of people! The best thing you can do however is just attend! We grow by having more people attend. If you want esports and social gaming to grow in Calgary, show your support and get your butt to the event! What are you waiting for? </TEXT>

Also, feels = opinion, but if you have experience or studies/data to back it up please share!

This is mostly about Z1, so please speak about Z1 before Z2 or Z3. Thanks for your input! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay so the included ka-50 training videos for Black Shark 2 are way lower quality than the ones for the A-10C. There's a fair bit lacking in terms of even the startup and take-off instructions.

I've followed the instructions and my chopper keeps just pulling back when I try to take off, and I'm pretty sure my joystick is not mis-calibrated.

Can someone point me to some professional and complete ka-50 training videos please? </TEXT>

**But subject5587, how many of my friends can you fit?**
We're fully equipped to handle up to 50 attendees plus staff! So make sure to bring your friends and let us know that you're coming.

We certainly do have more details, and you can sign-up/prepay too! For the full event details head to: http://www.lanified.com/events/go/13/7

**But subject5587, I haven't been to a LAN before, can I come poke my head in the door at the day of the event?**
You certainly can! If you want to see what the event is like before you plonk down your heard earned money just come on down and we'll gladly show you what it's all about! But be aware we only have so many seats, so if we run out we can't simply portal in more space!

	<TITLE> rtorrent: how to watch multiple folders and save to corresponding folders (torrent files) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-06 13:15:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm posting this here because the documentation is confusing to say the least. I hope this is helpful to at least someone.

I'm using Ubuntu 12.04.

I've installed the following packages (last I checked) since fresh install:

* rtorrent meta package (it seems to pull in all I need for packages out of the box)

I then downloaded the following sample .rtorrent.rc file to start with: http://libtorrent.rakshasa.no/export/1272/trunk/rtorrent/doc/rtorrent.rc (if this hyperlink breaks, to people in the future, this just demonstrates example parameters, all the parameters you actually need to get started are below)

I then modified the following settings:

* upload_rate = 200 (just so I don't destroy my internet while testing)
* schedule = tied_directory,10,10,start_tied=
* schedule = untied_directory,10,10,close_untied=
* schedule = watch_directory_1,11,10,"load_start=/mnt/something/watch/general/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/mnt/something/general/"
* schedule = watch_directory_2,11,10,"load_start=/mnt/something/watch/linuxISOs/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/mnt/something/linuxISOs/"
* schedule = watch_directory_3,11,10,"load_start=/mnt/something/watch/BSDISOs/*.torrent,d.set_directory=/mnt/something/BSDISOs/"

I then run rtorrent as root (for science, obviously) and it picks up on existing and new torrent files in the source folders, then downloads to the relevant directory. If you delete a torrent in any watch folder, it automatically stops running the torrent (closed) but does not delete the data in this configuration. If after you delete the torrent you put the exact same one back, it restarts it and picks up that the data is already there.

This is strictly the CLI rtorrent tool, this does not touch webgui stuff like rutorrent, but that part should not be too hard after this doozie. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> EBGames (Gamestop) wants to charge me to circumvent the front of the line at midnight releases. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-11-21 02:06:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I placed $5 down on Mario World 3D coming out Friday. Dude from EBgames calls me to notify me that I could come in Thursday night for the midnight release.

Then he begins to try to upsell me to the Platinum Edge card for $15/yr, and talks about the benefits, and I don't care but then I hear something I do care about.

If I have the Platinum Edge card I can circumvent any lineup at midnight releases.

So, hold on a minute, I back up and clarify on this. If I wait 6 hours or so in line for a midnight release, that doesn't matter? Any other douche that happens to pay more gets in front of me no matter what?

Turns out, this is true.

This is fucking stupid, I told the guy this was stupid and that I've stood in line for every single CE that Blizzard has made, and been front of the line. This directly impacts me, and I shouldn't have to pay to ensure front of the line status.

Some may say, "1st world problems" or "quit whining" or  "you're the 1%", but why should anyone who legitimately stands in line be marginalized by someone who pays $15/yr? Who's the real fan here?

EBgames is now losing my business.

Just a heads up to anyone who plans to stand in line in the future at EBgames or Gamestop. Your place in line no longer matters to them. </TEXT>

I've tried cleaning up the area beside the toilet and trying to mask the smell of the urine. But It's not yet working.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey Folks,

Just letting it be known again that we/me (LANified!) run a public Mumble server. Lots of people use it for gaming, but you're welcome to use it for whatever you want.

Address: voice.lanified.com
Port: Default (64738)

All I ask is that if you are playing a game to do it in the relevant channel, so others can join you.

If you want a channel made, just let me know and we can get it figured out.

We don't limit who uses the server unless they cause problems. So this isn't region limited either.

Have fun!

p.s. if you don't know what Mumble is, it's a voice application to chat with people. You can download your client at: http://mumble.sourceforge.net/ </TEXT>

Wow, way to go guys.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a frustration, and you may not guess what it is in advance. My frustration is that gmail allows the sending/receiving of files larger than 10MB.

Why is this frustrating to me?

Because this makes it harder for my users to understand why our mailserver only allows 10MB attachments and that I will not change it.

My understanding is that it's a bad idea to increase it past 10MB because other mail servers will just reject the email anyways as it is larger than the general acceptable mail size.

Am I antiquated? I don't know. But I sure am frustrated. I know of at least one user who is frustrated with me, just because I'm doing my job, but they don't know that. :/ </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm using Ubuntu in Unity. With Chromium or Firefox I log into our Zimbra webmail, and try to attach a file two ways. The file is on a network samba share.

1) I click the attach button in the web gui, and try to browse or manually go to smb://hostname and cannot actually reach the host (or figure out how). Failure.

2) I go to the file tool in the environment, successfully browse to smb://hostname, locate the file, and then try to drag it onto the attach field. Fails.

The only way it works in either case is I have to copy the file locally then do it. The local file works for both methods.

I'm uncertain what component is causing this as the experience is for both Chromium and Firefox. Ideas? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Tip - fitting Zimbra OSE in 2GB of RAM </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-16 16:36:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For those considering Zimbra OSE here's a tip that has worked out for me.

First off, some back story so you understand why this is necessary. In December 2012 I was looking to set up Zimbra for one of my side projects. The documentation says that it should operate in 2GB of RAM fine, but a lot of other guides/sources of info recommend 4GB. Zimbra installs and seems to run alright in 2GB but various modules randomly stop for no apparent reason. So I tried this:

My tip is simple. Setup a 2GB Swap file and activate it, then add it to fstab.

First, find a good place you want to keep your 2GB file, some place it wont be deleted, but if it is deleted it's not the end of the world as it was just temporary info anyways. I used /swap

* dd if=/dev/zero of=/swap/swapfile1 bs=1024 count=2097152

Note - The odd count number is to produce a 2GB file, but as long as you are larger than 2GB the precision on this number is not that important. It is also safe to use /dev/zero, you don't need /dev/random for if=.

* mkswap /swap/swapfile1

This formats the file for swap use.

* chown root:root /swap/swapfile1

* chmod 0600 /swap/swapfile1

Need to make sure permissions are set properly. Adjust this detail to your environment.

* swapon /swap/swapfile1

Activate the swap file right now

Then add the following line to /etc/fstab

* /swap/swapfile1 swap swap defaults 0 0

Parse it as you see fit, adjusting /swap/swapfile1 to the location and file name you actually used.

And that's it! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SAMBA4 Kerberos issue, ideas? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-15 15:48:35 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm stuck setting up my SAMBA4 PDC.

I'm running Ubuntu Server 13.04 in a VM. The static interface is set to point DNS to itself. /etc/hosts resolves domain.local (placeholder) to itself, as well as the member hostname it holds.

I've installed the necessary packages with this string:

apt-get install samba4 ntp krb5-user samba4-clients cups

During package installation I feed kerberos domain.local and tell SAMBA to not setup a domain. After installation is done I nuke /etc/samba/smb.conf and /etc/krb.conf .

I then provision using "/usr/bin/samba-tool domain provision" and follow the interactive options. I've tried internal and BIND9 DNS resolution (I'd prefer to use internal). I've used "DNS forward" to it's own IP or just "no".

I add the following to my new smb.conf file under the [global] section:

passdb backend = samba4

server services = +smb -s3fs

"smbclient -L localhost -U%" does populate with IPC/netlogon/sysvol, as expected

Then my krb5.conf looks like this

[libdefaults]

default_realm = domain.local

dns_lookup_realm = false

dns_lookup_kdc = true


Now onto the actual problem, the test right after this:

kinit administrator@DOMAIN.LOCAL

produces:

**kinit: Cannot resolve servers for KDC in realm "DOMAIN.LOCAL" while getting initial credentials**


I have tried quite a few things (some outlined above) and I am stumped. I ping DOMAIN.LOCAL and it resolves and responds to pings, so I don't know why KDC is having such an issue. I'm following multiple guides on SAMBA4 provisioning and this issue is not covered.

Ideas? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SAMBA4 sysvol replication across multiple domain controllers </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-07-11 01:49:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm in the process of setting up SAMBA4 as our PDC and a second one for a BDC (Primary Domain Controller and Back-up Domain Controller).

One of the things I keep seeing is that the sysvol does not inherently replicate in current versions of SAMBA4 (4.0.0-4.0.8 I'm assuming).

The SAMBA4 official documentation suggests that rsync is one way that can work. But I was wondering if anyone has any relevant experience on replicating sysvol in this or similar scenarios?

If you can speak on this matter, please outline the following information too:

* OS Distribution and version

* SAMBA4 version

* How many domain controllers you have for said domain

For those unfamiliar with SAMBA4, or Active Directory Domains, sysvol is a required element which houses many things but primarily is used for logon scripts and policies. Replication across domain controllers is vital especially in a fail-over scenario (which is what this post is about).

**my idea:** I was thinking of having sysvol be a NFS share on another system so it inherently replicates data to all nodes; of course mounted on boot before smbd starts. Is this an erroneous idea? Maybe having it rely on an external share might be a bad idea. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I bought a standing "portable" Air Conditioner many years ago, and over multiple moves since then I have since lost the included plastic tubing. The thing that made the tubing great was that it fit, and did not require duct tape to exhaust the heat.

As a result I've had to make many failed attempts to exhaust the hot air, primarily thin ducting using duct tape, but the duct tape's glue always melts and stops working.

I have not had any luck finding a replacement, so I was wondering if anyone knew of a good solution or source on such an item?

	<TEXT> Okay so leading up to the 50mbit plan the pricing is reasonable, then it just goes bananas.

(multipliers are relative to 50mbit plan)

$105 - 50mbit down - 5 mbit up --- 1.0x down speed - 1.0x up speed - 1.0x price

$260 - 100mbit down - 5mbit up --- 2.0x down speed - 1.0x up speed - 2.48x price

$360 - 259mbit down - 15mbit up --- 5.0x down speed - 3.0x up speed - 3.43x price

Almost all businesses don't care about getting that much down speed, more up speed. I've never heard of the price ratios being like this. Normally when you buy more bandwidth they give you a **better** price per mbit, not a worse one.

	<TEXT> I just came from Superstore and some people are buying as many as 6 flats of water. Seriously guys, come on.

I spoke to the management and recommended they ration the water. I've been told the water treatment plant is offline. I'm not sure if it's true, but even still don't buy more than you really need folks. Don't be selfish in times like this, please. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Promise VTrak M300i, what happens if I plug both iSCSI ports into same network? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-13 18:56:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We have a Promise VTrak M300i. No, I didn't recommend we purchase it.

It has two NICs used strictly for iSCSI traffic, and a third port for management. We had one system connected directly into one of the ports for a dedicated connection. Last night I plugged that system into a VLAN which connects to the other iSCSI port on the same device, and it worked without any reconfiguration on either the Promise or the client server (fortunately same IP range on both ports).

So that got me thinking, what would happen if I plugged both iSCSI ports into the same LAN?

I haven't found any bonding features just yet, and this is a production storage device so I'm not actually going to do it, but I am curious about what would really happen.

Thoughts? </TEXT>

I'm mostly particularly interested in idmap_rid and idmap_hash, or whatever the equivalent is in SAMBA4. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Have you implemented vPro in your environment? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-05 17:53:44 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> No, I don't work for Intel, I just want to know. If you would be so kind as to talk about what you do know I'm sure others would appreciate it too.

1) Have you implemented vPro in your environment in any meaningful way?

2a) If no, why not?

2b) If yes, for what purpose?

3) If yes, has it been worth it? Why?

For those unfamiliar with vPro it is an Intel only chipset featureset which enables you OOB management in many ways for desktops. The earlier versions were a little light weight in features, but recent versions include things like onboard VNC servers (licensing uncertain). Unfortunately I do not know of an AMD camp equivalent. </TEXT>
