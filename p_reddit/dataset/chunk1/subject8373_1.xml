	<TEXT> This ad wasn't meant to be shown everywhere, more just the local area, where the term "MVMT" is a lot more well known.  I wanted to keep a  cleaner look, without too much text all over the place. 
But yeah, I do understand where you're coming from.

	<TEXT> Penny's are really popular at the shop I work at.  I'm not sure if you're into supporting core companies, but penny's are being sold in Costco now. But they're still pretty sick little cruisers.  Personally, I prefer my zip zinger with bones ATF's. Those wheels are amazing. They skate almost just like a normal wheel, but they're soft, perfect for cruising and doing kickflips and whatnot when you're fucking around.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually work at the skateshop in the local college town and you wouldn't believe the amount of kids that come in with their longboards complaining about how slow their board is.  They ask if it's the trucks or the wheels. lol Not the bearings.  And whenever I ask if they ride in the water or rain, they say yes.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When I was younger, my mom and I were at the grocery store when two black ladies walked up and started talking to me, commenting on how cute I was and whatnot. (This is how my mom tells the story.) Once we walked away, I immediately asked, "Mom, do you know those purple people?" 

She'll never let me live this down. </TEXT>
