Can't be much fun looking over your shoulder or thinking if  someone is lurking in shadows following that unfortunate incident in the hallway. It's understandable that you have a heightened sense of fear and foreboding whoever someone seem to be following you - hence your emotional response is more acute than most of us.

I hope you are okay now :)

	<TEXT> I may be wrong since I am no expert or even remotely close to the field of psychology/neurology etc. From the highest OP's comment I think this amygdala hijack is almost instantaneous - the amygdala takes over in milliseconds and the rational part of the brain has no chance to even "think about it". From thence on if the experience has been mapped the emotional side of the brain is triggered and the noecortex is not prominently active. 

I guess in your case it's a collection of bad experiences that allowed you to form some opinion of the unfairness of the professors' actions and the basis for your judgement of them. I don't think this is rage - which is almost instantaneous - like this guy [here](
http://i.imgur.com/bHeXIB5.gifv) - from r/wtf

That doesn't mean your are not being unfairly treated. 

But as I said I am no expert and I bow to those with superior knowledge ;)

This might give you time to figure if your next action is going to be counterproductive and calm the fuck down! Maybe even excuse myself and leave the room if possible.

	<TEXT> Very Interesting - thanks. Personally witness such a reaction last week at a meeting. 

 An amygdala hijack exhibits three signs: strong emotional reaction, sudden onset, and post-episode realization if the reaction was inappropriate.

What if a person is still angry post-episode and still think their rage reaction is justified when everyone think they overreacted? Is there some psychological explanation or term for such persons? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Forgot about that. Just got this excerpt from Wikipedia where he was shot during a drug bust:

 Shooting and public interest

 Serpico was shot during a drug arrest attempt on February 3, 1971, at 778 Driggs Avenue, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. Four officers from Brooklyn North received a tip that a drug deal was about to take place. Two policemen, Gary Roteman and Arthur Cesare, stayed outside, while the third, Paul Halley, stood in front of the apartment building. Serpico climbed up the fire escape, entered by the fire escape door, went downstairs, listened for the password, then followed two suspects outside.[7]

 The police arrested the young suspects, and found one had two bags of heroin. Halley stayed with the suspects, and Roteman told Serpico (who spoke Spanish), to make a fake purchase attempt to get the drug dealers to open the door. The police went to the third-floor landing. Serpico knocked on the door, keeping his hand on his revolver. The door opened a few inches, just far enough to wedge his body in. Serpico called for help, but his fellow officers ignored him.[7]

 Serpico was then shot in the face with a .22 LR pistol. The bullet struck just below the eye and lodged at the top of his jaw. He fired back,[8] fell to the floor, and began to bleed profusely. His police colleagues refused to make a "10-13" dispatch to police headquarters indicating that an officer had been shot. An elderly man who lived in the next apartment called the emergency services and reported that a man had been shot. The stranger stayed with Serpico.[7] A police car arrived. Unaware that Serpico was one of them, the officers took him to Greenpoint Hospital.[citation needed]

Good film too starring Al Pacino.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Saudi Arabia now leads the UN Human rights council.

Given the situation recently in Yemen where a Saudi-led Arab coalition were pressing for a bombing campaign in Yemen to restore the ousted govt. and that Saudi Arabia recently deter UN investigation in alleged human rights violation in Yemen, I doubt this US bombing incident is going to gain much traction especially as a "war crime" investigation.

There were these two so-called [Opium wars in China involving the British](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opium_Wars)

 The Chinese briefly sought to stop Britain from illegally importing and selling opium in the country, while Britain sought to legalize its opium trade and to liberalize other trade. For Britain, its balance of trade would be more favourable if Chinese payments for smuggled opium, provided from India and Turkey by British and other merchants, were boosted. </TEXT>

 "I mean a black mane lion like that you can see from afar and even on a hunt. You are definitely going to identify that this -- hang on this is a collared lion and it is Cecil. Because all the conservationists and wildlife industry in that area would have been very familiar with that lion Cecil," Kotze told CBS News' Debora Patta.

	<TEXT> Perhaps that was more an opportunity than a plan when Pao was hired. 

Yishan left recommending Pao allowing him a smooth exit that's nice and clean on friendly grounds ( don't burnt bridges if you still wish to remain in business). His intention was no honourable.

Pao did the job but her court case made her lose focus. Couple Thant with her incompetence or lack of understanding of the community culture resulted in some bad moves. Those confluence of forces presented an opportunity for Alexis to capitalise on a vague idea to monetise Iama but there a stumbling block was Victoria. He needed to remove her but needed a cover to deflect the heat and the opportunity presented itself in the shape of Pao. The situation was ripe for plucking! 
 
She wasn't the "glass cliff" originally planned to take the blame (you are giving Alexis to much credit for planning) but she become one as the situation unfurled.

I could be wrong !

	<TEXT> Some corporate-speak (lame excuses) along the lines like - we were for free speech when we were a fledgling startup and focusing on a very raw reddit. Now with changing time we have investors breathing down our neck demanding some solid evidence of ROI. And of course with authoritities such as the NSA with their bastion of eavesdropping tools and the need to comply with legal requirements, we feel reddit cannot continue to support absolute free speech as we know it. It put us in an awkward position that might force us to cross the line into illegal territories such pics of dead kids for instance. 

We regret this decision but feel it's the best for the majority concern. As a business we need to be profitable at some point and adv will not use reddit or be associated with it if we are unable to control the subreddits in existence.

Oh btw we hope to hive reddit off to some big dumb company for $$$ billions in a year's time and we can't do that without first doing some spring cleaning! Each of us hope to walk away with $$$millions in our bank account soon. 

Please feel free to edit to suit the occasion.

	<TEXT> Confirmed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bald_and_Golden_Eagle_Protection_Act

 Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act (16 U.S.C. 668-668d) is a United States federal statute that protects two species of eagle. The bald eagle was chosen as a national emblem of the United States by the Continental Congress of 1782 and was given legal protection by the Bald Eagle Protection Act of 1940. This act was expanded to include the golden eagle in 1962.[1] Since the original Act, the Bald and Golden Eagle Protection Act has been amended several times. It currently prohibits anyone, without a permit issued by the Secretary of the Interior, from "taking" bald eagles. Taking is described to include their parts, nests, or eggs, molesting or disturbing the birds....

Penalties:

The criminal penalty stipulation.. maximum fine of $5,000 and one year's imprisonment. Furthermore, in the second case of second conviction, the penalty was increased to $10,000 fine and two years imprisonment. The maximum amount of a misdemeanor offense was increased $100,000 under the Criminal Fines and Improvement Act of 1987. In addition, $250,000 will be fined for an individual for a felony conviction. Respectively, $200,000 and $500,000 will be fined in case of an organization for a misdemeanor and felony conviction.[2]

 The civil penalty provision was added, stating anyone who takes, possess, transports, sells, barters, or purchases any dead or alive bald or golden eagles will be fined $5,000 for each violation. In addition, he or she who violates or disturbs any egg or nest will be fined under the civil penalty act. The act allowed the taking, possession, or transporting of the bald and golden eagles in areas where they were endangering wildlife and livestock.[2]

Native American - The Federal Eagle Aviary and Eagle Aviary Permit

 This permit allows Native American tribes to possess lawfully obtained live bald or golden eagles for religious activities. In order to be eligible for this permit, tribal entities must be registered and be receiving services from the United States Bureau of Indian Affairs. The Federal Eagle Aviary is a facility that houses non-releasable bald and golden eagles for the religious purposes of Native Americans. The permit's intent is to provide Native Americans with an additional source of feathers through moulting...[35] </TEXT>

 "After Garner expressed to the police that he was tired of being harassed and that he was not selling cigarettes, officers moved to arrest Garner on suspicion of selling "loosies" (single cigarettes) from packs without tax stamps.[15] When officer Daniel Pantaleo took Garner's wrist behind his back, Garner swatted his arms away.[16] Pantaleo then put his arm around Garner's neck and pulled him backwards and down onto the ground.[17] After Pantaleo removed his arm from Garner's neck, he pushed Garner's face into the ground[18][19] while four officers moved to restrain Garner, who repeated "I can't breathe" eleven times while lying facedown on the sidewalk.[7][20][21] After Garner lost consciousness, officers turned him onto his side to ease his breathing. Garner remained lying on the sidewalk for seven minutes while the officers waited for an ambulance to arrive.[22] The officers and EMTs did not perform CPR on Garner at the scene; according to a spokesman for the PBA, this was because they believed that Garner was breathing and that it would be improper to perform CPR on someone who was still breathing.[23][24] He was pronounced dead on arrival at the hospital approximately one hour later.[25][26]" </TEXT>

 In 2008, Norway became the first country to enact a quota of 40 percent, threatening to dissolve publicly traded companies who did not comply. France, Iceland and Spain soon followed. The Netherlands and Malaysia set non-binding targets of 30 percent. Australia, Britain and Sweden have threatened to enforce quotas if companies not voluntarily give more corporate supervisory seats to women

	<TEXT> The author wasn't trying to discuss the technicality of the patented ideas but merely pointing out how Apple lost this case - by being complacent and flexing its muscle instead of doing some preparation and showing some respect to the court and jurors. 

 Brad Caldwell, the Dallas-based patent infringement specialist who represented Smartflash...tells a curious story.

 I think the reason we won, he says, is because we focused on the questions that were going to be presented to the jury: Were the patents valid? Did Apple infringe? Was the infringement willful?

 Apple, according to Caldwell, focused on everything but the issue at hand..

 They thumbed their nose at other people, says Caldwell. They acted like were Apple and have no need to respect other peoples intellectual property.

Much as I dislike patent-troll, Apple deserved to lose this case. Apple's key witness didn't even bother to read the patent:

 Augustin Farrugia, Apples director of security and its key witness, had previously designed the national banking system for Singapore. On the stand he said he too hadnt gotten around to reading Racz patents.

To strike fear into the hearts and mind of ordinary people, perhaps.

	<TEXT>  And it is a given that people will break ethical boundaries to fulfil moral obligations. The only thing we disagree on is what is immoral. Selfish people think it is immoral for them personally to lose. Generous people think it is immoral for others to lose. They will both break ethical boundaries to achieve a desired outcome.

Interesting explanation. Not knocking you but is there some research citations about the relationship between ethics and moral obligations.

 These kinds of discussions are better handled in /r/politics[1] where knee jerk accusations and confrontational tone at least make for good entertainment. 

If it is posted there it surely be removed and flared as 'off-topic' ;) </TEXT>

Can some military experts weigh in on the degree of difficulties in making such shots? 

**Edit:** Did some googling and come up with these - not exactly the same situation unfortunately:

* [U.S. Navy snipers killed three Somali pirates with just three shots... in the dark, from the deck of a rolling ship](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1169712/Flawless-How-U-S-Navy-snipers-killed-Somali-pirates-just-shots--dark-deck-rolling-ship.html) - with video.

* [Open Sea Sniping -- How hard is it to shoot someone in a lifeboat 100 feet away?](http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2009/04/open_sea_sniping.html)

	<TEXT> Yup  - more onions:

"[The rescue team] went in to rescue him and [his captors] had bound him up so tightly that he was in a lot of pain," she said. "The vet and our team came with fruits and just started speaking softly to him and to reassure him that we were there to help, and it was at that time that tears flooded down his face. The founder of Wildlife SOS, who was there are the time of the rescue, said .... that really caught him off guard. They've done a lot of elephant rescues and the fact the the tears were just coming down ... he was weeping. It was an emotional moment and everyone was more motivated to get him on the truck and to safety."
