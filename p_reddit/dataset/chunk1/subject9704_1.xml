I may have been melodramatic but I am trying to make a point about the path that using violence against people you disagree with is on. Shutting down ideas is un-American.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right, peacefully protesting ideas is ok.

Violently protesting ideas is not ok.

The qualification is important because if we cannot condone violence to stop ideas. That is what authoritarians do. What's next are they going to put a pile of books together that have bad ideas and set it on fire?  </TEXT>

But yes when someone is trying to have a political lecture and people who do not like it shut it down with violence, I am concerned. I am more concerned that other people are defending it.

I would be equally as concerned if they shut down a Richard Wolfe lecture. </TEXT>

To claim they are the 'anti-fascists' is crazy, because they are literally using violence to shut down opposing views. This is disgusting. Whether or not you agree with Milo, resorting to violence to shut down his message is acting like what they claim to be against.

But you cannot call things that have not happened yet lies. The wall isn't built and we do not have resolution on who is paying and how. 

As far as getting money out of politics the lobbying ban for his own team is a hell of a start. 

Draining the Swamp and coal jobs have not had a resolution yet, but that does not mean they were lies.

I do not however think it likely for Trump to work with people who are denouncing him daily and calling him all the buzzwords. 

Here is a fun snippet from an article I was reading earlier about Bernie wanting to work with Trump and you will see an example of what I mean. 


"Within the last 24 hours, Sen. Bernie Sanders has called President Trumps behavior delusional, dangerous and unconstitutional.

But the Vermont independent also says he wants to work with Trump  if he is serious about standing up to the pharmaceutical industry and reducing drug prices."

	<TEXT> I am looking for a book on the first communities of men. Has anyone come across a good one? 

Specifically I want to learn about how the first communities were formed, and what the result of the formation of communities was immediately. So if a group of hunter gathers got together to form a community, what was the net benefit to those individuals.

Any answer is appreciated, thank you.

	<TEXT> My thought is going after the foreign donors angle. 

http://www.fec.gov/pages/brochures/foreign.shtml

So it is illegal to accept donations towards a political election either directly or indirectly. It is also illegal to help foreign nationals in doing so. 

Now we get to the stretch that maybe the emails can help us with. We know the Clinton Foundation and State department ran parallel in Hillary's camp. We also know that Hillary was planning on running for POTUS way before she announced in the year 15. A logical argument could be made that the Clinton Foundation has been accepting donations from foreign donors for Hillary. She has been active in office during much of its life and the Foundation activities were commingled with her and her staffs efforts while she served as SOS. 

She signed a pledge to not accept foreign donations before serving as SoS and I think as a Senator because of the obvious implications of influence. She continued to serve or campaign ever since, all the while the Clinton Foundation accepted foreign donations on behalf of her. You cannot separate her public positions and her private foundation and trust her that there is no influence.

The foundation is guilty of accepting foreign donations on behalf Hillary for her campaign. 

Can anyone think of some emails that prove it?

Or other provable crimes with the law to compare? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Our country needs some nationalism. We are being ruled by corporations leveraging nations against each other and a government more concerned with globalism than our own nation. The cost of living is rising while average pay is stagnant. We need nationalism to drive infrastructure projects, rebuilding the military and improving our schools. Our poorest neighborhoods need nationalism so we have pride in ourselves enough as a nation to help lift these people from poverty. 

America needs nationalism and those opposed have labeled it White Nationalism, I say no; American Nationalism. It is not a question of color it is a question of one America. 

Don't let the opponents of a Strong America muddy the waters. They say white nationalism, I say no

AMERICAN NATIONALISM.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a crazy idea but what if there was a the_donald SuperPAC that raised its own funds to run digital promotion of Donald Trump or against Hillary Clinton. There would be no campaign coordination, just coordinated shit posts across the web. 

This is using the system to beat the system at it's finest. There doesn't even have to be millions of dollars because of the inherent low operating cost of a truly digital operation. 

I do not know the rules of Super PACs or the first thing about organizing one but I most definitely know about digital promotion and data. 

Thoughts? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The scary thing is that people are acting like they need to save the country from Trump. There is this notion that he is an imminent threat to our nation; and we must do everything to stop him. 

How far does this narrative go? What is too much to stop Trump? Lying? Cheating? Violence? 

The more media dummies say he is 'literally' Hitler or that he is only supported by white male racists the more the media followers will feel justified in the above. Or just as bad, will feel the media is justified in the above. 

This is scary and truly unAmerican. This is the dictatorial behavior they supposedly fear. 

Just a thought.  </TEXT>
