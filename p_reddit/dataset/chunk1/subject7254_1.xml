EDIT 2: Producers of Disney, you sick bastards. I CAN'T believe how easy it was for all of you to do this! I mean, I could see a few movies being dark, but there are ones I've never heard of, and ones that I've always loved even now as a high school senior, if only for the great stories. 

I am especially appalled by the fact that Simba screwed his half sister. Thank you Reddit </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've practiced Taekwondo for three years now. I've got a reputation among my organization as an unorthodox fighter, even for Taekwondo. Flying, spinning, jumping kicks is part of the advanced curriculum. I've been looking at other martial arts, grappling and striking alike, for more ideas for things to practice and use in sparring situations. I've taken a liking to the Superman Punch and Cartwheel Kick. I've used the walls in class to jump off and land punches and kicks. I want to learn more though. Can you give me the name of a crazy unorthodox striking technique for me to practice? If you have a link to an instructional video, that would be amazing. Thank you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> She broke up with me about 2 months ago. Said that we'll try to be friends. Like real friends that hang out every now and then. Not the "yeah we're friends, but we never talk" friends. 

After an awkward 2 weeks of barely talking at all, we start texting again. Like every day. For the next month and a half up to the present. Snapchat too. Tag each other in Facebook posts. 

When school started up again (we're in high school), we started hanging out in person again (she went to stay with family after we broke up, the reason for all the cyber communication). The breakup wasn't ugly at all. It's complicated. We both admit we're still crazy for each other, and we both agree that some day we'll get back together. Just not now. 

Things feel exactly like how it was during the relationship. The only difference I see is that we no longer kiss. We still cuddle when we watch movies or if she's cold. We give each other hugs. We flirt a bunch. Just no kissing. 

Me and my (ex?) girlfriend are bad at breaking up with each other.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So my friend brought up a very good point. I thought you all might have good opinions. He was watching X-Men 2 when the woman with Wolverine's powers shows up. Somehow his mind wanders to virginity and he thinks, "Is it possible for her to lose her virginity?"

His logic was that since her regenerative healing repairs any damage to her body, that would most likely include breaking the hymen. So she would never be able to lose her physical virginity. Thoughts?

Btw, I hope I picked the right subreddit.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> TIFU by ripping a big one. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-11 02:43:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I will admit, on the scale of the kind of stuff I've seen on here, this really isn't that big of an FU. In the moment, however, it was the worst thing I've ever done. 

So, I had a long day. What I really needed was a hot shower to relax. I was showering, feeling good. The hot water running over my skin. I felt a pressure in my lower abdomen. The familiar fart pressure. I decide to release. 

At the moment I released, intense pain shot to my butthole. For that split second, I believe I felt what it must be like to be anally probed. I nearly ripped my butthole apart. My rectum spread and stretched before slamming shut again. As for my cheeks, if you played it back in slow motion, I believe it would look something like a horse's lips flapping. The pain subsided very quickly, so I went back to enjoying my shower. 

For anyone who has farted in the shower before, you'll know that every now and then, you'll smell it, and it smells way worse than normal. I have no idea about the chemistry involved (if someone would explain it to me, it would be appreciated.). I think it has something to do with the water molecules bonding with the fart molecules and the steam lifting it up. 

What I smelled... Was something akin to absolute, concentrated death in its purest form. My first thought was, "Oh, God! What have I done??"

Second thought, "*THAT* came out of my body???"

Now, thirty minutes later, I can still smell it. 

TL;DR: nearly ripped open my butthole and smelled Satan's nuts.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a brown belt in Taekwondo and am starting to really work on my judo and Jiu-Jitsu. I'm a big follower of MMA, and I've noticed that some of these fighters are just that: fighters. 

I believe there is a major difference between being a fighter and being a martial artist: a fighter knows how to beat you up. A martial artist will only beat you up in competition and do everything to avoid violence outside of it.

Guys, your "manstrating" will of course vary from person to person as it does with females, and your cramps are constant blue balls, but, hey, more worry free sex if you find out your body's rhythm.

	<TITLE> TIFU by taking my medicine. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-08-07 14:11:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Literally just happened. First off, I'm a 17 year old male. Second, I have to take medicine in the morning before anything. Well I was off work yesterday, so I slept in. Took my medicine later than usually, about 11:30. Couldn't sleep well last night, about 3 1/2 hours total on and off. Woke up about 6:30 this morning for work (feeling like crap I'm so tired), took my medicine, started making breakfast. Then my boss calls two minutes later saying I didn't need to come in today and we'll work tomorrow. I work on a farm, so the weather determines if I work normally. Last night it rained horribly and still is. 

Here's the fuck up: my medicine is a stimulant. So I won't be able to sleep until it wears off a LOOONG time from now. Nothing disgusting or cringeworthy, just a sad 17 year old who won't be able to sleep. 

TL;DR: Took my stimulant medication late yesterday morning and couldn't sleep well last night. Woke up early for work today, took medicine only to get call from boss that I didn't need to come in. Now I'm tired, very sad, and will probably spend today Redditing.  </TEXT>

And I think they aren't even really a 155 lb fighter if they cut 10 lbs to make weight. They're just pretending to be one. I also get cutting 2-3 lbs if you're barely over the limit, but it gets ridiculous. 

I'm an aspiring fighter, and I've already promised myself that I'm going to fight in my natural class. 155 lbs lean </TEXT>
