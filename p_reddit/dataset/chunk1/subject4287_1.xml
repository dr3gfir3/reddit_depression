	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Users work so hard to accumulate karma and it means absolutely nothing.  While I think the results might be horrifying, I thought this might be an interesting subject for discussion. 

It would immediately give the capacity to spend your previous good will to affect later influence in yours and others' posts/comments. 

Thoughts?

**Edit:** I love how quickly this got buried. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Long story short: she's Chinese (Hong Kong background, speaks Cantonese) and I am obviously Caucasian.  I've always understood it to be a racial slur, and fairly offensive, but she disagreed rather vehemently...

Wikipedia seemed to back me up:

Are there circumstances where this is considered okay, and I'm out to lunch?

	<TEXT> I really like reddit; I get reddit.  There's a community, people rattle off ridiculous puns like they're going out of style.  Interesting links, there's karma, I'm happy.

I really don't get Twitter yet.  

I don't want to be one of those people that writes off Twitter as some bizarre internet fad that doesn't really make any sense.  I suspect that there must be some merit to it.  So, lately I've been giving it a try, started "following" a bunch of people I know, as well as some funny actors (Simon Pegg), cool authors (Cory Doctorow, Brandon Sanderson), comedians (Chris Hardwick), relevant politicians, etc.

Is there other stuff you can do with Twitter that'll make it more of an experience? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have a pretty unique name, as far as they go.  For a long time I thought I was the only one who had it in the whole world, since the family with that name is fairly remote.  

Thanks to facebook, I now know there are at least 5 other people that come up if someone tries to google me.  I find this oddly comforting.  

How do you feel about all the people out there with your name?  Are there a lot of them? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always avoided reading science fiction novels, but I picked up Ender's Game by Orson Scott Card a couple years ago, and it really changed my mind about the whole genre.  Since then I've read some Sci-Fi like Asimov, William Gibson, Rant by Chuck Palahniuk was pretty cool. 

If you had to choose what would you say was the coolest Time-Travel novel you ever came across?

Thanks! </TEXT>
