	<TEXT> Hey all! Coming from r/pokemongoPasadena and r/pokemongoSFV. I've been researching nests and habitats in Pasadena for quite some time, check out our thread [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongopasadena/comments/4z4l47/pasadena_nests_and_habitats_version_30/), which not only lists them, but includes image proof as well for each. 

The San Fernando Valley thread is just getting started, you can find that [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonGOSFV/comments/4zx4ut/san_fernando_valley_nests_and_habitats/)

Please feel free to use any of this data, and I'm excited to join all of you in mapping for TSR! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> San Fernando Valley Nests and Habitats! </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ______________________________________________
#**San Fernando Valley Nests and Habitats Version 1.0**
______________________________________________

Hey all! As with the [original thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongopasadena/comments/4z4l47/pasadena_nests_and_habitats_version_30/) over at r/pokemongopasadena, this thread aims to list all the nests and habitats in the SFV. What makes it different is proof in the form of images from different times. This should alleviate any trainers getting bad information on nests/habitats in the area. I will also add any credit due to you guys that find/confirm nests!

I'll continue to update this list with more images for each nest/habitat, as well as any other confirmed spots you know of! Please feel free to submit photos or nests/habitats you know of! The list is small right now, lets add more!
_______________________________________________
*Habitats* are spots where you'll find a certain pokemon spawning regularly, but usually no more than 1-2 at a time.

*Nests* are spots where you'll find multiple of a certain pokemon at once, usually 3-5 at a time.

Note: Habitats and Nests have a cooldown time between spawns. If you arrive at one and the pokemon you are searching for is not around, wait for a bit! Cooldown times can be anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Lets make a list of the best Pokestop spots in the SFV!

To get us started:

- In Downtown Burbank, outside a bar named Story Tavern, are three Pokestops lined up on the street. If you situate yourself in the middle of all three, you can sit and hit all three of them at once! They are usually lured in the evenings and weekends as well. [Here](http://imgur.com/83bUyGw.jpg) is what it looks like on the map.

Please share yours! </TEXT>

Snorlax spawned at the end of the Queen Mary, blocked by security guards, and two Lapras spawned at Bixby Park, way too far to get to. A real dud of a night.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Id add more later, but for Downtown Burbank:

- Theres a spot in front of Story Tavern where you can sit and reach three pokestops at once. They are usually all lured in the evenings.

- Charmanders spawn here throughout the day, one at a time around San Fernando, in between the mall and Gordon Biersch.

- Geodudes, Machop, and Doduo spawn like crazy all over the downtown area.

- Along the river, water pokemon spawn on rotation: Omanyte, Squirtle, Staryu, Magikarp, and rarely Dratini.

Before the migration, Burbank had seperate Pikachu, Tentacool, Abra nests, and a few others I'm forgetting. I can start scanning the areas again to get the current info. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a different type of user-submission than others. Nobody knows for sure, but it seems that when anyone with the app encounters a pokemon in the game, it's relayed to Go Radar, which makes it accurate. You can see from the app and website that there is no way to actually submit any findings yourself. This is why it only works in highly populated areas. 

EDIT: See u/DreadPirate_Roberts_ reply for how it works. </TEXT>

#**Pasadena Nests and Habitats Version 3.0!**
__________________________________

Nests have changed again! Here comes the new list! Please submit any others you find. As before, Image Proof will be listed with each nest/habitat!

*Habitats* are spots where you'll find a certain pokemon spawning regularly, but usually no more than 1-2 at a time.

*Nests* are spots where you'll find multiple of a certain pokemon at once, usually 3-5 at a time.

Note: Habitats and Nests have a cooldown time between spawns. If you arrive at one and the pokemon you are searching for is not around, wait for a bit! Cooldown times can be anywhere from 5 to 30 minutes.

	<TITLE> For each specific encounter, CP is the same per level? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-01 04:34:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was farming with a few people yesterday at a Charmander nest, and we decided to do some testing on CP per encounter. There were three of us at level 25, two at level 21, and one player at level 14. Each encounter, we would check the CP with eachother. For us Level 25s, every single encounter was the same CP. Same with the level 21s. The level 14 player had different CP than either every time as well. 

For example, encounter 1 (same pokemon at same place, same time), all three of level 25 players encountered a Charmander at CP 405. The level 21 players encountered theirs at CP 128. The level 14 player encountered theirs at CP 105. On and on the entire day. Every time it each group of players with the same Level would have the same CP.

Has there been any info related to this? Even though this is still a small set of tests through only 15-20 pokemon encounters, I'm thinking the CP is tied to the player Level, and any player encountering the same pokemon at the same time/place will have an identical CP as another player of the same level.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> #**As of 8/22/16 Nests and Habitats have changed again! Click [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemongopasadena/comments/4z4l47/pasadena_nests_and_habitats_version_30/) for the new, updated thread!**


__________________________________
#**Pasadena Nests and Habitats Version 2.0!**
__________________________________

Now that the nests and habitats have changed, it's time to list out the new ones! Please submit others you find. This list will grow as I confirm what the old nests have turned into! As before, Image Proof will be listed with each nest/habitat!

*Habitats* are spots where you'll find a certain pokemon spawning regularly, but usually no more than 1-2 at a time.

*Nests* are spots where you'll find multiple of a certain pokemon at once, usually 3-5 at a time.

Note: Habitats and Nests have a cooldown time between spawns. If you arrive at one and the pokemon you are searching for is not around, wait for a bit! Cooldown times can be anywhere from 5 minutes to 30.

Note2: List is now in alphabetical form!

_________________________________

I've been going through the python map (more accurate than pokevision) throughout our lovely city, and have found some nests and habitats not mentioned yet. Below is a list of the already confirmed nests as well as the new ones I've found.

NOTE: Some of these lay right outside the official Pasadena city boundaries, but they are so close I thought to include them.

NOTE 2: I'll add more to this list with any others I find, as well as others that are submitted (and confirmed) here!

NOTE 3: I'm currently in the process of adding map proof (pictures) for each of these. For *Habitats* I will be adding more than one picture from different time periods.

	<TEXT> I'm trying to locate the best choice in color for my model, based on a Forest Service truck, picture [here](https://farm3.staticflickr.com/2503/3712123884_5db122edd2_b.jpg). I've looked through the Model Paint Database, and it looks like the Model Master 1710 fits, although I'd love some guidance. I'm also wondering if there's somewhere to get decals for this type of vehicle?  </TEXT>
