	<TEXT> A lot of really good points already mentioned. I agree just make sure you are in a good environment, you don't want to enhance your issues and have a plan for when you finally get high especially it being your first time. Coloring high is a personal go to if you want, it's very relaxing and fun!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How did it taste sweet wise? I'm tempted to try something like this since all the breads at my local market have crazy amounts of HFCS and other processed sweeteners. Is it bitter or bland? </TEXT>
