The function of universities is to pass along knowledge, without restriction, for the benefit of the community. Removing someone from the classroom, whom is there to learn, is unconscionable and violates their academic freedoms.

	<TEXT> It's pretty safe to assume that Congresspeople (including Senators) do not read every piece of text that they vote on.

Don't let your Senator vote without them reading and deeply considering the TPP agreement.

Call them. Ask them if they have read the entire text. Tell them not to vote until they read the entire text. Tell them to read the entire text while others can watch them read the text. They could read the text in a very public space and/or create and post a video of them sitting there, reading the text.

Yes, I want to actually see every US Senator read the entirety of the TPP before they vote on it. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I primarily develop on dual 1920x1080 monitors (code on one monitor, terminals, debuggers, web browsers, music   more on the other). Are there any solutions for easily making a watchable broadcast with this setup? I've tried Google+ Hangouts/Youtube live streaming, but it seems like with those you can either share a single window or the entire 3840x1080 desktop, which becomes pretty useless for viewing text unless the viewer has a 4k monitor.

Is there any good solution? Or do you just need to drastically reduce your development area when you are broadcasting? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It seems like Mitt Romney is so inept, or cynical, that by November the arguments he puts forth will be unintelligible or at the very least a constant stream of what we've been seeing in the last few weeks. 

It is fascinating to watch people attempt to rationalize his behavior and defend the things that he is saying. They keep pushing it to stupider and stupider places. 

It seems like you can detect some cracking in the facade they have built up in their minds. Little flinches, pauses here and there, as if Steve Doocy were thinking to himself, "What the fuck am I saying?".

For some reason I am extremely curious to see just how far they will take this, when and how they will figure it out, and how they will respond once they finally step into reality.

Will they just snap? Realize their mistake and apologize? Deny it forever? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Romney pays less taxes than a lot of us even though he makes much more than us. Why aren't we pissed off that he is not pulling his weight? 

He just wants to make more money at our expense. He gets taxed less and we get taxed more to make up for it.

Should we as a society allow someone who thinks they don't have to contribute as much as we all contribute to be our leader? 

This man is clearly primarily motivated by making money. He doesn't care about contributing to society in the same way we do. He will do everything he can to minimize his contribution to our common burden.

Why do we want a person like that to be our president? It doesn't make sense.


Edit: To clarify, I am talking about him paying less federal income taxes as a percentage of income than a lot of us in the United States do. </TEXT>
