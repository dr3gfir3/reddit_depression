	<TEXT> Another thing I think plays into this is that electronic transfers have been happening for a quite a few years almost every second of every day. Voting only happens every few months at best and each county is doing their own thing. It isn't as centralized as banking. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are exactly right u/rakajj. I am going to try and work on some more data involving the geography that better shows it. This visualization doesn't because I wanted to highlight some of the other characteristics that can have an effect on commute time.

Those are even affected by geography though. Federal workers have the longest commutes, but it is because most are located in DC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for asking u/billclintonsbrother those questions. 

So the survey is a household based survey so all the data is coded where a person lives. So like what you were saying about DC. Commute times inside DC won't seem as long even though the commutes from the surrounding counties are some of the longest in the nation.

I started to play with the county data last night and it does a much better job of showing some of the geographical trends that you were mentioning. I didn't do that with this because the county data isn't available and it could be a visualization all on its own.

When I finish up the geographical look I would be happy to send it to you. </TEXT>

After downloading the data, World Programming System, Microsoft Excel, and Tableau were used to create this visualization. If you have any questions go ahead and leave me a comment.

	<TEXT> I support the petition and am willing to say that to other members of the Lds church. I don't want to sign it because I don't want to give the website my street address. 

I don't know about the particulars of what is happening here, but I do believe the honor code office shouldn't get involved. It's more important that rape victims report the crime than knit picking the honor code.  A church the cherishes eternal justice should be ok with it some people abuse this clause since the cases that it is true are so important. 

Ldsbc actually moved to the KSL building on north temple and west temple. It is actually a pretty cool building as well. Just different.  </TEXT>

For example LA county has almost a million more people then it did, but counties the gained 10,000 look to have an enormous amount of population growth. Your map shows relative size, but you could show relative and nominal. </TEXT>

I was able to fix the zoom. Thanks for pointing it out. I must have messed with it when I was exploring and didn't switch it back.

Thanks for the feedback. I really appreciate it. When I have a viz like this and it is pretty good, but I don't know what it needs to take it to the next level I'm always hoping to get some insight on what I can do to improve it. </TEXT>

In the case of a mother that wants to have an abortion, she is no longer acting in the interest of the child. That is why the government has some right to become involved. They would do the same if a child was being abused.

Again, their you go dabbling in slippery slope arguments that have no baring on what is occurring here with your talk about euthanasia.

	<TEXT> The reason it become a political issue is at what point does a fetus become a human and have rights that a supposed to be protected by the government.

The biggest issue is that people don't agree on when this change occurs. I believe it is early than most of the people here do it would seem.

I will concede that republicans do a horrible job of making this argument. They fall into the easy(/stupid) fallacy that everyone should believe their religion knows best. 

They should instead focus on pointing out that science shows that their are certain milestones that even a fetus goes through and that at some point it  becomes a person and has rights. Science shows that this point seems to be getting earlier than we used to believe. </TEXT>

A trade deficit isn't like a budget deficit.

A trade deficit is like paying someone to do something for you like a yard service or cleaning person. You can use the time you would have spent doing that doing something that you are better at and creates more wealth. </TEXT>

Since data is only released yearly for geographies with more than 65,000 people, I had to calculate the difference for the counties with less than 65,000 people.These totals can be found if you filter by county.

	<TEXT> I am willing to revel my bias and am definitely rooting for him. I just don't know if he can pull it off. The polls aren't moving at all in FL. My guess is a lot of older people voting for Trump.

If he can win next week that would be awesome and he could win the whole thing or at least broker the convention. I just don't know if it could happen. 

The only way I see him staying in after next week if he loses is to try and win California. I think he has the best shot their and I think that would give him some sway. I just don't know how his campaign sees it. </TEXT>

Trump was supposed to win Idaho last night and didn't. My guess is it had something to do with Romney.
