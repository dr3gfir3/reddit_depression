	<TEXT> I abosuletely agree with Schumer on this one. I'm a libertarian but I want to see people like Bernie get elected so the dialogue is possible between both sides. That kind of governing leads to finding best solutions, at least I think so. For example if one side wants to regulate anything and other wants to regulate nothing, it will lead to best case of regulations, where some things are heavily under federal government and others are left to people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see in comments that myth of blue and red states is still alive. Well,  particular state economy position doesn't really matter if it is blue or red.  California is a great economy and a great state but not just due to liberal policies. There are plenty of others factors.
