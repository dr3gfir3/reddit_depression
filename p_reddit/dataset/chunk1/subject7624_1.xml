	<TEXT> Not really. In my experience 15 years here, not once has anyone broken out a board game at a home gathering or otherwise. That said, Go and Shogi sure have their following. The Chinese game of mah-jong seems to be popular too, as well as hanafuda, with a re-emergence due to some popular anime film.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just to reiterate how out of touch with the world I am, I had no clue this was happening. I also went to the grocery store last night (yes, I live in Tokyo) and didn't notice a great section of the snack aisle being empty. Maybe this is a localized phenomenon? But to be fair, I don't eat potato chips regularly. Maybe if I did I would be panicking right now, too. </TEXT>

I have very bad flexibility in my calves - in fact I can barely keep my body at a 90-degree angle when I am sitting up. Is this something that can be remedied with the downward facing dog? How should I approach this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those are common posts, but it's not like they're up there for karma - those are people who really want to talk about those issues. Our whole lot didn't choose to become CF at the same time, nor did they join the sub at the same time. Most of those are people who really want to hear others' opinions, and sometimes it's cathartic to type out their own opinions out after mulling it out for a period.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Japanese. I like pretty much everything about the culture, at least compared to my own boring country. Plus it's so complicated and layered. There's something for everyone, even a weirdo like me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's an international / regional distribution license problem. These days Netflix is trying to create multiple versions more attuned to each country.    
As a side note, it sucks for those of us living abroad, because they are not releasing the same content worldwide (we can't enjoy what our friends in the States are enjoying and vice-versa). I understand the distribution and language barriers, and of course I know that we expats are a negligible share of the market and we don't count, but it still sucks. </TEXT>
