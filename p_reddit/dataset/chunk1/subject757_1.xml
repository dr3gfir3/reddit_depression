	<TEXT> I think you're going to end up disappointed. Trump will be a lot of things, but "fried" likely won't be one of them. He's styling himself after some of the great names in history and he's about to kick off the 9th crusade and take some land back for Israel. 

Nothing you think is important now will even be on your mind in a few months. 

Mr Toad's about to take us on a very wild ride. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone's got to start somewhere. I too remember what it was like to simply accept globalism as the obvious future, but I was doing this without real examination. 

There are common phases that people go through. One of the first is to start digging into the sources for your information. As an example, you see a headline that says "Republicans gut ethics committee because they are evil"... you can stop reading right there. You already know what it says. Your next search is to find said bill and actually read it. Once you read it, you can learn who was behind it and quite often, they will have said publicly exactly what and why they were doing. Yep, sometimes they'll just come right and say it...and it might even make sense given the circumstances they were facing. 

But maybe they don't just come right out and say it. But know that nothing happens accidentally; things only happen because someone wants them to happen and is applying force in such a way that they do happen. So you need to dig a little deeper, maybe into some "alternative news" sites, forums, etc... and examine the information that you find there. Any obvious theories on the real back story? 

Maybe, maybe not. Regardless, at this point, you, informed human, can come to your own conclusion on the event that occurred and if you do this for long enough, you will start to see patterns... and they aren't down party lines.

Good luck on your journey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In WoW, you have two sides, Alliance and Horde, that cannot talk to each other in game but can understand players on their own side. When you /say or /yell something, it's visible to everyone though so when someone from the opposite side saw the words it would come across with a subtitle of the language and converted to "gibberish", e.g.,

[Player 1 - Horde] Gonna kick some ass!

might be seen as:

[Player -1] [Orcish] Lok-Narash Nogah Kagg Gul!

Anyway, the entire point is that when a Horde player typed "KEK", the Alliance player saw "LOL". 

KEK=LOL

Then KEK begins to just be used in place of LOL on 4chan and other places and then eventually ascends to be a God...presumably where /u/Jack41096's response kicks in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. This seems to have become a partisan issue for an ambitious prosecutor. 

Here's the [original law](http://law.onecle.com/california/penal/647.html). The [bill](http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201520160SB1322) makes more sense in context. 

Now that we are just dealing with the facts, please tell me how convicting victimized children for the crimes of their pimps and giving them criminal records is supposed to help them.

Nothing is stopping the police from picking up an unaccompanied minor an putting them into the system (where they are likely to be abused again, but that's a separate problem). This only removes the misdemeanor from the minor and I fail to see how that is a bad thing.

I'm a frontline pizzagater and I want to see the pedo's hang...victimizing victims isn't on the agenda. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I absolutely know of the allegations. I do appreciate your thoughtful reply also. Unfortunately, linking Snopes isn't going to bolster the story. 

The claims lay with all the others the democrats threw at him that all magically disappeared after the election. The smarmy lawyer knew she was risking her license by pushing too hard and is dangerously close to libel so she pulled everything back. 

As the hearsay goes, Epstain was also banned from Mar-a-Lago once Trump realized he was an actual pedo. So without more, we got nothing except rehashing the same tired story that lacks evidence and a victim.

	<TEXT> It wouldn't be American, but I'm tempted to suggest let the parents decide. 

Unfortunately, the parent is often the worst offender. Also tough when 1/3 of the offenders are juvenile themselves. 

This is a real issue without a simple fix. Some percentage of the population is pre-dispositioned to cause harm to those that cannot defend themselves. It has always been that way and always will be. 

We can't round them all up and kill them, technology will always provide a semi-safe haven for them and the sick parents will always push the envelop forward in the abuse of their own children.

Maybe an fast-track death penalty is the best deterrent given our lack of options to deal with, or even understand the problem.

	<TEXT> "Article's" sources: Washington Post, Huffington Post, Gizmodo, Slate...

If my 6th grader was doing a book report, I would be okay with this work. Meanwhile, the primary source for the article, Washington Post, uses two Washington Post "articles" as sources for the article, which continue to just source more Washington Post articles as their sources until we get to:  
"a senior U.S. official briefed on an intelligence presentation made to U.S. senators" as the root source, which is no source at all. 

This is literally one story with no evidence and no new updates that continues to get reposted over and over and over again.

Examples where it hasn't failed yet include countries like Finland and Denmark that are rich and have been resistant to immigration.
