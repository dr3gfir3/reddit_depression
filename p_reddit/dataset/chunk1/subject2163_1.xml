	<TEXT> Why not just remove the nearby window completely then? I'd rather not see Pokemon that I won't be able to catch and just have Pokemon randomly pop up. I remember walking around my local park for hours tracking Pokemon but now I'll open the app whenever I have free time. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like everyone else is saying, work on your flexibility and core strength. It looks like you're comfortable in a low bar squat.

Try doing barbell rollouts and reverse kettle bell crunches to strengthen your core. </TEXT>
