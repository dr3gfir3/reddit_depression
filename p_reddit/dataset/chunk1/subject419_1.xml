	<TITLE> Problem with someone in my group </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-21 23:07:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Iv just had my first session with a new group from roll20 today, went pretty good except for 1 person. I have described his actions to myself as backseat dming. 

My problem is I found him too bossy and obnoxious. He never let anyone else speak and kept trying to make peoples decisions for them. At one point he was moving everyone's tokens to where he wanted them without asking. The DM did change it so we could only move our own tokens after that. 

He was also telling people to roll for certain things and taking over telling the story from the DM. Basically he kinds ruined it for me. Does anyone have any advice on what I can do about this? Is this normal behaviour and I'm just over reacting? Please help! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> OK so just a month ago now I had an emergency ileostomy due to a bowel perforation and had peritonitis and a 3 day coma and a generally rough time. Iv been home about 2 weeks now and starting to think about becoming more active when I am fully healed. I'm having s bit of a problem with security though, I.e. I think my stoma is quite high and I don't know what to do with it in public. How will it hold up to cycling and swimming and running and stuff? What about walks where there will be no access to toilets all day? 

I'm sorry for a bit of a text wall but I kinda feel like I have no one I can talk to and have no idea what I'm doing and frankly I am terrified </TEXT>
