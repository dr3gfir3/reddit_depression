	<TEXT> Over the last few months I have found myself becoming more and more interested in studying philosophy. I have run into some roadblocks of where to start. I have heard three ways of starting. 1. Start at the very beginning with the Greek Philosophers (i.e. Plato, Aristotle). 2. Start with the most accessible/most readable philosophy books. 3. Start with the most interesting philosophy books. I am wondering which of these paths I should follow. I am also curious as to which books are the easiest to start out with. Thank you for your suggestions ahead of time.

	<TEXT> I read that earlier in the summer. A lot of Kafka's stories are a lot funnier than people give him credit for.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **White Noise, by Don DeLillo**
I was told it was a great book and also a great introduction into postmodernism. I started reading it months ago but had to return it to my university's library before I could finish it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I will admit being an atheist used to make me sad. For most of my life I selfishly believed in an afterlife that would preserve my mind after death. Even when I was an agnostic, I still held onto this notion of the afterlife. But after doing some deep thinking and reading some books on atheism (notably "The God Delusion" and "God is not Great") I realized that the afterlife is a myth but that is not exactly as bad a thing as I thought it would be. I feel now that I have been lucky enough to be born and given a chance to experience life. While the ending is not pleasant, I know every moment leading up to it I will celebrating and enjoying life. Sometimes the end makes you enjoy the journey more.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Steppenwolf is full of breath taking lines. The one that I always loved (and have made my Instagram bio quote) is "Eternity is a mere moment, just long enough for a joke".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> During my freshman year of college I re-read The Great Gatsby and The Catcher in the Rye. I have a good memory so I thought I was not going to enjoy them as well as I did when I was a sophomore in high school reading them. Upon re-reading I was shocked by how "different" they were from how I remembered them. I think everyone has this revelation of how much they have grown up when they re-do something they did years ago. Back to the books. The Great Gatsby fell in comparison to the other Fitzgerald novels I had read earlier in the year (namely This Side of Paradise). The Catcher in the Rye was interesting because its feelings of social isolation were still there but its general feel did not strike me as much as it used to.  </TEXT>
