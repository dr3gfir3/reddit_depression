	<TEXT> You can get them in pretty much any bookshop, or even supermarket. As a Muslim, I'm glad you chose this as something to purchase, I'll even happily give you one, but at the same time, we don't like it to just be left around as an ornament or decoration. If you want a dual language one (I appreciate these don't look as exotic) then it would be awesome if you could at least read a few passages at least as a sign of respect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the UK there's a "democracy", and one of the longest standing in the world. However, each party when elected, is only interested in the next 4 years; they aren't interested in REAL long term change. Whereas somewhere like Dubai has a ruler who wants to see the Emirate prosper in 10, 20, 40 years time also. </TEXT>

Those whose commit acts of terrorism generally come from either broken families, or from backgrounds with some socio-economic issue. They are generally angry youths, often uneducated and more exposed to western entertainment glamorising violence (movies/games) than they are from a pious, spiritual background. Their motivation is often created by their situation rather than their religious beliefs. They simply find some convenient internal justification through the guise of religion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> his metaphor implied a creationist would take issue with evoloution but this isn't the case. I concede it was used as an example, and admit that I used it as a platform to clarify this common misconception of science and religion being incompatible. But I don't believe I habitually "like to bust out that statement" nor do I believe it was any more unnecessary than Reddit itself. All good l, bro! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But ice melting doesn't raise sea levels...  
If you have a block of ice in water, it sticks out the top, that's because it's less dense than water. This includes the bit above and below the water level. As it melts, the density equalises above AND below the water, so the frozen stuff below the water level now has less volume, and thus the level is maintained.  
That's not to ignore the other catastrophic effects of climate change.

	<TEXT> Isn't that the idea of becoming rich? That things are relatively cheap. Next you'll want to charge poor people less for utilities. If everything is calculated as a percentage of your wealth, then wealth is irrelevant. Not a bad idea, but doesn't fit in well with capitalism. Hmm... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I totally agree with you here. Whilst I concede that I may be an idealist, you must admit that should people (all over the world) cease to enlist themselves in armed forces, then we can snatch back a massive amount of leverage over these "powers in control".  
The world is in such a mess that it's a case of "you drop your gun first". But if we, the common people, stop fighting all together, then the corrupt will be powerless.  
There is not a force in the world that genuinely defends freedom against tyranny. Because the tyranny is always the other guy.  
Peace and love, man. </TEXT>

I'm Russian.  
Thanks.  
The idea of an enemy is often manufactured.  
In the world wars there were many reports of "enemy" fighters sharing times of leisure; famously the Christmas day football game. The "enemy" is just like you. If you put yourself in the "enemy's" shoes, you will most likely have done exactly the same as them and most would rather not be fighting (leaving only the 4th category). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ideologically speaking, no we'd not have an army. However, in the absence of utopia, then actually the best army would be populated with those who do not wish to be in it.  
It's a sad truth that those who WANT to join forces (police, army etc) are usually the least suited to bear that responsibility.  
I don't disagree with an army, but I fail to see why someone in their right mind would WANT to enlist. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The burden placed upon soldiers

If they sign up outside conscription, then it's hard to be sympathetic. I know it sounds harsh, and they probably have a really shitty time dealing with it and can't imagine how I'd deal with it. But surely one knows that it's horrific when you sign up, right? You are effectively volunteering to take the lives of others. I know I'll get downvoted to hell, but this world needs fewer fighters killing people. It's terrible that even those that survive combat, come home and take their own lives. Something's really wrong worth the world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. Killing civillians is always wrong. I was merely putting into perspective the numbers of people killed. What's terrible is that US veterans are killing THEMSELVES after having gone into combat. It's so sad. There is so little regard for those in power for us little people (who don't even really want to fight).
