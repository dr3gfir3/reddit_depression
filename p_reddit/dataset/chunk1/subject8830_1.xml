	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Food assistance: Would Jesus dictate what foods could be bought?
(Of course he would probably cook for them instead, but the government cannot afford to make meals for all people who receive assistance)

Healthcare: If Jesus was a doctor, instead of carpenter, would he charge to heal people? Would he be against universal healthcare?

Wages: Would Jesus not pay his workers enough to feed and shelter themselves while he keeps huge profits?

I'm looking for serious dialogue about how you think Jesus would have us handle these, or other, economic issues in today's world. Faith healing and miraculous dividing of food is not a realistic answer. Humans cannot do these things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few months back I told one of our journeyman that he should turn in his card, which, coming from an apprentice, was completely out of line. It festered in me until last week when I apologized. He said he didn't even remember me saying it, but that wasn't the point.

The point is, we all do things that are out of line, disrespectful, hurtful, etc. and if you haven't apologized recently, well, maybe you are a Saint...but probably not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I read a comment on Reddit telling someone they might like Stephen Baxter's NASA trilogy and ordered all three. The original thread was about the Odyssey books and expected something comparable, but halfway through book 1 I'm wanting to gouge my eyes out. So boring! It looks like book 2 is similar and no real action happens till book 3, but that may be just as technically eye-gouging. I thought Time ships might be better, but saw a review that made me think twice about that too. Any suggestions? Or should I just move on? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have 2 that come to mind. The first is A Tale of Two Cities. I started it while I was backpacking Europe in 2001, but found it quite boring. Though the main reason for not finishing it was having to look up definitions of archaic words in the back every page or two. More recently, I saw a Redditor suggest Voyage by Stephan Baxter. I was over zealous and ordered it and its two sequels. 300 pages into the 600 page book and I finally read the wiki summary on it only to find out it is a "hard science fiction" book. WTF does that mean you ask? It means it's boring! Full of a lot of unexciting build up to no big climax. The second one sounds better, but I switched to the Space Odyssey series which had me hooked a couple pages in. We'll see if I get back to Baxter's trilogy. </TEXT>
