	<TITLE> Stubborn Westie </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I obviously love my Westie more than anything - but wondering if anyone else has these issues and solutions -

Abbey just turned 4 and every night she jumps off of our bed - then whines to get back up in the middle of the night. This happens about three times a night (when she used to sleep through the night). We put a bench at the end of the bed and are trying to bribe her with treats - she does it just fine on her own when we're not there but not in the middle of the night.

Also on walks - she'll beg to go - but puts the "brakes" on multiple times if we're walking through the neighborhood - but can hike just fine for 3 plus miles.

Anyone else deal with this? Westie tips appreciated!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thoughts on Lafayette - many people are priced out of Moraga and Orinda, cute downtown with newer restaurants, shops - still close to shopping in Walnut Creek and a bit closer to jobs in Oakland and the city... overpriced though </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the insights! So many mixed reviews... I guess the bottom line is no one knows for sure (obviously). It's just scary to potentially get in at the top, and crazy how much prices have increased over the past few years. Seems over-inflated. Although they could just keep going up. It is the best place in the world to live - just have to keep reminding myself that! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What do you guys think - I keep hearing the tech bubble is bursting. Do you think that will have a widespread impact on real estate prices across the Bay Area? I keep hearing mixed reports. Wondering if I should take the plunge now, or keep waiting it out! </TEXT>
