	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ***FINAL EDIT: HOLY SHIT NO ONE GIVES A FUCK ABOUT NECROCHASM!!!!***

**DPS TABLE AT BOTTOM**

For anyone interested in this new exotic, I noted the damage I was doing on today's daily with all my auto rifles.  I include my own fire rate times below too measured using stopwatch averaged over 5 times.  I intend to convert it to DPS but am too lazy this very moment, so I'll edit it in if people are interested in these numbers.

**The numbers below are 1 bullet's worth of damage from a 32 warlock shooting a 30 goblin.  The upper number is the upper threshold of damage caused by the perks/fire method in the third column.**


Attack | Name | Perks | Body shot (DMG) | Critical Shot (DMG) | Fire Rate | Notes 
--------|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|--------|
339 | Necrochasm | | 80 | 198 | 14.84 bullets/s | explosion does a static amount of damage unlike Firefly, processes about 2/3 the time.  Something around ~928 damage
331 | Abyss Defiant | ADS using Focus Fire | 140 | 348 | 5.81 bullets/s |
331 | Vanquisher VIII | Crowd Control | 142 - 163 | 353 - 406 | 7.46 bullets/s |
323 | Vex Mythoclast | Crowd Control | 175 - 201 | 523 - 605 | 6.02 shots/s | Melty
312 | SUROS Regime | ADS with Focus Fire | 193 - 292 | 456 - 730 | 4.88 bullets/s | Only at 312 Attack.  
302 | Hard Light | | 97 | 242 | 10.04 bullets/s | Virgin gun.  Sorry hard light I swear I'll upgrade you
300 | Atheon's Epilogue | Glass Half Full | 61 - 65 | 152 - 162 | 15.35 bullets/s |


Again, ranges indicate lower threshold (minimum) and upper threshold (maximum) of the gun's damage based on the perks.

Attack | Name | Body DPS | Crit DPS | Average DPS
--------|--------|-------|-------------|---------------|--------------------|--------|
339 | Necrochasm | 1187.20 DMG/s | 2938.32 DMG/s |  ?
331 | Abyss Defiant | 813.4 DMG/s | 2021.88 DMG/s | ?
331 | Vanquisher VIII | 1059.32 - 1141.38 DMG/s | 2633.88 - 3026.78 DMG/s | ?
323 | Vex Mythoclast | 1053.50 - 1210.02 DMG/s | 3148.46 DMG/s - 3642.10 DMG/s | ?
312 | SUROS Regime | 941.84 - 1424.96 DMG/s | 2225.28 - 3562.40 DMG/s | ?
302 | Hard Light | 973.88 DMG/s | 2429.68 DMG/s | ?
300 | Atheon's Epilogue | 936.35 - 997.75 DMG/s | 2333.20 - 2486.70 DMG/s | ?


And here's a short gameplay video of it: http://xboxclips.com/viccaro/6a518b4c-3cd1-468a-ba5b-d34e2326c87c

If anyone has any additional ARs they have damage stats for that want to add to the table, please share.

EDIT: added DPS table.  sorted both tables by attack. looks like Vex still does the most damage although if my Suros was 331, it's upper threshold crit would hurdle it over the Vex.  If anyone has improvements on this data post a comment  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Shameless self-pity thread.  Wanted to reroll my Titan.  Forgot to check inventory before deleting him (apparently).. went to go buy stuff from Xur just now, and have none of it.  So here's what I lost:

* 1528 Weapon Parts
* 252 Ascendant Energies
* 120 Ascendant Shards
* 18 Radiant Energies
* 6 Radiant Shards
* 500 Plasteel plating
* 60 strange coins
* 25 motes of light

edit--
* 8 exotic shards
* 100+ planetary mats of each (eh whatever)
* 30 resupply codes.. grr!

	<TEXT> At least the first one.

After the first cutscene where you are flying through the ship graveyard and gain 2 friendly Awoken escorts, the game loads another cutscene where you are meeting with the Queen.  It also shows a saving/loading indicator in the bottom right that something is happening during the transition between these 2 cutscenes, so I decided to test for science if you could just go to "Change Character" from there.  I logged right back in and the next few Venus missions were unlocked, so it works.

I did search and didn't find this posted outside of the "you can skip the 30 second countdown" SGAs and it was news to me </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> These may be getting more and more boring each and every time a solo Guardian extinguishes Crota, but after hours of wrestling with the oversized blue bastard that the Hive call a godgetting him to a sliver of health only to have him enrageI finally bested Crota with my warlock, feel all proud and stuff, and wanted to share the video.  Most especially because of my ogre strategy, wondering if anyone else tackles them this way..

This video misses my first sword because of Xbox DVR constraints, but I took him down the first time using fusion grenades and Touch of Flame to save heavy ammo.  The video picks up as I attack the second swordbearer.  Watch out for 3rd swordbearer, where Crota doesn't go down to 2 Gjallarhorns and forces some improvisation.

EDIT: well update since i just hit 32 on my hunter.. better video from *first* sword, same strategy, no mistakes:

	<TEXT> This may be common sense or such obvious advice that I couldn't turn anything up in search, but I figured I'd post it anyways.  Heavy ammo synth is overpriced, so what's a poor Guardian to do when faced with Juggler?

* 1) Shoot rocket at mob from distance
* 2) Switch to primary immediately before rocket hits
* 3) Watch it rain purple ammo (or be smited by the RNGod of Ammo)

Happy reset day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> ...they are the last link in the The Dark Below's quest chain.  



From the very start of the story through to the end, you face off against Omnigul a number of times in a number of different ways.  You only get to ultimately try to kill her in the new strike.

If this is common knowledge then happily ignore this post.  I did do some searching but didn't see it mentioned. And judging from the uproar about it, and the fact that there *IS* even SGA about how to unlock the weekly, makes me think it is not.  It is obvious, once you complete the chain of bounties, that the weekly strikes had to be locked since they are the endgame of the DLC's story (besides the raid, not sure how that ties in, havent done it yet).

Bungie used the weekly strikes as a vehicle for the last link in the story.  It was not done to passive-aggressively force you to spend $20.00 to continue playing what I imagine is one of your favorite games (to be on this sub), Bungie is just merely utilizing the platform they built.

	<TEXT> Late day work musings...

I am sad to say I have not once yet stumbled upon any of you on Destiny.. obviously it is granted that 1) not all of you are on XB1 and 2) it is a massive game with a huge population of players that gets split up regionally often...  but still.  I even teamed up with a group from /r/fireteams last night for the HM raid, but only the person that invited me was from reddit.

Anyways, just curious, anyone see each other out in the wild?  What percentage of players on Destiny also frequent this sub, or is it just too low to matter? </TEXT>

This game really wants me to be a hunter I guess.  Can't get an exotic helm/raid helm to save my light for my would-be-30 Titan but do have 4 exotics and 2 legendaries for a hunter.  Ugh.  Anyone else in a similar spot?  Not complaining per se though, as I just made a hunter and once he hits 20 he'll almost be decked out.

	<TITLE> Thought for VoG secret chests: Equip raid class items? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-10 15:32:33 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Last night on Hard Mode the raid group I was in was doing some exploring on the jumping puzzle, and encountered a secret cave room.  If you go to the left when you first spawn, past the jumping platforms, you come to a rock tunnel that leads to a cliff.  About 200 feet below is a platform that spawns.. when you hear it, you can free fall, and you'll land on it.  It takes you to the secret room.. and you can see the Broken Timegate from there, as well.  I have no pictures but the guys I was with got some videos, hopefully i can get them to post here with them.

We obviously spawned no chest, but were speculating on how a conditional chest could appear there.  Since then I had a thought that I haven't seen, I think, anyone try.  So I'll ask.. has anyone tried conditional things in that area with the Raid class items equipped?  Would if the entire team needs to have their cloak, bond, or mark from the raid equipped?  Anyone try this yet? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> PSA: Ammo Synthesis does not work if you have a full consumable inventory </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-10-31 21:45:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I keep seeing people reporting this bug on this subreddit, yet the fix is known.  If you have a full consumable inventory, your ammo synthesis, be it primary, special, or heavy, will not work.  It will consume the synth pack and give you 0 ammo and the fun 5 minute cooldown timer.

So, have at least 1 consumable slot open before using a synthesis pack!

That is all.  Hope this prevents future posts and helps anyone still struggling with this.. it has been the cause of certain death in many a raid. </TEXT>
