	<TEXT> That's some good information there. So far I've only dealt with two suppliers, Monarch and Bullion Direct. I was extremely happy with Monarch but not so much on BD. I'll probably give Westminster a shot and get a few generics although Monarch is most likely going to be my primary supplier  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for you're opinion. I actually did see that post a while back, however I'm more looking for opinions about their generic bullion and not so much about the company itself, as I have heard good things about them.

I do own a tube of buffalo's and those are no-named, however I was under the impression that they are well known and I would have no problem reselling when the time came. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Has anyone ever dealt with Westminster Mint's Silver Bullion? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I only ask this because I noticed they have very good prices. They have a large selection of silver rounds in some pretty nice looking designs, and as of right now are only about $1 over spot. I'm hesitiant, however, because there are no mint markings or anything showing where the silver came from and who minted it. Would you trust those rounds, does anyone already own any and can vouch for them?

	<TITLE> Casting/Selling Home Poured Silver, Could Use Some Advice! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-27 01:34:12 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, I have a question or two. By trade, I am a Graphic Designer and 3D Modeler. I'd like to integrate my skills with one of my hobbies, Silver hoarding!

I have been looking into pouring my own silver bars for some time now and have access to all the equipment needed, including a CNC mill (for making custom molds) for more intricate pieces down the line. For now I'm planning on just doing simple hand poured, hand stamped bars of varying weights. I am getting a custom stamp with my logo, as well as a set of alphanumeric stamps.

My question is this: Is it worth all the effort to buy .999 silver shot for pennies over spot and then casting my own bars and products to sell? And also, is it legal for me to stamp them with .999FS and the weight. I won't be changing the purity, just melting and pouring. Is this something people would buy, or not really?

Any advice or suggestions would be appreciated. Thanks!

	<TEXT> Thanks for all the advice. By using viewport 2.0 exclusively I was able to fix the issue. Guess ill have to get used to 2.0 after using the default viewport since Maya 8!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently upgraded to 2014 and have noticed a problem and was wondering if anyone else had the same issue and if there was a fix. 

Whenever I try using the new modeling toolkit, my mesh will turn Transparant and look almost X-rayed. However none of those options are selected in the viewport and there is no way other than closing and reppening the software to fix it. Any suggestions? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's a U-2 aircraft, most likely landing at Beale AFB in California. Those planes resist landing so the pilot has to stall the aircraft in a controlled crash to land it. The chase car is in radio contact with the pilots and once it touches down, two "pogo stick" wheels are placed on the wings so that it can taxi, since the only wheels on it are the two down the center of the fuselage. </TEXT>
