	<TEXT> If you have a look at the post and many of the comments over in r/exmormon, you'll see that many parents who share custody with church members oppose the private interviews and have had requests ignored before to be present during interviews. 

Also, if you listen to the recording, the Bishop basically tells the dad that if he doesn't let his son do the interviews, and his son dies in a car accident, his son might go to hell.

That kind of manipulation is disgusting. Asking 8 year olds if they touch themselves is disgusting.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi! I can relate, as healthcare and education are two **huge** issues for me as well. Hell, I voted for Bernie largely because I thought his plans for the two were refreshing. 

However, Bernie did not win. 

My next three huge issues? War, freedom (whether it be CJ reform, MJ legalization, reproductive rights or lgbt rights), and ethics. 

When it comes to war, Johnson and Weld recognize, just as Bernie does, that interventionist, regime change wars have to stop. 

When it comes to all the social issues, Johnson and Weld are on board. 

When it comes to ethics and integrity, Johnson and Weld are spotless compared to Clinton and Trump.

I'm voting for Johnson and Weld because I agree more with them, not because they are perfect.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several years ago, I spent a lot of time with the Twelve Tribes. They built a Yellow Deli in the city closest to me, and I became close friends with many of their members who worked in the deli. 

Even went to one of their weddings and slept in their bus. They have a cool boat, too. 

I witnessed them spanking their children with a rod like object, but honestly the verbal and psychological abuse was more traumatic, in my view. As the child was being disciplined, the parent would say things like "you will submit to my will/god's will," etc. The whole thing was very creepy. 

A few of the people I knew eventually left the cult, and subsequently told me of molestation stories, etc. For the most part, everyone agreed that overall the "communities" are safe, but it's largely dependent on who your parents are. Just like in the real world, some parents are shit, some parents are great. In a cult, having shit parent is more dangerous though :( </TEXT>

People on the right endlessly rail against "government takeover of healthcare" while at the same time constantly passing laws trying to dictate what medical procedures (and medication) women can get, and how and when said women can get access to them. The contradictions are glaring.  </TEXT>

Do you agree that those within the church who rail against moral relativism are hypocrites? 

For example, if plural marriage was ok back in the day, but it's not now, that's moral relativism, as the only difference is time period and the opinion of 13 men who you already agree have made a shit ton of mistakes.

Yet church members will often rail against gay marriage, calling it moral relativism. 

What say you? </TEXT>

In D C 132, which Joseph Smith himself gave as "revelation from God" about how plural marriage was supposed to be practiced, he said that men were not to take plural wives who were already vowed (married) or who weren't virgins. Joseph Smith married both women who had already been married and women who were not virgins.

Hell, he even married a woman and her daughter, which is prohibited in the old testament.

How can you consider him to be a prophet when he broke the very rules he gave and claimed were from God?
