	<TEXT> Edit your opponent's turns, even if you commentate during it. You can't see their hand, and you're not at a high (low?) rank to consistently see class archetypes.

You lost your first game. It happens, but why show that off first? The point of a tempo deck is to play on curve while maintaining board control. You lose card advantage by wasting removal, which tells me you don't know how to play the deck well. You need more practice with it, and some of your commentary should point out what the opponent might do, and how you'll get around that. 

Sometimes decks don't have a good answer, but still achieve their win conditions. Your commentary was mostly play by play, which can already be seen on screen.

A decklist would also be useful to have on an overlay.

Hearthstone is F2P so you'll have to ask yourself, "Would people (who have it) rather watch me or play the game?" </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Listing ingredients (and the amount) in the video description could be helpful, not only for people to quickly copy and paste shopping lists, but to search for recipes using similar ingredients.

Having info about budget, prep time, and time estimates for each step (e.g. saute for about two minutes) can also be helpful; I'm one of those people who has no clue when something is under/over/perfectly cooked.

Drinks would also be great. Thai tea and bubble tea are awesome. Is it practical to make it yourself like smoothies/milkshakes? This would be something I'd look to know.

The visuals and tips are definitely effective in making me want to cook Thai instead of just ordering out. </TEXT>
