	<TEXT> You assume I have selfish gains. I'm simply sharing and it riddles my mind why that concept is so hard for some people to believe. There is a such thing of seeking help and documenting what goes on in one's house with the hopes of sharing it with others while help arrives. You're telling me if you're stranded on a deserted island you're not going to try to learn the in's and outs of the island till help arrives?  What if help never arrives and its just you forever.  What then?  Documenting everything in one's house down to the day of the week it transpires is what true paranormal investigators tell you to do.  It's impossible to memorize every event especially since the new events supersede the old.  In this field were inconsistency is severely frowned upon and where peopel scream fake and hoax more than they try to sincerely analyze something its a wonder why a community like this exists. No one's trying to fool anyone?  I'm not here to make you believe. I'm here to share what little I've captured while living in the house I now live in. No more no less. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's mischievous, and definitely malevolent.  We tried asking for stuff back. Stuff never comes back. Stuff we never owned, i.e. previous tenants stuff come back. Two Bibles are missing. Two crosses are missing. A Virgin Mary statue left by the Priest is missing.  24/7 hour surveillance with house cams finally caught the apparition in the doorway.  http://i299.photobucket.com/albums/mm305/subject1320/Stafford%20Way/Apparition_Bedroom_2015.jpg </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Missing Cross (Gone for a Week) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-20 16:51:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The events of this day will always be remembered because it was the weekend Captain America the Winter Soldier came out. April 2014 - I believe the 1st weekend of.

A month prior to this movie premier my cousin from Dallas came to visit.  Elementary school teacher Dallas sub-urb. Devout Christian. She was in the know of our paranormal events and decided to bring with her a wooden-metallic cross. Written on the cross itself were the verses Joshua 1:9, Phil 4:13, Psalm 28:7 and Matt 19:26 summation "Strength."  

Cross was prayed over and immediately hung in our bedroom at the time - the 3rd most active place of the house BUT being the place were we slept and layed our head. A cross positioned high upon the wall seemed accurate.

A week or so before the Capt America movie came out the cross went missing. (Keep in mind I'm only referring Capt America because the same weekend it came out is [b]also the same day I was going to see it.[/b]) So a week before the cross went missing. And missing objects in our home is not new. Things get taken all the time. Sometimes they return. Sometimes they don't.. The items that do return never get returned in the place they were taken. This cross would be no exception.  

We noticed it missing the morning we woke up . Other religious objects had been taken before and with the house being severely active and etc friends, family and clergy all advised us to display our belief system openly as a means of riding the home of negative spirits.  I'm a Christian. I wouldn't call myself a devout Christian but a believer non-the-less.

So the cross is gone. Its missing. Girlfriend and myself at this stage gave up the notion of even looking for it after all it was gift from my cousin, a spiritual  gift at that, a gift from the heart, no one else lived with us and objects get taken all the time, and items we eagerly search for never come back.  

Now its Saturday morning (movie day) and the cross has been gone for a few days and like most typical Saturdays in my house its laundry day. By 11am I'm doing my laundry because in a few hours I'm going to leave and go meet one of my best friends for drinks and movies.  The guys, us geeks if you will are descending into Bellevue WA to watch the Capt American Winter Soldier movie  GF doesn't get into stuff like that but I do. us guys do.

I began my first load of laundry - colored clothing. GF, Tina is to and fro around the house doing her own thing. While my clothes is washing I decide to go into my office and watch TV, work on my PC , post in forums like this in search for answers to our Poltergeist problem. 

About an hour later I notice something peculiar. My 1st load of clothing is still washing. Now I know there are long wash cycles but this was weird my brain knows how long it takes for my clothes to wash. So I'm in my office and I glance towards the wash room hoping to here the beep beep beep, the noise the washing makes  it's done.  Clothes don't wash for an hour, esp my clothes, esp a light load of clothing. So I glance at the wash room and sort of look at the time on my PC toolbar and raise an eye brow and after that I mentally shrug it off and keep working. A few minutes later I hear this knocking sound, banging, knocking. You know the sound the washing machine or dryer makes when you have shoes or a big object in it. So I hear this noise and its clearly coming from the washing machine - and once again I glance up from my PC and turn to face the washing machine or wash room I should say. Now in my mind I'm thinking - that sound wasn't there before?  All I put in the washing machine was clothing. Coins, chap stick, keys, etc wouldn't make that noise. And even if it did those sounds would have been heard almost immediately. At this point the cycle had run near to over an hour. So why the loud noises now?  Now normally I would get up. Walk to the washing machine and open and see what the commotion is about. But something prevented that idea from crossing my mind in that I was either pre-occupied on my PC or pre-occupied watching TV. It was very uncharacteristic of me to not stop what I was doing and investigate.  Looking back and reliving the moment, It felt weird for me to not get up and investigate the noise esp with the previous events happening in this house. I acknowledged the noise and length of time it was taking for that load to complete and stayed in my office.

A few minutes later the washing machine finally beeps informing me that the load is complete. Few minutes after the beep I get up and go to the washing machine to remove my clothes from washing machine to the dryer. As I'm pulling out clothes and tossing them into the dryer (few inches away) I immediately grab something solid. Not clothing. Not shoes. Not anything except a metallic-wooden cross. I didn't know what it was until I pulled it out of the washing machine.

There in my hand, wet and etc. Was the missing cross my cousin gave me.  Two key points I want to make before I submit this story to you (which is 100% true). Some will say "well maybe the cross was already in there to begin with."  Not so. As I mentioned above the bang, knocking noise, the noise we all are familiar with-those who have done laundry-where large objects i.e. shoe, etc are in the machine. The noise would have been heard early on, esp during the spin cycle. The knocking noises I heard began 15 minutes before the washing was complete. When my machine is done it beeps.  And also the washing machine was empty when I filled it with my clothing.  Some might say well maybe you put the cross in the machine when you loaded it up with clothes. Nope. It was a colored clothing(Machine Wash COLD/WARM).  I sorted my clothing carefully meaning items go into the machine almost one by one. A cross this size is not going to be grabbed by mistake.  

Someone will also say well maybe your GF put the cross in the machine.  My GF was not even near the washing machine. I never left my office. The washroom sits right outside my office.  And she wouldn't stop my wash load regardless.  I do my laundry and she does hers.

I had to get those particulars out the way because I know how some people like to gravitate to the obvious.  And that understandable but allow me to paint the picture near perfect as possible because it even hasn't began to get weird yet.  In my hand is the cross my cousin gave me. Its wet and broken (see pic below).  I then call my girlfriend and when she comes to the hallway we both examine the cross top to bottom.  It had been taken the week before. About 4-5 days prior.

Like I said before this would not be the 1st, 2nd , or 3rd time something like this has happened in my house. Now you see the reason why we're displaying the religious objects is because of the stuff happening before, during, and after this cross went missing.  Interesting enough after I glued this cross back together and placed it back in its original spot. It would be taken a few more times. Never re-appeared in the washing machine again though. 

The other tricks the Poltergeists did or would do with this same cross I will share later on.  This is a forum for sharing Ghost encounters or Paranormal experiences. So I'm sharing.  

Below are two pics.

One pic shows the cross as it looks like when hanging in our bedroom.  The second pic you see is of the cross after it was taken out of the washing machine. Pic is literally seconds after that event had happened.

[u]The Paranormal Group B.U.M.P.S[/u]
and its founder Kyle can attest to the events of this story and others as his team was called soon after
to investigate.

I felt like sharing this. I have my theories to how all of this transpired. 

But I'm eager to hear your response and theory before I offer a few of mine.

this post will alert trolls. But I'm hoping some intellectuals in the paranormal field and those who think outside the box find there way here as well.

	<TEXT> thats all they are are opinions. Opinions from skeptics/scenic who think all re-counts of an individuals experience is fake until evidence is shown that proves other wise. 99% of them are not even investigators but more so Ghost Enthusiasts who view the subject matter scenically anyways. I mean if this page and others like went by that notion this forum would be empty.  Opinions come a dime a dozen. All cases reported had doubters, disbelievers, and nay sayers.

	<TITLE> 2nd Bible Burning - Ghost? Demon? or Poltergeists ? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-14 19:43:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 2nd Bible Burning
It was a April Sunday morning where Tina and I were awakened to loud bangs, door slams and just out right feeling of uneasiness. We woke up abruptly somewhat irritable by the unpredictable events.  By now we had our 1st Bible that went missing a year ago return on fire and now this Sunday morning a series of bangs and thuds to where we had no choice but to wake up. 
Even with the 1st Bible being set on fire the consensus among the local paranormal teams, friends and local religious houses was stay proactive and assertive with your belief and decorate the house surroundings with religious symbols..  The #1 recommendation being continue placing religious: Christian themes out in the open. By open I mean book shelf, door way, door entry, above the chimney area or coffee tale.  
So within a few days a 2nd Bible was placed on the hallway book shelf. No cameras, no nothing.  The Bible was opened to Psalms 91 and 92 and the prayers or hymn on those pages were recited internally by us.
On this particular Sunday after being jolted awake  and  doing the  normal routine of brushing ones teeth, showering and etc. I left our bedroom and ventured around the upstairs rooms.  It was a normal Sunday. Nothing different except the hauntings I just described. But before I sit down either in my office or down stairs I need coffee.  And it was when I leaving my room-coming out of the master bedroom that when glancing left towards the book shelf I noticed the Bible was missing.  Tina and I kept passing each other in the hallway and when I noticed it missing I immediately asked Tina did she move it. Her answer was no.
One thing Ive learned is anytime an activity happens in the morning and we are immediately made aware of it-something BIG is about to happen. And I dont mean BIG like eminent danger.  Maybe I do and I just dont realize it. But in most cases something else is about to happen. No activity happens on its own. Theres always another shoe about to drop. The Bible was missing and I know I saw it before going to bed. 
There was no point in searching for the Bible I mean one had been missing for months and here this one- a Gideons Bible was now missing and we had no idea if and when it would return, but the house was crazy active this morning. Sundays are the worse.  I think Tina and I searched no more than 20 seconds before I was off down stairs to make my coffee. And thats what I did. I went down and did the whole make me some coffee routine. So I started brewing coffee and while that was going on I headed back upstairs.
10 minutes or so had passed when I left my office to go make my full-fledged cup of coffee.  Tina was to and fro doing laundry.  I ventured down stairs and upon turning the corner and entering the wide open area of my kitchen there in the middle of the island was the missing Bible.  Albeit somewhat different in appearance.  The Bible was sitting on the island, pages open and it was scorched. I mean the pages were literally burned to a crisp. I immediately called Tina. She darted down and we both looked at the Bible.  It had to have been missing for a few hours. Where it was so it burn and not set off the fire alarm is anybodys guess but then again thats another piece of mystery to it. The pages were scorched but it appeared the pages burned from being exposed to extreme heat vs. someone purposely setting a match to it.  We didnt burn it.  Gods honest truth we had nothing to do with it. The Bible was on the hallway book shelf, albeit the pages were spread open to Psalms now with it being burned and the pages incinerated a majority of Psalms were gone.  Including the lords prayer.
Tina and I both got on the phone and started calling some paranormal teams and alerting local clergy again.  To this day I still dont know whats harder to deal with a unpredictable Poltergeists or people saying they can help you but wont.  A few hours later I would be in my office researching the internet looking for help and assistance. Whatever that was haunting us was not through with us yet. The next event to happen that day would be wax on the wall.  Both videos are below. They have not been edited, shorted or lengthened in any way. Both Bible burning and wax on the wall happened on the same day.  Like I said before for a period of about 8 months the worse day of all days when living in that house is Sunday.
When the entity wakes you its almost as if its waking you to say Its time to play.

Both events happened on the same day. There would be 3 Bibles and more burned in my house this was the 2nd one.

I can tell in our house objects have been thrown when the house was filled with laughter, glee and objects have been thrown when we were both fearful. There's really no rhyme or reason (at least not with our situation). I can only speak about my account; our account and how it relates to other documented cases.

There are parallels to other cases and their are unique differences.  IMO this Poltergeists is tied to the land , I could e wrong but I base that on the fact that previous tenants had their own accounts and they moved.  As of right now no one in their new homes are experiencing weird activity. Just this house regardless of the tenants occupying it.

That's me and us for now.

There things and events about this case that are rare and deserve deeper study.

I stand by that and welcome any genuine input available.

Key word being genuine.

Maybe this is easier. Sounds when the house is empty. I'm not recording this a Paranormal Team is. I'm out of town. the sounds you hear are sounds associated with Poltergeists.

[BEST TO LISTEN IN ITS ENTIRETY VS SKIPPING TO JUST THE NOISE MOMENTS] Haunted House - House Monitoring. For the entire summer of 2015 several paranormal teams came to assist Keith L in documenting the events inside his house. Events spoken briefly on Ghost Adventures aka Demons In Seattle episode. Its believed now that many spirits (+) or ( -) traverse through the home BUT the main constant is a Poltergeist tied to the land. This video is a remote viewing. House is empty and thus is being monitored while occupant is away. You will hear noises. You will hear strange sounds, interference and more captured by teams more experienced in dealing with these types of haunting. 1:29, 2:40, 4:10, 4:20, 6:00, 10:05, 12:00 LOUD Bang, 15:20,23:40 (major noises), 33:11 (major noise) cabinet door sound.33:50 noise, camera tinkering, 34:10 camera tinkering, noise, static, team does some configuration, 36:11 Noise or Motion detected ?? 36:47 noise heard, camera interference, static. 37:00 noises, static, intereference, 38:00 noises and voice, unsure if that is the team, possible evp? Just now sure. 38:57 noise, static, interference 41:35 voice, interference and static. These cameras do not transmit two way audio - not sure how voices are being captured. But the noise must be in the house as the camera sound detection is going off. 43:11 noises with the static.44:00 interference. 44:18 somethings happening with the camera equipment. 44:44 tap noise. 45:18 noise, taps, static, this interference is not coming from the team. 46:00 motion or noise alert goes off. BEST WITH HEAD SETS ON. Additional info. https://app.box.com/s/r5ta5kk6p4qr6t1... and https://app.box.com/s/mkkuf2a9kpyiqzq...   best with headsets </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First of all IceDagger316 (hope I spelled that right --let me look, yes I did) first of all if you're going to reply back to me you might want to educate yourself a little bit about the workings of Ghosts and Poltergeist. And while you're doing that you might want to stop thinking in 2 dimensional terms. Heck you shouldn't even be thinking in 3D or 4 Dimensional terms either. Everything a Poltergeists does defies logic. I'm sort of shocked ( well not really I was the same way as you when all this started) But I wised up. The more events happened and I admit my IQ is higher than yours about this subject matter because I lived it for 3 years. I'm still living it. But I digress. You're trying to rationalize and find meaning as to why a Poltergeists would hang a pair of pants on the doorway is like me trying to rationalize why a bumble bee can fly.  It flies because it can. Same thing with a Poltergeists. Do your home work and you'll everything a Poltergeists does defies logic aka doesn't make sense, aka is weird, aka rhyme and reason don't apply here. Get it? Got it?  Comprende esse'?


And after you've done thorough home work and thorough reading  grab a head set and listen to a true Paranormal Team investigation

	<TITLE> House Attack June 2014. And loud bang from Bedroom Door March 2014. </TITLE>

June 30th 2014. Motion detection, camera movements and furniture displacement into my upstairs office, kitchen and living room. Key indicators of an active Poltergeists. To dispel the break end theory. This has happened numerous times. I've seen the apparition 3 times. Previous tenants have come forth and have explained they had similar activity while living in the house. They had children we do not.  Of course none of this started abruptly. What started first was foot steps, occasional thud or two, waking up finding all cabinet doors open, lights and TV go off and on by themselves and items going missing. ADT security *Pulse was installed to monitor the doors and windows to rule out intruders and outside sources.  Communication to the church, clergy and paranormal teams bought about the hanging up of religious objects to ward off negative energy and spirits. This plus Sagging seemed to make matters worse and thats when events equal to the above video began to happen.

this video is March 2014.  Best with headsets. Loud banging on door at 3:03AM 3/27/14  4:58.   Hallway is the 2nd most active room in the house. The most active room in the house is the office. My office. We're asleep and are awakened by a BANG on the door. You will see the door shake but there's noone there. The noise even sounds like its coming from elsewhere. You'll appreciate the noise more if you wear headspeakers. 0 background noise.  Link below is the Photobucket of the 3 year ordeal.

Slideshow goes from 2015 to 2012.

	<TEXT> Valuable items are never stolen. No kid or group of kids is going to break into a house a two story house and trash one room out of five and not steal anything of value. No forced entry. ADT is armed and there is no captured log of entry while we are gone. Previous tenants experienced the same thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Break in is an accurate analogy used for a Poltergeist. House is secured. There is no break in and this has happened more than once.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> House exorcism was performed in July. Since then activity has died down. Its died down before and then spikes off and on. What remains now is occasional off and on with the lights. Foot steps, thuds, occasional BANG.  All missing items are still missing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How does one say what a ghost, demon, or Poltergeist can or cannot do. Actually nailing pants or nailing objects to a wall period is level one Poltergeist activity.  Google historical cases and you'll see each case offers uniqueness and similarities. </TEXT>

April 26th 2014 
Frame 4:58 - 5:07 center stage (screen) Ghost torso.  Don't blink. Other stuff exist in video as well. My friends, my self and Paranormal Team count 6 unexplained phenomenon ( images or spirits)?  https://app.box.com/s/lmero13u8x58h27rphc6i3rl8uimj6vy . The narrative here is no legit ghost video gets created out of a vacuum. For us the story begins we moved in a house. Items began missing. Items neither of us owned started appearing. Thuds, Bumps, Taps, snaps and loud bangs begin. Every cabinet door is found wide open in a series of mornings. Then objects i.e. flower pots get thrown. Things go projectile.   Then the cameras go up to rule out intruder and the obvious. But the obvious never presents itself. Instead something more mysterious. UPDATE 2015 Finally agreed among teams we have a Poltergeist linked to the land (Property). 

activity took a turn for the worse the minute we when tried to get rid of it or bought in more cameras.

	<TEXT> Questions about the DemonsInSeattle Ghost Adventures TV airing(questions never asked to us directly)

1. How did Keith and Tina come about being on the show Ghost Adventures? What was the process?

After two years of getting little help from local clergy and local teams. Two years mind you I decided to reach out to the local media. I felt the media had a back door with the local clergys and possibly could assist with getting someone on board. Activity was increasing so we needed help.

KOMO news TV responded and did a segment. They reached out to me near Halloween 2014 even though they had the info 5 months prior. This the airing.

Upon interviewing me the news anchor and camera man who accompanied her both heard a loud noise from upstairs. The noise was very distinctive and it was not house noise. I was alone in the house working from home the day when they arrived. Not shown in the interview I asked to give them a tour of the house (including the upstairs) they nervously declined. News anchor was given strict orders from Dave Schrader to not become too connected to the house for fear of attachment. I was told this upon them leaving. Invite to tour the house came after the noise was heard (to prove Im not faking it). They declined. The noise was that unsettling. Its in the video.

Less than two days after this piece aired locally. Producers of Ghost Adventures come calling. Nowhere in the interview did I ask for Ghost Adventures. I asked for local help. After experiencing the loud noise themselves the news anchor told me she had a back door connection with Ghost Adventures that being Dave Schrader. Dave called me less than two days later after the piece aired and asked if GAC could do a show on our house. He was less critical over the phone, even less critical in person. The only questions he asked about the house was the activity captured off camera and a legal question of do we own the home. I told him we rent the home. He then advised they would need the owners permission before shooting. The home owner being kept up to date on all activity within the house accepted. GAC arrived 6 weeks later and filmed the episode. </TEXT>
