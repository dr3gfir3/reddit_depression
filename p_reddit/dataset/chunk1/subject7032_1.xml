	<TEXT> *Don't stick your dick in crazy*. 

Words to live by. It's amazing how our mind can rationalize anything when we want something (or someone) badly enough though. 

When we first started dating, I didn't think Emma was *crazy*. Well that's not entirely true, but somehow I thought crazy was a good thing. Riding shopping carts down hills, holding a conversation with a dozen different voices, singing in public without a care in the world. 

She was innocent and free and wild, and I loved her for it. Every fun spontaneous thing that came into her mind, we did together. She forced me to open up as an individual and tore down walls and inhibitions I didn't even know I had. 

There were warning signs for the "other kind" of crazy too, but I just thought it was all an act. I didn't think she was really hearing voices, and even if she was, what was the harm in it? She never acted out bizarre commands or anything. It was just part of what made her unique. 

When she gave birth to our daughter Anastasia, I began to take her mental health a little more seriously. Emma was having visual as well as auditory hallucinations now, and she would get angry at me if I ever dismissed them as "not being real". 

We talked through it and did some research, and it sounded to me like she had schizophrenia. She always thought her voices were from a guardian angel, and I knew she wasn't going to be happy hearing otherwise. 

I had to get her to recognize they weren't real though, otherwise she would just encourage our daughter to believe in that stuff. Anastasia would already be genetically predisposed to her own hallucinations, and I didn't want that mentality to be reinforced. 

That was the worst fight Emma and I ever had. I didn't realize exactly how real it all was to her until I pushed her to get help. She wouldn't talk to me afterward for days, and even when she started to again, she would reference her guardian angel constantly. 

*"Ezekiel [her angel] reminded me to pick up milk at the store."*
 
or

*"Let's go see the star wars movie. Ezekiel said it was good."* 

It only got worse as the years went on. By the time Anastasia was nine years old, her mother and I couldn't even be in the same room together. Then one night my daughter was having nightmares, and instead of comforting her, I caught Emma telling Anastasia that she *should* be afraid. That she should *run* from it for God's sake. 

That was too much for me. We had a big fight right there in our daughter's room - screaming, cursing, throwing pillows - the whole bit. 

I wasn't going to let my daughter turn out to be like her, so there was no choice but to file for a divorce. I had recordings of her being crazy, and I would get custody of the kid. It wasn't going to be pretty, but that's how it had to be. 

I tried to talk to Anastasia about it, but she was so upset from watching our fight she couldn't deal with it. That night, I found a note in my daughters room while putting her to sleep. 

*I saw pictures of mommy and daddy when they first met.*
*They went on adventures. They smiled a lot.*
*Then there are pictures of them after I was born.*
*They aren't smiling anymore.*
*I'm sorry I did that to you. I hope you'll feel better when I'm gone. I love you mommy. I love you daddy. Goodbye.*

That was it. I asked Anastasia what it was and she shrugged. I got angry - I shouldn't have, but I was scared - and I yelled at her. She promised she didn't write the letter, and I calmed down. Yelling will only make things worse. I promised nothing that was happening was her fault and that she should never do anything bad to herself. 

She still insisted she hadn't written it though. That's when it clicked. The manipulative bitch. Emma wrote a fake suicide note just so I would feel bad and we would stay together. This was the last straw. That demon was not spending another night in my house. 
 
I ran to our bedroom and pounded on the door. Emma was in there, reading a book with a mask of innocence on her face. How I hated that innocence - she wore it like an excuse for nothing being her fault. I screamed at her and shoved the letter in her face. 

She screamed back. It was about five minutes before either of us could understand what the other was saying. Finally a string of clear words punctured through the violent words.

*I didn't write it. I swear on Ezekiel I didn't.*

We both stared at each other in silence as the awful realization dawned on us. If she hadn't written it then...

We both raced to our daughter's room, shoving each other out of the way as we went. The door was locked. 

*"Anastasia! Are you in there?*"

Silence. I rammed my shoulder against the door. 

"It's alright sweetie," Emma cooed. "Everything is alright. We love you and we love each other.*

I glared at Emma, but she shrugged. She was right though. This wasn't about us. This was about our daughter. 

*"Your mother and I love each other," I added. "I'm sorry we were fighting. Please open the door. Please baby."*

*"You will both be happy again when she's gone."* That wasn't my daughter's voice. It was deep and old - like a soldier who stared death in the face so many times it stopped phasing him in the least. There was a man in my daughter's bedroom!

Emma and I stared at each other. Her eyes were two quivering saucers. She turned back to the door. 

*"Don't do it Ezekiel. You're my angel. You're supposed to protect us."*

*"No," the deep voice. *'m supposed to protect you. And that's what I'm doing."*

Anastasia screamed. It couldn't have been anyone else. I hit the door so hard I could feel my shoulder dislocate. I didn't care. I hit again, and the door blew open. 

Anastasia was lying on her bed, a kitchen knife in her hands. The red circle of blood soaking into the bed was expanding with every second. There was no-one else in the room.

---

I still don't know what happened that night. Maybe it was Emma playing a trick on me - maybe it was real. After our daughter died, Emma and I couldn't even look at each other anymore. She left that night, and I haven't seen or spoken to her since. 

I never heard the voice again either, but sometimes in the deep of night I'll ask it a single question: *[Is Emma happy now?](https://www.facebook.com/A-Haunted-Mind-1256444524403181/)*

	<TEXT> Hospital food is the worst. Youd think being sick would be miserable enough without them trying to push boiled kale and broccoli. My guess is they try to make you even sicker from the food just so youll stay and they can keep billing you. I joked about it with my son, but I didnt expect him to laugh.


They say coma patients can still hear your voice at some level. They say a familiar sound gives their subconscious something to hold onto, and believing he is still in there is what gives me something to hold onto. Without that belief, I would just be hollow.


So everyday after work I sit with him and talk. Ill tell him about my day, or the latest news, or just sit and read to him from a book. I tell him that I miss him, and his mother misses him too. I know she doesnt come to visit, but thats just because its too hard for her to be here. When he wakes up, I know hell understand.


Ive been waiting for the last two months. Even the nurse started rolling her eyes when she sees me. I can tell they gave up on him, but I havent. And its not just blind hope and Im not just lying to myself because the alternative is unthinkable; its because I know something they dont.


I read my sons journal after he fell into the coma. I was looking for some reference to drugs or something he might have taken which could have caused this. In the last entry  written right before the night he didnt wake up from  I found something completely different than I expected.

December 20th: 2016
-
My dream last night spoke to me. It said:
-

*We share a birthday.*


*And a mother.*


*And a name.*


*But you arent my twin, or my brother, or any other type of relative.*


*Because we also share the same body. Its been that way for as long as I can remember, but I dont think you even know I exist.*


*When you open your eyes, I feel myself slipping into a dream which descends upon me so softly I barely notice it isnt real. I dream of going about your life and watching the world through your eyes, but you are the one in control. I watch my body eat, but I do not taste your food. I hear my body laugh, but do not feel your joy.*


*Only when youre sleeping do I find myself in control again. I can take your mind wherever I like, and I know you dream of my life in the same way I dream of yours because Ive dreamt of you writing in your journal about my adventures.*


*Were not the same person though, and in truth I am jealous that you own the body during the day. Dont pretend you havent dreamt of me begging you for a turn  just to smell the air and feel the sun upon my face. I know you remember me weeping through the long hours of the night until the morning steals your mind from me.*


*Even the nightmares didnt work. Ravaging your mind only made you afraid to fall asleep. It only robbed me of the precious little control I already had. Ive tried everything within my power to get your attention, but Im done playing games. You are a selfish boy, and you will be punished.*


*You can fight me for as long as you want, but I will teach you what it is like to be the one on the inside. I dont care how long it takes; the next time you open your eyes, I will be the one rising from your bed. Everyone who has ever cared for you will pay for loving the impostor who has stolen my body for so long.*


---

After that, he didnt wake up. As much as I hate myself for saying this  theres even a part of me that doesnt want him to. I want to look him in the eye and tell him everything is alright, but I dont want to have to wonder who will be looking back.


Its an absurd fear of course, but a mind can play funny tricks on you after such long hours of lonely vigil. Day in and out watching him sleep  its easy to imagine the black eyes of some evil spirit flashing open.


Reading about these horrendous nightmares in his journal only deepend my fear. Its all I had left of him though, so i kept reading them over and over again until I had each memorized by heart.


My poor boy has been visiting hell in his mind every night for months leading up to his coma. He wrote extensive passages on each trial, even drawing pictures of some of the beasts which tormented him. The worst one to me was a recurring nightmare about hands trying to rip out of his body from the inside out. They would climb up his throat and out his mouth to strangle him, or grab his spine from the inside, or break straight through the stomach and crawl out of his body.


Sometimes I stayed with him through the night  just in case his condition varied then. I would usually fall asleep in the chair beside him before morning, and invariably my mind would trace back to those nightmare worlds. Worse still were the nights my dreams played tricks on me and I imagined him waking up, only to actually wake up and see him unmoved.


That is until last week when it wasnt a trick. I didnt really expect anything to happen, but I stayed with him just because it was getting more difficult to go home to his mother. She has given up and closed off from the world, and nothing I could do or say brought her the slightest glimmer of relief. But last night was different, because he finally did wake up.


I know I wasnt dreaming because I couldnt sleep with the commotion in the next room over. Mrs. Juniper was having another grand mal seizure and it took both the night nurses just to hold her down and keep her from hurting herself.


Somehow above all that noise a small rustle caught my attention. I looked up from his journal and saw my sons left foot slowly moving back and forth beneath the thin sheet. I called for a nurse, but they were still busy with Mrs. Juniper. I kept telling myself it was excitement that made my heart race, but part of me could not shake the fear his journal had instilled upon me.


I stroked his face and he responded to my touch, mumbling something inaudible. I couldnt even breathe for the anticipation.


Nurse! Nurse hes waking up!


Well be with you in a moment!


Well screw them. They werent the ones to wait by his bed every day. They were the ones who had given up a long time ago.


Can you hear me? Do you know who I am? I asked. My eagerness sent my fingers digging into his shoulders. I needed him to feel me  to know I was there. A doubt in the back of my mind let slip the thought that I was also holding him down  just in case it wasnt him who woke.


I knew the truth the second his eyes opened. It wasnt my son. I dont know how, but a father knows. When he started to laugh, my blood ran cold. He gripped my hands hard with a strength which should be impossible for an emaciated boy who hasnt moved in months. It was all I could do just to break free.


Who are you? I asked, but I already knew. All those pages detailing his nightmares  all those descriptions of the other thing inside him  they all came flooding back. How cruel it was  how many times it had threatened him  tortured him  killed him a hundred times over in his dreams. 

Dad he whispered, smiling at me with his cold eyes.


No. You arent my son.


Its me dad. Whats going on? Where am I? He tried to sit up, but I forced him back down into the bed.


No! I dont care if I was screaming. I dont care if I was hurting him. I waited this long for my son  I wanted my son. What have you done with him?


What are you talking about? he looked like he was on the verge of tears, but I wasnt going to let him fool me. A flash of recognition, and then: Youve read my journal. You mean the other boy.


What have you done with my son?


There isnt anyone else anymore, he said, and he was laughing again.


He killed him. He killed my son. He tortured and killed my boy, and now he was laughing. He wont fool me, but he would fool my wife. She would be so happy to see him that she wouldnt even look twice. I couldnt let this murderer get away with it. I wouldnt let any more pain come to my family.


He fought like a wild animal, but I was still active everyday and I was stronger. I held the pillow on his face, and the soft fabric pressed in upon his nose and mouth. I wish he had never woken up  that he had just died in his sleep. I cant imagine how much my son suffered before this monster killed him, but he was going to pay.


Everything alright in there? the nurse opened the door.


I fluffed the pillow and put it back under the boys head.


Everything is fine. I was just having a bad dream.


You sure? she asked. I thought I heard shouting. She glanced at the boy. He lay so peacefully he didnt even draw breath.


Nope, just my active imagination.


Thats what happens when you sit up every night, the nurse said. Go home and get some sleep. Ill let you if his status changes.


I picked up my coat and my book and followed her out. I think youre right, I said. Im going home, see you tomorrow.


But I wouldnt come back tomorrow. There was no-one to come back to. I got a call later that night telling me my son had suffocated. They say that happens sometimes with coma patients  the automatic functions of their parasympathetic nervous system just turn off just like the conscious ones did.
I thanked her and hung up, but I didnt tell her she was wrong. My son had died two months ago.

---

My wife doesnt know what happened, but she still hasnt spoken once in the last week. There have been no shortage of other people wishing their condolences though  estranged relatives, neighbors, coworkers.


His English teacher even stopped by my house to offer her sympathy. She went on and on about what a wonderful student he was. His essays were always the most imaginative she had ever seen, always going above and beyond what was required.


For example, one of her assignments was to keep a dream journal, but he asked instead to write a fictitious story which he was going to publish alongside pictures from the yearbook. It was going to be all about this made up nightmare world where there were two minds living in the same body. She asked if I still had his work so it could at least still be published, but I told her I didnt.


Which is true. I destroyed the journal the same night I killed my son.
