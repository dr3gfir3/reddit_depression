	<TEXT> Worked in a few hospitality roles, would never spit in someone's food! But the coffee shop I worked in I'd sometimes deliberately make a rude customers order wrong - not so they'd notice necessarily but so I'd feel a bit better after they'd been super rude. Like using full fat milk for the skinny latte of the woman who would come in talking on her phone, not properly look at me and always make me wait for ages with her change in my hand, or swapping out decaf for caffeinated, that kind of thing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While crossing the road the other day I flipped off a car driver who honked his horn at me, leaned out the window and shouted "get out of the road" because I didn't stop halfway through crossing the road to let him turn in - arrogant drivers are the worst </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'd mostly agree with the comments here - I solo travelled and travelled with another female friend in Morocco a few years back. Food is amazing, people are on the whole friendly and very welcoming to tourists. A couple of the places I really enjoyed visiting were fez and chefchouen up in the north of the country. And spending a night in the desert with the bedouins is really worth it if you have the time, there are a few package-type trips you can book through agents in Marrakesh. 
On the whole buses are cheap and pretty reliable way to get around, there isn't much of a train network so unless you can drive or find some other travellers to split a taxi with it's also your only option.
I wouldn't be too nervous about booking places before you go - definitely preferable to have somewhere lined up at least for your first few days rather than finding somewhere when you arrive. There isn't really a hostel culture like in Europe, but you can find cheap places to stay that are pretty basic amenity-wise.
Like has already been mentioned you will be asked for money a lot - haggling is part of the culture and you have to stand your ground about what you're willing to pay/ agree prices before any services are provided. 
The only other thing to be aware of is that I dressed very modesty, trousers and long sleeved shirts, and I still found that I attracted a lot of male attention, some of it very unpleasant. I'm not really sure what the best advice about this is, it is obviously just a small minority of men but I was cat called, followed and groped, in broad daylight in busy touristy areas in Marrakesh and elsewhere. I don't want to sound scaremongery, but just have your wits about you, and if you need directions or help try to approach women or families.

	<TEXT> As a renter it's the little details that suggest a poor level of upkeep or a landlord/agency that won't fix things that really put me off. If you can't be bothered to repaint a dirty wall or repair a kitchen cabinet before looking for new renters then my confidence is lost. Similarly, there are certain agencies in my city that I would just never rent through no matter how nice the apartment due to personal experience and other word of mouth reviews about their total lack of regard for tenants. </TEXT>
