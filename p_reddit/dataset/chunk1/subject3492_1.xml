	<TEXT> Also featured on [WKYC's 6 things to do this weekend in Cleveland](http://www.wkyc.com/news/local/six-things-to-do-this-weekend-in-northeast-ohio-nov-12-13/350869022), Dinofest takes place at the [Cleveland Museum of Natural History](https://www.cmnh.org/).


This year, an amazing roster of dinosaur experts will be speaking on topics like reproductive behavior in the raptor-like dinosaur *Troodon formosus*, recreating cretaceous ecosystems using paleoecology, how *T. rex* grew up and transformed from a fleet-footed rebel to a titanic, 40-foot predator, and how artists reconstruct extinct animals and bring them to life in paintings. There will also be a workshop where you can learn to draw dinosaurs with famed paleoartist [Dr. Julius Csotonyi](http://csotonyi.com/).


The museum will also have special fossils on display for you to see and touch, and lots of family-friendly activities set up around the museum- like fossil casting, and fossil dig activities.

The speaker roster includes:

Dr. David Varricchio from Montana State University

Dr. Holly Woodward-Ballard from Oklahoma State University

Dr. Jordan Mallon from the Canadian Museum of Nature

Dr. Julius Csotonyi, paleo artist extraordinaire


This is all included in the cost of admission for the museum, so check it out! </TEXT>
