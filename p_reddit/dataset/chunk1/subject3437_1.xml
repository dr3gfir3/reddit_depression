	<TEXT> Apart from woodcutting, foraging has little value late-game. You could make 1 item each season more rare   valuable. You could make 1 item each season more rare   valuable.

Winter sort of already has this going on - Crystal Fruit is intensely valuable for a forage item ( 150g base ), which makes it excellent wine fodder - it has a higher value than Strawberries, Blueberries, Cranberries, and Grapes. Only Melons, Ancient Fruit, and Starfruit outperform them.

Spring and Fall have this with with Salmonberries and Blackberries - only a few days to harvest all you can, and you can then churn out an obscene amount of Jelly with them since they're useless for Wine, as good as Blackberry Wine sounds.

Spring and Fall also have Morels ( Spring, 150g base ) and Chanterelles ( Fall, 160g base ) in the Secret Woods, but Summer overall is lacking - with the main thing of note being the Fiddlehead Ferns at 90g base.

Granted, to make these a stable income you farm them yourself from the season appropriate wild seeds ( minus mushrooms and ferns since they aren't included ), which mostly defeats the purpose of foraging in the first place. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a few older people who more or less live in their motorized recliners since they can't handle getting in and out of bed without assistance - the chair tilts forward to help them into their walkers and back for sleeping. George is probably in a similar situation. </TEXT>
