So, was there a concept of honour killing in Europe in the middle ages that would allow or even compell a community to execute victims of rape? I'm guessing it unlikely, but possible. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Was just reading the Sicario 2 thread and a couple of people said they'd only want a sequel if Villeneuve was directing. So, innocent /r/movies guy that I am - meaning I really have no idea who this director is - I figured I'd let this bunch here recommend his movies to me. Maybe I've even already seen some others. Guessing here that that is likely. But I'm not even going to google to learn more - you all, not google,  are the movie recommendation gods.

Please feel free to go on and on about his and his work, but try to avoid spoilers. I'm fine with "Watch 'X' - you won't regret it" without knowing anymore when going in to watch. In fact, I probably wont' read nested comments if i think they are going to give something away.

	<TITLE> I need a module for a multiple-choice quiz based on content types and fields. Is there one? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-11 09:01:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Say I've got four types of content that all have similar fields. The content types might be A B C and D.

Each of these content types has the same fields (plus other not related to taking a quiz):

Symbol, Text, Value

I want to generate a random multiple-choice quiz, based on one of the content types. 

So, say the user chooses "category A", "quiz me on value"

Then the module should choose 10 random nodes of type A and pose questions like

1. A - node102

Choose the correct value: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4

The user chooses the correct answer, say "2" and the next question comes up and so on until the end of the quiz, after which the score is shown.

The choices for the answers must be pulled from the fields of nodes in category A. 

For example, say I have a quiz on US states. US state might be a content type and the fields might be "capital", "governor" and "shape"

So, the quiz must pull a random node like Delaware and if the user has chosen to quiz "governor", the choices must include Delaware's governor and three other governors of random states. (In other words, it's not a simple matter of set answers like if the quiz was about foods and the user had to recognize that a banana was a fruit and not a meat, veggie or dairy product, which would be a simple matter of randomizing the order of those four choices for each question.)

The "quiz" module does not seem to do this. Where can I find a solution?

	<TEXT> I'm subbed to this subreddit for over a year now and I just want to thank all you lovers of fine film for all your discussions and insights here. 

I can hardly take part in most threads. I pretty much know nothing about movies except that I enjoy watching good ones. So, for example right now on the front page, I honestly don't know who Paul Feig is, or Alan Taylor or really anyone. And well yeah, I don't really care. But!

But, thanks to the extreme lurkability of this place, I've seen a ton of great films over the past year. We just watched 12 Anrgy Men last night and without /r/movies I'm sure it would have never been on the radar. 

Anyone else like me lurk? Let's hear it for the people who can and do contribute.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, no, I do not have a lot of things on my desktop.

That said, I just noticed that when the dektop is visible and "Finder" is the active program, when I hit "a", the item on my desktop that starts with "a" gets selected. Wow!

If you hit a key that does not match the first letter of anything on the desktop, then the next one higher in the alphbet gets selected. (So, like if you have three items "a.png", DataForWork.xls, and "Nothing here" folder, then typing "b" would cause DataForWork to get selected.)

I've never noticed this before, but it is incredibly convenient!

This is on Mavericks, btw, but I suspect it's been the case for a while and is still true on Yose and higher. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My DELL 2713 monitor just stopped showing resolution of 2540x1440, wat to do? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-05-23 13:47:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have used this monitor in 2540x1440 resolution since October 2013 and yesterday for some reason, it decided (or my mid-2010 MPB decided) it was only good for 1080p TV resolution.

I've tried holding option when going to "Scaled" in Settings-Display, but that only gives me a max of 1600x1200, though I could swear i've seen 2540x1440 in there before when I had a similar problem maybe six months ago.

I'm using 10.9.5.

What gives? I really miss my great monitor...

EDIT ONE: After unplugging the cable from the monitor and mpb and waiting like a minute for it to cool off?? the scale demons to escape? When I pluugied it back in the 2560x1440 was there! BUT as I selected it, it disappeared and then there were NONE and then after closing settings and reopening them, back to square one. PROOF (I weep, I really want my resolution back! especially after cropping these in photoshop) http://imgur.com/a/H17Ha#0

EDIT TWO: After much agony, I foun this to work: http://www.ireckon.net/2013/03/force-rgb-mode-in-mac-os-x-to-fix-the-picture-quality-of-an-external-monitor </TEXT>

	<TEXT> you probably know that if you hit the space bar in finder you'll get a popup preview of the file. 

TIL that if you press the option key when viewing an image in this way, if its preview pane is smaller than the image's real size (shrinking the image to fit on your screen), it will enlarge to full size. AND you can two-finger track pad pan around it at the same time!

Just something I'd never noticed before and that is pretty useful at times. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Say I made a new taxonomy term and called it "holiday-tag", the default path is going to be "[term:vocabulary]/[term:name]" under Patterns. And so I add some terms and then decide the path would be better as simply "holidays/[term:name]". 

Is Delete Aliases where I reset the ones I've already made?

Or is Bulk Update there? But if it's Bulk Update, then why does it say "Select the types of un-aliased paths for which to generate URL aliases"? What if I want to change some already-aliased paths?

Also, how does this affect 404 results and consequently SEO? 

I'm afraid to use Delete Aliases, because it looks like it is not granular enough and I could delete a lot of aliases that are perfectly fine. And I supose I'd have to update them all individually. But maybe not?

So, what kind of corner have I backed myself into? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any modules for Multiple choice quiz based on fields from content type? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-14 08:35:08 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've browsed and all the quiz-type modules I've found seem to require actually entering answers.

An easy-to-understand example of what I want could be a quiz on the capitals of US states. 

So, say I have a contnt type "State" and that content type has a field "capital"

I want a module that will let the user choose from a set number of questions (10, 15, 20) and then populate a quiz so that the first question might be:

1. What is the capital of New York

a) Salt Lake City
b) Albany
c) Jefferson City
d) Springfield

the user clicks on his choice and 

if wrong, he gets the notificaiton "wrong" and the correct answer is highlighted and the question remains visible until he clicks on the correct answer and the quiz moves to the next question.

if correct, he gets the notification "correct" and when he clicks that he goes to the next question.

When generating a quiz, the questions are in a random order, and the answer choices also vary - just pulilng in the correct answer and three incorrect answers from the field in other nodes of the content type. 

OR is there a quiz for something like "How many sides does a triangle have?"

a) 3
b) 4
c) 5
d) 7

Where i can populate the choices with the correct answer and the incorrect choices from a list of letters/numbers/etc.?

Anything like one of those out there already? </TEXT>

http://www.vedomosti.ru/politics/news/38310201/zaschita-ot-majdanov

         ,        

Deputies and senators have organized an "Anti-maydan" movement with the support of the patriotic part of society in order to counteract the threat of a color revolution both ideologically and physically.

Just wow - do they relly think there is a threat? Or are they just looking for a way to scare anyone from even thinking about it? Bizarre. </TEXT>
