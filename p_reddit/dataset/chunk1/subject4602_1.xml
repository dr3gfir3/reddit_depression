	<TEXT> So my dad and my uncle managed to get into mcr's second Roxy show and brought back a full length bootleg and a shirt they made specifically for the show. Sadly I've lost the shirt for now (it's probably buried with some laundry in the back room), but I've got some pictures/clips for proof. Does anybody know if there are any other recordings of this in full?

Honestly, I've got some moral issues with sharing as it was a birthday gift from my uncle to me. Also, I don't really know how to rip it onto a computer, I'm not to knowledgeable on stuff like that.

However, I'm willing to answer any questions on it for you guys. I could also transcribe some if the talking sections if you guys are interested in that.

	<TEXT> We're back! This is a simple song, but a good one (even if it's my least favorite on the album). I love the organ bit before the chorus and this song has a great solo section. I've heard people say Al's best solos are on P/G and PoW. I 100% agree and think I know why. Due to the synth thing, he wasn't focusing as much on guitar bits for main parts of the song. Rather, he focused strongly on the solos.

	<TEXT> This is an amazing song by Dream Theater off of Scenes From A Memory. Kind of Rush meets heavier metal. I recommend that, if you have an hour and a half to spare, you you go listen to the entire album of Metropolis Part 2: SFAM.

It's about a guy who is having these reoccurring dreams with a girl. He falls into an obsession and the album starts with his first visit to a hypnotherapist and tells what he finds. It was vote the best Prog album of all time in a reader poll for Rolling Stone and is my personal favorite album of all time.

	<TEXT> Sorry. I was starting to get burnt out on this and, in fear of not making quality posts, decided it'd be best to take a break for a day or two as opposed to letting what happened from about 2112-Moving Pictures happen (where I got burnt out and lazily threw posts together). As a moderator, I like to take pride in the work I do. This is an awesome community and these posts have been a nearly daily occurrence for many months now. I want these to be something I can happily look back on instead of looking in disappointment.

***I'VE DECIDED THAT, IN ORDER TO PRESERVE THIS ENTHUSIASM FOR THE SERIES, I WILL MAKE A POST WITH A DIFFERENT SONG I FEEL EVERYONE SHOULD CHECK OUT EACH DAY FOR ONLY A WEEK. AFTER THAT, IT'S RIGHT BACK TO P/G***

Anyway, this is a great song. The little keyboard section "Do do do, do do do, dodododo do do do, do do do, etc" is one of my favorite bits in any Rush song. It's so happy and resembles someone stunned by this amazing feat of humanity. That's something captured perfectly in this song, an achievement that grips everyone and destroys the barriers separating each individual.

	<TEXT> #I EDITED THIS POST BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CALLING ME UNGRATEFUL WHICH IS UNTRUE. I WANTED TO ELABORATE ON THE FACT THAT I STILL REALLY ENJOYED THE SHOW, BUT WAS CALLED "DISHONEST TRASH" FOR DOING SO. MAN, FUCK THIS FANBASE.

This loving criticism goes out to the ladies in the crowd tonight.

There NOTHING new in it. Here's what the nsp section was

1. The Decision
2. If We Were Gay
3. Everybody Wants To Rule The World
4. Take On Me
5. The Hit

That's it. Aside from the two obvious covers played at both of their Toronto shows and the obvious song they did with TWRP, it's seriously annoying that they haven't added a new NSP song to the set since 2009! I mean really! And the fact that they teased 6969 with "Looks like this is song 69" makes it even worse. I'm sure it was great to be there, and the versions with full instruments were cool, but they wasted an opportunity to use a full band to do literally anything else than their two most played songs.

That said, it was a fucking fantastic show, probably the best I've ever seen them do, and I hope I can one day see then if they come around, not just on Twitch. Seriously, a great performance that I'm sure I'll watch dozens upon dozens of times more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Such a sad song. I remember playing it one rainy day with my windows open letting in the beating of raindrops. Signals is my summer album and likely many other people's as well. Only 113 more days!

I love the time signatures. 5/8 intro/verse switching to 4/4 at the end of the verse then back to 5/8, then 4/4 again, and 8/8 at the chorusish thing, then 4/4, then 5/8, then my favorite. 11/8 phrased as 6/8, 5/8. Followed by a switch to 6/8 then eventually 5/8 and finally back to 4/4 to close the song. It's probably their most complex since Hemispheres (Cygnus Book 2) and a great showcase of their ability to seamlessly switch between time signatures. Another example is Tom Sawyer where it goes from 4/4 into 7/8 in the solo part counted as 1 2 3 1-11 2 3 .

	<TEXT> This is a cool song. Part 2 of the Fear Trilogy. Also the 4th Rush song I heard. I had heard 2112, Xanadu, and Subdivisions, so I've always had a soft spot for this song.

	<TEXT> I firmly believe that Vital Signs is the best track on Moving Pictures. Also, the 90s was their best era for live shows. They had great energy, they had great set lists, the crowds were amazing, and the sound was as good as it has ever been and will ever be.

And, you guys will hate me, I don't much care for the R40 CD. The mix is better than the Clockwork one (which we all agree is absolute shit) but I still find myself going back to ATWAS, ESL, GUPL, ASOH, DS, and R30 far more than R40.

It's just because they have literally anything you could want except for Losing It and some stuff off Snakes And Arrows and Clockwork Angels.

And I know a lot of people like ATWAS over ESL because it's more genuinely live, but I prefer ESL's setlist and, honestly, the mixing isn't *that* horrid. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> NOTE: To the person who reported this for being illegal or immoral, it is neither to be honest. According to Standord's website, this is fair use. It's an alteration on the original material. Literally a remix. Plus, I'm not selling it and I'm not claiming it as my own. Also, it's pretty fair to say most people (99%) who care about this in the first place have Vapor Trails in some form already.

I found this while looking for stuff on torrent sites (I've already legally purchased all the media I can, don't worry). It's the BEST remix of Vapor Trails I've ever heard. [Here is a link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/8vgse7e1y7a6t7h/AACJaeqzrz_B-Zn8iYxKcScna?dl=0) to a Dropbox folder with all of the songs. Check it out, seriously it's great. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For simplicity, I have all of SFAM combined into their proper scenes with some liberties.
Pretty much it's this:

1. Regression/Overture 1928/Strange Deja Vu
2. Through My Words/Fatal Tragedy (I know Deja Vu transitions into Words, but I can live with one iffy one)
3. Beyond This Life/Through Her Eyes
4. Home/The Dance Of Eternity
5. One Last Time/The Spirit Carries On/Finally Free (this makes a fucking awesome epic)

I also have Metropolis at the start of SFAM and A Change Of Seasons at the end of Images And Words.

Don't kill me please.

EDIT:

Oh, also, I got rid of that stupid crying in Losing Faythe and combined the tracks that fade into each other on that album. But I hate the crying there. Absolutely ridiculous. Also, I got rid of Astonishing and am interrupting the ending as "she died and went to heaven". No Disney-bullshit ending. She's dead. The end. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've got a likely controversial opinion on this song: I firmly believe it has the most difficult bass part of any Rush song. EVER. This is coming from someone who can play YYZ with about 90% accuracy. This bass part is complicated, fast, and brilliant. The guitar solo's pretty damn awesome as well. A theory I have about why Lerxst's best solos happen to be in the synth era is because he didn't have much other say for the guitar part. So his time to shine would always be in the solos. Maybe that's just me.

I've compiled this list of cool/rare Rush stuff including unreleased songs, collaborations, soundchecks, and bootlegs. You more intense fans may have seen all of these, but hopefully you'll find something new. I've seen 99% of these multiple times, but by far the coolest thing is way at the bottom. I found a complete soundcheck from R40 with SOUNDBOARD AUDIO. Had no clue that existed! So enjoy!

Edit: I'll do more organization and add more in a bit. My phone's about to die.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So right now we're kind of in a limbo as fans. We don't know if we're getting a new Rush album or not. When asked if Rush is in Limbo, Geddy responded:

*"No, I don't think 'limbo' is the right way to describe it. I can't speak for them - in fact, I'm certainly not speaking for them, just for me - but I found the end of the tour to be a very sad time. I was melancholy for quite a while because I felt it was... truncated. I'm not saying that my partners weren't justified in their decision - I'm not criticising their decision in any way. I'm just describing my feeling. And I wasn't ready to end the tour. And the thought that it might have been our last one really hit me pretty hard. So it took me a while to get past that point. And I am past that point, and now I'm trying to think about what the future might bring for me. I'm trying to be more optimistic about it. And I have gotten drunk with Al a couple of times, and Al is... well, he's Al. If I call him, he's there."* [(Source)](http://cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/prog-02.2016.php)

That's comforting. But let's go back all the way to R40. Well, two years *prior* to R40. In an online article for Rolling Stone in 2013, Geddy was asked about a 40th anniversary tour. This is what he said:

*"I think [2015 will be the earliest for something new]. Something like that. . . The plan now is to have no plans. We have had a great 10 years of tour, album, tour album. I can honestly say that the three of us enjoyed this tour more than any one we've ever done. We left on a high note, but we recognize that we need to pay attention to our families and recharge our batteries. So we decided that we're just not going to discuss anything for a little while."* [(Source)](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/q-a-rushs-geddy-lee-on-finally-taking-a-break-from-the-road-20130923)

So they didn't shut down anything, but they didn't say yes either. It's comforting to know that they can spin it around so quickly. And much like in this article, both Al and Ged seem eager to continue for another album.

Now flash forward to the R40 tour announcement. In a press conference early 2015, the band said this:

*"These not-to-be-missed concerts will highlight four decades of the bands music, [this] will most likely be their last major tour of this magnitude."* [(Source)](http://ultimateclassicrock.com/rush-last-major-tour/)

That has been since confirmed in numerous interviews. So everything seemed bleak, when this article appears!

*"That question was posed many times: Is this is? Is this the end? I don't think it is the end, and we never really said this is definitively our last tour. I think it's likely to be our last major tour, but we're still in contact, very close contact with each other, all three of us, and I don't think it's certainly the end of the band. There are still lots of things we want to do. It's not to say that we wouldn't do something in the future on a smaller scale, and there's always the fun project of making a record, which we've all loved forever. Right now I think we're just kind of relaxing and taking it in and getting reconnected with our families and friends and more of a domestic life, and then we'll kinda sort of review it, I think, in the new year and see what we want to do."* [(Source)](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/6762657/rush-alex-lifeson-r40-tour-interview)

So that's cool. Recently, Ged was asked if he'd do another solo album. He responded:

"Yeah. I think I would do another solo record. I have some ideas I've been working on. I love to play, and at this point, if there's going to be less of my time devoted to playing in Rush then I'm going to have to find a hobby." [(Source)](

But about Rush itself, these are more comments from the same interview:

**Q: [There was a 5 year wait between S A and CA. Is it fair to say there's a new album coming in 2017?]**

*"I'm down with that. I dunno. It's a good question. Honestly, I can't tell you. I wish I knew. I'd say there's a chance."*

**Q: [Would you and Alex do an album together not as Rush if things don't work out?]**

*"Yeah. It's an option."*

**Q: [So do we talk about Rush in the past tense or the present tense?]**

*"The present tense. Very much in the present tense."* [(Source)](http://cygnus-x1.net/links/rush/prog-02.2016.php)

So we know we're getting *something*. 2017 will be the soonest though. We'll just have to wait and see! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I didn't screw anything up today!

This is a great song, very tough to play on bass and probably any instrument. It reminds me of the summer I got into Rush, waiting eagerly for R40. This is probably my favorite song on Signals.

Inspired by an Edgar Lee Masters poem called Jonathan Houghton, the lyrics had a spin on this:

 And a boy lies in the grass

 Near the feet of the old man,

 And looks up at the sailing clouds,

 And longs, and longs, and longs

 For what, he knows not.

Also, according to Neil the girl with "fawn brown legs" was a girl he met whole vacationing in Ohio with his family during the summer of 1967.

	<DATE> 2016-02-12 02:33:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been a life long fan of Genesis and Dream Theater (thanks, dad), a fan of Floyd since I was 10ish, a fan of Rush for 2 years (which evolved into me being crazy about them), and I've had an interest in Yes for a year or so. Today, I bought the following records:

* Breathless (Camel)
* Pictures At An Exhibition (Emerson, Lake, and Palmer)
* Tarkus (Emerson...)
* The Missing Piece (Gentle Giant)
* Stormwatch (Jethro Tull)

These are bands I've heard referred to as classic/essential prog, but have never checked out. Right now I have Pictures At An Exhibition playing and it's crazy. I hear its influences in bands I already know. I also like the singer's voice. My only other dive below entry prog was King Crimson, you know which one. It was...quite interesting. I've also read that The Missing Piece is NOT the Gentle Giant album to start with, but that's all they had and it was $2.

What do you think about the albums I got? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Often called their best album, I disagree. While it's good for sure, I just like others more. There have been days though where it temporarily pops to #1.

This was also the first album I learned to play all the way through on bass. Sadly, it's been a bit since I played Camera Eye so I'll probably have to relearn it.

Song rankings from favorite to least (1 favorite, 7 is least)

1. YYZ 10/10
2. Red Barchetta 10/10
3. Tom Sawyer 10/10
4. Limelight 10/10
5. Vital Signs 9/10
6. The Camera Eye 8/10
7. Witch Hunt 8/10

Overall rating is about 9/10.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was bored, so I thought it would be fun to come up with an extended version of Scenes. It's across 3 acts with a total of 12 scenes and 30 songs (roughly). Each additional song has a similar meaning to what's occurring in the story/with the characters. Some songs, like This Dying Soul, have a different meaning, but you should be able to get them by just glancing at the lyrics. If you want me to elaborate anywhere, just let me know. Anyway, the tracklist goes:

	<DATE> 2016-02-05 10:37:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know a few:

* The Decision is ***obviously*** inspired by Flight Of The Conchords.

* Three Minutes Of Ecstasy has a very Bee Gees feel to it. Namely Nights On Broadway

* Accept My Shaft is straight up The Doors with Dan's vocals and the piano. It's almost The Changeling + End Of The Night

* The Sacred Chalice reminds me of something, but I can't quite put my finger on it. Maybe a bit of Genesis is in there.

* Everybody Shut Up! is reminiscent of Tenacious D I guess all of the skits are too.

* Rhinoceratops Vs Superpuma is clearly inspire by Flight Of The Conchord's Hiphopopotamus Vs Rhymenoceros

* 6969 is Rush inspired in many ways. It's main song is reminiscent of the Synth Era (Signals-Hold Your Fire) and the end is ripped from By-Tor And The Snowdog </TEXT>

	<TEXT> EDIT: Sorry, I was talking to someone about the Dream Theater song Heaven's Cove while making the last one.

This is a really great instrumental and easily one of their best songs ever. A great song to play on any instrument.

If I had one criticism, it'd have to be that this was *clearly* a drum and bass jam. They even said Dirk and Pratt made it while in a barn and Alex was doing something in the house. However, that guitar solo is awesome.

	<TEXT> I noticed this first with Headlong Flight's similarities to Bastille Day in both key, riffs, and structure. But then I was thinking and though Caravan seemed similar to Fly By Night. I went through the rest of the album and found some songs that were similar to other Rush songs. It'd fit with the theme of the album (looking back on life) and the story clearly being about Neil with Rush. Do you agree with my thoughts?

Caravan - Fly By Night

BU2B - A Passage To Bangkok

Clockwork Angels - Cygnus X-1 (both parts)

The Anarchist - The Fountain Of Lamneth (specifically Didacts And Narpets) and Driven possibly

Carnies - What You're Doing

Halo Effect - Closer To The Heart

Seven Cities Of Gold - Scars

The Wreckers - Grand Designs

Headlong Flight - Bastille Day

Wish Them Well - Workin Them Angels and Cinderella Man

The Garden - Different Strings (especially with the piano) and Resist </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ordering was rough especially when I could hear my own voice reading the credit card number. Plus the girl on the other end was nice but it felt like she was judging me. The pizza guy arrived early and I raced up stairs for change. I stuttered a bit while talking, fumbled with the change, scribbled a "signature", tried to give him back the pizza while taking the receipt, and then tried to give him the receipt when he wanted the pen. Then he left and my dog went after him and wouldn't come when I called so he ended up walking back to the house with my dog trailing him. I also was wearing a dirty shirt that I've been wearing for a bit over a week straight and pajama bottoms.

	<DATE> 2016-01-30 03:44:27 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> ***TL;DR - "As a very young boy, Nafaryus was always zipping in and out of the palace halls and buzzing around his fathers feet trying to get the busy Emperors attention (hence the nickname BUG)."***

*"One day while on one of these journeys [Faythe] stumbled upon the Great Hall of Artifacts buried deep within its underground corridors. It is here that she found something remarkable; an antique digital music player very common during decades past but now deemed obsolete. It was filled with thousands of songs from all sorts of talented artists from a distant time when music was still created and performed by humans. It had a strange engraving on the back that simply said, To BUG. She didnt know what it meant but that never mattered to her."*

___

*"It is then that Empress Arabelle expresses that shes seen enough of this stubbornness between [Faythe and Bug] and enlightens [Bug] to the fact that if he doesnt agree to this meeting, his daughter will never forgive him and that he will lose her forever.*

*I remember a time when you too possessed Faythes romantic innocence and passion for lifes unexplored mysteriesBUG. says Arabelle to her husband.*

*It is then that Faythe realizes that the word BUG inscribed on the back of her music player was referring to her father and that it once belonged to him!*

*It had been given to him as a gift by his own father who shared the same secret affinity for music made by humans as Faythe eventually would. As a very young boy, Nafaryus was always zipping in and out of the palace halls and buzzing around his fathers feet trying to get the busy Emperors attention (hence the nickname BUG). The rare times when he wasn't consumed with balancing the many affairs of The Realm, his father would privately submit to the therapeutic bliss of his own secretly kept digital music player, oftentimes inviting young Nafaryus to indulge in these undisclosedsoul-soothing escapes. His gift of themusic player to his son was his way of letting Nafaryus know that they would always have that special connection no matter how complicated life may eventually get."* </TEXT>

"Rush's don't do stuff like that. They got these lyrics about... how trees are talking to each other, and how different sides of your brain works, and outer space bullshit."

	<TITLE> How do you think I can summon a leak for The Astonishing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-16 23:27:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm bored today and figured I'd help everybody by doing whatever they might think could help summon a leak for the album were so desperately waiting for. Drop a comment with a (SFW) idea and I'll make an edit with proof that I tried it, saying **Wither** or not it worked. (I just kind of wanna do goofy shit at your command)

Edit 1: Whether. The wither thing was a pun.

Edit 2: Another rule is that it had to be free and realistic. Jesus Christ.

Edit 3: While denying /u/DTnoxon (dtf admin?) 2 million dollars was satisfying, it did not provide a leak.

Edit 4: I got an idea. I'm going to take my dog on a 14 minute (8+5) walk. Possibly this could provide something.

Edit 5: /u/DTnoxon claims to own it already. He may be our only hope. But I don't have $2mil

Edit 6: My walk has just begun. Picture proof coming asap

Edit 7: wait until Monday came up. I'll try.

Edit 8: Here's [picture proof](http://i.imgur.com/Q9W1CES.jpg)

Edit 9: I summoned the dark eternal night who supposedly brings leaks, but he was just kind of in a pissy mood. </TEXT>

**Lyrics**

 nbsp;

When the dragons grow too mighty

To slay with pen or sword

I grow weary of the battle

And the storm I walk toward

When all around is madness

And there's no safe port in view

I long to turn my path homeward

To stop a while with you

 nbsp;

When life becomes as barren

And as cold as winter skies

There's a beacon in the darkness

In a distant pair of eyes

In vain to search for honor

In vain to search for truth

But these things can still be given

Your love has shown me proof </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So what have you figured out about The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-01-12 13:25:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm trying to figure it out and have been stuck for a week. I got the story, but I'm struggling with the other layers. I've got some easy things.

1. It's very obvious that The Chamber Of 32 Doors is about how Peter needs guidance in his life.

2. I'm thinking Lilywhite Lilith could be a metaphor for Jonathan King who helped Genesis get into the music industry. They played off of each other and he led them to a secret path, them stumbling in the dark, and eventually finding the light.

3. The Colony Of Slippermen is about Peter realizing that if he keeps following his libido, all that will happen is he will get an STD (he'll look like the Slippermen).

4. Brother John is both Rael and Peter's goodness that was displayed in Counting Out Time, which wasn't his first sexual encounter mind you, but his first *romantic* encounter. This is pretty obvious.

5. At The Light Dies Down On Broadway I find new meanings which bugs me as it contradicts some of the others. It makes me think that Brother John may be Genesis (which is struggling), New York could be life before Genesis (which he's always able to return to without struggle), and his dick being carried by the Raven represents the movie that he was given the ability to work on (which the creator of shooed him away because he didn't want to be the reason for breaking up Genesis)

Those are just some thoughts though.

What do you have? </TEXT>

Lyrics

 nbsp;

And the men who hold high places

Must be the ones who start

To mold a new reality

Closer to the heart

Closer to the heart

The blacksmith and the artist

Reflect it in their art

They forge their creativity

Closer to the heart

Closer to the heart

 nbsp;

Philosophers and ploughmen

Each must know his part

To sow a new mentality

Closer to the heart

Closer to the heart

You can be the captain

I will draw the chart

Sailing into destiny

Closer to the heart </TEXT>

**Lyrics**

 nbsp;

'To seek the sacred river Alph

To walk the caves of ice

To break my fast on honeydew

And drink the milk of Paradise...'

 nbsp;

I had heard the whispered tales of immortality

The deepest mystery

From an ancient book I took a clue

I scaled the frozen mountain tops of eastern lands unknown

Time and Man alone

Searching for the lost Xanadu

 nbsp;

Xanadu...

 nbsp;

To stand within the Pleasure Dome

Decreed by Kubla Khan

To taste anew the fruits of life

The last immortal man

To find the sacred river Alph

To walk the caves of ice

Oh, I will dine on honeydew

And drink the milk of Paradise

 nbsp;

A thousand years have come and gone but time has passed me by

Stars stopped in the sky

Frozen in an everlasting view

Waiting for the world to end, weary of the night

Praying for the light

Prison of the lost

Xanadu

 nbsp;

Xanadu...

 nbsp;

Held within the Pleasure Dome

Decreed by Kubla Khan

To taste my bitter triumph

As a mad immortal man

Nevermore shall I return

Escape these caves of ice

For I have dined on honeydew

And drunk the milk of Paradise </TEXT>
