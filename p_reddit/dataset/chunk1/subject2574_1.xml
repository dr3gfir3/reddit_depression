	<TITLE> If you bought a non-refundable airline ticket for IPL6, these links might help you. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-03-05 02:57:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had to cancel tickets in the past, and sometimes its not a lost cause.   Here are some links to several airlines that might help any of you who bought tickets out.

*Note: this is for domestic flights.  Unfortunately, I don't have much experience with international flight cancellations.*

**FIRST**: If you purchased your ticket within the past 24 hours, you can request a refund on any airline due to government regulations: [link](http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2012-10-23/travel/sc-trav-1023-travel-mechanic-20121023_1_american-airlines-refund-full-fare)

*Note: most of these are not true refunds. They are mostly just ticket credits you can use for another flight within a certain time period.*

**Delta**

[Refund FAQ](http://www.delta.com/content/www/en_US/support/faqs/preparing-for-your-trip/refunds-faqs.html): 

 Even if your ticket is not refundable, you might still be able to cancel your itinerary. You have one year from the ticket's original issue date to reschedule your travel without losing the full value of the ticket (less any applicable change fees).

[Itinerary Cancel Link](https://www.delta.com/mytrips/)


**American**

I've had mixed success with their refund process.  Sometimes I get a large portion back as a credit towards a future flight, sometimes they just say GTFO and I'm outta lukc.

Language:

 Subject to certain restrictions and fees defined in the rules of the fare, the value of a wholly unused nonrefundable ticket may only be used toward the purchase of a new nonrefundable ticket. Travel on such reissued tickets (or subsequently reissued tickets) must commence no later than one year from the date of issue of the original ticket. The value of an AA nonrefundable fare can only be applied to the value of another AA nonrefundable fare. The value of an AA non-refundable fare cannot be applied to the purchase of another airline refundable/nonrefundable fare.

Link: [refund request](https://prefunds.aa.com/refunds/)

**United**

Unfortunatley, I've had zero luck with United over the years. But it doesn't hurt to try: [refund link](http://www.united.com/web/en-us/content/reservations/refunds/refund.aspx).

**Virgin America**

IIRC, Virgin charges a $100 fee.  Which is better than nothing, I suppose.

 Nonrefundable fares must be cancelled prior to scheduled departure time. In the event a non-refundable ticket is cancelled prior to flight departure, the guest will receive a credit file in the value of the refund minus any change fee. This electronic credit may be used to book travel on Virgin America within 12 months from the cancellation date of the original itinerary.

No link for Virgin --  you need to login to your itinerary and there should be a link.

**AirTran**

The one or two times I tried with them, I had to call them directly at  866-5-REFUND.  They charged a cancellation fee, but I did get back at least a portion of my original ticket cost.

**SouthWest**

Never personally cancelled on them, but I've heard of mixed successes from friends.  Though all of them were minus a cancellation fee (sometimes substantial).  [refund link](http://www.southwest.com/flight/cancel-air-reservation.html) </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2011-04-05 13:22:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *tl;dr: We are all immensely proud of SCReddit's success. Several days ago, I sat down with FearGorm and talked to him about the origins and people involved in that great endeavor.  We also talked about his team's history and goals with their new project, WellPlayed. This is their story.*

*in service of full disclosure, I will be writing several articles for WellPlayed in the coming weeks and months. FearGorm and his team were impressed enough with my previous posts to offer me the privilege of writing for their new site.*

*This article is also posted at [http://wellplayed.org](http://wellplayed.org), but I wrote this piece with /r/starcraft in my mind, and with this community as the intended audience.  The team below has done great things for /r/starcraft, and I felt it was important that their tale is not forgotten.*

**For Us, The Living**

In the late, hot days of Summer 2010, shortly after Starcraft II's long climb out of beta, /r/starcraft was a community that was missing something. Not members, or content, but community events they could gather around. The subreddit talked about the beta, about Team Liquid, about HD and Husky and others.

What this subreddit didn't talk about, because we couldn't, was our own members regularly competing in our own events for the enjoyment of our own community.

Then FearGorm started the [SCReddit Open](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/cvw53/introducing_screddit_open_a_weekly_tournament_for/).

And just like that, the many talented players of /r/starcraft had a home.  

As regularly as possible, we gathered, and we played.  We cheered our first winner, and every subsequent winner, as [champions of our own](http://screddit.com/open/hall-of-fame/).   Great games were played, with upsets and streaks, complaints of imbalance and teary eyed wails of QQ.   We watched chompyyy, and WinHouse, and NrGdde, and all the rest.

We laughed, we cried, and all we got out of it, at least initially, was simple prestige.  Not prestige with anyone outside /r/starcraft, but bragging rights within.  

The team that assembled behind FearGorm grew stronger with each passing SCReddit Open.  First came live streams, then higher quality justin.tv streams.  Then prizes and small amounts of money.  Each Open was stronger than the last, and /r/starcraft grew to know not only the players, but the casters.

But that wasnt enough.  SCReddit Open was known mostly within the halls of /r/starcraft.  FearGorm, and others, wanted a bigger event.  Something to put SCReddit on the map.

**Glory Road**

There was a brief but strong moment of incredulity during the GSL World Championships when White-Ras [info card flashed on the screen](http://i.imgur.com/luToT.png) and it proudly stated that he was the SCReddit Invitational Championship.

Surprised though we were, looking back, the SCReddit Invitational was equal in quality to any other Starcraft II tournament.  It was produced to the highest standards, gathered more views on the stream than anything else until TSL3, and included outstanding players of all nationalities and races.  It was even commentated by Day9, djWHEAT and a whole crew of talented, well-known casters.

It was, in short, ample reason for the SCReddit team, and /r/starcraft, to feel extremely proud.

But the transition from SCReddit Opens to the SCReddit Invitational is seemingly large, an abrupt leap forward in scale, complexity, and sheer production quality.

How did this happen?

As with many things, it started with a group of dedicated people.

**By His Bootstraps**

The initial post that [introduced the SCReddit Invitational](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/elpyb/introducing_the_screddit_invitational_600_prize/) (SCRI) revealed the prize pool.  With help from a very generous and dedicated group of Redditors, over $600 was raised.  But just having sponsors wasnt enough.  A great tournament is derived from a multitude of areas: production, art, organization, brackets, and referees; SCReddit needed help, and it was looking for help from the community that had supported them for so long.

They needed all the untapped talent that we, /r/starcraft, could offer up.  And offer up we did.

SCRI had wonderful referees. Fair and organized, they kept the entire event running smoothly without any major hiccups.  They ensured that matches were set up correctly, that players were where they were supposed to be.  They were the arbiters, and they took their roles seriously.

SCRI had incredible production values.  Their VODs were some of the best ever seen. The hype videos, the website, the sheer professionalism of the entire tournament rivaled that of any other.  Every aspect rang with quality.

SCRI had awesome players.  SCRI truly succeeded in its goal of drawing great players to a tournament supported by the Reddit community.  Players who were famous through the scene, and who could bring to bear their massive talents to produce games that every fan would enjoy: KiwiKaki, White-Ra, TT1, and more.

*Its All Still There.* 

Check it out if you havent seen it at: [http://screddit.com/invitational/](http://screddit.com/invitational/)

**Time Enough for Love**

Some time before the SCRI, the SCReddit team discovered that they really wanted a good, robust tournament management system to make their lives easier.  Running a tournamnt was hard work and immensely time consuming.  Anything to make the process more streamlined and manageable would greatly reduce overhead.

So just as theyve done before and since, [they put out a plea for help](http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/ekuba/want_to_make_a_tournament_management_system_for/).

And just as weve done before and since, we answered.  Developers and designers from across the world put in their time and effort into creating a system for running events.

Somewhere along the line, a name was decided: WellPlayed.  

And somewhere along alone the line, dreams grew bigger, goals more ambitious, and the desire to truly create a space for SC2 more determined than ever.

**Citizen of the Galaxy**

Much of the team that created and produced the SCRI still remains to this day, working tirelessly to promote esports and to create quality content.

Shortly after the SCRI, they were contacted by some of the biggest names in the scene.

At PAX East, this team  now going by the moniker WellPlayed  was tagged to help produce Day9s and Huskys VODs. Working in tandem with the two popular casters, WellPlayed cut and edited videos that really highlighted that talents of Day9 and Husky, and provided the community with yet another round of good, high-quality Starcraft II content.

WellPlayed, previously SCReddit, proved once again that they were eminently capable of producing great content for fans.

Unknown to us, their performance at PAX East was but a precursor to grander dreams still to come.

**Time For the Stars**

WellPlayed wanted more.  Not only out of themselves, but also out of the community at large.  They wanted better ways of consuming streams, easier ways of following tournaments, and less time-consuming methods of managing events.

They wanted, in short, a custom-created hub for all things Starcraft II.  A hub that acted as a nexus for the entire scene, that gathered fans, and players, and streams in one place for discussion, for consumption, for organizing.

Never known to back down from a challenge, the WellPlayed team built exactly that.

With the core group of developers, artists, producers, writers and marketers that helped create the SCRI, and with additional help from even more members of /r/starcraft from around the world, WellPlayed slowly crawled itself towards reality.

And now, after countless hours of blood, sweat and tears, WellPlayed is ready to show the world their newest project.

**Beyond This Horizon**

FearGorm was careful to note that the site wasnt built because the WellPlayed team was dissatisfied with the community at /r/starcraft, at Team Liquid, or anywhere else.  The team was well aware of the effect that the subreddit and Team Liquid has in drawing and motivating the legions of fans.

They were aware that they were standing on the shoulders of giants.  Aware that they were working within an environment created by very dedicated and passionate people that came before.

What the WellPlayed team was dissatisfied with, however, was the platform.

They felt that though both /r/starcraft and Team Liquid had great communities, the platform on which they resided wasnt something that was specifically made, custom tailored to their needs.  Just as they wanted to give the /r/starcraft community a tournament they could call their own with the SCReddit Opens and SCRI, now they want to give the community a home to call their own.  

A home designed not to divide the community, but to bring it together so that new members, new players and new fans could more easily discover just what it is that we love and devote some much of our time and energy towards.

eSports.  Starcraft II.

**To Sail Beyond the Sunset**

And so, after talking with FearGorm and learning what the WellPlayed team has planned, I sayI hope we all sayto them:

**gl. hf.**

And for what theyve done with SCReddit for the /r/starcraft communty:

*tl;dr: White-Ra is a hero. And has been a hero. Since forever.  And watch his upcoming games in NASL and TSL3.  White-Ra will be facing MC again in TSL Ro16.*

**Stemming the Tide**

After day one of the GSL World Championship team game, the Korean team was behind the World team, and things were in danger of spiraling out of control. TT1 carried back to back wins against HoSeo.San and oGsNaDa, and entered the GOM studios high on his victories.

oGsMC and Team Korea had seen enough.

The current best Starcraft II player in the world, oGsMC was Team Korea's best chance to regain momentum and shift the winds in their favor.  As he proved in his GSL Team League 2 performance against team SlayerS, MC was an opponent capable of taking multiple consecutive victories against a variety of players and races.

After a brief PvP battle, TT1 fell. A small win by itself, but large in significance. 

Team Korea had made its stand.

As Artosis talked with his World team, and Tasteless stood ready to commentate on the next game, who would go out to face oGsMC?

Who would, in turn, make a stand for the World?

As it turns out, Artosis knew exactly who to send.

**Rage Against the Machine**

In 2006, on the main stage of the WCG Grand Final in Italy, White-Ra was preparing to face one of the toughest opponents of the event.

A Korean player by the name of iloveoov.

Nicknamed the Monster Terran and the Machine Terran, iloveoov was a few years past his era of absolute dominance, and the the air of invincibility that resulted in his miraculous 34-9 win/loss ratio in 2003.  But he was still extremely potent, and not someone to be taken lightly.

Using effective drop harassment with Reavers, White-Ra managed to deal significant economic damage to iloveoov.  Unfortunately, iloveoov's macro proved to be too resilient, and in both games, the Machine Terran engaged in a slow but steady march towards White-Ra's bases.  Despite dark templar harassment and more Reaver drops, iloveoo's inevitable advance could not be stopped.

Ultimately, White-Ra would gg in a 0-2 loss. 

But the strands of fate are woven strangely, and this would not be the only chance White-Ra would have against a top Korean player.

Popular around the world, the WCG match was broadcasted internationally, and casted in multiple languages in multiple streams.

Who casted for the English stream?

[None other than Tasteless.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElkVcQJ7PMQ)

He, too, would have another chance to see White-Ra face a top Korean player.

**A Game of Thrones**

It was 2009. The IEF group stage. White-Ra was set to face a Korean Brood War legend: Boxer.

Utilizing similar tactics he employed against iloveoov at the WCG Grand Final, White-Ra drop harassed with Reavers and Dark Templars to absolutely demolish Boxer's economy.  Simultaneous to this harassment, White-Ra started multi-pronged attacks that forced the Terran to defend on multiple fronts.  

Eventually, it proved too much.  Dragoons at the front and harassing Reavers at the back pushed Boxer's forces into a pincer. 

In front of a large Korean audience, in a live televised match, White-Ra defeated the Terran Emperor.

Who else was watching, and cheering, at the back of the crowd?

[Artosis.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u8NLWHE8UW0#t=242s)

He, too, would have another chance to see White-Ra battle against a top Korean player.

**You Shall Not Pass**

At over 30 years of age, White-Ra is one of the oldest active professional players of Starcraft II.  But with age comes wisdom, and poise under pressure.  

Artosis and Team World decide to send White-Ra, counting on his experience in live televised games against Korean players to bring out his best abilities.

Protoss versus Protoss in Starcraft II is a volatile match up.  There's not often any chance for finesse or elegance, with brute force clashes between two similarly composed armies happening with fair frequency.

But White-Ra wouldn't have any of that.

With Tasteless and Artosis looking on in wonder, and perhaps flashing privately to those games they watched White-Ra play so many years ago, the Ukrainian Protoss engaged once again in drop harass.

Flying warp prisms instead of shuttles, White-Ra repeatedly warped in units inside oGsMC's mineral line.  Harassing zealots caused massive economic damage, and despite MC's best efforts in meticulous Stalker blink micro, the Kratos Protoss was fighting a losing battle on two sides.

A Brood War player of White-Ra's calibre, however, is not just about harassment.  Showing the world some of the best Protoss vs Protoss micro thus far in Starcraft II, White-Ra engaged in a calculated push towards MC.  With White-Ra's continued Zealot drops and constant pressure at the front, MC was steadily losing ground.

In the end, just as he almost accomplished against iloveoov, and just as he did accomplish against Boxer, White-Ra's economic harass put MC into a deep enough hole that defeat was inevitable.

gg. oGsMC was defeated. 

The deadliest player Team Korea had to send was limited to a single win.  

The World answered Korea's stand with a stand of their own.

As White-Ra made his victory lap, Tasteless and Artosis may have stood back, reminisced, and thought: "Yeah, I've seen that before."

Well played, White-Ra. 

*What's next for White-Ra? Among other tournaments, White-Ra will be in NASL and TSL3.*

**Don't miss White-Ra's upcoming Round of 16 match against MC in TSL3. A rematch I can't wait to see.** </TEXT>

**Salad Days**

One week way back in the prehistoric days of Starcraft, Blizzard had just about wrapped up its beta testing of Brood War.  Just prior to the retail release of the expansion, Blizzard decided to conduct its very own King of the Beta tournament to determine just who was the best Starcraft player at the time.  Many competed, and in the end, MIT computer science student Zileas, a Protoss, proved to be the champion.

*Zileas was a Westerner.*

The Protoss MIT student's reign was soon eclipsed by one of the more dominant players of the time, Maynard.  The name will probably sound familiar to you. Maynard was one of the first to engage in what is now one of the most common sights in professional Starcraft: the worker transfer.  Whenever you hear someone say that they are "maynarding", remember Miguel "Maynard" Bombach.

*Maynard was a Westerner.*

All good things, however, must be followed by an even brighter thing. Maynard's rule was not eternal, and soon a player named Grrr.... would take center stage.  A Protoss player, Grrr.... was perhaps Starcraft's first true era.  No one could touch him. At the turn of the millennium, Grrr.... set his sights on Korea.  He landed shortly in the burgeoning months of 2000, and proceeded to rampage his way through any and all that Korea had to offer. He won the very first OSL, and being dominant in the earliest days of Korea's televised Starcraft scene, became a veritable celebrity.

*Grrr.... was a Westerner.*

But then, a shift. A disturbance in the Force.

**The Emperor's Empire**

The BoxeR that crashed into the Korean Starcraft scene was not the struggling, elder statesmen that most know from today's GSL. This BoxeR, this Terran Emperor, was at the peak and prime of his playing abilities.  With the rise of BoxeR, Grrr.... would never match the successes of his former days.

But dominance was not the sole domain of BoxeR.  As with all things, another challenger eventually rose up to contest the existing champion. In this case, it was iloveoov.

And after iloveoov, there came NaDa, and July, and Saviour and Bisu and Flash and Jaedong.  

There did not come, however, a Westerner.  

**The New Capital**

With the fall of Grr...., no other Westerner was a dominating force over the entire Starcraft scene for an extended period of time.  The capital of the esport, the heart and soul and largest concentration of the most skilled players in the world lay squarely in South Korea.

And so it has stayed that way, from 2002 all the way to the current Brood War scene.

**Wings of Liberty**

But that's Brood War.  What about SC2? It's a different game, with different units and different balances.  Does Korea continue to maintain a stranglehold on the most elite of the elite?

Yes.  

But perhaps not for long.

One of the biggest contributing factors to Korea's dominance in Brood War has been the country's extremely competitive scene.  Sponsors carried a multitude of teams that trained dozens of talented players.  These players lived together in team houses and trained for countless hours in countless matches against against countless opponents. It was an environment that rewarded hard work with glory, fame, and a relative degree of wealth.

With the announcement of the NASL, the continuing tournaments of MLG, and the amazing groups of players gathered in Europe for Assembly and Dreamhack, the international scene is starting to resemble in sheer number and opportunity, the tournament scene of Brood War's South Korea.

Serious money is on the line; in fact, more money is being given out now in SC2 than in any other period in Brood War.  

Hard work is and will be rewarded with glory, fame, and a pretty fat honking wad of money.  A bonjwa, a player who dominates for an entire era, could very well see earnings of more than $300,000 in tournaments alone in less than than a full year.  GSL, MLG, NASL, Assembly, Dreamhack, TSL. Even the rumored IGN Starleague.

It's what some would call a target rich environment.

**If You Can't Beat Them...**

Many Western teams have started to adopt what were previously predominantly Korean methods of training.  Team Liquid players in the GSL live in the same house and train together every day.  Recently, TT1, Fenix, Catz and Drewbie announced that they were forming a pro house.  

The opportunities of non-Korean tournaments is fostering the same kind of environment that Brood War did for Korea.  

Improvement must be rapid, or some other player will improve more rapidly and steal that cash prize.

**Here, There Be Dragons**

But it won't be an easy road.  The nature of many international tournaments are that they accept any and all who would wish to test their skills.  This includes the current crop of top Korean Starcraft players.  

MVP, Nestea, MC, NaDa have all participated or will participate in a variety of Western tournaments like TSL or Dreamhack.  They will not be easy opponents, and the Korean players remain a sizable threat to any players looking at first prize.

**Korea vs the World**

In many ways then, the upcoming matches will be one of the first true tests of Western vs Korean skill.  Players are in the studio. Games are played in the same region.  Lag is minimized.  All factors not involving player skill is normalized out of the equation.

The Koreans have chosen their elite eight: 

*IMNestea*. Zerg. GSL Champion. Considered one of the safest and most consistent players in the world.

*IMMvp*. Terran. GSL Champion. Nicknamed by Artosis the Game Genie Terran.  Considered nigh invincible in TvT.

*MarinKingPrime*.  Terran. Two time GSL finalist. Ushered in a huge metagame shift that involved fast, tempo based play with a highly mobile bio based army.  

*oGsNaDa*. Terran. Nicknamed the Genius Terran in Brood War, NaDa is still ranked as amongst the most successful Brood War players of all time.

*oGsMC*. Protoss. Two time GSL Champion. Completely decimated both his opponents in both GSL finals.  Confident. Arrogant. And with the skills to back it up.

*ST_July*. Zerg. GSL finalist. Nicknamed the God of War, he was one of the few Brood War players to snatch championships in multiple distinct eras. Has a unique play style unlike any other Zerg in the world.

*anyproPrime*. Protoss. Probably considered amongst the weakest of the lineup of 8, he's still formidable in all matchups.

*sanZenith*. Protoss. The Cinderella story of GSL March. Knocked out both Nestea and Boxer in the round of 32. 

**The World vs Korea**

The world is jostling at a chance to fight against the Koreans.  Qualifying torments have been going in all major gaming regions on the planet. Winners from those qualifiers are flying from North America, Europe, and even non-Korea Asian countries.

Representing the World in this event:

*MoonGlade*. Zerg. Australia. Seeded GSL Code A. 4th at IEM. 

*MorroW*. Zerg. Sweden. Placed 1st at IEM Cologne in a victory over Idra. Known for mid-game macro.

*Sen*. Zerg. Taiwan. Arguably Taiwan's top player in both Brood War and SC2. Appearances at MLG Dallas and GSL3. Watch his NASL application video for great hilarity: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ICPy7kVu0cI  

*Dimaga*. Zerg. Ukraine. Participated at IEM Cologne. Had some controversy in TSL2 that resulted in a ban from TSL3.

*Jinro*. Terrran. Sweden. Nicknamed by Koreans as the Gorilla Terran. Known for strong macro, only Westerner to make it to round of 4 twice in the GSL.  Some say he's the best Western Terran player in the world at the moment. GSL Code S.

*HuK*. Protoss. Canada. GSL Code S. Famous for his "that's halo" comment at MLG DC in a game against SelecT. Good unit control, and interesting strategies when he's at his best.

*TT1*. Protoss. Canada. MLG Dallas 2nd place after a loss to Jinro. 

*White-Ra*. Protoss. Ukraine. 3rd place at Blizzcon 2010. One of the oldest of the World players, but has a long history of Starcraft experience. 

Who will win? 

Will the era of Western domination that ended with Grrr.... ever reappear? 

No ones knows for sure, but one thing is certain.

**The games next week will be a taste of things to come.  It will be the first battle in a war for Starcraft II supremacy.**

	<TITLE> Sit down, my friends, and let me tell you the story of GSL Team League 2 (spoilers) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-03-24 17:11:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **tl;dr: just read the freaking thing.** Every sc2 esports fan needs to know.  It will become part of SC2 lore.

**NOTE: Do yourself a favor and watch the games.**

**Two Roads Converge**

OUR STORY UNFOLDS with two paths, one begun in the summer days of Brood War, and the other in these early days of Starcraft 2.

Slayers_Boxer, given the opportunity to create a team in Brood War, surrounds himself with a hand picked crowd of then unknown players.  Most of them do well, but one -- iloveoov -- quickly stands out from the rest.  Surpassing even his mentor, iloveoov becomes the first true *bonjwa*. The team that Boxer formed around him would become SKT, truly the greatest Brood War team there ever was.

In another time, and another place, CellaWerra of the Werra clan is playing Starcraft 2.  He makes friends and gains many fans in the foreign audience.  Known for his humor and his on-stream antics, he quickly makes a name for himself outside Korea with videos such as the [13 Gate build](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJFG8jtU0CM).

Two things happen.  

Slayers_Boxer decides to leave Brood War and start a career in SC2 with the GSL.  He makes his debut in GSL season 2, eventually beating NaDa to advance to the Round of 4. Now deep in the SC2 scene, Boxer needs a team.  Intel answers his call, and sponsors not only a team, but also Boxer himself.  

Meanwhile, the clan Werra is disbanded admist a firestorm of controversy as their coach is accused of sexual misconduct towards Werra members.  And just like that, CellaWerra is just Cella, and needs a team.

Soon, Boxer puts out an open call for the new team he is creating with Intel's support, named Slayers.  Cella applies, and is in.  He becomes Slayers_Cella.  And as Slayers_Cella, he still continues to amuse and entertain his foreign fans, including [a certain rendition of a certain song](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEP05i6plr8).

**First One's Just Practice**

The members that Boxer gathers around himself this time around in the new Slayers team are composed, just like SKT, of relative unknowns. None of the star power or fame that a Nestea or MC possesses.

In February, GSL announces that it will be televising a one week team league.  It features the top 8 teams in SC2 at that time in Korea: oGs, StarTale, Incredible Miracle (IM), Team SCV Life (TSL), For Our Utopia (fOu), ZeNex, Prime, and Slayers.

In an exciting series over a week (that you really should watch), IM manages to take the championship, on the strength of IMNestea, IMSeed and IMMvP.

Slayers, meanwhile, falls in the first round to ZeNex.  Boxer himself came out as first pick for Slayers, and falls in the first game to ZeNex, one of the weaker teams. 

But one player on Slayers stood out in that series: Slayers_ Jjob.  In an almost reverse all kill, he went last in the Slayers lineup against ZeNex, and took out 3 of ZeNex's players.  

**An Emperor Falters**

With a team around him and sponsors to support him, Boxer seems primed to focus on advancing in Code S.  Unfortunately, in the March Code S season, he falls in the first round of 32 to SanZenith and Ensnare. In the following Up and Down matches, Boxer loses again.  

Boxer, the Emperor himself, is in Code A.

At the same moment that Boxer falls to Code A, however, another Slayers player -- Slayers_Alicia -- plays an extraordinary series against IMMvP, advancing to Code S while simultaneously helping to knock MvP down to Code A. This would not be the last time viewers would see Alicia.

**This Time for Serious -- or, GSL Team League 2**

GSL Team League 2 started with the same 8 team lineup.  Of the 8 teams, the general ranking was:

Top Tier: oGs, IM, TSL, ST
Lower Tier: Prime, ZeNex, fOu, Slayers

Most people put Slayers below even the lower tier, given their past performance in the team league and the obscurity of their players.

Viewers were introduced for the first time to the new vice-coach of team Slayers: Slayers_Cella.  Carrying a notebook and constantly talking to his team members, Cella was perhaps the person that Slayers needed the most.  A coach who could focus on strategy, not just at the player level, but at the team level.  Someone who could see the flow of the team vs team battles, and make calls about who to send out.

Slayers's first opponent was oGs.  Home to NaDa, TOP and 2 time GSL Champion MC, oGs were heavy favorites to win the team league.  MC appeared to be unstoppable, and NaDa and TOP rounded out a bevy of top tier players.

**The Birth of a Legend Killer**

oGs vs Slayers starts off with matches between Min, InCa and TOP that leaves the score at 1-1. In response, Slayers sends out Ryung.  In a series of 2 games, Ryung demonstrates a masterful understanding of TvT. At every step of each game, he was composed, calm, and knew exactly what to do and when to do it.

Down 3-1, oGs had nowhere to go. What could they do but send out oGsMC?

Hot off the highs of winning an unprecedented second GSL Code S championship, oGsMC was considered by most to be the single best SC2 player in the world at that point.  

And he proves it, by defeating Ryung and Frozen.  

The score is now 3-3. Cella gathers his notes. 

Slayers sends out **Slayers_MMA**.  

Who the hell is Slayers_MMA?  Slayers_MMA is the new name of Slayers_Jjob, the player who nearly reverse all-killed ZeNex in the prior team league.

In a furious game of micro timings, MMA managed to defeat MC and create one of the great upsets of the season. 

Slayers, considered the worst team of the previous team league, advances over oGs.

**Entering the Octagon**

Next up for Slayers is team StarTale. Trying to prove himself, Frozen opens up for Slayers.  In a surprise move, StarTale decides to lead with JulyZerg.

Frozen fared no better against July than he did against MC the previous day.  Down 0-1, who could Slayers send out against July, the Code S finalist?

**Slayers_MMA**.

In a quick game, MMA decisively defeats July. And every single StarTale player until STBomber.  In an amazing comeback play, STBomber bridges a huge deficit to defeat MMA. The score was now 3-1, Slayres lead.

One more win for Slayers would end the series.  And it happens. The TvT master Slayers_Ryung steps out once again, and defeats STBomber for the win.

*Slayers is now in the finals.*

**Perchance to Dream**

Team Incredible Miracle, with no less than two GSL champions in their roster, is widely considered to be the most consistent top tier team in Starcraft 2.  

The finals is a best of 9.  First team to five wins seals the deal.

Leading the charge for Slayers was Alicia.  Not having been used at all during the second team league, he makes his debut with an astounding 3-0 run against IM with convincing wins.

Down, IM decides that they should take advantage of PvP and sends out YongHwa.  In a quick back and forth, YongHwa takes the game from Alicia, making the score 3-1.

Comfortably ahead, Slayers decides to send out Slayers_Golden.  Golden, formerly of fOu, is unable to surpass YongHwa.  The score is now 3-2.

Falling once again back to the very solid and consistent Slayers_Ryung, Slayers manages to take a victory over YongHwa with some clutch TvP.  

4-2, Slayers lead.  IM is now against the wall.  With Nestea out, that left only one player they could send.

January GSL champion IMMvp.

** Patch 1.3 and the sweet, sweet sounds of Yamato cannons**

Stepping back a couple hours, Blizzard released Patch 1.3 in Korea just before the finals of the team league.  Patch 1.3 introduced many changes, including a speed buff to Battlecruisers.

Back in the team league finals, Ryung is playing great against IMMvP.  Ryung is sieging at the right moments, expanding at the right timings, and generally avoiding any serious missteps in the complicated chess game that is TvT.

Then MVP breaks all the rules.  **He makes Battlecruisers**.  MVP realizes that with the new speed buff, Battlecruises were once again useful in the TvT endgame.  MVP tears through Ryung's primarily ground and siege tank based army.  With a few clutch Yamato cannon shots at a sizable amount of vikings that Ryung had managed to scrounge up, MVP wins the game.

The score was now 4-3, Slayers lead.

** Pause, Crash, Restart, Pause **

After conferring, Cella and the rest of Slayers decides to send out GanZi next, in an effort to wear down MVP and to gain more information about his playstyle.  

After a series of delays, the game begins only to have GanZi pause and then leave the game.  Drama erupted.  The IM coach could be seen shouting at a GomTV official. 

In the rematch, MVP completely abandons the strategy he was starting to show in the first aborted MVP vs GanZi game, and goes for a quick 5 barracks all marine push.  GanZi is caught flat footed, and loses.

And just like that, the Game Genie Terran equalizes the score.

4-4. Tied.

** Legend vs Legend Killer **

As Slayers has done when facing MC, July, or ZeNex, *out comes Slayers_MMA*.

MMA decides to go for a marine heavy force based on decisive tempo based play.  MVP, meanwhile, decides to play orthodox TvT, getting a fair number of siege tanks and marines. 

The atmosphere is tense.  Nerdchills are experienced. The game to decide it all between the two pillars of each respective team.  

In the end, it comes down to timing.  In a moment so tense that Artosis and Tasteless were reduced to silence as they watched along with the audience, MMA takes advantage of a momentary opening.  He stims and runs.  Tanks explode, and MVP loses his army.

Soon thereafter, it flashes on the screen: **gg**.

MMA wins.

A legend killer. Over the course of a week, Slayers_MMA defeated oGsMC, STJulyZerg and IMMvp.  

Cameras flash.  SlayersBoxer, the Emperor, the founder of SKT, once again holds aloft a championship trophy.

**The Emperor has returned.**

**With minions.**

And Cella?

Cella is now coach of the Korean team for the World Championship games next week. </TEXT>

Transparency, full disclosure, and simply stating facts + opinons.   And the fact that the casters themselves didn't know about it, and djWheat came out as a neutral voice of authority was very well played.  Gives the entire decision the air of legitimacy and thought.

Since you're casting from replays, you have the luxury and the benefits of fairly judging disconnects. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The GSL had incredible story lines and lore. We should remember them. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-03-17 06:35:37 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Note: I don't pretend to guess what the actual officials of NASL are planning to do.  I'm only speaking toward some opinions voiced by some within the community.*

There have been many who argue that NASL is trying to create compelling story lines, and therefore should limit or eliminate Koreans from participating.  They say that creating an environment for the best possible games to be played is secondary or perhaps even contradictory to having an environment with good story lines.

That way, my friends, leads to madness, disappointment, professional wrestling, and FOX channel reality shows.  Do people really want Kitchen Nightmares US the Starcraft version?

**Let's pause for a moment, and think about the GSL thus far.**

The GSL attempted to gather the greatest players of Starcraft II in the world and put them in a single tournament to find out who is the best.  There was no mercy, no handicaps.  Players won and lost on the strength of their skill alone.

And what kind of drama and what kind of story lines developed?

**Incredible ones**.

If we think back to the GSL, there were no prearranged or produced story lines.  All the story lines emerged naturally.

FruitDealer winning Season 1, coming out of forced suspension due to his family, was epic and moving, but not planned.

Boxer/Foxer/MarineKingPrime and his ascension from a player everyone dismissed as a lame copy to a powerhouse who took out the Season 1 champion, and appeared in two GSL Finals was not dreamed up by a wily producer.

oGsMC's confident personality and style -- and his victory in GSL3 and defeat in GSL4 to someone he steamrolled in GSL3 was not the result of a carefully planned PR campaign.

**And there's more!**

IMMvP's meoteoric rise and fall from Code S champion to Up/Down matches participant.

Slayers_Boxer's heartfelt entrance into Starcraft II and his struggles to retain relevancy in the face of younger players.

LiquidJinro's incredible streak to 2 final four appearances, and his back and forth battles with oGsMC.

SanZenith's cinderella story in his last GSL before his military service.

LiquidHuk's road from Code A to trying to reach Code S, and his failures to qualify for pevious GSL opens.

Three titans of Brood War (July, Nada, Boxer) returning to try and reclaim their former glory.

**There are hundreds more moments in not just GSL, but tournaments and games across the world.**

HuK's "that's halo" moment in MLG.   Idra's "Gracken" nickname.  Select's arduous trek to MLG finals through the loser's bracket.  ActionJesus's relentless sixpools at Dreamhack 2010.  Loner and (at that time) NexGenius's epic back and forth at Blizzcon. Unending tie-breakers and "Korean's pwn white people" at IEM 2011. 

These are all moments that arose organically, naturally, unplanned and uncalled.  They rose out of the spirit of competition.

*All this in less than a year since the official retail release of Starcraft II.*

In the well-meaning eagerness of our community to give NASL wide appeal, let's not forget what makes these moments of lore and story so special in the first place:

**Authenticity**.  ** Spontaneity**.   And perhaps most important, **community driven**.

A Starcraft II e-sports scene with drama and plots crafted by producers is not a community I want to be part of.  

I mean, if I wanted that, I'd just dress up at as a giant Zergling and attend a WWE game.

*In the interest of collecting more story lines and lore that developed through the act of play and practice, I'd love to hear other stories I didn't list in the comments.* </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Upvote if you will not buy another season from GOMTV until VLC is restored or GOMPlayer is available for non-Windows. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-03-14 12:18:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **tl;dr**: GOM has now started to actively block VLC and any non GOMPlayer source. This means OS X and Linux users are completely cut off.

Today, in the GSL Season 5 up/down matches of March 14, people using Mac OS X or Linux computers were unable to watch live streams by using VLC.  Due to that, I'm probably not going to buy a pass for season 6. I've paid for passes since the first season of GSL.

**What Happened**

Last week, in the Code A Finals and Code S semi-finals of GSL5, gom started to actively block VLC user agents from working.  Specifically, they stopped serving streams to VLC user agents.  There was a workaround discovered. That worked for a time. 

Then, today, during the Day 1 Up/Down matches, GOM started to exclude everything but the GOMPlayer user agent.  Another workaround was discovered. This worked for around an hour.  Then they appear to have started to block the user agent that GOMPlayer previously used.

There appear to be circumstantial evidence that GOM or someone notifying GOM is monitoring Reddit threads for workarounds to their blocking, and actively preventing new solutions for working for more than a short period of time.

Which this means effectively is that I, or **any other Mac OS X or Linux user**, can no longer watch the HQ stream.

Now, I admit it's within their rights.  They never promised a working stream for any platform not officially supported by GOMPlayer.

Be that as it may, it also means that I won't be purchasing another pass until the issue is resolved. 

They can either restore VLC access or release GOM Player ports to OS X and Windows.  

Until then, GSL, it's been a fun five seasons.  I'll miss ya. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **EDIT 3**:

Looks like GOMTV is possibly watching the Reddit GSL thread and also this thread.  They've now started blocking KPeerClient.  I'm not sure what GOM thinks Mac and Linux users should do.

Not buy anymore season passes, perhaps.

**EDIT 2**:

Looks like in the middle of March 14's live stream, GOMTV once again changed it so that now going directly to the link results in a disconnect.  Sorry guys, still working on trying to figure out a workaround.


**EDIT**: Some people are seeing success by changing VLC's user agent to "KPeerClient".  Changing the user agent isn't working for me, so YMMV.  The method below so far is the only thing I've found that works every time I tried.

For those that can't get VLC working in Mac or Linux, here's a temporary work around:

Save the VLC link to your computer. (Right click link and choose "Save link as".

On mine, the file was named "view.cgi". This is essentially the video stream that VLC would've processed. Your browser may add an extension "view.cgi.crdownload" or "view.cgi.part". Whatever the file name is, use the file that's downloading.

In VLC, open the file.

If you're low on disk space, keep an eye out on the file size of view.cgi. You may need to delete it and redownload occasionally.

**for the technically minded who have some free time**

You can also get this to work on Linux by piping stream output directly to vlc.  in the shell:

    curl "http://yourgomtvstreamlink" | vlc -

"vlc -" tells VLC to read from STDIN.

For Mac OS X users, however, reading from VLC with the OS X version of VLC is unreliable.  In this case, you can try using a named pipe.

In terminal:

    cd ~/Desktop
    mkfifo gomtv
    curl -o "http://yourgomtvstreamlink" gomtv

In VLC:

    File-Advanced Open File (or Command-Shift-O)
    Check the "Treat as a pipe rather than a file" link
    Browse to desktop and choose the gomtv file
    Open

If the named pipe times ou on curl, just restart it.

Someone with more time than me could probably make this into a script. </TEXT>

I killed a terran, but he floated his CC and some other buildings away. i had some time to kill, so rather than chase him down, i spread creep to literally every possible corner of the map so he can't land. I even used overlords to transport queens on top of cliffs to spread creep.


Then, I built hatches everywhere randomly, killed all my units, and droned up to 200/200.


Then I built overlords.**Only** overlords. With 200 drones, money kept flowing in. So I kept building overlords.  My hope was to lag him so much that he quit or his system froze.  Mine might have also.  Didn't care.  With great rewards come great risks.

I got to over 350 before the other guy quit :(


Here's the results of my efforts:
