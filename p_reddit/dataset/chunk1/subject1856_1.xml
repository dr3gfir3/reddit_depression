	<TEXT> Hi Pat! My name is Kim. Unfortunately I won't be able to be come to the FIND next week (our school limits the number of professional days we can take off per rotation and since I am taking off a week for Midyear, it wasn't feasible to go to FIND too). 

Thank you advance for answering some of my questions! Would you prefer it if I just asked them here on this thread or send you a private message?

	<TEXT> No problem, I've toyed with the idea myself. Our school has a very clinical curriculum and strongly encourages everyone to pursue a residency after graduation. I considered it during my first 2 years, then decided during clerkships that if I do a residency and want to do clinical things, I would just go to medical school. Why waste time doing a residency if I ultimately want to be a doctor?

	<TEXT> Not that you need another person to give you advice...
But honestly man, I would just float retail while applying for medical school. I don't think being in a PGY1 residency will help you that much in medical school. Don't add to the stress of applying to medical school by doing it while completing a residency, it doesn't make much sense in my opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with this guy, a lot of people will automatically get into cliques because that is what they are accustomed to. Just take your time and you'll be surprised to find who you end up getting along with. After you find a few good buddies, take trips! The first 1-2 years of pharmacy school is the best time to do that in my opinion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As of now, I think the job outlook is looking pretty grim. There are jobs, but they're mostly in rural areas. Even places with a population of ~200K are kind of competitive to find a job. If you're considering pharmacy school, I think you should shadow a pharmacist in the community, hospital, etc. setting first as someone else mentioned.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like everyone else already commented on, I think it is different for everyone. Some of my classmates have a background in business, engineering, or even art. They had to spend a lot more time studying the first few semesters to soak up all the basic sciences knowledge the majority of us learned while in undergrad. At our school, Biochemistry was the big bad wolf to defeat. During my first year, I had to study to get the grades that I wanted. However, I still had time to go on trips and surf the web a ton (look for jobs, internet shopping, signed up for sweepstakes) only because I got my BS in biochemistry so it was mostly a review. The second and third year were more challenging because it was more unfamiliar territory. In short, depends on your boyfriend's background and if he's good at memorizing. Most of pharmacy school requires you to memorize a ton of information. If you've had exposure to it before, then it will take less time to memorize it the second time. If it's your first time coming across the material, it might take more time to cram it in. 

It also depends on how much of a gunner your bf is. My classmates who have a spouse and kids really aren't looking to do a residency nor do they obsess about grades. So while they study while they are at school (usually until their kids get home or until labs end), they usually don't pull all nighters like their younger classmates who want to be in the top 5%. 


Personally, I still had a social life in Pharmacy school (except for a 1-2 blocks where I had a rotation in the ICU), but that's because I a) don't obsess about grades like I did in undergrad, A-B average is good enough for me b) I have a fairly decent background in the basic sciences c) I enjoy sleep, hanging out with friends, and traveling too much to give it up for an A+ D) I didn't have a boyfriend to set aside time for while in school so tons of time was saved there. I do have a sister who requires as much if not more time though so I guess it evens out, haha. Just keep in mind everyone is different and handles stress differently. I hope this helps! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've only surfed a handful of times, but only pleasant experiences! Just read someone's profile and exchange a few messages with them before meeting. I think I should stress that you really should read someone's entire profile before asking them to host you, it'll save you a lot of trouble, believe me. If you get a creepy vibe from someone at all, even for a little bit, then don't do it. Find a hostel or hotel for the night or find an emergency host.  </TEXT>
