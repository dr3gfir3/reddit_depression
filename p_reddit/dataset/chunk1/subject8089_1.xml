	<TEXT> Yes, I think you're right about what she meant, but what she meant was really fucking weird. It was utterly unreasonable for her to express any degree of concern regarding Passover dietary restrictions and *not* expect me to interpret that as a request for a kosher-for-Passover meal. Not to mention the fact that that it was ridiculous for her to expect that a small caf would have any dishes that contained the very few things she could eat *not* combined with a single one of the things she can't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As I'm well aware, but those who do are typically quite strict about how they interpret the kashrut requirements during that period. Much more strict than the average observant Jew who keeps kosher year-round.

My family kept kosher only inside the house, but not at restaurants (religion isn't logical), but during Passover, we weren't permitted the cheat of eating out. Because unless you're going to a specifically kosher establishment, it's not actually possible to obtain kosher food, let alone kosher-for-Passover food, from a commercial kitchen. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've posted this here before, but it's one of my favorite wtf moments from working in food service.

 I managed a small independent caf/coffeeshop. I was working the breakfast/lunch shift one afternoon, and a woman entered and approached the register. She explained that she needed some assistance finding lunch that would work with her dietary restrictions. We'll call her crazy caf lady (CCL).


 "Sure thing!" I said, since I was very accustomed to catering to special snowflakes with extra-special requests, and since I knew we had options to satisfy most of the common issues: We had tons of vegetarian and vegan food, organic options, gluten-free options...it was the kind of neighborhood where such things were considered "necessary" by a substantial segment of customers.


 CCL: "Well, I'm a vegetarian."


 "No problem!" I reply. "The majority of our menu is vegan and vegetarian."


 CCL continues: "And it's Passover, of course, so I need something that contains no leavening or grain products."


 Me (internally): *Ummm...I was raised Jewish and if you're actually concerned about keeping kosher, anywhere other than your Bubby's house is the wrong place to be, but OK....let's see where this ends up...*

 CCL: "And most importantly, I'm allergic to nightshades."

 Me: "Oh, like the whole family? Just to be clear, you can't eat tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, or any kind of peppers?"

 CCL: "Exactly."

 Me: "I'm afraid I have very little in the way of standard menu items to offer you that would meet your needs. Can I offer to make you a tossed salad or a fruit salad?"

 CCL: "No, I don't want just a snack. I really wanted something hearty for lunch."

 Me: blink *Are you fucking kidding me? This bitch thinks I'm hiding "hearty" kosher-for-Passover vegetarian nightshade-free food back here?*

 She kept at it for another solid 5 minutes, like her whining was going to cause matzah brei to materialize out of thin air. Eventually, I managed to get across the idea that she might be better off to come visit us another day. </TEXT>

EDIT:  Judging by my inbox, this will come as a surprise to many of you, but over the course of my 40+ years, I have actually encountered several pieces of wisdom about how to avoid wishing for death the day after partying hard.  Over-hydrating, taking ibuprofen before bed, and making sure you've eaten aren't exactly secret wisdom; please stop telling me to drink water. My entire point was that at 19 none of that shit was necessary, at 26 it helped, but now that I'm over 40, it doesn't fucking matter.  </TEXT>

It's an interactive "crossword" puzzle site...I use scare quotes because the clues are not arranged in a traditional grid. I really like it though, because it's pretty smart and adapts the puzzles to your skill level. You have a handicap number just like golf, and it changes based on your performance. There are several new puzzles each day, some news-themed, others vocabulary building.

I know I'm distinctly in the minority with respect to loving crosswords, but if you're a person who does too, this site is pretty great. </TEXT>

This one, at a minimum, was *not* Lincoln.  The sentiment originally appears in Western literature in the Bible in Proverbs 17:28:

"Even a fool is thought wise if he keeps silent, and discerning if he holds his tongue."

The modern iteration isn't Lincoln's either, though. It's also widely misattributed to Twain and many others, but [it was probably first seen in Maurice Switzer's 1907 Mother Goose book.](http://mentalfloss.com/article/63002/9-popular-quotes-commonly-misattributed-abe-lincoln) </TEXT>

I had been feeling pretty terrible for a couple of days and thought I was coming down with the flu. My head hurt really bad, so I started walking into the living room to tell my son to put his headphones on because I was going to bed.

The last thing I remember is him asking me, "Mom, are you OK?" and then I remember waking up face down on the floor what I'm told is about 7 minutes later.

Even if you don't start writing letters to your representatives, at least you'll know how to make an informed choice the next time you go vote.

And it's not about being an expert on Syria.  It's about a) understanding that one of these topics is important and the other is *not*, and b) being willing to engage in what's going on in the real world around you rather than investing energy in things that are hollow and devoid of any substance or redeeming value. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [x-post from /r/actuallesbians, if you're wondering why this looks familiar.]

I'm in my early 40s. My last relationship ended nearly 5 years ago, when my girlfriend and I broke up a few months after my (polyamorous, 19-year long) marriage (of which she was a part) ended.

Apart from my ex-husband, the majority of my romantic and sexual relationships of any importance have been with women, and I'm even less interested in men now than I was before my divorce.  I mention this only because...well, because I'm a little gunshy from experiences with women who want to label me as straight because I was at one point married to a man.

For a looong time after the separation and the subsequent break up with my girlfriend, I was totally shell-shocked and uninterested in trying to date at all. But over the past several weeks, I've found more and more that my thoughts are turning to how nice it would be to share my life with someone special again. The problem is, I haven't the first clue how to begin.

I was partnered by 1992, so I never learned how to do the whole online dating thing at all. And now, I just feel awkward and clueless.

I don't even really know what I'm asking for here...advice? help? for you to share your experiences?

I just...it's finally hitting me that I've been alone for 5 years, and I'd really kinda like to change that, but I don't know how.  Would you be willing to share your suggestions, stories, tips, cautionary tales, and creative ideas please? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi.

The new semester just started and my laptop just died (its fan is no more...also, I was thinking about getting a new computer this semester anyway, sooo...).  I'm just feeling a little overwhelmed by my options and could really use some advice.

* **Total budget and country of purchase:** 
$400; USA

* **Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications to your requirements for the money? Pick or include any that apply.** 
 Toss-up between specs and battery life. I'm an adult full-time college student, so a longer battery life is nice for extended use on campus, *buuut*, I'd rather just plug into an outlet than have a PC that struggles to work with PowerPoint and Word at the same time.

* **How important is weight to you?**
 Eh. Not super important, I guess...I'm already lugging around a heavy-ass bag...another couple of pounds probably doesn't matter that much.

* **Which OS do you require? Windows, Linux, Mac.**
 Windows (10). I won't run 8 ever again, and going back to 7 at this point makes compatibility difficult for certain things on my campus.

* **Do you have a preferred screen size? If indifferent, put N/A.** 
 15.6", mainly because I have a strong preference for a keyboard that contains a number pad and it's impossible to find those on smaller laptops.

* **Are you doing any CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming? List which programs/games you desire to run. If you have no requirements, put N/A.** 
 No CAD/video editing/photo editing/gaming, but I have to use PowerPoint a lot, which, when run at the same time as other MS Office applications, causes my current machine to groan and freeze up. Other than that, I use it for word processing, web browsing, and watching Netflix.

* **If you're gaming (leave blank if you put N/A above...), do you have certain games you want to play? At what settings and FPS do you want?** 
 N/A

* **Any specific requirements such as good keyboard, reliable business grade build quality, touch-screen, finger-print reader, optical drive or good input devices (keyboard/touchpad)?** 
 As I mentioned above, I *really* want a number pad...I study foreign languages and need to be able to use [Alt] + [number] combinations to create non-English characters quickly in text.

* **Leave any finishing thoughts here that you may feel are necessary and beneficial to the discussion.**
 My laptop gets significant daily use. It is my only computer and it travels back and forth with me between home, work, and school, so it needs to be durable and good quality.  I don't have a lot of money to invest, I know, but I need to get as much good quality computer for my price range as possible, because this is going to be the primary tool I use on a daily basis for (hopefully) the next several years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 4 doors.

She does need cargo space - she owns and runs a small business and often has to haul medium-large loads of whatever. Passenger seating is less of an issue...standard 2-row SUV seating is fine.

She really wants to remain high up,  so a truck or SUV is probably the solution. For reference, I drive an '06 Subaru Forester, and she felt like it was a little too low and small for her needs.

She **strongly** prefers manual transmissions, but knows that this may be unrealistic.

It would really be nice if the thing could get at least 20mpg.

This car will be used for both daily commuting and utility. As a small business owner, and a new homeowner doing renovations, she's constantly hauling all kinds of stuff around.

Top of her budget is $24k, and she'd be happiest with an older vehicle that's better quality for the money, as opposed to a newerm but less reliable vehicle, *especially* if going to an older car gets her back into the era of manual transmissions being a thing.

Last, she's biased toward imports...but if you folks have good suggestions for domestics, I can probably reason with her on that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if this will make you guys want to facepalm as hard as I did, since I guess the story is a bit specific to the fact that I work in call center that handles retirement investment accounts, but I'm guessing most of you folks will get why I'm still shaking my damn head over a call I had on last night's shift.

As I mentioned, I work in a call center that services retirement accounts.  Among the many things account holders can do is transfer funds from other eligible retirement/employer plans (like 401(k)s and IRAs) into their accounts with us.

In order to do this type of transfer, 2 items are required: a form that needs to be filled out by both the account holder and the financial institution sending the funds, and a transfer check for whatever amount is being deposited.

A guy calls in to check on the status of a transfer request he says he has submitted (he'll be GC for "genius customer" and I'll be "me").  At first glance, I don't see that we've had anything come in, so I ask him to hold while I look through another part of the system.  I look, see nothing other than a note saying he had called in a couple of weeks ago and another rep gave him instructions on how to complete the transfer process.  But we haven't received anything from him, neither form nor check.

So I return to the line, thank him for holding, and tell him that I'm not yet showing any indication that the request has been received, but that it can sometimes take a few business days for us to be able to see submissions once they are received. I was getting ready to suggest that he simply call back on Monday or Tuesday so we could check status for him again when he said:

GC: "That doesn't make any sense. I faxed the form **and the check** on Wednesday.  They should be there by now."

Ummm...Wat?

Me: "I'm sorry, sir, did you say that you *faxed* the check to us?"

GC (exasperatedly):  "Yes, yes! I faxed the form and the check together on Wednesday.  There's no reason they shouldn't be there already."

Me: "Well, I think I may be able to offer you an explanation about why I'm not seeing anything in the system.  You see, sir, when a transfer is requested, we must receive the physical check in our office in order to process it."

GC: "What do mean? I can't fax you the check?"

Me (flipping up my mic over my head and stifling my mouth with my hand so he won't hear me laughing hysterically at him because our phones have no mute button): "Unfortunately, no, sir.  We are not able to process a faxed check image in order to effect a transfer into your account in the amount of several hundred thousand dollars. Do you still have the original check that was issued by the other plan?"

GC: "Of course!"

Me: "Excellent.  Allow me to suggest that, at your earliest convenience, you resubmit both the form and the original check *by postal mail* to us at the following address.  Once we receive both required items, we will be glad to process your transfer. Is there anything else I can help you with this evening?" </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm an older, nontraditional student who transferred from a community college to a state university in Fall 2015. I  had a 3.76 GPA at my CC, and I'm a senior with a 4.0 institutional GPA at my current school. I say this not to brag, but to establish that I am not a wholly incapable student.

I am currently taking a 300-level political science class that is **kicking. my. ass.** 

I understand the concepts, and I feel perfectly competent participating in class discussions, but I am really scared about the volume and depth of information my professor expects us to regurgitate *and* analyze in less than an hour's time for our 4 exams, which are basically our entire grade.


I have the first exam of the semester tomorrow. He gave us a study guide, and I'm terrified. There are 23 vocabulary terms/concepts that we have to be able to define/identify/explain the significance of. Out of those, we will be given 4 of the 23 from the list, and we have to pick 2 to explain.

Then, there are 5 possible essays, out of which we will be given 2 to choose from, and have to respond to one. To be fair, he was kind enough to tell us exactly what all 5 of them are, but shit. I've been sitting here trying to draft responses to all 5, and I'll be lucky to have enough minutes to even write out the answers in the 50 minutes we'll have, let alone worry about remembering what the fuck my answers *are*. 

The essay questions are the kind of questions that really need a 5 page response to be adequately addressed. I can't imagine how I'm going to have time to get a complete response out in the time allotted, even if my brain doesn't go blank from sheer terror.

Look, I'm not trying to be a whiny baby, and I don't really want to get into the whole "try being a STEM major and taking our exams" derailment. I accept that college is supposed to be difficult. Maybe this is normal and I just have somehow weirdly missed having any other classes like this?

I don't know...I'm just feeling really confused and frustrated. Anyone have any thoughts? Your input would be very much appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, /r/AskAcademia! I just found this sub, and I really wish I had known you were here before. I posted the following very long series of questions and thoughts to /r/gradadmissions about a month ago, but I got only one reply. Having now found this sub, I was hoping some of you might be willing to weigh in. 

Im very new to this process of grad school admissions, and I'm feeling extremely rushed, lost, and generally overwhelmed. I am sorry this is so long, and I truly thank you for taking the time to read this post. I have tons of swirling thoughts and questionsso many that Im having difficulty organizing them in a coherent way, but here goes:
Up until just a few weeks ago, I thought grad school was in my distant future. Due to some unforeseen circumstances, my graduation date has been pushed up a full year  to May 2017  and my new Plan A involves continuing immediately into a graduate program the following fall.

About me, my interests, and my goals:

 Since it might be relevant in ways I am unaware of, Ill mention that I am (at least by reddits standards) old. I turn 41 soon and didnt really give college a good, old-fashioned college try until I was 38. I dont know how, exactly, but I suspect that my age in some way does (or should?) affect this process.

 I will graduate with a B.S. in Social Science (concentrations in political science and geography) with minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropology. I speak Spanish fluently, so I have no fear of graduate foreign language requirements.

 Since I returned to school in the fall of 2013, my overall GPA is 3.859. However, over 20 years ago, when I was 18-19 years old, I had 2 spectacularly awful semesters at the University of Maryland. The effect of these 2 semesters is that my current cumulative GPA is actually 3.202. By the time I graduate a year from now, I can have it up to 3.407, but unless I make changes to my proposed undergrad program/timetable, I cant get it all the way to a 3.5.

 I attend a small state university that is improving, but that is generally unknown and that tends to have a mediocre reputation among those with an opinion. Lets just say that my primary criterion for choosing an undergraduate program was affordability and maximizing transferability of credits from my associates degree, so at the time, choosing an inexpensive state school with a seamless transfer process made sense  especially when the (old) goal was just to finish my stinking bachelors degree. Now Im worried about how the lackluster reputation of the school might tarnish how my otherwise pretty decent (recent) academic performance is viewed.

 I am open to the idea of relocating to a wide variety of places for the duration of my program.

 I have to find a fully funded program. Paying for grad school is not an option for me. My EFC on this years FAFSA was $0, and until I have a graduate degree, my earning capacity likely wont be much better than it is right now. In addition, Ive been humping it nonstop since August 2013, working full-time and attending school full-time. I cant do it anymore. If Im to finish a graduate program, I have to be able to stop working 35 hours/week on non-school related stuff.

 Ultimately, I would like to teach in a social science field, probably political science, (I think, please see last question below) at a small teaching college. I really dont want to put down long-term roots in a publish-or-perish environment.
My questions:

 What type of graduate programs are going to best position me to get the kind of teaching placements I really want? Am I a realistic candidate for those schools?

 How competitive should the schools I apply to be? Does my drastically improved recent performance make any difference in terms of admissions cutoffs for minimum GPA?

 How do I account for the relative lack of prestige/name recognition enjoyed by my current university when trying to calculate if I should even bother applying for a program at a given school?

 Should I apply directly to PhD programs, or do a standalone MA/MS first (hopefully creating a great grad school GPA and gaining some research experience in the process)?

 How do I commit to a single field and subfield for graduate study? I understand that the whole nature of doctoral level inquiry is specific, deep knowledge about a single subject, but the research questions that fascinate me are all interdisciplinary in nature. For example, my primary area of interest is academic/health/social outcomes in gender and sexual minority adolescents, especially those of Latino/a heritage. I could investigate the issues I care about via political science, sociology, geography, or even language. This is why I sought out an undergrad program that was explicitly interdisciplinary. Im finding it difficult to change that approach.

 On the above note, I realized last night that it would only take me 2 extra semesters of undergrad to end up with a major in modern foreign languages instead of my current minor in Spanish. If I did this, I would open up other options in terms of fields of study at the graduate level. In particular, I have a recurring fantasy about a degree in multiple Romance languages, such as is offered by U of Oregon and Johns Hopkins. How insane is this idea? Would I be better or worse off trying to find tenure-track positions in foreign language or social science?

I feel like I should clarify that I dont actually give a single fuck about the prestige of a particular school as long as the actual quality of the education there is high and I get to study what I am really interested in. Buuut Ive lived and worked in the U.S. job market long enough to know how much brand recognition matters to prospective employers. My understanding is that this is even more pervasively the case in academia, so Im trying to accept that I need to play the game to some extent.

If youve made it this far, thank you so much. If you have any words of advice for me, whether it be general, answers to questions I raised, or suggestions about specific programs, I would be genuinely grateful for your input. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This will be long. I apologize in advance.


Last fall, at the age of 38, I graduated with my associate's degree from my local CC. In researching schools to transfer to, I became aware of a new program at a small state university at the other end of my home state.


It was an interdisciplinary major in social science, which was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a lot of social science programs, this one allowed you to choose 2 tracks to concentrate in among the 6 social science disciplines offered. When I got in contact with the coordinator, we also discussed the new secondary education major that the school had launched. Turned out that with the planned curriculum changes, I was going be able to double major in social science and secondary education, and graduate within 3 years with certification to teach social studies and Spanish to grades 7-12.


In the past, those in the social science major who also wanted teaching certification were required to choose history as one of their 2 tracks, but lucky me, with the changes being implemented, that would no longer be the case - I was free to choose the disciplines that most interest me (in my case, political science and sociology or geography - a toss up).


YAY!!! I was going to get to study the things I am actually interested in, and then, when I was done with the degree, I would have an actual professional skill that would be very likely to quickly translate to a stable job with decent benefits - even if the pay is shitty for the work required. This was really important to me...I have lived basically hand-to-mouth my entire adult life, and I really wanted my college degree to insulate me from that a bit, especially since it has taken me so long to get here.


That was a year ago. I have since completed nearly all of the content courses required for the social science major, and have completed 2 of the education courses. A week ago, just prior to my advising appointment for next semester, I received an email from a professor in the education department I had never met informing me that I had been assigned to her as a new advisee.


Long story short...my advisor - the one who was making changes to the secondary education program - is terminally ill and has taken an indefinite leave of absence. In his absence, no further progress is being made on getting changes finalized to the new major, which means that the old rules still apply. Which means...that since history is NOT one of my 2 tracks, I am ineligible for teaching certification unless I essentially start half my concentration over again.


Fuck that noise. I have already dropped the teaching certification option from my program, and I wil now graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Social Science and double minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropolgy. So, as best I can tell, I have a few realistic options:

* federal/state government
* non-profit
* graduate school with an eye toward staying in academia


I'm OK with not using my degree to teach high school...I just want to be able to use it in some way. Before returning to school, I worked for state government for 8 years; I'd be happy to parlay that experience + my degree into something relevant. For example, I'd love to work in equal employment opportunity or fair practices, but no one can seem to give me any information about how to get a foot in the door with those jobs. I feel like there should be some kind of perfect internship opportunity here in my last year of school, but everyone I've talked to stares at me like a deer in headlights.


I'd also love to teach at the college level...I don't have so much ego that it needs to be a school with a recognizable name, but I don't want to be an adjunct indefinitely...because that's right back to the uncertainty and instablility that I've fought so hard to get away from.

	<TEXT> This will be long. I apologize in advance.

Last fall, at the age of 38, I graduated with my associate's degree from my local CC. In researching schools to transfer to, I became aware of a new program at a small state university at the other end of my home state.

It was an interdisciplinary major in social science, which was exactly what I was looking for. Unlike a lot of social science programs, this one allowed you to choose 2 tracks to concentrate in among the 6 social science disciplines offered. When I got in contact with the coordinator, we also discussed the new secondary education major that the school had launched. Turned out that with the planned curriculum changes, I was going be able to double major in social science and secondary education, and graduate within 3 years with certification to teach social studies and Spanish to grades 7-12.

In the past, those in the social science major who also wanted teaching certification were required to choose history as one of their 2 tracks, but lucky me, with the changes being implemented, that would no longer be the case - I was free to choose the disciplines that most interest me (in my case, political science and sociology or geography - a toss up).

YAY!!! I was going to get to study the things I am actually interested in, and then, when I was done with the degree, I would have an actual professional skill that would be very likely to quickly translate to a stable job with decent benefits - even if the pay is shitty for the work required. This was really important to me...I have lived basically hand-to-mouth my entire adult life, and I really wanted my college degree to insulate me from that a bit, especially since it has taken me so long to get here.

That was a year ago. I have since completed nearly all of the content courses required for the social science major, and have completed 2 of the education courses. A week ago, just prior to my advising appointment for next semester, I received an email from a professor in the education department I had never met informing me that I had been assigned to her as a new advisee.

Long story short...my advisor - the one who was making changes to the secondary education program - is terminally ill and has taken an indefinite leave of absence. In his absence, no further progress is being made on getting changes finalized to the new major, which means that the old rules still apply. Which means...that since history is NOT one of my 2 tracks, I am ineligible for teaching certification unless I essentially start half my concentration over again.

Fuck that noise. I have already dropped the teaching certification option from my program, and I wil now graduate in May 2017 with a B.A. in Social Science and double minors in Spanish and Cultural Anthropolgy. So, as best I can tell, I have a few realistic options:

* federal/state government
* non-profit
* graduate school with an eye toward staying in academia

I'm OK with not using my degree to teach high school...I just want to be able to *use* it in some way. Before returning to school, I worked for state government for 8 years; I'd be happy to parlay that experience + my degree into something relevant. For example, I'd love to work in equal employment opportunity or fair practices, but no one can seem to give me any information about how to get a foot in the door with those jobs. I feel like there should be some kind of perfect internship opportunity here in my last year of school, but everyone I've talked to stares at me like a deer in headlights.

I'd also love to teach at the college level...I don't have so much ego that it needs to be a school with a recognizable name, but I don't want to be an adjunct indefinitely...because that's right back to the uncertainty and instablility that I've fought so hard to get away from. So should I go to grad school? Stop at the master's level and teach community college? Push through and get a PhD and hope against hope that I can find tenure track somewhere?

Other ideas appeal to me also...my pet issue is improving quality of life for GSM teens, so, as an off-the-top-of-my-head example, does the It Gets Better Project need a program assistant?

	<TITLE> Please don't laugh at me, WCSIB...I wrecked my vehicle, and I have no more than $6k to replace it with something safe and reliable on snowy mountains that is roomy enough to haul big, heavy crap. </TITLE>

	<TEXT> It's kind of a tall order, I know.

I'm an adult college student and I work 30 hours/week, so I do a lot of back-and-forth. 

I live in a mountainous area that gets a LOT of snow and some ice, and ice is how I flipped my 1998 GMC Jimmy a few weeks back, so trustworthiness in bad weather is a real priority now. 

I have a 19-year old that does metalworking/blacksmithing stuff, so I end up hauling a lot of pretty big, heavy gear around. I'm not comfortable doing that in a Honda Civic.

I can go as high as $6k on a cash sale...I suppose if a dealer were willing to let me finance *only* $2-3k on top of that, I'd be willing to have a *small* car payment, but I'd rather not, really.

So, can I please have your expertise and opinions? What would you guys recommend?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Deadlines and double standards [x-post from /r/college] </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-22 18:15:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, I originally posted this last night on /r/college, and I have been surprised and a bit confused by the overall indifference and mild hostility toward what I'm saying. Maybe it's because, as a non-traditional student, I have different expectations about the student-teacher relationship and the nature of each person's responsibility in the classroom. I don't know. But this issue is really bugging me, and I thought I'd post it here for a response from a somewhat different audience:

Now that the semester is over for most of us, I wanted to have a conversation about something that has been bothering me with increasing intensity each semester: the double standard that seems to apply when it comes to due dates and timeliness for work assigned to students, versus teachers' adherence to similar (or any) standards in returning graded work.


This semester, my classes began the last day of August. I had a class in which the professor didn't return a single piece of graded work until October 25, just one day shy of 8 weeks later.


This doesn't seem to be an outlier by any means. I had a classes my last 2 semester of community college in which we didn't receive any grades posted until at least midterms. I would estimate that the standard turnaround time on getting papers back across all classes is an average of 4-5 weeks.


Even published timetables don't seem to help much. Professors who say they will return work within one week get it back in 4, those who say they will return it in 2 weeks mean (usually) more like 6...but sometimes never.


A couple of things really trouble me about this situation. First, the lack of feedback about my performance for what essentially amounts to half a semester is really a problem for me. For one thing, if I haven't gotten back any graded work, how do I know that I am mastering the material and producing/performing to the instructor's standard? For another, like it or not, I really need and thrive on that (hopefully positive) feedback from my professor regarding my work. Sure, it would be great if I had an infinite wellspring of intrinsic motivation to do all of the work that is required of me over the course of a semester, but after writing and turning in three 5-page papers, it's agonizingly difficult to try to find the drive to write another when I don't even know if the first one I turned in was up to snuff. It is both anxiety provoking and maddening, causing me to exist in a state of both fear and rage for way too much of my semester.


So, I have 3 questions:

* What are your experiences with this?

* What do you guys think is reasonable in terms of turnaround time for graded work (understanding that professors have LOTS of students and papers take LOTS of time to grade)? and
 
* What, if anything, can I do to keep myself from blowing a gasket when this inevitably happens again next semester?

Thanks for your thoughts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got email this afternoon (to my personal, not school, account) about my student loans, so I have been trying off and on to connect to the school's website to take a look at the financial aid disbursement schedule.

More often than not, I get timed out. Once, I was able to get to PAWS, but not to the home page itself. Ordinarily, I'd chalk it up to heavy demand causing the system to barf, but since I did some updates to my PC today, I'm not sure if that might (also) have something to do with it.

Any FSU redditors been able to get to the school website today? If not, what kind of trouble are you having? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am giddy with excitement and relief right now...I just wish it weren't tainted with negative self-talk about how small my A.A. in General Studies from a community college is in the larger scheme of things.

I just turned in my last final exam for the last class in my degree program. This is especially significant for me, not because I've done really well (which I have), but because my struggle has always been with *finishing* things. The bigger the project, the greater the odds I would get bored, overwhelmed, or stuck in perfectionism and just abandon ship.

So, I'm trying to remind myself that *finishing* and actually getting a degree are the important outcomes of this process for me.

Reddit, please help me believe that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, everyone!

I will be relocating to western Maryland in the near future in order to attend Frostburg State as a transfer student. I am an adult ("non-traditional") student with a teenager of my own.

Having looked at a number of rental properties in Frostburg, I am starting to think that living outside the town itself may be a much better option for me. Either direction - west or east - would be fine, but I imagine that Cumberland has more rental housing options then, say, Grantsville.

What should I know about moving into Cumberland? How would you describe the various geographic areas/neighborhoods? I may not know enough to even ask the right questions, but does anyone have any tips to pass along?

I should mention that I'm moving from a very densely populated area of the state with a less-than-optimal crime rate, so I'm not really skittish about neighborhoods that are somewhat "borderline" -- I'm used to that. I do not, however, want to have to regularly deal with gunshots on my block or stepping over passed-out humans on my way home. (No, these examples are not hypothetical.)

Thanks in advance, local folks! Your wisdom is much appreciated. </TEXT>
