	<TEXT> Sorry to say this, but I am from Norway, and I am certain that this isn't in Norway.

I would say Netherlands based on the signs and the car signs.

Mark Van Reesk is a dutch name too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't understand why there is fjords in the series.
I know Kattegatt isn't in Norway, but please tell me if there is any fjords like that in Sweden, I know there isn't any in Denmark at least.
And they talk about the soil being hard to farm in , Norway have that problem. And kattegat is also between Norway and Denmark.

	<TITLE> Low FPS problems. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have a problem where I have very low fps in DayZ. At the start I just thought that I should just wait, cause it is in alpha. But after a while, and patches coming out. I came to the conclusion that it is probably something wrong with my computer.
So what I am asking about is; Do anyone of you have a solution for this, cause I should be able to run it.
Will post DxDiag if asked.

Not my native language, so sorry for any grammar fails. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In Norway we have english in our school all the way to the end of high school (13 years)

And I think that is one of the best things the school has given me, cause I can talk to people from all over the world because of that.
Thirteen years is too much, but atleast ten years is good. But when we start to get spanish, german or french on the side of that. Well that just makes it hard for us :)

EDIT: I am not that good on has and have yet, haha 13 years!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have problems with my fps on games I should run easy. For example Metro Last Light that I just bought, I have 15-20 fps. This is a game my computer should be able to run easy. (The list of games I have this problem with is too long)

I was hoping for some hero from reddit to save me from my misery, because the place I bought it won't help me at all. 
Maybe you could be my hero, and we can use Teamviewer with skype or TS3.

Sorry for any spelling problems, this is not my native language. </TEXT>
