	<TEXT> Funny, people in /r/Libertarian actually do read the article, because there are lots of downvotes there. X-posting my comment from there:

Did you actually read the article? What he is suggesting is that the most important aspect of creating jobs is a healthy economic environment and demand. If you have any experience from an entrepreneurial or VC viewpoint, you know that is completely true. Tax rates can be zero, but if there is no demand there will be no new investment, new companies formed, and new jobs.

Aside from the catch phrase of *rich people don't create jobs* (which the author says isn't exactly the case), what exactly about this article don't you agree with?

	<TEXT> Its hard to establish direct cause and effect in a situation like that, but obviously the greater the regulatory burden, the higher production costs are going to be, said John Anderson, deputy chief economist for the American Farm Bureau Federation.

We don't have any evidence to back it up, but obviously that's the case. Forget all the other macro and micro conditions leading to higher input prices.

Rock solid article. This is the kind of chicken shit that's getting posted to /r/Libertarian these days... </TEXT>

1) This guy is a dick and asking the same bullshit buzzword neo-con questions. Check out his channel and tell me if you think he is really Libertarian. To me, he seems to be pushing the same neo-con agenda.

2) Is he asking for personal experience or "good for the nation?" He blends the questions to try to *gotcha* people.

3) He frames the questions in the manner of "Have you told your parents you're gay yet?"

What a bunch of joke interviews. Plus the way he keeps looking at the camera. I wouldn't be surprised if he talked to some people actually knew what they were talking about but didn't give airtime because they knew what they were talking about. Go to the middle of some rural town and ask them about the ACA.

So, as a Liberal* what do I think of Obamacare so far?
*Disclaimer: I don't consider myself a "liberal" as this interviewer is trying to label.

Personal Experience:  I was dropped from my parents' health plan while in school and couldn't afford a private one (~150/month more for catastrophic). I was allowed to get back on in the early days of the ACA. I'm now on my wife's company plan. They have an amazing plan and prices actually went down since the ACA went into effect. There is no one close to me who was dropped from insurance. The exchange in Colorado worked well from the get-go with a few early connection errors/too many hits. I signed up for the Connect for Health Colorado and plans were much cheaper than before, but my wife works for a European company so health insurance is a large part of her benefit package. Health insurance companies now advertise regularly on TV encouraging competition, which never happened before. My parents combined will be saving around $500/month switching to a Kaiser plan on the exchange from a plan offered in a pension by IBM. My ex-girlfriend's mother was on a private plan and got really sick. She was incredibly anemic and was told if they didn't find what was wrong she wouldn't live, so the doctors ran a large amount of tests. After the fact, the insurance company covered very little of the costs, claiming they were unnecessary, sticking her with ~= $500k in medical debt. She had to declare bankruptcy, getting rid of a quite a bit of it, but will never again get a CC or loan, and the stress of that period took many years off her life. This should never happen.

On the "bigger picture": There are astounding flaws in the law, and it was a spectacular failure of a roll-out with the federal exchange. Obama clearly lied about aspects of the law. Many people are losing their previous plans. Prices are going up for the most price sensitive class, healthy 20somethings, that *must* enroll for the law to succeed. The ACA did little to nothing to actually get healthcare costs under control.

Bottom line: What do I think about Obamacare? Well, I don't know. It *personally* had positive effects on me and the people around me, but there are clearly major flaws and questions about the effects and sustainability. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are right, I was definitely overreaching with the "none of this applies." I'm sure there are small-scale farmers out there doing terrible things with crops. From my experience I would say this is not the norm though, and most small-scale organic farmers take pride in and would love to take you on a tour of their farm and discuss techniques.

We are in Colorado and produce a pretty diversified crop because we are really small scale and have a few other businesses, but our highest volume at the market is from greens. We have a few acres of fruit trees as well, which is where we have used the DE. We don't do a whole lot with the fruit trees, but I have friends who have 60 acres of peaches on the Western Slope. They use IPM and have great yields, which sell out in the first 2 hours of the farmer's markets. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be clear, you are talking about corporate organic, which is essentially the same as corporate non-organic. Almost none of what you are talking about applies to small-scale, local farms. When you buy produce from a grocery store, you are correct, although some grocery stores buy from local farms that don't use the "organic" pesticides.

I live on an organic farm that has a few acres and know all the farmers around. Small-scale farmers where I am from do not use the organic pesticides you are talking about, and have really nice crops. There are a few things we have tried like diatomaceous earth (ground up sedimented algae shells), which is nothing close to the pesticides you mention.

Just making the distinction between corporate organic and real organic, and there are HUGE differences between real organic and produce using pesticide and synthetic fertilizer.

I agree that many of the organic crusaders don't know what they are talking about. But the mainstream debate is comparing corporate organic and corporate non-organic which is completely disingenuous to the real organic farms which get labeled under the corporate organic. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the most meaningful comment I've seen of yours!

To be fair though, you did directly quote the LP in your post which could make one believe it was some sort of plug for the party. It's a shame that the party is so irrelevant and much of the discussion in this sub is on whether you adhere to *true* beliefs of socialist-liberals or minarchists and anarcho-whatevers. So much of this sub is people ranting about their theory and what they believe, then doing nothing, or even offending and scaring potential converts/allies which is much worse than doing nothing.

Anyways.... </TEXT>

Do people actually think this about libertarianism? I would think that anyone who has any minute understanding wouldn't actually believe any of these 7.

I do have a few questions though:

1) What would a libertarian leader to national parks and forests? From what I have read is that they would be privatized? What would happen after that?

2) *If* one believes in global warming, how would this fit in with Libertarianism? How does the free market deal with externalities like this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks like Pyongyang is a rather humid climate.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyongyang#Geography_and_climate

That combined with the pollution (I'm sure all the people burn wood, trash, or whatever they can find to keep warm) make it a rather dreary place.  I lived in Chengdu, China, which is a very humid place and horribly polluted.  For the little over a year I lived there it was clear maybe three days. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another gem:

 It does not promise the immediate creation of some imaginary number of jobs, because government cannot create jobsat least not productive ones that contribute to our long-term prosperity. 

Edit: I was mostly commenting about Mittington's relentless "12 million jobs," rectally extracting this number.  I agree that the private sector should be the ones creating the jobs and can be significantly more efficient, but building infrastructure that encourages the private sector succeed is vital and does create jobs.  I especially liked him in the debate tonight with the "oh, the numbers add up, trust me I was a business man, the numbers add up. I'm not going to tell you what they are but they add up." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "Americas large cities generated nearly 85% of its GDP growth in 2010a greater share of national output than cities in Europe, India or China. "

From a great article in the most recent Economist entitled "Urban Nation."  It discussed how many of the guest speakers at the Democratic Convention the were mayors of cities, and that "Those positions, like much of city governance, tend to be more pragmatic than partisan, and tend to focus on more tangible goals than national politics does."

The GDP growth in cities has been strong, while farmers in rural areas are handed billions of dollars in subsidies to do nothing.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I work in a restaurant and a (religious) family comes in fairly often, with 3 kids that usually make a mess.  They recently gave a card thanking our staff for putting up with the kids, included a bible verse in the card and ended with God bless you.  

They also baked cookies for the whole staff.  And tip 25%+ every time.  

That behavior is much more heartening, and much more likely to get your message across, than stiffing a server. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The poor won't end up paying more money.  They don't have the money and never will.  When the Republicans talk about lowering the overall tax rate and simplifying the tax code, they want to get rid of deductions such as the first home buyer and mortgage deductions.  Who uses these?  The middle classes.  The upper classes get a tax reduction while the middle classes lose the deductions that lower their tax rates, in turn raising them.  Neither mainstream party truly wants to lower spending, they just want to lower spending where they want and raise it where they want.  The money has to come from somewhere, and if one intake is decreased, it will be increased elsewhere, in the short term or long. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not technically police.  This is "Chengguan" (first two characters on side) - they are the ones that harass street vendors and migrant workers.  They are usually the ones that get violent and rile up the population.  Most Chinese hate the Chengguan while having significantly more respect for actual police. 

Could be similar to Environmental Police in college towns.  All they do is go around writing noise complaints and alcohol tickets.

edit:   - chengguan
 - police </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not involving words but very related:

When I was first starting to smoke I wanted to learn how to blow smoke rings.  While waiting for the pipe to be passed back to me, I decided to give it a dry run.  I thought the large rings looked the coolest, so I opened my mouth nice and wide.  I moved my head back and forth to make the smoke come out of my mouth in ring shape.  So my mouth as wide as I can make it, moving front to back.  Just as I realized what this must look like, everyone was looking at me, laughing.  I was too embarrassed to explain what I was trying to do. 

TL;DR  Deepthroating invisible blackdude.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just got back from a year in China, and lived there for a year in 07-08.  Inflation is going through the roof in China.  When I first lived there, I lived like a king.  Everything was very cheap and you still made good money. This time around, stuff was still cheap but not to the same degree.  If you live the same life as some do in Western style - going to clubs and bars - drinks are usually $5-$10, eating Western food- it is close to the same price.  Also, everything cheap in China is cheap - not just price wise but quality wise.

If you find a school to directly enroll in or do private tutoring for small groups you make 25-100/hour, but some are a hassle and and are unable to provide a visa.  Teaching on a student visa or tourist visa is the easiest and pays the most - but if you are caught you can be deported.  If you teach at a training center, you make 10/hour and work nights and weekends.  They will provide you a working visa, but you have to sign a contract and often times they are nazis and pull scandalous gimmicks.

TL;DR - GREAT job if you know what you are doing. </TEXT>
