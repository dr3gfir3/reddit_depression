	<TEXT> Although I still don't get it, thanks anyways! I guess I'll do some more research on my own. But I don't think 'cathedral ceilings' are used as much as 'vaulted ceilings,' so I might as well stick to a slightly more popular terminology. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Chinas holdings of U.S. Treasuries declined to the lowest in more than six years as the worlds second-largest economy uses its currency reserves to support the yuan. Japan overtook China as Americas top foreign creditor, as its holdings edged down at a slower pace.

I think this means that China's economy is slowing down, which isn't something new. But what do I know. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It looks fantastic. It has that 3DS character sprite feeling to it. My only gripe (a totally insignificant one at that) is that she is a bit short, and that her dress should be a bit more floaty, and that a mimikyu would have been better than a frosslass as it is more commonly associated with her, but I guess it makes sense in that she uses it for her other job. </TEXT>

Nearly 40% of Japan business chiefs down on Trump: poll

Worries over trade deals, dollar and immigration

TOKYO -- Some 37% of Japanese corporate leaders in a recent Nikkei Inc. survey said U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would have a negative impact on their business, citing uncertainty over policy under the new administration.

Just 24.7% said Trump would be a positive force. Those seeing him as bad for business were asked to choose up to three reasons. The most popular, at 72.2%, was withdrawing from the Trans-Pacific Partnership regional trade agreement.

Trump has vowed to pull the U.S. out of the TPP upon taking office, effectively scuttling the deal. Companies already making moves with the TPP in mind would be forced to rethink strategies. The next-most-popular strikes against Trump were concern over a weakening by the dollar, at 42.6%, and an exclusionary immigration policy, at 22.2%.

Of the 106 respondents with operations in the U.S., 79.2% did not expect any change to their business there. Most explained that it was unclear whether Trump could keep his promises of massive job creation and stepped-up infrastructure investment. Some thought that the American economy could improve overall but were unsure whether their own companies would benefit.

Trump has also expressed a desire to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Although 73.8% of the 61 companies with operations in the popular auto production base of Mexico expected no changes there, 19.7% did foresee a negative impact.

Back home, 64.4% of all respondents expected the Japanese economy to stay flat -- down 14.5 points from the September survey. Sluggish consumption was the top reason for this cautious outlook.

"The Japanese people are still living very defensively," said Junji Ueda, president of FamilyMart Uny Holdings. "Unless we can dispel concerns over social welfare and other issues, we won't be able to revive the economy."

Respondents were also asked to look six months down the road. The most popular response, at 48.6%, was that the economy would be growing at a moderate pace. The recent softening of the yen could bolster exports, and some companies will likely benefit from OPEC's agreement to reduce output. </TEXT>

Thankfully, more of these are being renovated, and more private housings that integrate hanok elements are being built all over the country, although it's far from the majority. </TEXT>

I knew their would be a comment like this. XD This is a version of highly stylized calligraphy of Chinese character, which is quite hard to read and write if you're not properly trained in the art, so I doubt it'll look like a penis in its standard form.
Edit: It turns out the character is [] (https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%BF%83) (pronounced 'sim' in Korean), which means heart or mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks like you've just started using reddit. My advice is that you should look carefully into the rules of the sub before submitting anything. And every sub has a topic they're not very fond of, which could be heavily downvoted. Look at what others submit and try to do something similar. And including an emoji in the title of an article you're trying to submit is mostly not allowed, afaik. Do that in a self post or a non-article link. </TEXT>

The gate is one of the structures that survived the destruction of the Palace during the Japanese occupation period when two thirds of it were destroyed, but it's original location was altered to make way for a road. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chinese was the lingua franca of East Asia for centuries, and it still is to some extent. Korea is actually the country to use the least amount of Chinese characters among East Asian nations, thanks to the development of it's indigenous alphabet 'Hangul' in the 15th century. That neon sign in the background is in Hangul, too, although it might look like Chinese because its blurry. </TEXT>
