	<TEXT> Thanks, i'm really taking that with me. I've decided that no matter what, I don't need to add depression to the anxiety. Whatever happens, i've come a long way and learned a lot. I'll just start over in a place where people deal with anxiety and help students that have it. Maybe the University of Michigan just wasn't for me. Thanks for hearing my story and giving me some courage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> to me it sounds a lot like  shock actually, which is a little different than panic attack. Of course panic attacks treat everyone different, but when panic sets in, generally people get very hot, sweating, etc.

	<TEXT> yes, it definitely is. I wasn't depressed when my doctor prescribed prozac for me. I just had GAD and Panic disorder.  
Unfortunately Prozac didn't work for me because I had the SE Of losing a ton of weight (and i'm pretty tiny for my age) so he switched me to lexapro :p

Lexapro is an SSRI and it works really well for me. I went from having Panic attacks 4-5 times a week to maybe once a week or none at all. SSRI's are great! Let me know if you have any specific questions :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, first of, let me start by saying, it's nice to know that I'm not the only one here. Knowing you guys are facing your own battles AND WINNING, gives me strength. Let me share my story now.

I'm a nursing student and my clinical instructor saw I was having some anxiety and clinical. So she set up a 4 part plan to help me.  The last step was to go into a room that REALLY scares me...this is the the room where I started having panic attacks two years back. I agreed with 3 of the 4 step plan and told her that I was really uncomfortable with the 4th step. That it wouldn't help me and that anxiety doesn't just go away that easily. You can't just put someone in front of their stimulant and just expect things to get better, nevertheless, she did.

I went into that room today...and I was doing well until half way through. Then one word from an instructor on just turning an IV bag upside down and I froze. I was useless. I became excessively hot, sweating, shaking finger, heart palpitations, the works. 
I'm just so frustrated because I've done so well so far and this one thing brought me down. Just came for a little support and ranting here. Thanks guys. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi guys,

So I've just been put on clinical warning for my weakness in critical thinking? 
What will help me? In short, I usually go in in the  morning, hear patient report, and then start prioritizing. I then start to think
- what is the admitting diagnosis
-what needs to be done for this patient and why?
- Why are we giving these meds and what do they do?

What ELSE do I need to think about? I'm just so frustrated here.

Should i be looking at their history? What am I looking for?
What else should I worry about?
fjdklas AHHHH.

	<TEXT> when i was a senior in High school, i went to play hide and seek in Ikea with my friends. Two of us were hiding in a bath tub. Suddenly and ikea representative comes in and puts her hand on the curtain and says "let me show you this particular  bath tub" and opens it half way and the couple says they dont' want to see it. So without looking at the bathtub, the representative closes the curtain and walks  out. Had she just turned around, she would have seen us.

	<TEXT> Depending on where you live, LAYERS. One of you classes may be in a building that is stuffy and hot. Another may be in and ice box. Again, LAYERS.

Realize that everyone you meet during welcome week will most likely be your college friend group. If they are, great, but if not, join clubs that you are interested in and friendships will come easy

Don't drink if you don't want to - no matter what peer pressure you get. Remember you are not the only one not drinking. Chances are, at least 40% of the people around you aren't drinking either. 

Don't freak out if your GPA goes lower in college. IT HAPPENS and it's pretty much natural. Just try to get it as high as you can your freshman year, because things will get harder.

Force people to walk you home at night. Do NOT let them guilt you into walking home alone. 

You will have to work. HARD (most likely unless you are a super genius.) Get into the habit of not studying for tests the day before. It will kill you in college. 

ENJOY. Learn to be independent. RELAX, you'll do great!! GL. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Two tips:

1. find out what your one make-up vice is. What do you REALLY like and just makes you feel good and confident? Carry it around with you in your cute little purse, even if you don't use it a lot. Having it there just makes you feel feminine. (mine is lip gloss)

2. Lingerie. IT'S FOR YOURSELF. It'll make you feel feminine and sexy. Get something you feel comfortable and girly in. And if you want to show it off, go get em' girl! 

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 21F So, I've been thinking about my options for birth control lately since I want to start having sex with my boyfriend. He's all for using a male condom, but I would like to be on sometime of birth control as well to make it safer.
I've looked at all the methods open to me on the planned parenthood site and done my research but now I'm just extremely anxious about what to do. To be honest, everything is scaring me now. 
I would really prefer something that doesn't mess with my hormones or decrease my period. Otherwise, I really liked the idea of Depo Provera or the Patch.
I thought about the sponge, or nuvaRing which really feels the best and most comfortable to me, but I'm just so terrified they'll get stuck up there and I won't know what to do. I mean what are the chances of that? What are other people's thoughts of them?
Another problem is I really don't want my parents to know, or they will kill me. ( I'm Indian- and it just wouldn't be a realm great joy to them if they knew I wanted to have sex.)   so please keep that in mind!

Anyway, a little anxious here and would really appreciate some advice

edit: I've also read that you can use spermicide on it's own (without the diaphragm) with a condom on. Would any one suggest that? </TEXT>

she said I had never written a good soap note (which is impossible -because I've been doing soap notes for two years and all the nurses say they are great and fix nothing.)
i didn't know where to put the 5   6 lead on a pt and asked my instructor and she called me incompetent and dragged me out of the room.
and when i was doing a pt assessment she also dragged me out of the room saying that i needed to let the pt eat his lunch when the pt clearly stated that he'd rather get the assessment over and eat in peace after that. Then my instructor documented that I had incompetent assessment skills. 
These are a couple of the things that went wrong.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> 

Hmm, where do I start? I've finally found a place to tell my story and maybe encourage a few other nursing students while I'm at it.
In my 1st semester of Junior year, I was on a cardiac med surge floor. I loved it, at first. Love  reading EKGs, loved giving meds, and making connections to patients and setting up IVs, - I loved all of it. Then, my instructor started to get picky with me. She started to yell at me, ask me "what were you thinking!?", told me I'd never become a nurse, told me I was going to fail no matter what I did. I went in to my labs for extra practice because by this point  I was pretty scared. She sent me for senior year testing, and of course - I failed it because I had just started my junior year. I"m not up to end of year senior status as a nursing student. She called me incompetent and all.
When I confronted her and asked why she was allowing other students to learn  in a non-theatening manner and not myself - she said again, you are incompetent. And don't bother trying to tell anyone this because no one will believe you. I mean come on, who are they going to believe, a clinical instructor or a student who seems to be failing." After that, she failed me for the semester- I developed Panic disorder and depression.
The next semester where I was doing my OB rotation and Psych rotation were a mess. I froze up everytime my clinical instructor came to talk to me or see me do Ivs or exams. I started shaking, hyperventilitating. Things weren't going well. I went on panic disorder and depression medication...I was a mess, like I said. BUT, slowly, things started to get better. My instructor was kind, she understood, my psychiatrist was kind, and I started to believe in my self. Somehow- through some miracle I made it and passed through that semester. I lost a lot, but I gained a lot of strength. I am no longer student president of my class. I am barely hanging in the Honors program of my school, and any internship I could have wanted was out of my reach. BUT, like I said, I gained a lot of strength. Going back into medsurge this year is scary. I think about someone yelling at me everyday, but I know i can do it. Be confident, practice, and most of all, never believe anyone that says you can't be a nurse. You can and you will.

	<TEXT> I really enjoyed this article! 
One of the things I had to argue about though is the line: 
"The ultimate goal of all feminists, male or female, is and rightly should be the welfare and social and political emancipation of women."

I wouldn't entirely agree with that. The more updated definition of feminism is the political, economical, and social equality of the sexes. Not just WOMEN. 

Because of the older definition of feminism, my boyfriend will NOT admit he is feminist even though he so clearly is. 

Anyway, good article overall, get's a good look into the male mind (I think.) </TEXT>
