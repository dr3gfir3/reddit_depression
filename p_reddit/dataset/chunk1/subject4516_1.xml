	<TEXT> You know what, it sucked more when I was still working part time and studying, I'm typically a person with a lot of energy, but he was working full time and commuting a long way, and just really tired a lot. I didn't get that at the time and I was frustrated and hurt from all the rejection. Now I also work full time and have a really stressful job as well, I used to commute further than him and that meant catching the same train so morning sex upped the frequency side of things, but now I'm in a closer office and it seems we real rely see each other and the frequency has dropped right off. I still get really hurt by the rejection, but I've sort of gotten used to it. I'm kind of dreading what having children and being an at home mum will do for my libido and sex life - apart from career and motherhood balance, man, being human sucks. Sorry, thanks for asking, I don't often get a chance to think about it much. </TEXT>

One lesson he went around the class asking "what would be the moral of the story of Romeo and Juliet?"

Everyone was offering all these romantic sentiments like "young love is fleeting", "loving once is better than not loving at all" 

When the Professor got to me I said "Read the fucking letter before drinking the poison" he said "Bingo! Ok now let's watch this crap" </TEXT>

Anyway, may answer is yes, I like it, particularly in 69 position so that I can tease and reciprocate, it's kind of like when two people are jumping on a trampoline and one tries to "bounce out" the other one so they stumble. It's a fun game to do with your mouth on your partner's pink parts. He'll be like "lick lick suck...ohh,mm, LICKSUCKSUCK" and vice versa.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One time a drunk guy told me I had "massive tits" in a loud voice then asked me to show them to him outside a pub. I said "Nothank you, but show me your dick and I may consider it" he then proceeded to unzip his pants and pull out one nut, showing me his hairy scrotum. I told him "That's not fair, is you're dick so tiny that you're embarrassed to get it out?" He then became rather upset and went on to say that I have nothing going for me and I am a loser.

I laughed and entered the venue and when he tried to follow me he was refused entry and manhandled by the bouncers. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if I would call it a fetish, but I have a real thing for European men and I'd like to have sex with a clown.

The first one is easy, I had a completely beautiful Polish man as an admirer once, he was utterly sexy, fit, passionate, infuriating and confusing. With an incredible body. Nothing ever really happened, he was such a tease (and secretly quite nervous, he didn't think I could tell) and I suppose I was nervous too (because I didn't really believe he actually liked me, I don't think of myself as particularly alluring or beautiful - so I think that discouraged him and my not reciprocating might have even hurt him a little) but he was terribly romantic and passionate both in word and action and I always find myself wondering what might have happened had I reciprocated, and fantasising about it. I now kind of have a big thing for European men as a result.

The clown thing, well it's a combination of always loving the circus, clowns and acrobats, from a very young age. And I once was the object of a Russian clown's affections (as part of his act, not in reality - a girl can hope though) I absolutely love Jimmy Stewart as Buttons the clown in "The Greatest Show on Earth" and David Bowie in the video for "Strangers when we meet" (where he isn't really a clown, but the imagery is circus-like and I LOVE Bowie) and gosh I just don't know, clowns are often so so fit, due to the physicality of their acts and acrobatics. And just such romantic archetypes. But yes I would fuck a clown, more importantly a European clown, make up and all. </TEXT>

Penis enlargement becoming commonplace? Just, please, no. Humans are beautiful and diverse just the way we are (and I have seen a lot, A LOT, of naked bodies in my time due to my work) and I just simply cannot understand why a person would mutilate themselves due to vanity. I do understand if there is a medical or functional need or if someone was born in a body that doesn't suit how they identify, but cutting bits of yourself off or pumping bits full of silicone to achieve an unachievable ideal culturally mediated by a hegemonic media and advertising. I just do not get. Sorry. I did say I was old. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Get another doctor or, seek the advice of a professional who works exclusively with drugs that effect the brain. General Practitioners rarely have any idea of different SSRIs effects or possible interactions and they will generally use a "suck it and see" process, trying one then another then another. 

These are medications that effect the function of your brain. You don't want to fuck around with your brain. Also, your brain is unique, as is everyone's, so a drug that works for me and still lets me keep my libido may not work the same for you or Joe Blow down the street. The same way that Chanel No. 5 smells wicked on my mum but smells like cat piss on me.

That's all the advice I can offer, I also used fluoxetine and other SSRIs for a few years and it screwed with my libido, but eventually found that sex was a better antidepressant than the drugs were and weaned off it and got into dance, singing and training hard. But that won't work for everybody. Good luck. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always believed that I would meet him one day. Every time I go to Sydney I say "Oooh I wonder if we'll meet David Bowie today?" This usually confuses who ever I'm heading there with.

But it's because a group of ladies who used to lunch in a cafe/deli I used to work at once told me a story. They all worked for the Macquarie Bank, a few of them had quite high positions. So one day in the 80s they were at the Marble Bar having a liquid lunch when one of them spied a rakish younger man at the bar, and said "Hey girls, do you reckon that bloke up there looks like David Bowie?"
Dares were made and one of the ladies went up and asked him, wether he was David Bowie, or wether he just looked like him. He admitted that he was in fact David Bowie. He lived in Sydney at that time. Then my friend, pointing at the piano, asked if he would care to prove it. And he did. He gave the almost empty bar a little concert of four songs and then enjoyed free drinks for the rest of the afternoon. All the ladies said that he was a very nice young man. One said that he even got her hormones racing.

I guess I'll never meet him now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I feel like this would send mixed signals and it would be totally unfair to remind her of nicer, passionate more connected times for the both of you, particularly since your analysis is that you are incompatible and she doesn't agree with this analysis. You guys seem to be a little hooked on each other, so if there is a chance you can get over your differences and get back together, then go for it. But if not and this is going to leave her hoping to get back together when you clearly don't want to, then I personally wouldn't go there. Less drama that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think most women usually only come from clitoral stimulation, so nothing to worry about there. As above there's no rule that says you must come from PIV, and count yourself lucky that you actually can orgasm cause I've read that there are a lot of women who can't. I can only speak from my own experience, but I feel like when I relaxed about it all and didn't make a big deal about it, it just happened. 

It probably helped that my BF (now husband) will always get me off before PIV a few times, and then again after if I don't get there. So the pressure is well and truly off, and one day - Sploosh! Vaginal orgasm out of nowhere. I feel like when I stopped putting so much importance on it, I relaxed enough for it to happen. But it still doesn't happen often and more often than not it will happen from fingering rather than PIV. But now that I'm more relaxed (and older, I'm pretty old) I have discovered all sorts of other orgasms, nipple ones and neck kissing ones.

Edit: I misunderstood the question. I fixed that up now haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's your hymen. Mine was like this, waaaaay long ago in the dark ages before I lost my virginity. I guess the important thing to remember is that each woman is different, so nobody can tell you exactly what you're going to feel when you have sex for the first time. 

For me when I lost my virginity it was too tight the first time we tried it, I was a bit stressed out and my BF was fairly big, and we hadn't had any foreplay beyond some touching in the cinema. It was pretty painful as well, and his penis wouldn't go in. But he was understanding and we cuddled instead and then tried again a few days later, with lots of foreplay, (touching, kissing, BJ, cunnilingus - the whole lot) and then we had sex with me on top so that I could control things, and because I was well lubricated, he slipped right in, causing just the tiniest tear in my hymen. It was actually wonderful and one of my favourite memories ever. It hurt, but just a little bit, and after a few seconds it felt really good!

So it probably will hurt but only a little as long as you have a partner who is patient and understanding and passionate enough to want to spend a long time on foreplay, and I would also suggest using lube as well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From a ladies perspective-use your words. Say "I'm going to cum" and then it's up to her to either keep riding and then get you to get her off with your mouth and/or fingers/or both or she can stop, press on your perineum or just stop and catch breath with you before continuing or change positions. There is no psychic, magic pill. You could also talk about it when not in the heat of the moment and make a bit of a plan. But really, just use your words and you'll be ok. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a lady in a similar situation as you, we're in about 1-2 times a month and have also found that exercise and meditation, although they help a bit, don't really give me the relief I need. 

Masturbation is great, it clears the cobwebs and I watch good porn and that gets me going but both usually make me frustrated about what I'm missing out on. I too prefer the intimacy of being with my other half and making love to him as well as getting off.

I also issues with concentration and motivation when I'm not getting any, and tried mindfulness, but I wasn't very good at that. So I've been having imagination breaks, writing mostly, or getting out in the garden with my headphones on and just letting the creative visualisation happen. It's got so that I have a bunch of characters and sometimes things get rather steamy and erotic scenes play out on the paper and in a way it's satisfying for me in that I guess my brain is my biggest sexual organ. It's still not as lovely and intimate as having sex with my husband, but I don't think anything is. At least my little imagination breaks with the characters I've made up and short erotic fiction help me remember that I've still got it.

Sorry I can't help you more, but that's what helps me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Number one top fantasy is completely  unachievable, sex with a clown. With the make up on. It can't be a scary pervert clown though, think old fashioned and sweet like Jimmy Stewart in "The Greatest Show on Earth" or romantic and rakish like David Bowie in the "Strangers when we meet" video clip. I imagine my clown would have a beautiful body beneath his baggy trousers due to all the tumbling and acrobatics he does, I imagine him as Victorian or steampunk. He would probably be European. I know there are clowns like this out there, Cirque du Soleil and various other circuses and the steampunk thing is really in right now, but unfortunately I'm married. No clown sex for me.

Apart from that my real and achievable sexual bucket list:- I would really love to be properly spanked, as a form of foreplay, rather than just a novelty. I'd like long, slow, teasing oral sex - not something that seems like a race to orgasm. I'd like to tie up a man and tease, tickle and dominate him until he can't help but orgasm and I'd like that for me as well.
