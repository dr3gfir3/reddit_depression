	<TEXT> Honestly, I don't even feel like it'd be great to let something go inside me. It actually makes me even a bit uneasy, to be fair, but I can't even say it's trauma because I don't remember anything that happened when I was younger that was even remotely close to that.

Also, it's been some time that I went to a gynecologist, as I said there. That's especially because I want to freak out whenever I go to one... and think along with me here: if I feel uneasy of even showing my legs off/wearing dresses, just imagine what actually showing my ladybits to a complete stranger feels like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, I personally never got turned on by them, so that was also my opinion there (but Terpers would dismiss it, much probably). Probably also because I'm sensitive AF on that region and it's painful instead of anything close to pleasurable to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They say society is gynocentric and then go on to say how all women use their "prime years" (*insert cringe here*) to go around... that's right, male genitalia.

I mean, women are all self centered Machiavellian harpies with venomous views about men... and yet they all drop their panties on the floor if they see an "alpha dick" 'cause that's all life's about for a woman.

Uh. 


Now look at RP/PUA community pages and see how many posts focusing around "how 2 get da boosy" there are.

	<TEXT> I think she could be just joking, though. I've seen lots of people who make jokes around this, both men and women; I've just seen people going against women doing that, though, but still, it was there, especially when people needed to vent through humour or were in groups they knew they could say these things without being lectured about "being more womanly" and groups everyone joked around harmlessly between each other and ABOUT each other. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am aware. I just wish more people wanted to be "cool" (as in not being jerks) instead of, well, asshats. I know good people still exist especially because of a long term friend of mine... who's actually a guy with many traits people often say are "lacking" on the world. And completely despises TRP as a whole to add to the bunch :v

LOL, glad for the offer, but I've never been into makeup :P it's not even that nobody wanted to teach me, it's just me that never enjoyed it because it felt odd on my skin for some reason. Still, I also hope you're alright there and that you'll find someone who needs a new lipstick, too :P </TEXT>

	<TITLE> A "Thank You" For You All Here </TITLE>

	<TEXT> First of all, nobody has to read my last post. In a TL;DR: dated a traditionalist, felt like I was being chained down, broke up, decided to vent here because I know this is the only place guys won't come up to ostracize me by taking an actual right choice. He himself said he wouldn't change, so yeah, I don't want "relationship experts" telling me to try changing him if he doesn't want to. Also, it doesn't work if the person still thinks the same way but doesn't show it.

ANYWAY. A special thanks for u/thelastpear. Really, I'm grateful as fuck for your message and it did help me a lot to know that good people still exist ('cause you know, I like to think people are still good but it's hard when I deal with dickheads everyday), and a thanks for all of you for comprehending. For real. And I have to admit that I used this time out of that relationship to actually put my mind to some use on... STEM. Yeah, that area Terpers say women are bad at. I luv eet.

And I admit I was bitter about the guy's view, indeed. Which was the main reason why I decided to do a lot of searches that proved his point wrong. Turns out I was right, though a certain one is more personal (like the fact that I don't think personalities are "feminine/masculine" or that inborn natures truly exist) considering that I used a personal example... which is my mother's side of the family and my brother himself. I mean, he's the greatest nurturer I ever met when it comes to children, and I'm just a floppy pile of carbon-based life who can't word my feelings like women "should" do. Personal problem, yeah, never been an expressive person, but it's not like people teached me to be that way.

Either way, thanks a lot, TBP. Even if you didn't say anything directly to me, the fact that people like y'all exist is already a motivational to me. It's good to know that I don't stand alone about these things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see. I'm sorry if my question came out kinda rude; as I said on my post here, I broke up with someone yesterday because he had RP-like views, and... well, it's all really similar to one another.

Anyway, thank you for replying. I'm sorry if this question feels a bit hard to answer. </TEXT>
