From L. E. Sterling:

Hi, everyone!
Im L.E. Sterling, author of the sci-fi Y/A novel, True Born, and Im here to answer your burning book questions!
But first, for those not familiar: True Born is the first novel in a YA sci-fi/fantasy dystopian series (also called True Born). Identical twins Lucy and Margot Fox are from Dominion Citys elite Upper Circle. Although the twins hope to be told they are Splicers at their Reveal party when they turn 18  those who can afford to have their DNA spliced, warding off the plague that is decimating the population  theyre put through round after round of testingand no one will tell them why. Meanwhile, as unrest among the dying Lasters (those who cant afford to Splice) rises to a fever pitch, the girls father hires a team of mysterious True Borns  genetically resistant to the Plague, but not entirely human, either - to watch the girls. From there the questions keep mounting: what threatens the girls security  and if they arent Splicers like others in their Circle, what exactly are they?
A little more about me: True Born (Bk1) hit stores two days ago (yay!). Im also the author of two previous YA novels: The Originals (under pen name L.E. Vollick), and Plutos Gate. I once taught a class on vampire literature and another on superheroes. I completed a PhD thesis on magic (seriously). I'm Canadian, but of no relation to William Shatner (he wishes!).
Im here to answer all of your burning book questions for a few hours (from 7:30 pm - 10:30 pm EST), so ASK ME ANYTHING!
Proof: P.S. I totally bragged about this event on my website here: https://le-sterling.com/2016/05/01/ask-me-anything-thursday-may-5th-2016/

From Ryan:

Hello, Im Ryan Gattis, the author of ALL INVOLVED (optioned by Alan Ball   HBO), KUNG FU HIGH SCHOOL (acquired by The Weinstein Company)which is soon to be re-released in the United Kingdom as KUNG FU, as well as two crime novellas in a series called THE BIG DROP: HOMECOMING (1)   IMPERMANENCE (2). Im part of a street art crew in L.A. (http://www.uglarworks.com/) and a board member at 1888 (http://1888.center/), a Southern California literary arts non-profit.
True story: I once had my face rearranged so badly that I needed two facial reconstructive surgeries to fix it and the doctor who performed them told me Id never smell or taste again. He was wrong, thankfully. Im from Colorado originally, but am a huge proponent of Los Angeles and of tacosa tacoponent, you might say. Wait, no. Dont say that. That sounds like Im against tacos. Too close to opponent. Well work on it later in editing.
Ill be answering questions here from 10-11a PST, which is 1-2p EST,   either 6p or 7p in Europe, depending on where youre calling from. AMA, Redditors!
Proof: https://twitter.com/Ryan_Gattis/status/727484109027610624
About ALL INVOLVED: 6 days of rioting. 17 different narrators in the most diverse city on earthall just trying to survive. The novel is grounded in 2.5 years of research   background spent with former Latino gang members, firefighters, nurses,   other L.A. citizens who lived through it. It has won the American Library Associations Alex Award   the Lire Award for Noir of the Year in France.
Heres a TED talk I did about my journey to write this book, which included being summoned to a sit-down with a former South Central gang lord: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PG3tp2oA3xo
For those unfamiliar with the scope of the 92 L.A. riots, the most destructive civic disturbance in U.S. history, heres some quick background: http://www.lariotsallinvolved.com/

	<TITLE> The /r/books bookclub selection for May is The Water Knife by Paolo Bacigalupi </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-28 01:51:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We are very excited to be reading The Water Knife and talking to Paolo Bacigalupi this month.  Many of you may be familiar with some of his other books like [The Windup Girl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Windup_Girl) which won a Hugo and Nebula award in 2010. 

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23209924-the-water-knife):

In the American Southwest, Nevada, Arizona, and California skirmish for dwindling shares of the Colorado River. Into the fray steps Angel Velasquez, detective, leg-breaker, assassin and spy. A Las Vegas water knife, Angel "cuts" water for his boss, Catherine Case, ensuring that her lush, luxurious arcology developments can bloom in the desert, so the rich can stay wet, while the poor get nothing but dust. When rumors of a game-changing water source surface in drought-ravaged Phoenix, Angel is sent to investigate. There, he encounters Lucy Monroe, a hardened journalist with no love for Vegas and every reason to hate Angel, and Maria Villarosa, a young Texas refugee who survives by her wits and street smarts in a city that despises everything that she represents.  With bodies piling up, bullets flying, and Phoenix teetering on collapse, it seems like California is making a power play to monopolize the life-giving flow of a river. For Angel, Lucy, and Maria time is running out and their only hope for survival rests in each others hands. But when water is more valuable than gold, alliances shift like sand, and the only thing for certain is that someone will have to bleed if anyone hopes to drink.  </TEXT>

From Charles: 

Firstly, a special thanks to any night-owls dropping in from earlier time zones, as well as to early-birds from later ones.
I suspect a lot of todays questions will be about the Caine Riordan/Terran Republic series, the third of which, Raising Caine, is up for the Nebula right now. I also write with Eric Flint in the NYT best-selling Ring of Fire/1632 series, and with Steve White in the NYT best-selling Starfire series. Or you may have seen my science fiction in Analog, and various anthologies.
Im also a (non-teaching) Distinguished Professor of English and a five-time Fulbright recipient. I received the American Library Associations 2006 Choice Award for Best Book, Rumors of War and Infernal Machines. I also designed and wrote for various RPGs and worked in film and video in the 80s and early 90s, and currently serve as a subject matter expert for both government organizations and national media venues.
Lastly, I have to prove Im who I say I am, so heres a link to not only my FB page, but one of my posts announcing this AMA session:
https://www.facebook.com/chuck.gannon.01/posts/10206040705158157
And now...ask me anything about these or related topics! </TEXT>

From Charles: 

Firstly, a special thanks to any night-owls dropping in from earlier time zones, as well as to early-birds from later ones.
I suspect a lot of todays questions will be about the Caine Riordan/Terran Republic series, the third of which, Raising Caine, is up for the Nebula right now. I also write with Eric Flint in the NYT best-selling Ring of Fire/1632 series, and with Steve White in the NYT best-selling Starfire series. Or you may have seen my science fiction in Analog, and various anthologies.
Im also a (non-teaching) Distinguished Professor of English and a five-time Fulbright recipient. I received the American Library Associations 2006 Choice Award for Best Book, Rumors of War and Infernal Machines. I also designed and wrote for various RPGs and worked in film and video in the 80s and early 90s, and currently serve as a subject matter expert for both government organizations and national media venues.
Lastly, I have to prove Im who I say I am, so heres a link to not only my FB page, but one of my posts announcing this AMA session:

From Holly:

Hi, I'm Holly Jennings. My debut novel Arena was just released on April 5. I've also authored several short stories, though lately my focus has been on novels. Arena was inspired by the growing popularity of eSports and the emergence of at-home VR technology. I predict (and hope!) it will only be a matter of time before they converge, and gamers will be competing against each other in virtual space.
As the firstborn of a sports enthusiast, it wasn't long before my father discovered that the only games I'd ever learn to conquer involved consoles and controllers. I enjoy most kinds of video games, other than horror and anything turn-based. My recent favorites are Fallout 4 and GTA V. I was also not addicted to WoW for many, many years.
Random fact: I love robots, Firefly, and my grandma, but not in that order. Besides writing and gaming, I also enjoy several other creative hobbies like drawing, reading, and landscaping  though I've yet to plant anything that lasted through the year. My current obsession is Orphan Black.
I will be here 2:30-4:30 PM ET to answer your questions! </TEXT>

From Josh:

Hello Reddit/Books! I'm Josh Vogt, author of the urban fantasy series, The Cleaners, which launched last year with Enter the Janitor and has Book #2, The Maids of Wrath, coming out today. I'm also the tie-in author of Pathfinder Tales novel, Forge of Ashes, as well as the first HC SVNT DRACONES novel, Fate's Fangs.
I also moved to the Seattle area late last year to work full-time for Paizo, as an editor for the Pathfinder Roleplaying Game. You can find a decent rundown of myself and my work through my website: JRVogt.com or on Twitter via @JRVogt
When not reading or writing, I'm often exploring my new hometown, training for my next mud-run/obstacle course race, searching for a new seafood restaurant to indulge in, or trying to improve my extremely amateur fly-fishing techniques.
Oh, and for anyone interested, I'm currently holding a Goodreads giveaway for Enter the Janitor.
So, ask me anything! </TEXT>

From Adam: 

Im Adam Mitzner, the author of The Girl From Home, which came out yesterday, and three other legal thriller novels  A Conflict of Interest (2011), A Case of Redemption (2013) and Losing Faith (2015). In addition to writing legal thrillers, Im a full-time practicing lawyer at a New York City law firm.
Im happy to talk with you about anything  writing, the law, Batman, how to start a novel, how to get it published, you name it.
First, a tiny bit about my books. I write thrillers with a legal bent, but I prefer to think about them as first and foremost, character driven stories.In my first book, A CONFLICT OF INTEREST, I wrote about a man who was on the path to success, and then through a series of bad decisions lost his way. For my sophomore effort -- A CASE OF REDEMPTION -- I started out the other way  focusing on a character that had lost everything before the book opens, and was trying find his way back. LOSING FAITH is about a man who has reached the pinnacle of his professional, and explores how fragile such a high perch can be, and the lengths he and those who love him will go to hold on to it. Finally, in my most recent book  THE GIRL FROM HOME  the protagonist is a man whos willing to do whatever it takes to get what he wants, and through the course of the novel hes confronted with the price to be paid for such life choices, and whether hes capable of changing his ways.
I'll be on Reddit for the next three hours or so, and Ill answer questions about writing, the law or Batman (or something else if I know anything about it), so just ask! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The /r/books bookclub selection for April is Dead Wake by Erik Larson! He will be doing an AMA here on April 27th. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-03-30 01:38:24 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This month we are excited to be featuring a nonfiction book for the first time! Erik Larson's writing style is very readable so even if you don't read a lot of nonfiction I encourage you to give this a try.  

#[Link to the discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/4dx7jj/a_discussion_is_dead_wake_by_erik_larson_the/?)

From [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22551730-dead-wake):

On May 1, 1915, with WWI entering its tenth month, a luxury ocean liner as richly appointed as an English country house sailed out of New York, bound for Liverpool, carrying a record number of children and infants. The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the eras great transatlantic Greyhoundsthe fastest liner then in serviceand her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack. 

Germany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwiegers U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly smallhubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and moreall converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.

It is a story that many of us think we know but dont, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love. 

Gripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history.

From Wendy:

Proof of me is in the link below! I started writing later in life, in my forties, after leaving a twenty-five plus year career as an actress in regional theater, Off Broadway, on Broadway, TV and commercials. My other work has been published in Redbook, on Powells.com and in the Los Angeles press, where I live with my screenwriter husband and our two kids. My first memoir CHANEL BONFIRE was about my fabulously neglectful childhood, being dragged around the world by my chain-smoking, bipolar, trophy wife mother - just trying to stay alive and get my homework done. The second, HEART OF GLASS, picks up where CHANEL left off as I move to New York in 1980, trying to find an identity, a not mean or crazy boyfriend (this proved to be quite difficult) and some kind of fulfilling work as an actress. I made many mistakes, slept around - looking for love in all the wrong places, and had run ins with the police, jaded rock stars and of course my psychotic mother who screeches through the story periodically to make me feel small and unloved. I can answer questions on publishing, agents, bad boyfriends, failed birth control, acting, Hollywood, substance abuse, and being a mom raised by a mom who was nuts. Looking forward to your questions!

My name is Shawn Speakman. And I lie for a living.
When I tell people that, they assume I'm either a politician or a lawyer. I get the sideways look like I'm a demon or some kind of virulent pathogen. I always chuckle at that. But a fiction writer lies more, I think, if to less damaging effect.
Besides webmastering for Shannara author Terry Brooks and writing my own novels, I enjoy editing anthologies.

And now that Unbound is newly published, the wonderful people here at r/Books have asked if some of the anthology's contributors would stop by to answer your questions about Unbound, books in general, the craft of writing, or whatever you want to discuss!

Hi, Im Laurel Saville, the author of two novels, a memoir, several design books, and essays, articles and short stories. I've been all around the fast-changing world of publishing, from NYC agent, to work-for-hire, self-pubbing, and now, I am happily being published by the Amazon imprint, Lake Union. I'm also a brand communications consultant and have been a full-time writer for about a dozen years. I've lived in LA, NJ, VT, NY and now WA, have a BA in English Lit from NYU and an MFA in creative writing and literature from the Writing Seminars at Bennington College, and am getting a certificate in my other passion, Applied Animal Behavior. I volunteer with two shelter organizations where I work on re-habbing rescue dogs and helping new adopters live happily with their dogs. I live with 2 dogs, 1 cat, 4 ducks and 1 husband on an island in the Puget Sound.
You can find more about me at www.laurelsaville.com. Ask me anything. (I'll be here at about 2 pm ET to begin answering questions).

From Chris and Larry:

In 1989, military thriller RED PHOENIX showed what might happen if North Korea invaded the South as it did in 1950. That was the threat the Republic of Korea and its ally, the United States, planned and trained for. Our sequel to the original, RED PHOENIX BURNING, showcases how another scenario has emerged: Instead of invading the south, what if the Northern regime imploded, disrupted by a coup or some other form of internal stuggle?
