	<TEXT> The recent comments are probably reactions to other people suggesting versions of the Mindcrack logo pixelart and Bdubs saying that he hates it when other people suggest ideas to him that implies "I did it better". I love Bdubs but I think not only is he okay with a little criticism, being a YouTuber and all, but he also understands that most of them are good natured joking around. Understand that even the Mindcrackers themselves tease each other about these things. Just look how long the Pause on vacation or the Beef has no legs jokes have lasted. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe I'm being a derp and not seeing it, but what's the eighth chart on the second page of the album for? I don't think any link in the post itself directs to that and there's no title. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I completely agree with the sentimental aspects of this. I've been watching Mindcrack for less than a year, but I came from trying to catch up with all the inside jokes to seeing new members join the team. The season 3 world is Mindcrack for me too. I'm very attached to the places and events that had happened in every corner of this world. However, I do feel that a map reset is in order. After all, the interactions are what make this a server instead of a singleplayer world. The dynamics of these people together are what I enjoy the most about these Guys. ;-) </TEXT>
