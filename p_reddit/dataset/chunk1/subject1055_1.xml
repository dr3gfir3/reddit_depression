	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Mine is from the hostful "Airport Intro", when they're recapping Comic Con, and Chris talks about how, during the Man of Steel panel, a guy in a Superman shirt came to the mic to ask a question, and actually broke down in tears because he was just so happy to be witnessing all this cool stuff that's going on in cinema and stuff. Chris says he went down and just gave him a hug and that this moment just made him so happy because it was such a moment of positivity, and there's like a really positive and mildly cheesy vibe kind of being created on the podcast at this stage, and then Jonah says really bluntly, "It sounds like he could be manic depressive." I don't even know why but I just found that so fucking funny, the way he takes a really positive, light story and puts a really dark twist on it out of nowhere, and you could tell it kind of pissed off Chris.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well yes, he did do that, but I think that even if nothing was being adapted it would still be considered shitty writing - I mainly just meant the dialogue of the characters and how cheesy and cringey it is. I haven't actually read ADWD so my problem with the writing isn't his misunderstanding the source material or anything. Just terrible dialogue imo! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Probably a bit of an odd question: Is it considered totally weird and generally frowned upon for someone to choose not to go to their Debs? Is there anyone here who hasn't? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-07-15 18:48:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm just in a bit of an awkward situation. I have mine coming up at the end of August, and over the past few months I've been wanting to go less and less. Mostly because I barely know my date; I only asked her because I used to have a bit of a thing for her a long time ago, and we spoke a lot in a pub about a year ago, and I left it too late to ask the girl who my heart was set on asking. The girl I am going with has a boyfriend so it'd only be as friends, but we've spoken like twice ever and I'm a pretty quiet person who is mildly awful at holding a conversation with someone I don't know, so I'm afraid it'd just be the most awkward night of my life, and that's without even mentioning the dancing (there's dancing, right? God I really know nothing about the Debs). On top of all that, I really could just do without seeing all those faces from school again, I really want to dissociate myself from everyone there as that whole environment just holds bad stuff in my brain and yeah. As horribly negative as that sounds, I moved on at graduation and I'm done with the place and the people, for the most part. 

So yeah. Just thought I'd check and see how people would think of someone just not going, figured there's no harm in it!

**TL;DR:**    **I am weird and would likely have an internal meltdown of anxiety at my Debs, so would rather not go. Is that bad, do many people choose not to go?**

(I'm really just thinking about this too much aren't I)


**Edit: Thanks so much for the advice everyone - I've thought a lot about it and basically I think that the regret of not having kind of given it a shot and stepped out of my comfort zone would suck more than the awkwardness of going, so I paid for my ticket today.**

**Hopefully I don't fuck everything up too bad!** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a lot of it is just veiled jealousy and bitterness. The woman is wealthy beyond most people's wildest dreams, and ultimately it's because she had sex with a moderately famous guy, and has cameras following her places. She lives a more comfortable life than 99% of people, a life which hasn't really been earned by any real talent or hard work, and being that way in a world where most people work their ass off and don't even get a fraction of that success will definitely result in some jealousy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I initially had a jerk reaction to be annoyed with it, as it is such a departure, but I actually really like it. That riff is fucking sweet in a groove/Rage Against The Machine/bouncy sort of way, and the big scream in the mid section delivers so hard. Also, the chants will be fun as hell live. 

It's different, and I can see why it's divisive. But at least this shows how willing to continue evolving they are; I guarantee that (presuming the whole album is in this vein) either on the album after this one or the next one after that, they will miss being heavier and go back to it in one way or another. I mean, they can't possibly just keep getting softer like this, at this rate, two albums down the line they'll be pop punk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm just really concerned, because all this talk of Jon coming back as Azor Ahai, being the personification of "Ice and Fire" due to being a Stark and a Targaryen, and having a showdown with The Night King (which would lend meaning to the staredown at Hardhome) has been getting me so damn excited. Like, I can't express how much I want this to happen and how incredible it would be to see it all play out on screen. I know some people say it's too obvious and would be boring in a way for that reason, but I honestly would love it.
But surely GRRM has heard all this, and I doubt he would want to just do what everyone expects and wants. He would fuck with people's expectations, as he always has.
I'm just worried and I thought I'd see if anyone else shared these worries, or if my concerns are kind of baseless and I shouldn't be as concerned. </TEXT>

I really was hoping Oli would start to stretch himself more as a lyricist beyond the whole "inner turmoil/ trapped in my head/ I'm drowning/ don't drown with me" thing. Like, how much more can he possibly get from that creatively? It's also just frustrating because the whole genre overuses this whole concept so, so much. Hopefully the whole album will be a bit more varied. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure why, but I'm incredibly excited for the music video for this. It's just such a straight up, simple and happy song, I'll be interested to see what they do with it! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What's with all the mentions of the circlejerk? I just shared this because I thought it was a funny, awkward moment. I'd find it just as funny and worth sharing if Jake Luhrs were having his faith "insulted". I don't think everything to do with Matty Mullins posted here should become a debate/conflict between "pro circlejerk" and "anti circlejerk" factions. It's just a funny video. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, we can't assume Soupy knew about Matty's beliefs in the first place, I wouldn't be surprised if Soupy didn't know a whole lot about MMF considering their bands aren't really the same genre anyway. The joke clearly isn't directed only at Matty, but more just a general joke I guess. That, with the fact that he clearly pointed it out in a playful, joking way, and not a malicious way, kinda does shine a negative light on Matty for taking as a big insult, imo. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it was douchey that he chose a religious tattoo, if it was in fact his favourite. It's just the way he acts as if Soupy personally insulted him and his faith, like he could have been so much more lighthearted about choosing that one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really excited for this. I liked the sound of it from the Warped webcast before it was removed, despite the performance being pretty bad. 

I am hoping the rest of the album will be a little less "safe" though, this song felt very much like it could have been off any of their other albums, or from most other metalcore bands today, to be honest. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really don't see how you can watch any performance from the Wembley show and say he sucks, he nailed everything imo. Granted, he usually isn't as great, but I don't think he generally "sucks" by any means. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The 30 second sample is SO much better in the context of the song. I was a bit disappointed by the sample, maybe because I still have memories of how phenomenal it was hearing Domino as the first song on The Afterman albums, but after hearing the whole song with the intro, I'm so fucking into it. Such a summer vibe and it's like old, Blood Red Summerish Coheed but more mature. 

I love it. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> This is probably a stupid question, but is Red Bull Zero Calories still terrible for you, and a bad idea during weight loss? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Just asking because I saw it in the shop the other day, and I guess I used to really like energy drinks before I stopped drinking them, so it'd be nice to be able to have something that . Any nutritional information I've looked up just tells me it has extra sweeteners and as much caffeine as normal Red Bull, so I don't know how to tell if I should still stay away from it. Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, thanks for bringing this to my attention. [This](http://www.thomann.de/ie/pearl_wood_fiberglass_satin_cocoa.htm) kit is absolutely gorgeous and youtube videos tell me it plays well, so I'll definitely keep it in mind, cheers! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've heard so many good things about that kit, I always played one for my exams in the School of Music I did my grades in. Would it be a good kit for a player who plays mostly harder rock stuff, as in letlive. and heavier Led Zeppelin sort of style? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Starting college in September to study drums for four years, and looking to upgrade to a better kit from my beginner one I've been playing since I started seven years ago. What are some great mid range kits, around $900-1300, and where should I look for second hand kits? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-06-29 23:37:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It's just been dawning on me that I really, really should upgrade, as my current kit (it's an Astro beginner kit, it's pretty awful sounding but it plays ok) is just falling apart and there are bits missing. I've been looking at this [Pearl Vision Maple kit with Walnut finish](http://www.thomann.de/ie/pearl_vml_studio_walnut_802.htm). I've been trying to find a Sonor Essential Force kit without the hardware and no second rack tom as I wouldn't use it, but I've had no luck so far. 

Also, where would one look to find second hand kits? I'd definitely be into buying a better kit second hand for a similar price. 

Any and all advice greatly appreciated, cheers!  </TEXT>
