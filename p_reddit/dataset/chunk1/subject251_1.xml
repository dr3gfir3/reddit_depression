	<TEXT> I've definitely noticed this dynamic in live poker too.  Sometimes you almost need to underbet the pot to get action.  If you have a nutted hand like this I don't think theres anything wrong w better smaller.

Think about it, how often have you seen OMC fire flop turn and river for $15 a pop w the immortal nuts?  And he gets called every time.... But if hes firing 75% pot all 3 streets, he NEVER gets action.   </TEXT>

I haven't played too much online after Black Friday and have gone in spurts of 40+ hours a week live to playing almost zero hours in a month.  At the very least I would like to set a volume goal for live poker - but along with that should come some sort of bankroll challenge as well, I feel like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's accusing you and your father for cheating or colluding against him. Basically by him betting and you raising you are isolating and making it a lot harder for he villain to continue the hand. When you fold the river it looks to him like you were raising and squeezing the villain off the hand only so your dad or yourself could win the pot. 

I can see why he would be upset, but it's hardly collusion... I would have just told him I had 47 and were counterfeited  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  RESULT:
I'm not happy with how I played this hand - even though it worked out.  My friend commented that he liked the line, but the more I look back at it I don't like it.  I tank checked, trying to make it look like a missed flop and cbet.  Villain fired $45, I thought for a 10 seconds or so and looked at his stack and jammed the rest in.  I got called and doubled through but I really got lucky to get all the chips in the middle I think.

I think betting the turn is necessary.  $80 or so seems like a good number.  It may induce some bluffs, but I think he draws w hands and gets stubborn w one pair type hands for this amount. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hero has been running well, but playing well too I suppose.
Sitting on around $500 in the hijack w QTcc and straddle from UTG.  One limp from a tight passive player w around $80 from MP, Hero pumps to $17 with one flat from button who is a drunk Mexican who is playing super strangely...limping AK, but cold calling w hands like 95o, sits on around $300.  Likes to bet when checked too, but likes to call a lot of bets too.  BB also flats, and MP folds ( LOL ).
Flop runs QT5sdc.  Checked to hero who bets $36, Mexican calls and bb folds. Turn is a 2c giving us top two and a fd.  


Bet (how much)? Check/r (how much?)
I'll provide turn action after some feedback. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Reduces variance in big spots.  For example, if you get 1000 bb all in on the flop w top two vs a straight flush draw (hypothetical situation) you can choose to run multiple turns and rivers.  It's preference, some people only run it once, some people ask to run it twice or even 3 times (ive seen as many as 4) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I really doubt he is shoving the river with KQ or QT.  Those hands are more or less bluff catchers after you bet the river and if he jams hes turning his hand into a bluff really.  I can maybe understand him taking this line with AQ (which we chop with). 

So river shove is crappy... We don't beat many hands that would shove river for value.  That being said we have 95 bucks back on the river with an effective 305 in the middle (30 pre, 60 on turn, 120 on turn - plus his shove of 95 effective).  With over 3:1 on a call here I think it sucks because he is either very nutted or completely aired; gotta rely on some table history/reads w this guy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While unfortunate, you cant be results oriented like this an all of a sudden expect villains to have trips whenever the board is paired.  You have to analyze the action preflop, flop, turn, and river.  Given the preflop action you cant put very many combos of 2x in his range.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think youre really lost in this idea that villain has trips if hes calling or raising.  This is one of the driest flops in poker - he almost NEVER has a 2 here.  

If we cbet and get called, its most likely 55-TT type of hand, some Jx, and MAYBE 2 overs like KQbdfd or QTbdfd like SkeetRag said.  If we bet and get called, outs are likely all Q and all A, and backdoor broadway cards; meaning if we turn a Q or A we can effectively extract 3 streets of value against some opponents.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If were raised when we c-b then why not just fold and move on?  Whats the plan if he bets the flop given our read that we are way ahead?  Are we going to check call 3 streets w high card?  Seems way too passive and cannot be profitable long run.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's like zero 2x in his range though... Maybe like A2s or 23s but that's it.  You probably will get called by better but if we check call 3 streets we are value owning ourselves imo </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seems super dry and we fold out a lot of whiffs.  I don't think people in 1/2 are floating this very much.  If we are confident our hand is the best why give a free one?  There's a lot of brick turns for us - do we check or lead?  If lead then what do we do on brick river? 

Seems like I'd rather just take a stab with like 20 on the flop, idk, personal preference.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I c-bet this flop with some regularity but whatever, check is fine.

Turn and river are fine.  I don't think he has many 2x in his range at all.  I expect to see AQ sometimes, JJ sometimes, and air sometimes really.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great post here.
I was going to comment something similar once OP posted desired speeds.  I can't imagine OP wants to spin his grinding wheel at 3600 RPM, that seems outrageously fast and dangerous for something of such mass.  So the question still remains, how fast do we want to spin?  We can also gear down an electric motor assuming it can produce enough torque, or, as I mentioned, go to a low speed high torque hydraulic motor...

Maybe I am biased as I used to be a hydraulic systems engineer :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How fast do you need to spin it? Your startup torque will be the initial hurdle, I would assume a hydraulic motor would be much better suited for your needs as the power density is much greater than that of an electric motor </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First post here... reg poster on 2+2, P5s etc but currently at work and unable to access, so now ill become a reddit reg :)

A friend of mine recently had this hand and was asking for advice/strat.  I have my own thoughts, was wondering what the community would offer.  Villain is a pretty solid reg but hero has little hand history with him. 

Hand in question is 2/5 NL.  Effective stacks are 650 and hero is in sb with [As](/As)[Ac](/Ac).  UTG open to 25 and folded to hero who 3b to 65.  UTG thinks and pops to 200.  
How do we continue the hand?  I think stack sizes make this a pretty interesting hand and not a unanimous correct answer.  
  
Option 1: flat and evaluate flop for c/r all in or lead/call
Option 2: shove pre
Option 3: 5b very small </TEXT>
