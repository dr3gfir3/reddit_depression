	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Years ago, I was quite involved in an active online community of analog audio hobbyists. People would occasionally put hardware and music up for sale on the message board we used. I'd been looking for a specific piece of hardware for several years to no avail. It was extremely rare and had never been sold in the US, so any examples would've been imported from Japan. One of these machines 'popped up' for sale from someone in the community and I jumped on it. 

The guy offering it wasn't new but wasn't terribly active. Somehow he'd obtained pics that weren't on the 'net and/or not easily searchable and ginned up a fake Japanese bill of sale. In hindsight, he may have seen one for sale and stolen the images from that. Regardless, it all seemed legitimate enough to induce me to go through with the transaction. So, PayPal sent and he says it'll ship in about a week. Then, the excuses begin. From he's been busy to out of town to his 'assistant' shipped it but didn't send the tracking number to providing a fake tracking number. Then, he just quit responding to calls or emails. Turns out the number he'd given me was a forwarding service that he subsequently disconnected. He also disappeared from the forum. He had, however, used his real name and a real PayPal account. I filed a PayPal claim, and of course they denied the claim on some technicality. I'm sure he was counting on this occurring. 

This is where the revenge begins with an unintended bonus. All I wanted was to make sure the guy knew I'd find him and get to him. I'd called the police and reported matters but they couldn't have given less of a damn.  I decided to find him myself, and found an old wedding announcement that'd been posted on the 'net. I searched his wife's name and found mention of her being out on leave to give birth to their first child on her work website. BINGO! I had a small gift sent to her workplace with my name on it, and called her work to say that I'm an old friend and don't have their contact info but wanted to wish them congratulations on the new child, and that I'd come see 'em soon. I had visions of his wife saying how nice it is that someone sent a gift to her work, etc and asking who I was. 

This apparently spooked him, because a cashier's check showed up for the full amount. Now, what he hadn't counted on, and I didn't tell him, was that I'd filed a charge-back with American Express after PayPal denied the claim. My conundrum was this; The AmEx investigation was ongoing, and I had no idea if they'd overturn the chargeback or not. I also had no idea if the cashier's check was legit; I've heard of counterfeit checks being returned up to 45 days later. So I truly didn't intend to profit off this. But I did.  The AmEx chargeback was resolved in my favor, which PayPal clawed back from his account, shortly after the check was proven good.

The kicker is; the guy had the gall to Email and threaten to try to have me charged with fraud for the chargeback when he'd already sent the check! I simply responded and said "HEY! Great to finally hear from you! Glad you're doing well, how's the baby? Listen, I'm sure there's just been a mix-up and I'll be happy to pay everything just as soon I get the machine. I'm sure you understand why I want to receive it before I pay at this point. Of course, if you do want to call the police, you're welcome to explain to them how you attempted to defraud me by selling something you never possessed in the first place. Your call." 

Never heard another word. I just hope his kid didn't have to go without diapers. 

TL;DR: Scammer temporarily got one over on me. I got that one back and ended up with a bonus. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> The time I made a rep cry... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-06 16:44:14 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **DISCLAIMER:** While I worked for a wireless carrier and frequently worked with reps and supervisors, I was not a rep myself.


**A bit of background:** years and years ago, no such thing as a nationwide wireless/cellular network existed. On a trip from, say, New Orleans to Houston, you'd go through five or six different coverage areas. Some were owned by major corporations, others were regional or even locally owned. Many smaller operators ran their own customer service locally.

One Friday after work I got a wild hair and decided to head to Lake Charles to see a buddy that'd moved there a few months ago, never mind the five hour drive. Met up with him and we went for the casino boat. At the time, call delivery systems were in their infancy. You had to dial a * code to tell the system you were there and to send calls to you. Except this wasn't working for me, as I found out when I stepped outside after losing a particularly large blackjack hand. Checked voicemail and had a stack of messages, but the phone hadn't rung. So I 611.

CSR: "Thank you for calling Cellular One of Lake Charles, my name is Janet, how can I help you?" (Not a real name)

We go through diagnosing the problem (I used to work for a carrier) and determine the home system is having an issue. Nothing can be done on this end. She's being professional about everything but something just seems... off. Midway through this as we're waiting for I-can't-remember-what, I ask Janet how her evening is going. "Oh...*ragged intake of breath* fine." 

Once all is said and done she goes into the wrap-up script and I blurt out "You sure you're ok?" "Oh yes, I'm...", and then just loses it. In the space of about two minutes a volume tumbles out about divorce, custody battles, working nights, etc. Midway through a sentence she stops and, "I... I ... am so sorry, I didn't mean to blurt all that out, thank you for calling Cellu..." I interrupted again and told her not to think a thing of it, that sometimes we just need someone to listen. I then gently asked about call recording and metrics (as I mentioned earlier, I worked for a carrier back then). 

Turns out; small company, rudimentary metrics {that were ignored for the graveyard shift), and the recordings were only retrieved in case of subpoena, emergency, or a customer complained of egregious behavior on the part of a CSR. We compared notes for a few more minutes, then I bid her a good night and told her if she needed an ear she knew where to find me. Astonishingly enough, she did. We ended up becoming friends, although I lost track of her years ago. 

I miss those days. Everything is so centralized, sanitized and scrutinized now. I suppose it makes for more consistent standards, but there's a certain human factor that's been eradicated. If you've read this far, thanks for reading my random ramblings.

**TL;DR: Asked a rep how her day was going one too many times and caused an emotional dam failure.** </TEXT>

Not sure how I came across the Pyle but this doesn't look bad for the price. Tracking and anti-skate adjust and it takes standard headshells. Anyone ever use one? $67 bucks would be a hell of a great deal for a 'table that doesn't kill LPs.

	<TEXT> Obligatory "this wasn't today". Way back as a small child when we'd go to religious services the congregation had an older woman who took care of the building,etc. She was cantankerous as all hell. Us being elementary school age kids we tear-assed around constantly and she was always screaming at us to get back into the service. Our parents, OTOH, were only too happy to have a moment of peace.

Well, during services she'd be in the kitchen preparing whatever snack was to be served after services. The kitchen was off a large hall/auditorium that echoed in the most awesomely cavernous way. So we'd sneak in to the auditorium, wait until it was dead quiet, and abruptly scream our heads off. It sounded something like a bunch of very loud angry Pikachus in a cave, but it would shock the hell out of that poor woman and she'd come running after us. We'd sprint off laughing all the while. Until...

The last time we did this, everything began as it always had. Snnneaaakkk quietly in (the doors had very creaky hinges), creep up to the door of the kitchen, wait until a deadly quiet moment (the kitchen had a speaker so the service could be heard) and BBBBBBBBBLLLLLLLLAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGHHHH!!!

So our poor victim comes tearing ass out of the kitchen as ever yelling all the while, we tear outta there, and then we hear her voice falter and get quiet. All we heard was this gasping and heavy breathing. So one of the braver of our group (I was a pussy) went back and saw her sitting on the ground in a daze breathing heavily. The kid had the presence of mind to go up and ask if she was ok... and she said no. (I'll be damned if I can remember his name.) The fun stopped at that point.

We all went in and got our parents. One kid's father was a cardiologist. That probably saved her life. We were angrily shooed away, dragged back into the services by our mothers, and sat there utterly silent and still.

Now, I grew up back in an era of "spare the rod and spoil the child". We had none of this "time-out" stuff. It was a hand, a switch, or a belt and we all knew that tone of voice. That tone of voice was in constant use that afternoon. When we finally got home, my ass got tanned more thoroughly than a homeless guy in Phoenix in August.

**TL;DR: Little shits had a shout and caused a heart-out. But all's well, she didn't go to heaven or hell.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lots of new vinyl enthusiasts out there and LOTS of companies out there offering far more form than substance. Many of these look very nice but aren't built as well as you might think. Before you decide to 'upgrade' from a used 'table to something else, don't get caught by the marketing. Here's a look inside the Onkyo. For reference, this build quality is about equal to the mass produced tables made by a company called BSR back in the '70s and 80s which isn't very good. The difference, BSR wasn't sold as a premium product which (some of) these are.

Specifically note this [picture](http://www.vinylengine.com/turntable_forum/download/file.php?id=16034 mode=view), which depicts the tonearm and the wiring to the RCA jacks. Note the wiring, soldering, etc. I'd expect to see that on a $30 plastic job, not a $200+ turntable. 

The cheapest new 'table I know of that's good quality is the U-Turn Audio Orbit, at $179. Cheapest good preamp I know of is the ART DeeJayPre which can be had for ~$40-45 with good Google-fu. So for the price of an AT-120 you can have a truly decent turntable which has proper support and can be upgraded if you wish.

	<TITLE> TIFU by ignoring a speed-zone </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-09-22 04:59:29 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As common with TIFU, this was several years ago. The family biz for which I worked was in the dark ages and still added many things on paper before shipping their products. This despite having to add many thousands of numbers a day. Lots of overtime.

**TL;DR : No sleep in recent past, work called me in with bombast, went too fast, cops put a sling around my ass, but all worked out and I went home with a hall pass**

So, about Y2K they decide to enter the 1980s and fully adopt barcoding to do away with hand-writing. They used barcodes for some items but not others. Cue much work involving an entirely new product coding methodology, new hardware, software, the works. In short, CHANGE FUCKING EVERYTHING! 

So it's go-live day. I'd been at the office 16-20 hours a day the previous week doing shakedown testing, chasing down issues, you name it. Due to an unforeseen issue, the night before go-live I was at the office until 3 AM. I decide to go home and change. That was my first FU. I'd arranged to have coverage that morning as I knew I was going to be useless with no sleep. That was my second FU.

Now mind you; we'd done weeks of training. Everyone knew the new hardware, everything was in place, we were ready to go. It all worked. Even printed up laminated instruction sheets and posted them all over the place reminding everyone how the new barcode scanners worked. I'd arranged for backup to be there in the morning given my late departure. I was due to go in at 9. So I thought. Phone rings at 6:45AM... "DUDEWHERETHEFUCKAREYOUWECANTLOGINWEREDOWNGETHERENOWWWWWWW!"

Naturally I fly up, throw on clothing, run out to the car and begin my impression of a bootlegger running from Johnny Law. At the time I had a fairly decent car with a big-'ol V8 that put down lotsa HP. Power in this instance was not good. I go shooting down one of our main thoroughfares through a speed-zone that ostensibly protects a pedestrian area. There's (quite literally) a shitbox Dodge in front of me and the passenger is flashing a light at me. I'm too focused on other stuff to heed this warning. My 3rd FU. I whip around the guy and I go flying right by a building. And its parking lot. Which was full of police. And the shitbox Dodge was an unmarked car. Speed zone was 20MPH, I was accelerating through 88MPH. If only I'd been driving a De Lorean in a lightning storm.  No, I'd run right through a speed trap.

Five, count 'em, five police cars rushed up to flank me as I pulled over. I knew I was in deep deep DEEP trouble. I grabbed my insurance and drivers license, turned off the car, put the keys in my pocket and held the proof of insurance and DL out the driver's side window. 

Four police officers walked up; one guy starts laughing and says "Could you step out of the car please sir?" Sure, why the hell not, I'm going to jail anyway. The shitbox Dodge driver storms up, gets right in my face and goes off on a tirade about how I could've gotten someone killed, what the hell is my problem, etc. I said precisely zero as I had no defense. Sure 'nuff, "Put your hands behind your back please..." and to the back of a cruiser I go.

Now, TILO (today I lucked out) as my cousin happened to be driving by and was giving a friend of his a ride to work. He recognized my car and pulled over. After a short discussion with the officers, it was decided that rather than tow my car, he'd take it with him. Always preferable to a tow lot. Being polite to the Police can pay some dividends. 

For some reason, the jailers took mercy on me and didn't stick me in the holding cell, but stuck me in a holding cell of my own. May have something to do with them not wanting to see me get killed on their watch? 

Used my one phone-call to get 'hold of a friend who's also an attorney and I was bailed out. Went to court a few weeks later and explained it all to the judge; requested a deferred adjudication and explained the situation. Hizzoner reasoned that as I wasn't racing and may not have been in my right mind due to sleep deprivation that I should be given the benefit of the doubt and deferred was granted. Thus, my insurance company remained none the wiser. 

After all that? I got to work to find everything running perfectly smoothly. The bonehead that'd called me just forgot how to power up the scanners. My cousin wasn't the only one that saw me on the way to work so I ended up having to explain myself. After everyone finished laughing their ass off, the big boss mercifully sent me home to rest.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Years ago, again, I worked for a family business. I primarily was responsible for IT, but was the only one who had a passport and was willing to travel. When something came up that required overseas presence, I was tasked to head over. 

We had some preliminary sniffings-around in Brazil that required someone on-the-ground briefly for meetings and inspections. I'd best describe it as quasi-due diligence. Round trips in coach were un-cheap at almost $4k per trip given the need for flexibility and refundability. ($Boss learned to permit flexible tickets after a $400 ticket to Arizona for training turned into $2500. Fare differences and change fees FTL.) 

Sneaky bastard that I am, I figured out that I could fly down to Brazil on a one time one-way ticket, do what was necessary, take a day flight back to Miami, connect to a flight to London, spend Saturday day and night in London, and fly home Sunday, with the return to Brazil set for months in advance and able to be changed at will. In Business/First. For less than the coach fare. The trick was buying the ticket originating in Brazil.

So I do this go-round  4 times. I'm having a blast; go down, visit, inspect, get taken to dinner, fly out the next morning, hang out at the Miami airport for 3-4 hours watching some of the most amazingly beautiful women in the world, do London, and home. All goes off without a hitch.... until the last trip I'd take. 

Turns out despite initial appearances all was not as represented and I reported back the bad news. I was told to continue on with the trip but that we were done with that. Here comes the FU. For reference, these trips occurred over the course of about 6 months at one every 6-8 weeks approximately. This was the fourth trip.

I land at Heathrow, suffer through immigration while dragging my carry-ons (checking luggage is a mortal sin for any trip under 5 days in my book) and am walking down the hallway to customs where I'm addressed by two gents waiting in the hallway, shown credentials, and asked into a side room off the hallway. 

Now, I've walked down this particular hallway many times. I never wondered at it's purpose before. It's a fairly wide nondescript hallway with walls on either side that do not quite reach the ceiling and opaque glass panels. At this point I discovered that the panels slide aside to reveal... interrogation rooms! One gentleman requested permission to search my luggage which I permitted and the other sat down and gestured towards a seat across the table for me. Luggage guy slid the wall panel back into place and it was as though I'd disappeared. 

Interrogations guy introduces himself as being from MI5 or MI6, I can't recall, it's the agency responsible for UK security. He proceeds to pull out my passport and start flipping through pages:

*Him: Travel a lot, do ya? (Imagine a mild Yorkshire accent)  
Me: More than I have in the past, certainly.  
Him: This all for work?  
Me: No there's quite a bit of personal travel in there too.  
Him: And all the travel from Brazil to here? It's very peculiar you know; you always go from there to here, you always stop off in Miami for a fairish long connection, and you always fly from here back to the States. Tha's not a normal travel pattern, now is it? I canna make any sense of it at all.   
Me:Blame $Airline. It's cheaper for me to do it this way than to fly back and forth to Brazil from the 'states and I get a side trip to London out of it and it's not in coach.   
Him:Have you ever been arrested or convicted of any drug-related offenses in the US?   
Me:Nope  
Him:Please wait here, I need to verify a few things.*

He and luggage-boy left for about 30. I did feel for the poor bastard that had to go through my dirties considering clothes get REALLY funky after you've worn 'em through a long-haul flight. At any rate, they both came back and the Yorkshireman says: 

*Him: Ok, your story checks out, you're free to go, enjoy London.  
Me: Should I expect the same hospitality every time I visit?  
Him:Especially if I'm on duty, I'm afraid. Although next time we may pull out the rubber gloves.*

I laughed at that, he didn't even crack a grin. I was disinclined to stick around. With that, I turned wordlessly to the table, grabbed my baggage, and walked out the wall which he'd graciously slid aside. People walking through were rather shocked to see that rooms were there much less someone coming out of them.  

Epilogue: Went back to London about 6 months after that trip to meet up with friends. Nobody even blinked an eye. Haven't had an issue since. So, for now, I've been spared the rubber glove.  

**TL;DR: Flew hither, thither and yon; Brits thought I was a fel-on; stopped me to see, found naught but clothes made dirty.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Years ago, I worked IT in a family business. We did business with Dell and others but tried to keep costs down so would occasionally buy parts from reliable secondary sources. One day a local IT/consultant type calls and says he got a deal on some new in box Dell drives (18GB SCSI hot pluggable 15k RPM in the proper drive trays if memory serves) for half what Dell charged, did I want any? Uh, HELL YEAH! We needed more drive space anyway. 

I go throw the drives in a spare server to test them before migrating everything over and one won't spin. Call the guy up and ask if they're under warranty. "Oh sure, just call Dell, they'll exchange 'em." 

Here's where the FU begins. I called Dell and they say no problem we'll send out a call tag etc etc.  The next day, instead of the call tag showing up,  I get a call from our receptionist that two FBI agents have arrived and would like to see me! I headed up front wondering what the flying f*ck this was all about. 

As I later found out, a FedEx (or UPS, I can't recall) truck full of Dell parts and computers got hijacked and this drive was part of the shipment. All the FBI would say was that the drives were stolen property and they were investigating the matter. We had to turn over all the drives and when asked where I'd bought them I pointed 'em straight to the guy where I got 'em. I do not mess with the FBI. 

Bro calls in a panic the next day profusely apologizing and begging me not to sue (which I'd never thought of doing anyway, I didn't think HE had stolen them). He even drove out and refunded the money we'd paid in cash after I told him not to worry about it. He said he wanted nothing to do with that. Never did find out if he'd gotten what he paid back from whomever he'd gotten the drives from. 

**TL;DR: Bought some cheap drive; the FBI did a drive by, the hot drives they did fly.** </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First it was CD [longboxes](http://longbox.org/), then the longboxes went away as LP shelving was reconfigured for CDs and the use of paper was rightly seen as wasteful (at the same time, LPs had largely gone away). Art got ever smaller. Cassettes never had much space for art. Flipping through a CD booklet was never gonna be as cool as checking out the gatefold.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Several years ago, I travelled a lot for business. I was heading from Santiago, Chile to Madrid and using a cheapo Round The World ticket (6 continents, unlimited mileage, $3800 in First thanks to a major currency crash at the time). First was overbooked and they offered me the difference in cash between First and Biz to downgrade. I thought they meant the difference in the Round The World ticket, which was about $400. I declined. Only after they found a volunteer did I learn that it was the difference between full fare tickets and I would've gotten back ~$3,500. Kicked myself right in the ass for that one. </TEXT>
