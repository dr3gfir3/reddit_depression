	<TEXT> it has nothing to do with the grade they are getting. It has to do with the fact that she thinks her class is more important for some reason </TEXT>

	<TEXT> yeah, the college portion was a little silly to me too. If you dont go to class you dont go to class, yes you may fail it that way, but that's their decision vs right now its the teacher making these decisions.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They totally can!! I have them make up the missed work on their own, but I can't morally give them a zero for another teacher keeping them. Its a very disrespectful teacher (from what i've heard, this is my first ever encounter with her all year), who has gotten fired for her... misconduct with students.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same teacher! It is very frustrating. I dont think it should be taking other class time at all, because that would mean that she thinks her class is more important than mine. I think that's super rude :( </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I am a math teacher and I teach seniors. As most of you know  during senior year students work on a big final research paper for their English course (regardless of level). It is the end of the year   there have been several occasions recently where a student comes in half way through or at the very end of my class period with a pass from a particular english teacher. The student always tells me that they stayed to speak about/work on the english paper. 

This makes me feel very strange. My class is just as important to be in and pass as hers is. I have not confronted her, but I dont see or speak to her much. I've seen her in the halls and didn't smile at her (Im a nice person, so this is almost equivalent to the evil eye for me lol). This teacher has been fired for next school year, so should I even bother doing anything about it?

Thanks!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> By censor I do mean swearing, and also I try to remain neutral on certain topics because I want my students to form their own options about life   such. I like to share my experiences with my students too, it defiantly encourages them to share back. I also know teachers who dont go as far as I do, but that has allowed me to discuss things with students that they wouldn't even talk to their parents about. 
I'm a bit careful about what I share about my personal life. I definitely wont tell them about the crazy nights out I have, or the nitty gritty details of my relationship, but all else generally goes :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man, well.... as you know, the age of the students you teach influences the interactions. I teach high school students at the moment, and it helps that I am close to them in age (I believe this makes them feel that they feel as though I can relate to them better, which is true). In order to create the relationships I have with my students I make sure on the very first day that they understand that I will be treating them with respect, fairness and also strictness. Once they feel and understand that, they begin to trust me. I am open with them and straight forward, just like I am with anyone else in my life (of course I censor myself with my students).  I believe these things, along with my personality help mold the mentor student-teacher relationship that I have with my kids. 

I'm not sure if that made sense, but the relationship is organic and it is hard to describe how it manifests itself. I put in effort for my students to see me in the way that they do, but I'm not equipped with the lexicon to describe it as accurately as I'd like! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> USA here:) We are taught that teacher student relationships are keys to educational success. As you know, teachers don't just teach- we mentor too! That is who I strive to be with my students: a mentor- an adult they trust   look up to.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm right there with you! Teaching math to all seniors   Ever since spring break they've slowly stopped trying! I try doing engaging activities but they could care less.
 What has seemed to work for me is reminding them how many days they have left   that those days can hurt or fix their grades. This best works on three seniors in danger of failing   the perfectionists. I have trouble with the middle group.  Let me know what works for you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You misunderstood my reply. I said "I definitely do" which was my reply to putting myself first. Luckily I am a rational adult   I know how to prioritize. I said that I am trying figure out how to both put myself first and be my best for my students and I am... but it is something I think about,  not practice.
Thanks anyways for that long response!  I appreciate it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is my first full year teaching (not counting long term subbing). I've been able to cut my non depressed days to about 10hours, yay!  You're right in the interpretation, the happy full of life person in front of my students *is* me. Teaching is the best distractor for me, it puts my depression on pause. 

I too have some students that I've been notified have depression, however I chose to confide in them instead. I told them something along the lines of "look at how well i'm doing now, you can get to this point too". 

I hope that like you, the more I teach the easier it will get   the more it will help me learn to love life. I just feel so alone in my struggle, professionally, because I do not know any other teachers going through this. If I do, neither of us has told each other. 

Thank you for your reply!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> - Everyone interacts differently with children. If you have a want to become an elementary school teacher you MUST love kids. you will learn how to be around them and deal with them through the classes you take, but mostly through experience. Maybe consider middle school?
-You will never know everything, but you will always know more than the kids you're teaching! I often "reteach" myself concepts, and thats ok. We're human after all. As long as you can act like you know everything and be real with your students when you dont ( like saying "oh man, i'm not sure, i'll look that up and let you know") you will be respected
- discipline is learned through experience. I still kinda suck at it. I teach high school and have the hardest time giving out detentions
-when i have a hard parent do deal with i always turn to my department chair or more experienced colleagues. Remember that you have 24 hours to respond to phone calls and emails, which is plenty of time to ask for help and gather your words. 

If you have a passion to teach, then become a teacher. If you question your passion, dont bother. This is a labor of love.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am a high school math teacher who happens to have depression. I have days where I go to bed crying and wake up crying. Teaching gives me life, and each day I can teach with a smile on my face and pep in my voice. However, I am so depressed that I have trouble concentrating during planning periods and after school, which makes me end up pulling 11 or 12 hour days. I feel like I make at least 1 mistake during my higher math lectures each day that I am depressed. Although I am able to brush it off, I feel that if I wasn't not depressed I would not be making mistakes as often. (when i make mistakes in a non depressed state I don't think about it twice! but you know how depression can be....)

Are there any other teachers that battle with depression outside the classroom? How do you separate your depression from your classroom? Is the only answer "do what makes you feel better"? Thank you.
