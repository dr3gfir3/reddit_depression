	<TEXT> So we will do a court wedding and have an Hindu and Christian ceremony on the same day. It's going to be on the beach, so the pandit and priest are cool with this.

	<TEXT> Absolutely, I completely agree. But we have had our clarity about this right from the beginning. Not saying we will not have issues later, but we are clear about the problems we will encounter. But we definitely want to do this. Coming to the ceremony: we are planning to do a bit of both, So we will do a court wedding and have an Hindu and Christian ceremony on the same day. It's going to be on the beach, so the pandit and priest are cool with this.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So our parents are not letting us get married. Sounds prehistoric, but true. We may need to do this on our own now, so all suggestions welcome! </TITLE>

	<TEXT> So, a little background here. 
I am India, so is my boyfriend. I'm Hindu and he is Christian. In India this is almost like being different species when it comes to marriage.
He is my cousin's best mate. (that's how we met) After two years of dating (which is again super frowned upon on India) we decided to get married. And where we come from, it's still the parents that give the final nod to your partner (Weird, I know).
So we tell both our folks. And initially they seemed to take it well and agreed to meet. After the meeting, his folks insisted that I convert, and my folks are insistent that I do not. (personally too I don't want to  convert and neither does he) Now it's come to the point where his people are saying things like 'she is getting older'(i'm 27) and stuff and the parents are refusing to talk to each other. This lack of communication has been going on for about 7 months now. We are quite done with it. We have decided to do this on our own. So we need to know what things we will need to think of besides the obvious stuff. Guests, Legal stuff, Food, Clothes, Alcohol etc are the stuff we have started looking into so far. 

Update: They have finally agreed!!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do want more close up shots. The kind that's on Pinch of Yum and stuff, my budgets around $200. Ideally I would like the 100mm but a bit strapped for that one. Maybe I should save up a little more? I just picked up the Ego 2 light set, so I'm good with the lighting equipment for the moment I feel. But any suggestions would be great. Thanks for this.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There are a few that fall under that category: 
A Few Good Men : About the subjectiveness of justice and obedience. Although Dawson and Downey are found not guilty, they are not blameless either. It was the first movie that made me think of the grey areas there.
Eternal Sunshine of The Spotless Mind: for what we can with our choices.
The Prestige: about the lengths one can go to. And the essential grey of life.
Incendies: Disturbing.

	<TEXT> I am a super amateur photographer, been only 3 months since I owned a DSLR.I have a food blog, so it's mostly food photography. Currently I shoot with a Canon 650D and use the 50mm f1.8. I was thinking of maybe investing in another lens. Which do you think I should be looking at next? People are suggesting the 40mm macro f2.8. Any advice is welcome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One big advantage with Wordress is that it is more customisable. Not just with themes, but also the plugins and widgets and so on. Adsense is fairly easily integrated on Wordpress, easier still in my experience if you have a custom domain. But it totally depends on what you want to do with the blog. If it's a design heavy blog, I would suggest go with WP. Blogger has it's own advantages, it's fairly simple to use and easy to understand </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is definitely alot of money in blogging. Check this out to get some idea: 
http://pinchofyum.com/june-traffic-income-report

And as to resources, yes there are plenty of those.
The kissmetrics website has a lot of insights, Neil patels blog is another good source. 
But it is not easy. It's hard work and the competition is super high. And it would also depend on what kind of blogging you are doing. Now banner ads are bringing in very little money, so you have to depend more on sponsored posts, affiliate marketing etc. So definitely hard to make a living, but not impossible.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's got a lot to do with the marketing. Not a lot of anime movies are marketed the same way across the world. That said, I think the fact that it is a mix of all the right emotions would be a huge plus. And it looks so beautiful! But that said, in my opinion it doesn't come close to Princess Mononoke.
