The trade in money is applied at POS (currently since there are no bill credit promos), and can be used as a down payment, to cover taxes or accessories, or it will cover your taxes and the rest goes to the bill. The gift card comes in 6-12 weeks and is visa cash you can use it on anything.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Had a problem today getting someone to have simultaneous voice and data on the Samsung 930u (and his wife has the 935u). S7/edge unlocked models.

Is it a whitelist problem or are the phones not capable of voice and data on verizon because of CDMA? Any ideas appreciated. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-12-19 06:53:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've been looking for a large home for myself and 8 guests. I found a great spot with a decent enough price and requested to book. 

The host didn't respond within 24 hours. Does this mean I can't rent the home? Do I try to request again to either get accepted or get a formal denial? 


It charged my card when I requested, then said it refunded. I requested again since I don't really know the protocol and get charged again (which is fine), I assume that's normal too? 


Is there anything I can do as a brand new guest to airbnb to get a host to accept my reservation? 



Any help on the above questions and general tips greatly appreciated, thanks!

	<TEXT> Anyone else experience this? I had an old s5 and decided to order the pixel to have as a backup phone instead. When I put the trade in it gave me $43 normal value and $87 promotional value. Can't find anything to corroborate that or why it gave extra value. 


Anyone else have the same "problem"? Trying to figure out if my friend should pay off the $165 he owes on his s6 instead of edging up.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> First Dbrand skin - Moto Z Force </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Randomly saw the marble skins go on sale via an add and decided to pull the trigger. Application was super easy to do, just following the steps of the video. 


It's got a precision cut and fit, and I can confirm all 4 mods work as I have all of them. It also fits fine with the bumper case. The skin looks great with the black phone and is a really authentic looking marble. Super pleased and will be a repeat customer for sure!

	<TITLE> [Help] is there a way to turn off the "night mode" in the Z force camera? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-03 23:08:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Title says it all. The camera has this default night mode where a moon icon comes onto the camera display. It makes there be like a 3 second delay to capture a photo, despite there being enough light for shot. 

Is there a way to disable this? It's really hard when I'm in my living room with dim lighting to take a picture of the cat or food because the camera wants to pause to allow more light in I'd guess. 

I can't find a way to disable it outside of going to the pro mode which takes away the moon but still has a slow shutter.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Samsung tab s2 (SM-T817V) controller help </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-30 06:25:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So as I'm sure the people in this sub are aware, Google doesn't seem to have an answer for using controllers on a non-rooted TB s2. I'm running marshmallow 6.0.1, and using the Mupen64 FZ app. 


First I tried a wired Xbox controller with otg and could get nothing, though it worked flawlessly on my Moto z force. So now I am trying a nyko core wired ps3 controller as I read that should be plug and play. 

With that, I can map the buttons, and if I do the controller diagnostic everything registers fine. However, in game I can only use left Joystick. Nothing else registers. I've tried changing the emulation profile, input profiles, using custom input profiles, etc... Nothing works. 


Al I missing something here? I'd much rather use my tablet to game the my phone and the controller is a necessity. 

Thank you for any responses.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Discussion] Any Droid Z Force users? General thoughts? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-06 02:08:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello Motorola fans!

I am wondering if anyone has the Droid Z force (or Droid Z for that matter) and what their overall thoughts are on the device? I have a note7 now, but because of the recall I could switch to a different phone if desired. 

I am intrigued by the phone, and I like the idea of the mods - particularly the battery one. I just wish I could try the phone out. I mostly am just wondering what people's impressions are, and also if apps can actually be put on the SD card or not (and actually run properly). 




The main thing that scares me is well, I was burned really badly by Motorola customer service with my custom turbo 2. Making matters worse is that I am a Verizon wireless employee and they still treated me like nothing - and I'm supposed to sell their phone! 

The short version was that my custom turbo 2 randomly had half the screen turn like inverted colors in January. I paid $25 for a warranty claim and was told it would be 4 days. Then a week. Then 7-10 business days. Then I was told it would ship within 10 days and I'd get it after that. 2 weeks in and no phone because it's out of stock. Which well, yeah makes sense it's a customized 64GB how many of those can there be that match mine? 

Anyway, eventually they agreed to give me a code for a new phone, I'd get an email in 48 hours. For weeks I'd call every 2 days and explain my situation, from scratch, and get nowhere and nothing but a runaround. 

Long story shorter, I ordered an s7 edge and it came before my moto came - the moto finally came through 3 months after the original order in late March.... And that was only after scouring the internet and coming across some random moto forum user named karimoto who helped me. 


So understandably I am scared to ever own another moto phone because of that. I also am now spoiled on the camera from the s7 edge and note7. I have read that the moto actually runs games smoother because it has better software, and with a battery mod I feel like it should have the best battery on a smartphone. 


Anyway, TL;DR what are your guys thoughts on the Droid Z force? 


Thanks in advance. I have no interest in an LG so it's either wait for a note7 or switch to the moto </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is there some easy way to access this app/feature? Currently I have to go to the file manager and get to the pdf file then "open with" 

I want to just be able to have the PDFs save in write on PDF but there is no app icon, and I can't search for it in settings. 

Feel like I'm probably an idiot and the answer will be obvious but I'd appreciate the tip. 




EDIT TO ADD: anyone with the same question try the "xodo PDF Reader and editor" app </TEXT>

	<TITLE> SD Card in New phone </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-21 15:36:54 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I recently switched from the s7 edge to the note7.  I had all my spotify music downloaded to the SD card on my s7 edge, however when I open spotify on my note7 (with my SD card inside) none of my songs show up as downloaded. 


However, my SD card is still the same amount full so the songs are there. I guess spotify can't recognize it? Further puzzling me was that when I went into the file manager to see if I had two spotify folders or something - which I do - neither one appears to have any content. 




Tl;dr

Anyone had success popping your SD card into a new phone and having your spotify music show up as downloaded?  </TEXT>
