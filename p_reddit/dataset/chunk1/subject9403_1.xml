I have the Big Box which includes several expansions, and I must say that after playing with many of them, vanilla Alhambra is almost dull by comparison. A couple of them are pretty gimimcky (expansion 5 is meh) but 2 and 3 are amazing. My favorite expansions are the sets that include: Diamonds, Camps, Change, Exchange Cards, and Treasure Chests. I don't ever play without these. </TEXT>
