	<TEXT> For the past few weeks I've been pranking my programming teacher by leaving the 10 hour version playing on a random locked pc everyday. She had no idea that i was the one leaving it playing and what computer I left it on. 

Just this week she found out that I was the troll that kept the amazing music playing the entire time. To honour my art of trolling, she got the entire class to play the 10 hour version simultaneously the whole period that day. After a countdown from 10, we had it all perfectly in sync the first try. 

RIP School internet.   </TEXT>

They see me walk in and they act fast. One runs to the urinals and one started washing his hands. I didn't think much of it so i just walked over to the urinals to do my thing. Then they start giggling out of nowhere and it went on too long for comfort. I walked over to wash my hands but they didn't move but continued to giggle. As a walked out still wondering what the fuck were they doing to this day. </TEXT>
