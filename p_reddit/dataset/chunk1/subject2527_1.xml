	<TEXT> Seriously, 70 hours in and I'm really having problems choosing a faction. I've done some quests for all, I'm at

Minutemans: Taking independence

Railroad: Boston After Dark/Underground Uncover

Institute: Battle of Bunker Hill

Brotherhood of Steel: Semper inficta/ Haylens and Rhys quests (just started this one)

So far I cant just decide which one I like the most. I like Railroads idea of saving the synths, but at the same time I dont like that they want to release the mad programmed-to-kill synths in the world also. Their cause seems alright but kinda over the top. Also I do not like any of the npc's at railroad

Brotherhood of Steel has so far the best npc's and pretty dope HQ. But they hate synths and ghouls which is kinda contradictory to the fact that I sometimes travel with Nick and Hancock. But they seem to be alright otherwise

Institute is no for me, there is no confusion. They are super shady and my character doesn't believe that Father is Shaun, he believes its just some Institute plot. 

Minutemen. They seem like a joke. I just can't take that faction seriously and I think I am going to be part of the minutemen even if I pick some of the 3 other factions? Correct if I'm wrong. 

What did you choose and why?  </TEXT>
