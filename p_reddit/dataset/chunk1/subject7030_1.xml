	<TEXT> A long time ago I used to game on terrible laptops. My frame rates were low, my temperatures high. Then a mod to Arma II came out called DAYZ. I watched in envy all the true ascended on YouTube playing this glorious game. I purchased Arma II on Steam, but my integrated graphics laptop could not handle the glory. I cried console peasant tears that night. The frame rates where too low, the temperature too high. So I waited until tax season rolled around and I got a meager tax return stipend. I purchased a refurbished PC from ebay for the parts (the entire ASUS PC was less than the cost of just the i7 K spec CPU in it, I could not refuse.) So I used the lowly pre-true-ascension rig and slowly built upon it over the next few months. Now I stand high atop the mountain shoulder to shoulder next to my PCMR Brothers in the shining glory of the light. My frames are high, my temperatures and low. All hail Gaben for I am ascended.  </TEXT>

It took me a while to figure out why (Comcast of course has No idea why...) Check you emails from when you first signed up I am guessing you had "Blast Plus" for 12months...Or like me had the service extended. They dropped the "Blast Plus" in March made it a separate service called "Blast" and are charging double for it...the Pig Fuckers of comcast of course did not tell anyone this.

	<TEXT> Zah slung his battle rifle up to to his shoulder and fired point blank at the marauding Krytolian towering over him. The massive hulk of the warrior slumped silently over the rubble. Zah cursed the invader. He wouldn't even give him the satisfaction of a scream of terror or pain. Zah snapped the magazine from his rifle and tapped it on the butt-stock. A hollow ring confirmed he was almost out. He would make these last rounds count. He slipped the magazine back into the battle rifle and heaved himself from his rubble cover. Krytolian warriors littered the battlefield their neon green blood illuminating the ground in an eerie phosphorescence. Zah staggered he tried to push the image of the many Zardonians soldiers he lost that day to the back of his mind. His friends, his command all dead. He had a job to do. Mega City four had already fallen earlier in the day. His last chance was to make it to what was left of city five's command center. He would have to cross 2600 feet of open enemy territory.

12 Hours Earlier. Planet Zardon Mega City 4 Command, 0800 hours.

Commander Zah stood behind eight inches of armored glass looking over the dimly lit landscape of his home world of Zardon. In the distance he could faintly see the warheads of the anti-ballistic missiles glowing red through the rolling morning fog. Today was the day. The defenses of planet Zardon would fall and the invasion of the Krytolians would begin. This was the last day Zah would stand in Missile Command. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For the image annotated "The Kaiser's heir, inspecting the troops." That is the father of Obergruppenfhrer Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. He was essentially third line of succession from Hitler (in a more ceremonial sense more than anything). The Obergruppenfhrer and Prince was held in the Flak-Kaserne Ludwigsburg across the street from my Grandmothers/Great-Grandmothers house by the Allies after the war awaiting Nuremberg trials. The US Military didn't feed the SS officers very well so my Grandmother used to throw apples over the fence. She never liked to see anyone go hungry prisoner or not. She also let the Prices' wife stand on the toilet in her bathroom and yell out of the window. The prisoners weren't allowed visitors but there wasn't much the US Army could do about wives yelling out of bathroom windows.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My great-grandfather's (conscribed Wehrmacht Heer soldiers) did not want to be involved in the war. They both had families that were depending on them and very young children. They were not S.S. and had no idea about the death camps. The death camps were a well kept secret. And if anyone reads anything about history and the Nuremberg trials will know that not even Hitler himself ever wrote a single order on paper regarding the camps. And when he did speak about them with those who knew it was always in euphemisms like "the final solution". They only ones who knew about the full picture knew from verbal orders or the ones actually perpetrating the crimes. 

A little background first. I am half German and half American. My mother's grandfathers both fought for the German military. Both were conscribed. My Great-grandfather Fischer died from Allied bombing of a German train station. He was a communications operator and had dropped his radio in the scramble out of the station. He went back for it when the bombs hit and was killed. My great-grandfather Beisswenger survived the war. He fought on the Russian front. He was shot and knocked unconscious (Russian side of a river I can't remember which one). When he woke he found that he was separated from his unit. He knew staying meant being killed so even though he couldn't swim decided to try to swim across. Needles to say he nearly drowned. A Russian soldier spotted him and took aim...the soldier took pity on my Great-grandfather. He lowered his rifle and instead threw him a tire. Considering how bloody and horrendous the Russian front was for this to happen was nothing short of a miracle. At the end of the war my great-grandfather Beisswenger had to walk from front home all the way to the outskirts of Ludwigsburg, Germany. He traveled with 2 fellow comrades sleeping hidden away during the day and traveling at night. They purposely avoided towns and cities due to rumors that the Russians were shooting unarmed German soldiers on the spot. Hunger eventually got to them and his two comrades decided to head into a town. He never heard from them again. He eventually made it home. His family did not know if he was alive or dead. My other Great-grandmother did not know the fate of my great-grandfather Fischer until the late 1960's when a comrade of his visited her and told her what happened. 

This is what the families knew. The area they lived in did not have a lot of Jewish people. A few Jewish neighbors did disappeared overnight. One was a doctor and everyone was quite upset about this since he was the only one in town. They were told they had moved away quite quickly due the animosity brewing towards Jews in other parts of Germany. They knew about the Ghettos being built, but all the propaganda they got basically said that these we just staging points to eventually move the Jews out of germany and into Poland and other places. They did not know about the death camps until American soldiers told them about them and eventually the Nuremberg trials. Across the street from my great-grandmother Fischers was a German military base that was conscribed by the US forces at the wars end. This base was converted into a German POW camp and eventually a prison for SS and the likes awaiting trial in Nuremberg. This included the S.S. Obergruppenfhrer Prince August Wilhelm of Prussia. They were pretty much starved by the US soldiers. My great-grandmother Fischer would throw the prisoners Apples over the fence. And would allow the prisoners wives to speak (more like yell) at their husbands from her bathroom window. 

My grandparents (who told me all of this) were both Hitler Youths at the start of the war. They were quite young during the war (16 at the end of the war). My grandmother still knew all the songs they taught her. They were both very Christian and never showed any hate towards anyone. A few years ago my grandfather for the first time went to a death camp. He went to Dachau with my step-father. My step-dad said my grandfather broke down in tears and could barely stand. My grandfather was overwhelmed by all the memories of what he had heard after the war and to see it in person just crushed him. He could not comprehend how his countrymen could do the things they did and call themselves humans.

	<TEXT> Douglas Adams stood in complete shock in front of a red sofa. The sofa, to even most learned observer, appeared quite ordinary. It's armrest slightly worn an faded and the cushions seemed to sink lower than one would expect. It was indeed not the sofa itself that left Douglas in a shock. It was the fact that a mere moments before the red sofa had been his Irish Setter. Douglas leaned closer and cautiously called the dogs name "Biscuit?" Somewhat to his relief the red sofa did not reply. A pair of  pensioners strolled by nodding at Douglas and carefully sidestepping the red couch in the middle of the walking path. They took a wide path around Douglas who was still holding the leash attached to the couch. They stopped to further examine the situation. The elderly man then asked "Taking the old davenport for a stroll eh?". "Not...um exactly?" replied Douglas. The old couple turned and mumbled something about all the crazies and continued on their way. What Douglas did not know is just a few minutes before the pensioners came across a man wearing nothing but a bathrobe and towel laying in the fetal position in the middle of the path eating a packet of crisps complaining about a sodium deficiency. That man was none other than Arthur Dent. Who was now fully recovered, from whatever ordeal left him with far less sodium that he would like. Douglas first meet Arthur when the two collided on that same path. Douglas was cursing at the red couch with his back turned whilst Arthur was busy cursing the sky for no known reason running full speed. Luckily for both the red couch with less than the desired amount but still ample cushioning broke both their falls.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Someone recommended a book or story to me (it may have been a film but I doubt it) about 15 years ago. I can't seem to be able to find it. Basic plot: Alternate History WWII Nazi's won the war. The story takes place 100-200 years in the future. Nazi's have conqured the entire world and killed all non-white races and erased all mention of them from history. No one in general public knows anything about the true past or anything other than the Nazi empire. The story is the point of view of a college student in Tokyo (I believe this is the city, it is an Asian large city for sure) when he hears rumors of a strange race of people that are hidden in the mountains. Turns out they are Asian Survivors. Anyone know what this story/book w/e it is was called? Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The old Sage sat in his rusted metal and ripped fabric strung together seat. His wrinkled right hand shifted like sand dunes, resting atop of what seemed like an even older cane. It looked to be forged from the roots of an ancient tree whose last leaves fell thousands of years ago. His patch work cloak seemed to cast his figure into the shadows. The lights from the torches set around him occasionally would dance bright enough to reveal his aged face from under the sunken hood. His eyes sparked like cold blue stars. The young children all jousted for front row seats on the ground. Their clothes all hand-me-downs repurposed from old rags sewn by mothers with more love than material. The children finally settled and waited eagerly for the Sage to speak. Long ago our ancestors crossed the Cold Black in their great sky ships. The Sage raised his root wood cane into the air and pointed toward the ceiling. They came as gods. Gods they did not remain for long. A great war tore them from the sky like falling stars. Stripped of their powers leaving them but stones to try and destroy each other. Our home is the bones of the old gods great sky ships. Like the ribs of the beast we slay, we live under the protection of the sky ships bones. The tools our ancestors once used to ascend to the power of gods now lay dormant in the sand. The sage outstretched his left hand like a bare tree branch quivering in an unperceivable breeze. Leaning on his cane he delicately snatched at a faint blue glowing pendant slung on one of the childrens necks. He cradled the pendant shaped like a tear in the palm of his open hand. The soft blue glow highlighting the deep wrinkles in his fingers. He then spoke looking away from pendant and into the distant dark. Like the necklaces all you children wear. The last remnant from the immortal ages of man. Its power fading like the suns at dusk. The sage pointed at a boy in the front row with his cane. That is why I am still around to see my great grandson of ten generations grow like a weed. Some of the children nearby playfully poked at the grandsons ribs tickling him. His relation to the great Sage was well known to them. And quite an honor for the young one. The little boy poked back at the others and as they all began to settle back down he asked his Grandfather How old are you exactly grandpa Sage? The sage dragged back his cane and drew his hand in thought to his white glowing beard. Well he paused. Using the time of the ancestors I will be 800 years old. The children all gasped. I am the last of the fallen stars. The power of the necklaces will not sustain me for much longer. The light glows dim, my life will near an end soon enough. The Sage could see this unrest the children. Fear not. I will live on in you. The lesson I have taught all these years. And even with only the faintest glow, the necklaces will keep you children safe. Now I must rest. The children looked forward to this nightly ritual of stories from the great past. The Sage would tell unbelievable stories of worlds with forests and water as far as the eye could see. Worlds free of the desert storms that sing in the night. The Sage, the last of the fallen stars, rested his eyes. Remembering the night so long ago when he was that young boy that fell into sand from the sky.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm from Maine just a town over from Bangor where Stephen King has his house. During summer vacation in high school a group of friends of mine and I decided to go to his house at 1am on a Saturday (in a semi stoned state) we had this great idea that if we went to his house that late and asked for a sandwich he would invite us in and make us one. Once we saw his wrought iron fence and gate (and to be honest quite ominous victorian style house) we got scared and resorted to one of my friend urinating in Stephen Kings driveway. Just a few months after school started the friend who urinated in his drive and I were heading to studyhall a bit early after lunch. As we cornered into the english wing there was Stephen King standing there with our English teacher (and the #2 most popular author from Maine) Mr. Sanford Phippen. My urinating friend turned to me and whispered "Oh God he's found us!".  </TEXT>
