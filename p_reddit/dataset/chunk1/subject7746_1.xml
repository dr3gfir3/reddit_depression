	<TEXT> App Name: WeCam

Developer Name: Acme Inc.

Launched: June 2016



**--- November 2nd, 2016 06:00 ---**

Press Release:

Due to user complaints and related incidents, we have decided to discontinue the app and have refunded users who bought after the promotional period, as incidents have continued to occur, even after removing the problematic filter; the correct number to dial in those instances is (202) 541-3000. Please do not dial customer service  we are still sorting some issues out.

We thank you for your patronage since our launch. We would also like to apologize for the undue emotional distress on our users from any of the tragic occurrences from the use of our app.



**--- November 1st, 2016 01:56 ---**

v1.4.3

Users noted that prolonged usage of the app caused intensity of occurrences and that connecting the app to social media caused the problem to disseminate through the users address book even to users without the app. We have removed the apps ability to connect to other apps, such as Photos and Email, and to PCs and other devices.

Any on-going issues should be reported to the following phone number: (202) 541-3000.



**---October 31st, 2016 22:54---**

v.1.4.2

\*Hotfix\*: We tried to tone down the problematic filter; however, it was not an optimal fix. Testing revealed that the filter still caused the same issue even if settings were dramatically lowered. So we have removed the problematic filter. Any users who cannot download the fix must disconnect their SIM cards as soon as possible.

Our direct line for customer service is (978) 555-0616. Our paranormal experts will help in any way possible.




**---October 31st, 2016 20:43 ---**

v1.4.1

We have received complaints about unusual activities when using our filter. While some were mild in nature, users who visited the sites of violent crimes would report entities being attracted to the device and cause injury and  in some cases - death. For users safety, we recommend that you do not visit these sites.

In addition, weve deployed automatic geotagging so that authorities can find you in case you are lost or something happens to you.



**---October 30th, 2016 18:00 ---**

v1.4.0

OooOooOOohhhh, ready for Halloween? Our latest update has a GhostCam filter. Our paranormal scientists here at Acme Inc. have created a filter using special settings on your cameras lens to find ghostly entities! You can take pictures of spooky and creepy apparitions with your friends while Trick-or-Treating, clubbing, or even watching movies at home! Upload them to Facebook, Instagram, or any other social media app and see how scared your friends and family are.


We have also included other bug fixes and improved the app stability for more smartphone models, so you and more of your friends can join in on the ghostly fun.

	<TITLE> [DBZ] which training method would have been effective from more time dilation: Gravity training (1000x and above) or Room of Spirit and Time/Hyperbolic Time Chamber? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-07 18:44:17 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> After the Frieza saga, the Vegeta uses a special gravity chamber that had the ability to go up to 1000x Earth's gravity. Just once though, and train for the Androids.

However, in subsequent trainings to fight Cell and Buu, they use the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in which 1 Earth day on the outside equals 1 Earth year on the inside.


Which method, given that the Saiyans were able to achieve SSJ 2 and above, and thus able to handle 1000x+ earth's gravity, would actually be more impactful at higher levels of gravity in the gravity chamber vs a time chamber?



EDIT: at what point would gravity cause a 365x time dilation?

Edit 2: conceptually this is the perfect /r/asksciencefiction question... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is there a way to keep records of friend messages? Or at least report the ones that are in question?

Hypothetically, someone adds me to call me things like "retarded". For no reason. I calmly defended my position but he resorts to name calling.

Can we implement a "Challenge" system like reporting for out of game messages? By challenge I mean like in NFL. We get 3 chances to challenge (per account). If the message is deemed harassment or name calling, we don't use up a chance. If it is, they get a karma penalty or queue penalty. You use up a challenge, when you report and waste the admin's time. </TEXT>

When I was a kid, my neighbor had a playground with swing set combo. One of the swings was a pogo stick like swing and it had a metal spring inside to help it bounce. I hated the sound... Then I realized I hated reverberation sounds like from plucking a rubber band.

Anyway, nice to know I'm not alone or that my condition isn't some form of psychosis. </TEXT>

A shout out to /u/obscure_renegade for the gold.


Anyway, ten years ago I fucked up.


Some background: my parents are from Taiwan, and they're proud Taiwanese. In the summer of my freshman year at college, I had the opportunity to attend a cultural study tour of the country. This also doubled as a hookup trip - sponsored by the Taiwanese government, no less - since it was all horny Taiwanese American college students. This gave it its nickname: "Love Boat". Now, I want to preface my fuck up by saying every time I go to Taiwan something bad happens. (One time I had an allergic reaction to mosquito bites. Another, I had food poisoning.) I was hoping this trip would not have similar issues.


This trip was 20 days in the capital Taipei and 10 days going around the island. It was a great trip overall. Except for one particular day.


The day in question was the first day outside of Taipei. Our first stop was an amusement park then called Small World Kingdom, now called Window on China in rural Taoyuan county. It's filled with miniature to-scale models of various global landmarks (Leaning Tower of Pisa, Kremlin, Mount Rushmore, etc.). It also has some rides, in the back of the park, accessible only by tram.


And it so happens that I ate something that disagreed with me prior to this park visit. It hit like a world ending asteroid when I was on the tram.


As soon as the tram stopped, a poop dam burst. The levees couldn't hold it back anymore. So, when everyone was headed excitedly to the rides, I ran into the wooded area right next to tram. I hoped I was out of sight as I unloaded on some tropical bush. It took what seemed like an eternity... and I didn't want to take too long as another tram would be coming soon. I grabbed a leaf and wiped.


Of course, it doesn't end there, because shitty water kept trying to come out. So I had to run whilst pulling up my pants to create a vacuum of sorts, as shitty water sprayed out. I made it to an actual restroom where I unloaded even more.


By this time, I was so dehydrated I was woozy. Nevertheless, I had the presence of mind to wash my undies in the bowl after I was done. But to prevent seepage of sorts, I resorted to using toilet paper to create my own makeshift diaper.


It had taken me long enough to evacuate everything that the chaperones of this trip decided that it was time to pack up and head to the next town. Cue my penguin walk of shame to the exit - I hope no one noticed any smell. At the exit, I felt something fall out of my shorts.


I surreptitiously turned back to see a brown, watery toilet paper chunk on the ground being stepped on by dozens of my peers.


tl;dr - I fertilized Taoyuan Valley in Taiwan. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are in the process of certifying a finished basement, and we had an electrical inspector come and take a look.


He gave us a list of repairs to be made including 2 outlets above baseboard heaters. Unfortunately, he didn't specify which receptacles to repair. An electrician came to do the repairs, to whom we gave the inspector's findings. 2 receptacles were removed and replaced with blanks.


We found a receptacle that seems suspiciously like it wouldn't be allowed, but we aren't sure. And since the inspector didn't actually specify the offending receptacles, we are worried that he's going to tell us to repair after he inspects again.


I've included 2 images: [one of a relatively safe receptacle](http://imgur.com/TKik38h) near the heater, and [one of the questionable receptacle](http://imgur.com/VqpqOgD). </TEXT>

My mom ordered some sneakers from Nike.com on December 29th and Nike sent us an email confirming shipment on January 7th.


My mom did online chat with Nike when the shoes didn't arrive by January 17th. The customer service rep told her that he'd look into it and get back within 3 business days.


The next day my mom received an email saying we had called on January 12th saying that the shoes were wrong size and that we were returning them. WTF? We never got the shoes in the first place. And conveniently, no records exist of the original shipment because the tracking number is invalid.


I've included screenshots of this embarrassment.

	<TEXT> Slowly but surely, we are seeing a long game between the two. Sure in this one game there was an outcome...

I pose a thought:
Samaritan is interested in acquiring people, and so is The Machine. But the way the two are doing it is different. So far, we've seen Samaritan find people in a mechanical and calculating way looking for skills they already have.

Meanwhile, I feel the Machine has been a motherly figure nurturing and doing its best to keep everyone alive and grow them beyond their bounds. So I wonder if the Machine has been running simulations on everything beyond today. </TEXT>

Strategy/Playstyle:


Argellios is a melee warrior who thrives in hand to hand, 1 on 1 duels. He is a force to reckon with in the jungle. He provides little utility in ganking and roaming, however, as his main job is to be a nightmare for the enemy in his own jungle.


His passive Fear the Reaver allows him to shred his enemy's defenses so he and his team do more damage the longer he fights his current target.


His main spell Deathly Skewer is a targeted attack on his current target. The damage increases the weaker the target is. Argellios is therefore good at picking off people who have not returned to base after clearing their jungle or people who are fighting mines.


His second spell Merciless Combo provides filler damage in between basic attacks and Deathly Skewers. It's a small conal area in front of Argellios that hits just like Joule's Thunder Strike, except it provides a mini stun.


Thunderous Roar provides Argellios some utility and once he gets to level 6, avoid invading and/or face checking bushes. He can easily decimate one or two targets -especially if there is a teammate nearby.


Matchups:


Argellios is a particularly painful hero for assassin type champions to deal with. Their lack of durability means that Argellios can destroy them easily. Even other warrior types find him troublesome at first.


Argellios has a hump shaped power curve: he gains power as he levels his Deathly Skewer until 8. At that point he's at his strongest. But as the game progresses, his damage falls off since his damage doesn't scale well into late game. Should focus on building pure tank.


Tanks counter Argellios after they complete some armor and health items. Ranged carries beat him late game as well, due to kiting potential.

Comparable to Pantheon and Darius from LoL. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Krul- A high sustain, attack speed bruiser who can just build tank and be unkillable and do massive damage. Not to mention a strong initiate and catch potential. Only weakness is early game when damage and stacking is slower as well as no cc.

The. I thought basically all melee champions can build tank and still be useful. The meta is undeveloped, or rather underdeveloped, as there isn't much variety yet. No one does %health damage yet (aside from Saw) or have cc prevention or reduction.

Example 2: Glaive if built tank then provides initiation and catch with his Afterburn spell. His damage on his ultimate Bloodsong and Twisted Stroke provide a lot of free damage and sustain as long as he stays alive.


It makes more sense to build tank on Glaive, Krul, Joule, and Catherine at the moment since they have decent base damage and tons of utility in teamfights. </TEXT>

Anyone got tips to prevent this? I mean I play LoL and even then it's hard, and that's with a huge map with many camps. So you can farm somewhat safely away from winning lanes or jungler. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was looking into AAP - and its competitor ORLY - and I noticed a strange pattern in the earnings.


AAP has the reverse cyclicality of ORLY, even though they're in the same sector. AAP tends to have its peak earnings in Q1, which is followed by decreasing NI throughout the year (until the next Q1). Meanwhile, ORLY has steadily increasing NI from Q4 to a peak of NI in Q3 the following year. AZO is similar.


Can anyone explain to me why AAP is reverse to other auto parts suppliers? I thought in general auto parts sellers would follow together. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Home Theater set up suggestions </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-09-11 16:39:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, first time here.


Just a little background: 8 years ago, we had a builder renovate our basement; the plans included a home theater. The alcove is about 20' by 25' and is not entirely enclosed (hence alcove). We got a Bose HTIB installed (Lifestyle 28, series II - if anyone's curious). About 2 years ago, the home theater fell into disuse because of a lack of HD capability from the Bose system. We had been using a WD TV Live starting around the time the home theater started being less useful.


What we need: 


- we have a Sony projector (8 years old) with HDMI, component video, and VGA ports.


- we have a bar which has an old (~4 years old) LCD tv using a coaxial connection with the satellite box. The wire goes through the wall and was put there by the builder.


- we recently got a tv for a treadmill. We use a 35 feet HDMI cable to connect the satellite box directly to the tv.


Other considerations:


- the front left, right, and center cube speakers from the Bose system sit on a AV cabinet/stand about 2' high. meanwhile, the rear left and right cube speakers are mounted on a wall.


tl;dr: We want an AV receiver that can connect our satellite box, dvd player, Wii, and WD TV Live (as well as any other HDMI capable device) to our projector, treadmill tv, and bar tv. Also, we need to find a sound system that is versatile to fit an irregular-shaped room.


Any recommendations? </TEXT>

I think from our discussions she knows I am interested in her, yet I feel directly asking should come with a follow-up plan. I would like to broach the subject of a relationship (which is potentially LDR), but I am uncertain how to proceed. 


I have 2 main points I need help with:


1) Best way to gauge interest in LDR.


2) Best plan to maintain relationship.


Wild Card: I have several interviews for jobs in different areas of the country. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My main concern is that the iPhone is not used heavily, especially during my dad's work. He spends most of his time on a computer terminal on the job, only using the phone to read texts or email from family. Bluetooth was on regularly to connect to a fitbit until recently (when I appropriated fitbit for myself). The wifi is turned on, but not connected to any wifi except the one at home. None of these should explain the need to charge every several hours, at least to me.


Earlier this afternoon, we went to Apple store in response to a previous post about certain iPhones being at risk for premature battery failure. The iPhone in question falls under the serial number range stated by Apple.


While spending over half an hour attempting to communicate our desire to replace the battery, the genius said that the battery is within normal limits of use and drain. Meanwhile, since we had arrived at the Apple store, the battery drained from 100% to 88% right in front of the genius's eyes. The only thing the genius told us to do was to change the settings of autobrightness and wifi and Bluetooth.
