	<TEXT> "Alistar needs to get up close for the 1.5 second knockup and stun, which puts him at risk. Same with Leona"

You're aware that both those champs are meant to be played as tanks, right?  That's like saying sona's ult should be less than Leona's Q because Leona's Q is melee...

You're forgetting Nami has fairly low base health, and armor..  And IIRC, after the last change to Sona, Nami actually has the LOWEST starting health of all supports.

Not to mention the CD is a lot longer than both Alistar's and Leona's abilities, and the mana cost is 50% more.... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is too true, but always ignored.  Just ignore Garen in team fights.  If he spins, try to stun/snare him, and that's it.  Dont attack.

Garen's spin and auto attacks don't deal much damage at all.  His ulti is dangerous to low health people, which again, is why i think Kayle is my favorite counter to Garen.

Garen's Ulti:
------------
Cooldown: 160 / 120 / 80
Magic Damage: 175 / 350 / 525 (+ 29 / 33 / 40% of target's missing health) 

Kayle's Ulti:
------------
Cooldown: 90 / 75 / 60
Plus makes your target invulnerable for a short time, meaning garen wastes his ulti (kayle is also best counter vs Darius, IMO). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Kayle's a good one too, and one of my favorites. Save your Q for when he spins.  He starts spinning, you Q him (which is dmg+slow) and back up to tower.  If he gets crazy and flashes or ghosts, you can W/Divine Blessing yourself (heal+speed boost).

He'll naturally push the lane towards your tower, thus giving your mid and/or jungler (assuming your have one) a chance to gank him when he's over-extended.  Pretty soon he'll stop, or you'll all get fed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't even count the times people have bullied others into picking certain champs because "d00d, ryze counters fizz soooo hard.  easy win bro."  The problem is, the guy picking Ryze has never played him, has little to no idea the mechanics of ryze, or how to engage/disengage, CS, or poke properly.  Counter picking doesn't mean shit if you don't know the reason one champ is weak against another champ.

For example, Caitlyn counters Ez and Draven very well.  But that doesn't mean a certain win.  If you have no idea that for Cait to counter Ez it's about harass, rather than pure damage... and in order to do that you need to stand in minion waves so Ez's Q can't hit you, and his AA range is shorter than yours... Then it's pointless.  If you don't know that as Cait you're supposed to be dropping traps on Draven's spinning axe marked locations, then you're probably going to lose.

The same is true with supports.  I've beaten so many Jannas as Leona because people don't know how to anticipate my engages.  Or they don't ward properly... or they simply don't know how to use Janna's tornadoes properly.  Many lane match-ups aren't just an all in fest.  It's a waiting game to see who makes the first mistake... usually it's the person who gets bored and over eager first.  They waste their stun/initiate on my ADC, I go in and stun/engage on their ADC.  By the time their ADC is out of the CC combos, my ADC has already landed a few abilities or AAs and disengages.  The same is true for top/mid lane.   Anticipate when someones going to try to CS.  Poke them when they CS, and then back off.  They either return the trade with you, and miss the CS, or they take the CS and the damage you put out, but they cant return it.  Either way, youre giving yourself a tiny advantage.  Those advantages start adding up, but its slow.  However, they can be thrown away in an instant.

The best way to move up is to be patient.  Don't force fights that don't need to happen.  Think things through.  Why are you going for an engage/fight? Can you kill the other person?  If not, you shouldn't be fighting.  Poking/harassing is different.  If you can get a few small shots off on them, and then move away, you won the trade.  Win a few trades and they have to base.  

Even if you don't kill the opposing laner, you forced them out of the lane which means:
1) They lose CS (meaning money and exp) and you get ahead in both.  Making you stronger than them. 
2) you can force your minion wave to their tower, meaning they lose more money, and you can roam to help another lane and help your teammates.
3) You can take their tower.  This is an objective based game.  I'm sure we all have had games in which our team was "winning" in terms of kills, but we still lost.  We won all the team fights, but no one took towers or objectives after team fights.

Just be patient, think through your actions.  And  take responsibility for your mistakes.  Learn from them, and make sure they dont happen often, or at all.  Once you identify a leak in your game, you can fix it.  Pretty soon youll be movin on up.

	<TEXT> One of the things i've learned, and still have a hard time applying, is everyone (yes, even you), makes mistakes.  You might be be the BestMidLane/BestADCNA, but if you're 10/0/2, you don't need to get to 20 kills, or 15, to show how awesome you are.  The best thing to do is start letting your teammates get some kills.  Otherwise, you'll be the only person with gold and items, and you will most likely be nuked down instantly in team fights, leaving your already fallen behind team at a huge disadvantage.

TL;DR: Remember, this is a team game.  It is very difficult to win 1vs5.   If you're ahead, pull your team up with you, don't leave them in the dust showing how good you are. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Thresh FPS/Lag bug back? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-06-08 19:33:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Has anyone else had performance problems when playing against a thresh, or any other champ?  I just played 4 games in a row, two of which had a thresh in them on the enemy team.  In each of the thresh games, I had severe problems with what appeared to be lag.  

The weird thing was, I was listening to Pandora at the time, and not once did pandora lag.  Also, my latency in game never seemed to go above 35ms.  My FPS seemed to stay steady at 60.  However, my chat, ability and item use, and even movement was delayed and extremely sluggish whenever thresh was near, even near but in Fog of war.

Has anyone else noticed this? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to play Nami support in ranked matches almost exclusively, and at one point had over 60% win rate with her.  I'm not the best player, and I'm still learning, so I could very well be wrong on some of the things I say...

One thing I have learned about nami is she is very much a poke oriented champ, like Lulu.  Given the fact Nami's ranged, and her W will either damage two opponents, and heal once, or Damage once, heal twice, AND her Q does damage... you can see she's designed to be played aggressively.  But this means you need to be playing with an ADC who is also aggressive.

Her Q is hard to land when you first start playing her, and is easy to dodge by some champs (Ezreal, Graves, Vayne, etc)... thus making her more difficult to play than someone with a target-based stun (Taric, etc).  However, when you do land your Q, you deal some damage, and if you're good with quick autoattacks, you can deal just a bit more poke... 

The biggest problem I faced when playing support initially was CCing when the ADC was not able to follow up.  There were times I was mad the ADC was "useless," and only farmed, but I slowly realized at least part of the blame was mine.  If you're going to play support, you must learn not to CC or overextend when your ADC mate is not able to follow up.  Theoretically, the higher ELO/rank people get, the more they're paying attention and anticipate and will position themselves to follow up.

Also, keep in mind Nami's Ultimate is slow and easy to dodge if people are close to the edges already, or have flash/ghost up.  The best way to cast it, then, is from fog of war, bushes, or further back so people aren't looking directly at you.  One item I build on Nami frequently is Kage's pick into Twin Shadows.  Just use the twin shadows to slow, then Ulti (which also slows), and then Q on the mfor the hard CC.  But again, don't do it unless you have backup and people to followup.

As for playing other support champs, don't play the "popular" ones just because they're popular.  However, they are popular for a reason... You should learn why, for each champ, and practice.  Taric used to be a pick and win champ, but not so much any more since his passive changed.  Taric is still good, but if you play nami well, you'll soon realize Nami is a great counter to Taric, and in my opinion, a better pick than taric now.

So... why are all champions balanced across all three game types and maps?  Why not have some champs available on Twisted Treeline (3v3), or Crystal Scar (Dominion), or Summoner's Rift (5vs5)....

	<TITLE> MSVCP80.dll missing? WTF? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> After eagerly awaiting the NA servers to come online today, I finally managed to get in and play.... I played one ranked game, and lost.  The second ranked game I queued for I had three people claim top, and lock in TP/flash toplane champs (wukong, riven, and darius).... I dodged... And went to -3 LP.  After taking a break for a few hours, cooking dinner for my family, I came back to play... Downloaded another patch, and tried to queue for ranked...  Went through champ select no problem, and as soon as the match started, I got an error message saying I couldn't load the game.

Messages says "League of Legends.exe"  The program can't start because MSVCP80.dll is missing from your computer.  Try re-installing the program to fix this problem.

WTF. Running repair option from the login screen, but there's no way I will connect before the match is lost, or even started.  I can log in just fine... and when I do I get the window saying I left a game in progress, and have the "reconnect" button to click... which produces the same error message.

EDIT:  Fixed it.  Found an old thread on the LoL NA forums:  Basically

Go to C:\Riot Games\League of Legends\RADS\solutions\lol_game_client_sln\releases   (or wherever your install location is), and delete the folder 0.0.0.209 (or whatever the most recent one is).  Should be the file/folder with today's current date.  Playing (level 1 while everyone else is 10 or 11..  Best support NA time...

Dafuq?  Now I get to lose more league points, and fuck over my team. GG Riot. </TEXT>
