	<TEXT> I think the conversion rate is exactly the same, with less range makes it poorer than the Monks but with the capability of fleeing from the spot faster after conversion, gives them a slight adv over monks.

Still not good enough reason to make them over Monks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guys, is there a game where an expert player has used the Missionary? Is it of any good? What is the point of the unit?

1) Can't pick relics
2) Heals slower than monks. Heals 1.25 HP in 1 sec compared to the 2.5 HP by Monks
3) Has lesser range than Monks

Is it the worst Unique unit in the game? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> AoE 3 is more about exploring history, understanding those times and the entire feel of the game revolves around the time in which the civ actually existed.

AoE 2 is competition oriented, MP games make much more sense, it doesn't really give you a feel of history but every unique unit, every research has an amazing history behind it. Nothing is there just for the heck of it. 

Also, AoE2 has an amazing community! </TEXT>

Regarding aoc_warrior - He is BlackDeath/Cold/AoC_Warrior on Steam and BlackDeath on Voobly. He is a friend, have been playing with him from a long time. Since he is the best among our lot, I cast his games. Not sure why it makes people annoyed. But yes point taken, I will cast other games too..surely!

	<TITLE> Uno-Rage: Can you win a game with just one kind of Unit? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-09-25 07:37:21 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello People, hope you are doing good.

Have you guys played a game with a human opponent [Maybe you have done it with the hard/hardest AI] with just one kind of mobile unit? 

We are playing a few games with this style, it is actually fun. 

1) If you have made one Archer, you ll have to make only Archer/Crossbow/Arbalest...you cannot make Castle Archer units, you cannot make Skirms. No siege is allowed. You need to beat the opponent [make him resign] with just Archers. Mind you he can't really make Skirms, he can't possibly win with only Skirms. Chu-ko-nus is the best bet to win with Archers I guess. Heavy Cavalry Archers?

2) Cavalry line [Only with Scout/Light Cav/Hussar], or [Only with Knight/Hussar/Pala]. Pala is the best bet, can't really win with Camels! Imperial Camels?

3) Only with Mango/Onagers/Siege Ona or only Scorpions/Heavy Scorps [Daut game anybody?] or maybe even only Trebs (katapur] with Japanese [Fun?]

4) Only with Castle units, only with Petards? :-)

I have played a few games with hard AI, it's a bit easy, but this will be a very difficult thing against human opponents. 

Why don't you guys try? Which Unit will you choose?

Note: The first scout is obviously not counted in this. You can make towers too but that is not considered as a Mobile Unit.

	<TEXT> Hi Drachen...

Really appreciate your watching the video and doing your homework. I didn't check exact ratings, I trusted the word of my 'friend' when claiming ELOs. 

As for advertising here and production quality - Nobody starts off with incredible work. The first game that Viper or Tatoh played in thr lives was surely not of 2.3K quality, people improve with time.
I am going to take your comment in a positive vein however harsh it is, and will try my best to improve on every aspect of my commentary. Word.

	<TEXT> thanks for replying here too..(at Steam also)..

One way is to go fast Imp, but this is far more standard than Fast Imp. With this, its much easier to win a game as your opponent on the 20th min mark can't ever compete with you, with any civ! Unless Mirror.  </TEXT>
