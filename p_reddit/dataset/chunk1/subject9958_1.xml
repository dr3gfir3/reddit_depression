	<TEXT> Yep seriously didn't mean for this to go any further than what I stated lol just wanted to say it's probably a lot closer to 33% than 5% since you said 5% would be the likely maximum.

Not that it matters in the slightest.

	<TEXT> Rep 3 conqueror with GS of 108 and I will say gear DOES matter in 4v4. Obviously it is dependent on player skill because I have beaten people with 40+ GS in a 1v1 with gear stats enabled and my character having a GS of 0, but getting to the higher GS is a whole other ball game. In a 4v4, if you or two, or three even of your teammates surround my conq I can easily handle and kill all of you because of how quickly I gain revenge, how hard it is to kill me, and how much damage I do. Even if you find me alone and we 1v1 I can still get revenge if I block a couple of your hits. 

But don't let this turn you off to the game. Not many people you run into are at a 108 GS and therefore not everyone exploits revenge builds so you will be fine 95% of the time in 4v4. Duels, for example, do not use gear stats and unless you have best of the best gear they will not affect the outcome aslong as you are a more skilled player. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Or you can feint an attack so that he lets go of charged heavy and then you punish? A conqueror that just charges his heavy isn't playing optimally, and if you're losing to that than the problem is you and not conqueror. I'm a pretty high level conqueror and only time I charge my heavy is for safe parry. Never to just charge it and lose stamina for no reason, makes it pointless since any good player will not approach you if you're just charging it and a better player will feint you. Once your expecting a feint if they GB you instead you can't tech. Basically, never just charge your heavy for no reason. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just be defensive and reactive. His shield bash heavy combo is nice for 50/50 since you can follow the initial heavy with a shield bash or another heavy, if they dodge expecting the bash you get a hit in, if they expect a hit and block and it's another bash, by that point they're stamina drained. Especially if you GB off a parry into a shield bash you can quickly exhaust opponents. I like to attack their stamina rather than their health at first and I really open up on them once they're exhausted. Works for me maybe not for everyone? And also something to use sparingly is using full block as a feint since you can't feint. Wastes a ton of stamina though so be careful. 

He has very safe parry as well. Just hold your heavy on parry. If they feinted all you did was charge a heavy. If they go for an attack at that point and you release the charged heavy with parry timing your superior block will still block the attack and you'll get in a guaranteed charged heavy. If they didn't feint initially then you parry them and go back to the original strategy.

Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basically when they go for a heavy and you parry it that automatically drains some of their stamina, if you follow it up with the guaranteed GB and then do a shield bash rather than a light or heavy, watch how much stamina you drain off of them. It highly limits their offense. I follow it up with the side heavy and try to go for another shield bash and start that shield bash 50/50 game to get them in exhaust range. If they dodge you still put them on the defensive at that point and you should be able to react accordingly depending on your opponent.

Edit: by shield bash I mean forward dash into shield bash immediately after a GB. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wanted to see what I'm not seeing here. I'm a rep 3 conqueror and have been reading through what people think of all the classes and I always see conqueror a lot lower on most people's lists than I would expect. What am I not seeing here?

In my opinion conqueror is an extremely strong class even in duels. The fact your blocks stop chains and, on parry, if you follow up with a shield bash after a GB, you essentially drain all of your opponents stamina. By applying even light pressure at that point you can pretty consistently exhaust them and drop them to the ground to open up for big damage.

Now of course you need to take a defensive style to achieve this, but I mean you're a guy with a shield, defense is implied. Some people may choose to force you to make the first move and avoid your defense all together until you give them an opening, which is fine by me and preferred honestly.  If you use your infinites to get in close, safely, and use full guard to occasionally "feint" and mix in dashes into shield bashes you can pretty much force your opponent to retaliate with offense or get bullied around. Once that happens well, I just said it above.

So of course I lose. I don't always win. But I win enough against all classes that I don't believe a conqueror to be a poor man's warlord, but rather a top tier class.

What do you guys think? Agree? Disagree?

	<TEXT> Well, that's kinda how they played before so nothing's changed. A good kensei will circle you with pokes and parry into GB to start their combo anyways as far as I'm aware. And CGB hasn't been changed to the point that any one can mindlessly CGB. If you're feinting and poking and throwing out the unexpected GB you will still land on less experienced players. Against more experienced players they would've CGB anyways, I see this only affecting GB spammers who  only relied on GB for their damage. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just wanted to say you need to be realistic. You think just because guard breaks work a certain way in competitive play that it shouldn't be changed to accommodate players at lower tiers, which is 90% or more of the total player base?

Unless you want the game's community to die and development to cease completely because of the lack of profit then you should make the game as suitable to new and casual players as possible without completely destroying the depth of the system for the higher level players, which is what I think is happening here with the guard break changes.

A higher level player will still destroy a new player, but atleast the new player won't get GB to death and have a frustrating experience like has been the case with that whole system.

I personally do not mind if a casual player can CGB me, either way I GB when I get a free one and I'm still going to out play then and win regardless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is something I've noticed as well. If you can CGB an orochi it's pretty much over. Storm rush is easily blocked. If they go for their side dash attacks you know exactly where to block. If they get in close just camp high guard since they're only quick move is that double over head. Everything else can be reacted to other than that so just block how, CGB, and you won right then and there. Once I mastered the timing on CGB against orochi they have never ever beaten me again in a duel since other than a GB into a heavy for big damage they don't really have any other mix ups. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This doesn't make sense. Because as a conqueror I am nothing without a solid defense since all of my attacks are extremely slow and weak. If they nerfed my block they'd have to seriously buff my offense. But then why bother playing a shield class if I'm going to act as any other sword wielding DPS class? I pick the conqueror to play exactly that way, turtle behind a shield and methodically break down an offensive character with my shield and batter them with my slow flail. 

Punishing blocking severely punishes us shielders. Unless these changes only affected blocking with a sword I feel it would render the risk reward of a conqueror, for example, not worth it therefore making him kind of unplayable. It's hard enough as it is reading feints and CGB until I find an opening with a conqueror as is without taking big damage on successful blocks. If 70, 50, or even 40% of damage went through it'll completely break the game once you start getting spammed into oblivion by assasins. </TEXT>

Repeating that pressure I either make them run or drain them of stamina and start doing hard damage. Conqueror main here. </TEXT>
