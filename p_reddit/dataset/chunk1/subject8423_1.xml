	<TEXT> Because everyone keeps getting knocked back to the Stone Age.

Nmenreans were in the renaissance when sauron convinced them to attack the undying lands (it didn't go well for them) forcing them to become the nomadic wanderers we see it the books.

Rohan was nomadic at odds with Gonder until very recently.

Gonder has been subjugated, suffered revolts, and devastated by a plague whenever it gets close to any sort of technology.

The Easterlings get subjugated, suffer revolts, devastated by plagues, and conquered by sauron whenever they come close to technology.

The dwarves' greed always gets the best of them.  Wether it's attracting dragons, tunneling into orcish kingdoms, awakening literal demons from below the earth, or declaring war on an elven kingdom ruled and protected by a maiar, the dwarves can be short sighted and have their kingdoms sacked and riches stolen.

Lastly there's the elves.  Why would you create anything to pass down to your children when you can pick up and go to paradise?  The last elven house to get all uppity and innovative made a few magic jewels and promptly died trying to get them back. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I hate this rhetoric.  People do say this about expansions, yes, but WoD is entirely different.  Never has there been more people saying it with clear examples and issues ( professions, # of dungeons, # raids, # of zones, pvp) than WoD.  

I left in cataclysm and came back for WoD.  Before that I had been playing since vanilla.  The only things I liked about WoD I found out came from Mists.  Random rares, personalized loot, pet battle systems, etc.  I'm hard pressed to say anything I truly enjoyed in WoD beyond being able to go back and solo old raids.  I unsubbed after a couple months, resubbed for 6.2, then unsubbed again. 

For 50 dollars you get half of a bad expansion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Boromir 10/10 every round.

This can be broken down into high fantasy versus low fantasy.  Some feats of Boromir include cleaving a cave troll's arm (the big ones) clean off in a single swing.  He single handedly faught a company of Uruk-hai shock troopers and killed 20 of them before succumbing to his wounds.  

As far as gear goes, his cloak keeps him hidden from his enemies and his belt was some other sort of unexplained magic.

This fight isn't between two men, it's between a man and Man, chosen race of Eru Ilvatar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this small subreddit blew up when Jon and Nicole posted and we know Arin has been on here.  Just now there is a post on the front page involving Arin's father and he responds in 9 hours.  Furthermore, all his recent posts are in /r/deadgrumps and /r/conspiracygrumps and they tend to [deny any possible wrong-doing by Arin](http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyGrumps/comments/2ipdc3/will_arin_remove_the_jonera_grumpisodes/) or [give no ground](http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyGrumps/comments/2ipdc3/will_arin_remove_the_jonera_grumpisodes/cmpcrn1) [about what happened](http://www.reddit.com/r/ConspiracyGrumps/comments/2ipdc3/will_arin_remove_the_jonera_grumpisodes/cmne0t7)

Now it could be he knows nothing and liked defending his son against accusers, which is very possible, but this is conpiracy grumps.  We know Grumps watch the subreddit but could a PR team be watching it as well? 

If this is the case, wont people alleged to have given information like RicePirate and Ross be immediately cracked down on, stopping any leaks before we can find anything out?  Delving further into conspiracy, we know downvoting bots and upvoting bots are on reddit and what's stopping this PR team from leading us down wrong path after wrong path, keeping the truth buried where they want it?

Just a ranting conspiracy theorist. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Pieces of evidence pointing toward a root cause </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-07 21:09:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've heard the main reason being money tossed around here a lot and it got me thinking about a few instances here and there.

In the new game grumps episode Amazing world, not only is Arin okay with 100 dollars being dropped for a joke(showing they have a good amount of funds coming in now even split between 5 people.) But Ross has to ask, almost beg Arin to let him use the grump account.  Furthermore, this means the funds are tied up in an account that Arin controls.  

Second instance of evidence happens in the cricket episode.  Did you see the grump space?  A large building like that with wall to wall games, a kitchenette, and it looked new.  Possibly an addition on Arin's house?  If it's an addition, new building, or even just old space, the dozen or so arcade games would cost a very pretty penny.

So maybe the disagreement was over the direction of game grumps?  It sure as hell became a lot more profitable after two more people came on the payroll. </TEXT>

However.  Aragorn isn't a soldier, he's a ranger.  He tracked gollum 200 miles through marshes and mountains, he can feed four fat Hobbits from shit in the woods alone.  Don't get me wrong l, he is beyond peak human in many aspects, he's just a ranger first and a soldier second.  I still give it to cap.

	<TEXT> It has to do mainly with two things, RAM and ROM.  When ever you start your computer ( or phone, or router, or new car) it takes everything that it is, which is stored on the ROM and loads it into the RAM.  This is done because computers can read RAM faster and you get to keep a backup of your computer on your ROM.  Anyway, when something goes wrong, something stops working right or your computer freezes, 90% something in the RAM messed up, many things can mess in the RAM.  So when we turn it off, the RAM wipes clean, then when we turn it back on it reloads the RAM from the ROM, most likely fixing the problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not as much as I used to in the retail side of things.  On average, I might get 2 or three in a week.

When I do get those calls, I deal with costumers in the most polite way possible and try to explain why something is the way it is.  No I can't refund this $250 purchase to a card not on the account when you can't answer my security questions.  If all else fails, you have one harassment warning before I can terminate the call, so that's nice.

A lot of people make small-talk, we actually are trained to lure you into small-talk.  Most small talk involved features and recommendations but a lot of elderly callers (which constitute a large majority of mayday users) love to make small talk about what plenty of things.  These conversations are actually one of the better parts of the job because it makes everyone's day better.

Weirdest call I ever got was on Mayday.  Someone called with a picture of a sausage full screened on the web browser, they only needed help with one question.  "Would you like the beef?"  I declined.  I admired their dedication to the prank simply because all of their personal information was beef related in some way, all of it.  They gave me a negative review, though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. It doesn't, but they honestly don't really care what you have on your screen as long as it isn't illegal or harassing.  

2. And of the background which is regulated to orange and white, or a nice beige. 

3. Joke's on you, you can not change the HDX's wallpaper at this time anyway.

4. Yes they do, as does what ever you have on your silk browser.

5. It actually spits out a generic "Disabled during mayday" message and promptly closes.

I mean, if you need help sending your junk to someone, they can help you do that as long as you're polite and respectful about it.  My friend helped someone get a porn video playing the other day.  The guy was okay until he started asking my friend their preferred porn; flags were raised and permanently affixed to accounts at that point.

	<TEXT> Weirdest call would probably be from a girl who maydayed in when an app wasn't working properly.  It had to be updated, easy call.  But after the problem was fixed, she proceeded to talk to me about said app, which featured customizable 3d avatars she showed off to me, and asked what kind of music I listened too.  It was very surreal and sad because I think she was a lonely tween girl based on her voice and choice of avatar style.

Second weirdest was someone maydayed in with a picture of a sausage full screened and asked if I wanted the beef before ending the call. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be happy you take no negatives in your ability modifiers because there is no such thing as a dump stat in d20 modern (unless you min/max)

Strong heroes are fun, they're the only class to start with full BaB and have a decent defense.  The strong hero talents are a joke compared to other classes, though.  Unless you're going to play the combat guy, I would go into another class.

So there are two types of strong heroes: melee dominators, think monk  and everyone with a gun is a wizard waiting to be shutdown; and ranged soldiers who use their full BaB and good defenses to take bullets while dishing them out.  You could make a sneak character as a strong hero, but they would always be outmatched by a fast hero, so go fast if you want to sneak.

With your stats, I would go ranged strong hero (if you must go strong).  Put your 16 into dex, 14 into con, and spread the rest out however you want.  You wouldn't be able to go battle mind as ranged (or shouldn't) but for a solid melee character you need good dex, strength, and con to not get hit, do damage, and not die respectively.

If you're set on a strong battle mind, I would take a hit to your dex and have 16 str and 14 con.  You will get bit much more, but massive damage has brought the end to many of my characters and melee builds are too feat-starved to take imp. Massive dmg threshold.

So for your strong battle mind:  start with the wild talent feat and pick an occupation that allows you to start with combat martial arts.  For your lvl 2 feat, choose either brawl or power attack.  For your talents, go melee smash tree.  Keep jump maxed until you get I to battle Mind then keep the psi-skill maxed.  I would recommend dipping into fast for a level sometime; the added AC and extra square under the fast movement tree comes in handy for melee characters.

If you have any more questions just PM me.  Sorry for errors, sent from phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's like Waffle House's unhealthier younger brother.  [The Menu](http://www.tudorsbiscuits.com/menu_breakfast_biscuits.cfm) consists of a biscuit that is fried in, I think, a mixture of butter and grease while the finished biscuit itself is then dipped in said butter-grease bath.  I think it is the sole reason for Huntington, WV being the fattest city in the country and it's soooooo goooood. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would be interested in joining.  I can fill any role you need, but am partial to martial classes.  Would you be willing to break your no psionic rule if I were to make a monk since psionic fist is fairly iconic for them?  If not I would like to play a ranges fighter but am still willing to play anything needed.

I have been playing RPGs for years, branching out into several other systems while always going back to 3.5/3.75 because of my familiarity.  I have DMed and PCed dozens of games of varying styles but have yet to play in an online game.  Like most new RPG experiences, I can't wait to give it a try and am waiting for your reply.

Sorry for mistakes, typed from phone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, literally everything I made has been destroyed.  I don't know if I should be flattered they chose mine to utterly demolish down to a dozen blocks, or mad it's no longer there, but I really don't mind either way because it's just a game.  My first reaction was to dry heave in anger, but that didn't accomplish anything; instead I'm going to build other things next rev that are even better and more ridicules!  I totally understand you leaving, I get burnt out on minecraft and suffering a serious burn out is something I can completely understand.  I hope we see you again some time in Brom/Shady Oaks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few ideas on that: 
Minos is actually Cretian for King, so a simple/complex  crown would work just fine.

Minos the king of Knossos had the best navy in ancient (Homer's) Greece, so a ship would make sense

Moving away from Greek things, a simple labyrinth design would work well for our flag, since we are a labyrinth; a short google search of the word brings up many examples.  

That's my 2-cents </TEXT>

Edit: I updated the cannon to a [Big Cannon](http://imgur.com/a/P11po) which is vastly improved thanks to more explosives.  Not only does it shoot two TNT that fly close to eachother, it shoots over a much greater distance with a much greater lift. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> How modern is Brom going to be?  I ask because I would like to build a space needle, which was built in 62, in new Brom downtown.  It'll be about y75 and 34x34.  

Those measurements aren't final and neither is the project, but it wont change every much.

Some explanation; the base is not under the tower, but the two circle plates are the same for the final product.

	<TEXT> Here's my take on the wall, feel free to make corrections.

There were two types of Berlin Wall, one for populated areas, one for less populated areas; eventually the wall became just huge and concrete everywhere, but that would be boring to stare at, so here are two types.

This first one is wooden, cheaper, and meant to be placed everywhere but downtown.
[Wooden fence](http://imgur.com/6NbLS)

This second one is meant for downtown, and looks awfully imposing in my opinion.

[Concrete wall 2](http://imgur.com/RUaHj)

So, what do you all think?
