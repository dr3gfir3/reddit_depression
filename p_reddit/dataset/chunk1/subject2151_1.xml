	<TEXT> If you do peanut butter first, it's difficult to get the peanut butter off the knife to then get the jelly without getting peanut butter in the jelly .  The jelly wipes off a lot easier, so do that first, then wipe the knife on the other slice of bread, then get the peanut butter.  It's only logical.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> After I got married in 1996, we moved into a duplex. My landlord's somewhat-batshit-crazy brother lived in the house behind ours. His house was a disaster. All the windows and doors were shuttered up with the exception of one door to the carport, which opened up towards my back door. It had been shuttered up that way since Hurricane Andrew in 1992. The paint on the exterior walls had been stripped by the hurricane and left that way. After that hurricane, people would write on the outside walls of their houses the insurance company   policy number for easy ID, since there were no street signs or landmarks left. His house had a note for the postal service: "USPS: I ALWAY HOME". Exactly like that. He would often sleep in the day and lurk around at night, usually in only his underwear. Occasionally in the daytime I would see him and greet him, and he'd talk to me about his lonely life and how horrible our neighbors were and how he was glad he had a nice quiet neighbor like me. All the time he spoke, he kept his eyes shut. Weird. My neighbors in the duplex were a youngish couple with a little boy. One day exiting my back door, I notice a HORRIFIC smell, like an alley in NYC, a stench of rotting piss. Long story short, I had ceased to be his ideal neighbor, because I vacuumed my house, or had the radio on in the car while I washed it. That stench came from him, which was his collected urine left to sit. When he got angry with a neighbor, he'd grab a cup of it and throw it into one's yard. He took lots of vitamins so it was super strong, too. I had words with him, and over the weeks our arguments over noise vs. piss escalated. One night we had a VERY loud argument, and a nearby police officer came to quell the fire. The crazy man ranted on and on even when the officer commanded him to stop talking. They ended up taking him to jail. I did my best to keep quiet but things calmed down with him after that. Fast forward a few years, the duplex neighbors move and some younger chicanos (American-born Mexicans) move in, who love to invite 50 people to a party seemingly at least once a month. The crazy man does his piss-throwing act to them while the party is going on, and manages to throw it right at a little girl. Not sure if they pressed charges, but I think they did. Not long after that, we moved, he has since died. His dungeon of a house was finally cleaned up and sold. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> La cantante es joven, y no tiene voz como Rocio, fue un ejemplo del sentido de la cancion. La musica creo que no tiene batteria, talvez solamente la voz y keyboard. Puede ser que en grupo que lo grabo tiene un nombre con un "X" y esta algo cortado como "X-etra" o algo asi.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Estoy cerca de Miami, Florida, donde hay una emisora de exitos Mexicanos. Alredador del ao 2010 o 2011, habia una cancion que tocaban regularmente pero no puede recordar ni como son las letras ni como se llama ni quien lo canta. La cantante es mujer, la cancion es despacio y un poco triste, algo como Rocio Durcal's "Amor Eterno", pero mas moderno. Algun idea? Gracias! </TEXT>
