	<TEXT> If my students still have time on their stipend I always advise them to wait to submit their thesis and use the time to apply for jobs and write papers.

Have you tried applying to private schools? Many private schools here like having teachers with higher degrees on their staff. 

Even though it might cost you more to work as an adjunct, the experience looks better on a CV than being unemployed.

	<TEXT> The average age of heavy rigid and articulated trucks in Australia are around 16 and 12 years, respectively. Passenger vehicles average 14 years. 
EDIT: Also just found: "Of the 329,464 heavy rigid trucks registered for use in Australia, some 43.5 per cent were manufactured in or before 1998. " </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is a valid point, however the study used a Euro 1 diesel with complete tailpipe assembly. Diesel oxy-cats weren't uniformly employed until Euro 3 (or equivalent) and filters not till Euro 6 (uniformly). 
So the study is likely to be representative of a large proportion of the diesel fleet on roads around the world today.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Everyone, any ID suggestions welcome. At first I thought these could be a Lactarius but that seems not to be the case???  These are quite prolific. The land was a radiata plantation for the last 35 years, but has been harvested and a wildfire has been through. 
EDIT: Hat for scale. These are dinner plate sized, however most on the property are smaller. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Despite what (that largely unreferenced) wikipedia article says, although farmed/domestic pigs are castrated early in life, you can often tell the difference between meat from male and female pigs. 
Some butchers I know only buy female pigs from suppliers. I have done blind tastings and you can detect the difference. 
EDIT: Here is a better article https://www.aasv.org/shap/issues/v5n4/v5n4p151.pdf

	<TEXT> This might be specific to your particular gearbox, but it sounds like you are talking about the extra effort of the synchros matching gear speeds. 
Modern gearboxes use synchromesh so that you don't need to match rpm for the gear you are changing into. These are usually in the form of spring loaded bronze cones which engage with the gear first and match speeds, before positive engagement of the new gear with the mainshaft of the gearbox. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As others have said guns were never outlawed. Just semi autos and pump action shotguns (essentially).

Most serious shooters I knew (farmers/hunters) were unaffected as they didn't own anything subject to the buyback. Bolt action / DB shotguns, etc...

A few people I knew who owned guns for "personal protection" grumbled and/or ranted, but when they went to hand the guns in got more than they paid so were somewhat happy.
 
Most then used the buyback cash to buy more guns. I think the stats support that. The number of guns per individual went up after 1996. 

Anyone with a "genuine reason" can still get a gun quite easily in all parts of Australia.

	<TEXT> This is essentially the right answer. 
If you are standing in a train carriage moving at a constant velocity and you jump up you will land back down in the same location within the carriage. This is because your velocity relative to the ground is the same as the train's, and you won't slow down significantly. 
If you are standing on an open flat bed, wind resistance will slow you down when you jump. How much will depend on the train's velocity and how high you jump (plus any additional wind speed - depending on the train's direction relative to the wind).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A wick is basically just a bundle of fibres (usually knitted or felted so it holds together). You can use a wide range of fibre diameters to make up the wick, which will give you a range of porosity and capilarity in the wick, suited to the substance you want to burn. 
EDIT: I think the OP mentioned using a paper wick - which is just a bunch of cellulose fibres </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the question you could either be talking about moving outside the power band (see u/shokalion 's response) or hitting the rev limiter. 
Modern electronically controlled engines have an rpm limit (programmed into the computer) that you can't go past. So it definitely feels like "hitting a wall" if you accelerate to an RPM that high. 
But in most vehicles, you will notice either a moderate or severe drop in acceleration rate before you get to the rev limit, which could also be described as "hitting a wall".

I can't understand why people are giving dogs cooked meat? Sure we give dogs scraps of leftover cooked meat, but dogs should be eating most of their meat raw. </TEXT>

Lots of military vehicles and even off highway (e.g. farm/mining) vehicles have these kind of filters fitted for cabin air filtration.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We often buy meat (for human consumption) with bones, then debone it (a few minutes work with a boning knife) and give the dog the bones and trims. 
You save money because you normally pay a premium price for boneless cuts. 
I don't have an answer to your direct question, but you can be sure that all meat that goes into dog food is classed as not fit for human consumption, so it would all otherwise go to waste. Chicken would likely have the lowest carbon footprint.
