	<TEXT> I think there are two main reasons this happens (though there are probably more). The first is that you may not have been the right age, or in the state of mind, or interested in concepts/techniques that the film explores the first time you watched it.

For me it's probably been more about life experiences, not about the film techniques etc. I've studied cinema from so young age that by the time I was in high school I had more knowledge of the history of cinema than probably most of people graduating from film school. But what I lacked was life experiences and I think that life lived changes how we see films. 

But then there are films like Chinatown where I rewatched it quite soon after first watch (in a less than year) and yet I appreciated it far more on rewatch. Maybe I just picked more details.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely not. There are more movies I'd like to watch than there is time and when I spend one day without watching at least one movie I feel guilty. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I sometimes watch a movie and I don't think much of it but when I later rewatch it I realize that it's a masterpiece. For example when I first watched Chinatown I was little bored but today I watched it again and now I think it's one of the best movies I have ever seen.

I was just wondering is it just me or does anyone else have similar experiences where they don't appreciate movie on first watch but later realize that it's a truly great movie? </TEXT>

[Army of Shadows (1969)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYl2I0vVok4). It's about resistance fighters in Nazi-occupied France. One of the most haunting movies I've ever seen. </TEXT>
