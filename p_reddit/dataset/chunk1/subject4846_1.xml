	<TEXT> i dont actually own it yet, have to wait 2 more weeks but...  yes. by a wide, wide margin.

i could buy my previous commuter car 7 times, and outright buy my current lease cars 4 times over.

my previous commuter car was a mazda miata. which had a just ok interior. my fiat 500e had, in comparison, a much nicer interior. so that got me on the "nice interiors are nice" train. so i started to think about more expensive cars. and then well... i became a chump and ordered 5 options away from the most expensive vehicle tesla currently makes.    sigh...   hindsight is a bitch. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> a few months ago i found a 3-4 inch hole in my front yard here in los angeles. at the time i thought it was a rodent hole of some sort so i proceed to fill it with sand and yard waste from around the area. about two weeks ago i was in the front yard and saw the hole had reappeared. so once again i filled it, this time with water to drown out whatever may have made it. then i grabbed a bunch of mulch / potting soil and filled in the hole with the water.

the next day the area was very soft and gave way under foot pressure. i though... oh shit... its a sinkhole. had the sewer line inspected, everything ok. tested the waterline today, seems like i dont have a leak.

decided to excavate the area and found under the root layer was a 3-4 inch deep layer of potting soil complete with little white stones. the small hole was softer than the surrounding dirt.   i have no idea what this is... or who to call to fix it.   any ideas from here?

another view shoving my cell phone in the hole.

	<TEXT> i ditched my gas car long ago, so currently i am only paying $200 a month for a fiat ev lease + like $30 in electricity for 2 evs. we have gotten rid of most of our debt for some time now, so other than mortgage and property tax everything went to the car fund. it was really only possible for me because my wife loved the model s as much as i do, so i had her help religiously saving. when i say religiously i mean not going anywhere, movies, out to eat, nothing. plus i had the opportunity to do crazy amounts of overtime for the beginning of 2015. by October were were at the 85D. tried to get as much overtime as i could for the rest of the year to get an ok equipped P85D.

sadly my uncle passed away in december and named me in his will so that covered the last 10k for the P90DL. 

as far as the "fuck it, im doing it" the wife was sold on the model s 60kw several years ago. but she could not swing the funds. i offered to give her a loan for the rest. time passed and i started researching more and more about the car. i told her we should be getting the S85 if im helping. test drove, fell for it hard. we were invited to the D reveal event and i was blown away by the P85D, prior to that i was not interested in the P85.

So now that i wanted the P85D the tables turned and the wife was giving me a 50% S85D loan and i would cover the rest. so...   basically i stole her dream  :D

we were not at all interested in a car payment. we agreed to just wait until the savings matched the price. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> hello, just found this sub reddit.  ive been mulling over a custom decal for my car. the only interesting place i could think of for it would be smack in the center of the high mount 3rd brake light on my rear window. the decal would be about 3", the brake light is about 7-8." from what i have read you can pretty much do anything with your rear window... but was wondering about the brake light part.

	<TEXT> hello everyone, the other day i was launching missions to clamp onto orbiting debris to deorbit them when i remembered Romfarer Lazor System. went to the mod thread and was sad to see it was very out of date. does anyone have a suggestion for lazer mods for blowing up debris? any other mod that could serve that purpose? 

i am fully aware i can just delete them...  but that does not feel right. got to put at least one kerbals life in danger... </TEXT>
