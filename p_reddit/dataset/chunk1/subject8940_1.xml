	<TEXT> The Twentieth Wife and the sequels by Indu Sundaresan.  These are historical fiction set in India.

I also have really enjoyed the non-fiction by Jean Sasson - Princess and it's 4 (I think?) sequels.  They're about a princess from the Saudi Arabian royal family. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I suggest The Little Paris Bookshop by Nina George. It's very relevant to healing following the loss of a relationship.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you like historical stuff at all, Victoria Thompson's Gaslight Mystery Series is pretty good.  The individual mysteries in each book are decently set up and the whole series has a great arc following the main character, exploring her past, her relationships, etc.

There's also a genre of mysteries called "cozy" in which I often find the mystery itself is really more of a window dressing for the main character just living their life.  Ann Purser has a series Lois Meade that's kind fun.
Charlene Harris has the Aurora Teagarden series as well.

If you like paranormal stuff at all, I'd suggest A Discovery of Witches by Deborah Harkness, though I think that's usually categorized as fiction rather than mystery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The OddThomas series (Dean Koontz) read by David Aaron Baker. The books are from the first person and Baker just does an amazing job of making Odd sound real, communicating the emotion through the stories and giving enough of a different voice to the other characters I had no confusion as to who was speaking.  </TEXT>
