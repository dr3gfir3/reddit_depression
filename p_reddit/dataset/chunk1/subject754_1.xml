	<TEXT> If people can grow and sell on a local level, it will cut out much of the smuggling from Mexico. Why import when you have a warehouse full of it just down the street? I don't smoke, but I'm all for the legalization. Tax revenue will increase, violent marijuana crime will greatly diminish, and normal people will stop being harassed for what they do in their spare time.

As long as anything is illegal, there's a black market for it. The aim here is to drastically cut the size of the black market </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, yes. Some secular Jews don't partake, but it is still a common occurrence. 

From Genesis ch 17:

10 This is My covenant, which ye shall keep, between Me and you and thy seed after thee: every male among you shall be circumcised.   
11 And ye shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin; and it shall be a token of a covenant betwixt Me and you.   
12 And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you, every male throughout your generations, he that is born in the house, or bought with money of any foreigner, that is not of thy seed.   
13 He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy money, must needs be circumcised; and My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant.   
14 And the circumcised male who does not pin the flesh of his foreskin to his door, that soul shall be cut off from his people; he hath broken My covenant.

	<TITLE> April 2012 Rifle Match - Iron Sights </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-04-02 00:25:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> **Congratulations to everyone who participated! Sewiv is our April winner, and will be making next month's competition!**

Welcome to the April 2012 iron sights rifle match! Hopefully we'll get a good turnout now that things are thawing out for spring.

**Target   Distance** 

[Here is the target](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JDYSXGPMdOJfL5s0_rfEsKlVPyHyInz30Kw_2UYtbpg/edit) we'll be shooting at, an April fool. Print it on a standard 8.5x11" paper (A4 for you non-americans out there). Distance will be at 50 yards with any caliber you want. ARs, mosins, black powder, .50 cal, .22, whatever you want. 

**Scoring**

The center is 10, and it decreases by one every ring. Hitting the paper nets you 1 point. If you break a line, you get the higher of the two scores. 

**Position** 

Everybody has that one position that they wished they had worked on more, and for alot of people that position is sitting or kneeling. Nobody wants to look like a fool when they shoot so for this month's competition we'll be shooting in the [NRA sitting position](http://i.imgur.com/iuDuK.png) and the [NRA kneeling position](http://i.imgur.com/VhfFq.png). Slings and kneeling rolls are OK, just no artificial rests for the gun like sandbags or anything like that. 

**Submission** 

Please scan your targets and upload them. Pictures are OK if you don't have a scanner, just make sure everything is legible. Also, pictures of your rifle and range are always appreciated!

**Course of fire**

We'll shoot a total of 10 shots, 5 from each position. Print off 2 targets and shoot one position at each. If need be you can shoot everything on one target, but that won't give good information about the groups you get in each position.

Feel free to sight in as much as you want, just submit your best score (1 submission per person).

If anyone has any questions, feel free to ask! This is my first time running a competition so hopefully it'll go well. Good luck everyone!

**Scores**

*sewiv* - 43

*x888x* - 40

*Smedly25* - 34

*pavelft* - 31

	<TEXT> I broke my right wrist 3.5 months ago downhill biking, and about 2 weeks ago I finally got out my cast. I can't climb or put weight on it yet (it's still fairly stiff), but I was just wondering if anybody had good stretches or "introductory" exercises that I could do to gain some flexibility and ease me back into climbing. 

Thanks guys! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Does anyone else ride moguls/chutes? What bindings do you use? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-10-07 07:38:02 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm not your typical snowboarder. I ride with primarily skiiers, and almost never hit the park unless it's on the way to the base of wherever I'm riding (which is pretty uncommon). I can't 360, ride fakie, or do anything other than 50/50 on a rail, but I can shred the hell out of a mogul run. I ride moguls, chutes, and powder allllll day long and I LOVE it. I can beat most skiers down a double black, and I don't mind hiking to hit the gnarly pillow lines. I also splitboard in early/late season to hit up the untouched remote areas (DIY splitboards are the shit!). 

I've been riding for 11 years, 6-7 of which were with my current bindings. I love them, but the straps have broken so many times it's ridiculous (they're currently black webbing with about 4" of plastic OEM strap material sewed to the ends), and the ratchets are pretty much dead as well. Since I've been using the same gear for so long, I'm super out of it when it comes to brands and features.

So I'm looking for some bindings that would be good for riding moguls and chutes. Anyone have any good recommendations? 

**TL;DR** - I need bindings for riding moguls/chutes, any suggestions? </TEXT>
