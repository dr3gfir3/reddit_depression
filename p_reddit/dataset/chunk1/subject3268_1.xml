	<TEXT> I know there will be lots of talking, lots of insults, etc. 

We have kept it up for 4 years, we have perfected not being caught and being careful. Most affairs are caught around the one year mark, when people become careless. 

I know if something was going to happen, I would just resign. I have no problems with that. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Perhaps, perhaps. But such is life! I said before that I didn't love him, I said I cared for him.

It will sound dreadful but that is not my problem.  If someone else in our office was the mistress, I still wouldn't feel different for the wife. It's up to her to say something, and it's up to them to work it out.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A few. I've missed dates with really genuine, lovely men. I do not want to be tied to someone and be emotionally attached to someone in the form of a boyfriend at this stage in my life. I get the best of both worlds with my secret partner - I get affection, I get freedom. I get financial independancy and get showered with gifts. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew there would be a bit of anger coming in!

personally... I look at it this way. He is just as bad as me, if not worse. I can move on quite easily. We are both getting what our lives lack, and it is not a simple case of me shagging him over a desk. We have deep discussions about all manner of things from religion to where we want to be in ten years time. He is a companion to me as well as a sexual partner. I appreciate how you feel, but it is not all me that is doing the wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if Pride is the right word. 

I'v always been a hard working woman, determined. I wanted the contacts and I wanted the experience of working with a high end company. I used what God has given me - figure, intelligence, being a female etc.

	<TEXT> Yes. And I have no qualms about renaming it to make it sound better than what it is.

I will quite openly admit that I am a home wrecker, a whore, a mistress, 'the other woman.' </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've made it clear that I would not be interested in being his wife's replacement. We are complete opposites. I am brunette, tall, reasonably slim, and I am in a powerful position with my work, contacts etc.

His wife is a shy, retiring blonde who dislikes being in the spotlight. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used to, but I have been doing it for so long with my boss that I never really think about her. We never talk about her, and he has confessed that if he could leave he would. I don't really believe that though as he has had plenty of chances to leave her, and the finance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am in Scotland, UK.

Our closest call was when he was in my office and I was pulling my shirt to the side to tease him. Little did I realise that my blinds had been reversed and the rest of the office could see me flashing at him. Luckily we convinced them that I had been doing it without realising, although we have become more careful.

I did have a boyfriend but because of the excitement in my ''double life'' we drifted apart. I craved the constant thrill and excitement, he wanted to stay in and watch movies. I guess if he was exciting, I would have ended the affair. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have been included on trips to prestigious hotels - due to the nature of my work and the location, our courses are over 500 miles away. The car manufacturer is a luxury brand and I have been given a courtesy vehicle even though I am not entitled to one. I think this is partially out of fear and partially out of affection, he wants me to keep on his side in secrecy and in sex.

I have been included on trips with him that are not strictly for me. I always have plenty of excuses for my co workers, I tell them I am a partial Personal Assistant and it is my job to go with my boss to these places. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew this was coming!

I bet most people that say they are having an affair are doing it for the sex.

The sex at the beginning was incredible, but I know now that it was because of the thrill of it all. Now, because I know what he likes and he knows what I like, it is like being in a long term relationship. What keeps it exciting is the remaining dread and fear of being caught by someone.  </TEXT>
