	<TITLE> Has anybody else been less than impressed with customer service lately? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-02 03:47:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've had a few problems going into Christmas, and overall have been pretty disappointed with the customer service Amazon has given me. My main problem was that I am a Prime customer, and have ordered a lot of things in the past year from Amazon. In my last report I had 130 items and spent about $3200 in the last year. 


In the last month I ordered a whole lot of Christmas gifts, about a grand worth of various things. Every single one was Prime, and yet 70% took longer than two days, even accounting for Sundays. A few even took 5 days, despite them being in stock when I ordered them in the middle of the day. I've heard that when this happens you should contact them, and I did. 

My response from the Customer Service department was that I should have chosen two-day shipping and checked the estimated delivery date when I ordered, both of which I did. And that was all they told me. This isn't the only problem I have had ([See here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Seahawks/comments/2qbt1s/i_think_somebody_is_having_a_laugh_at_me_twice_i/)), but it is the most frustrating to me. I used to praise their customer service all the time, and now it just seems like they don't care.

Anybody else been having problems? Or am I just cursed with bad luck? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey everybody. This year we are attempting to keep things more organized, and also more helpful to anybody new to the puzzle. Because of that we are hoping to do weekly hub posts. We need somebody that can help us collect all new information and weekly post a sticky that explains what has happened. This mod will also be in charge of keeping the wiki updated with information that is helpful to puzzle contributors. 

This will require somebody that can come to the sub and contribute at least an hour or two a week (depending on how much stuff has happened), so please don't apply if you can't contribute your time. We will give preference to those who contributed greatly last year, and those who have shown in other subs they are willing to contribute time.

So if you want to apply message the mods (on the right side of the page) and lets us know why you would be able to help, keeping in mind the preferences above. We will make our choices in a few days.

If you have any questions let me know! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I'm new to dogecoin, just got my wallet up and running and all of that. But last week I was at a really rummy old bar and a bunch of older guys there were watching Nascar. Josh Wise was mentioned(by me because I don't know who else to support in Nascar), and told them I support Josh because of the whole Dogecoin thing, even though I'm wasn't part of it last week. Somebody asked what it was,a nd I realized that I have no idea how to explain it! So I need some help. I'm probably going there this weekend, and want to be able to explain Dogecoin and give the guys an explanation. Analogies are probably most helpful.

	<TEXT> So like the title says, I have a Gateway NV55C, that will work great for a week of two. At one point it will just shut down, then for the next week or so after that, when the power button is pressed the fan will come on, the lights will flash, but no actual boot, or sometimes it does boot then shuts itself off after about ten minutes and won't boot again. After a week or two, it will start working again perfectly for a week or two and repeat.

I have tried it on Windows 7 and Ubuntu, it happens on both. I have switched out the Hard drive and it happened on both. I have replaced the thermal paste on the MB, happened before and after, although every time I take it apart it seems to work for a while then start doing it again. It seems to me it is something wrong with the MB, but not sure what it would be.It happens with or without battery in, and with or without power cord in.

	<DATE> 2014-03-22 18:03:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have found a large collection of flies at my house that seem old, and apparently they came from an old neighbor that decided he was too old to fly fish anymore. As much as I would love to go and fly fish, i have no money to go and get started. I was hoping to know if there is a way to find out if any are valuable so I could sell them to maybe buy some gear, and if any are good quality so I could keep them for my own future use. I was hoping for a general answer as there is a lot of flies. I know it's a good possibility they are all worth a few cents a piece, but maybe some might be worth something to somebody. 

For info, they seem to range from very small to medium size, but beyond that I know nothing about flies so I can't give anymore info. I have tied one before but that is about it. Would love to learn though!

Thanks for the help!

Also, if this would fit somewhere else better please let me know.

##WHAT WE KNOW SO FAR##

- The timestamps on the back of the envelopes are not random, and most likely a clue was found from this, see [Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/1u2yck/step_1_partially_solved_timestamps_on_back_of/ ). This clue spells out FEELFORGREEN, as seen [Here](http://i.imgur.com/aAtfcBt.png). Credit to /u/electro_mullet for the picture and /u/ewige (and some others in the thread) for figuring out the clue.
- [A website was also found, although we found it in the wrong order](http://butbeforeikillyoumrbondimustshowyouthetruemeaningofchristmas.com/). It tells us however, we need two 11 character clues. Also, the people from CAH are watching us. A possible way of finding the name of the website was found by /u/DoubleOhNine ([Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/1u62q5/running_of_this_thread_i_think_i_may_have_found_a/)). The original Cards Against Humanity kick starter included the James Bond card on the [page](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/maxtemkin/cards-against-humanity).

- [There are five colors on the envelope](http://www.reddit.com/r/holidaybullshit/comments/1u46t6/end_of_debate_there_are_5_colors_of_lights/)

**/u/rya_nc was nice enough to start an [IRC channel](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=r_holidaybullshit) to further our cause !**

**/u/DaveLambert** got the [straight poop from Max] (http://www.reddit.com/r/cardsagainsthumanity/comments/1sbky6/question_about_the_holiday_bullshit_possible/cdy37sm) that the puzzle prize can be split up to cover any group working on it.

**ADDITIONALLY:** A clue directly from Max regarding the puzzle:

"To dispel any rumors: There really is a puzzle, it's not a trick or a gimmick. There are multiple steps to the puzzle, one leading to the next. There is a solution, and if you solve it you will know what to do to let us know you solved it first."  

###FAQ:###
Ask questions and we will try to answer them and put them here.

**If you have anything to add to the sticky, please message me and let me know and I'll add it, I'm sure I've missed some things.**

**Finally, lets keep it fun! As /u/Maxistentialist has said, its just a puzzle, for fun. No need for a competitive nature or anybody being mean. We don't want them to cancel the whole thing!** </TEXT>

Gifting winner soon!


Alright, so I haven't ran a contest in a while, and I want to get something for somebody that is under $5! And I like Google Maps! So it's pretty simple how to enter this contest:

1. Have something under $5 on your WL.

2. Make sure you use the Raffle phrase "Nice to meet you, Brad!" (Because really I've been on here a while and don't know most of you)

3. And to relate it to Google Maps, find me the first letter of your username as a giant letter somewhere in the world. If your username starts with a number, do the first letter of the number spelled out. If you're using the new Google Maps, just copy and paste your address bar from Google in. It updates automatically now.

This contest ends tomorrow morning when I wake up, so get to it! I hope to do more Google Maps Scavenger hunts in the future, and maybe get more creative then just making you find a big letter. Also, here is a hint to help you find the letter you need:

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So back in the early 90's, as members of the Seahawkers, my parents won a Steve Largent jersey. According to the raffle, the jersey was supposed to be worn by Steve Largent in 1989, but was one of the remaining jerseys after he retired that wasn't used, one of apparently only 4. Because of that, it doesn't even have his name on it, only the number 80. Is there any way to verify if this is a real jersey? It's a bit dirty, so if it is real we would like to spend a bit of extra money to get it cleaned up.

	<TEXT> My dad has a eT1641-02w computer, with stock motherboard. However it has failed, and instead of buying a whole new computer, we would like to upgrade the motherboard, and most likely the processor and memory too. I don't know much about replacing motherboards, but know enough about computers to think I can do this. Now my main questions is about what items will work.

[This](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16813135315) is the board we were thinking about buying. Would it actually fit in with what we have already? i know we would need a new processor and memory, but don't mind buying those. Just want to make sure this board will actually fit in the case and is usable with everything.

Thanks

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am doing a project on creating differential equations, and would like to create an equation to see if a Youtube video will become big. However, I can't figure out to see a history of views for a video. i.e. How many views did Gangnam Style have within its first week, two weeks, three weeks, and on. 


I was hoping somebody could help me either figure out a way to see stuff like that, or give me another way to figure out how a video is doing. I feel like Google trends doesn't give me enough info to be useful, but maybe there is a way to unlock more statistics.


Thanks for the help. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've recently learned in depth about the big bang, expanding universe, etc. Most of the sources use the expanding balloon analogy, where points on opposite sides of the universe are expanding away faster than the speed of light, therefore we can't see the stars across the universe. However I also read that the universe expansion is accelerating as well. So that leads me to believe a star that at one point was moving away slower than the speed of light could now be moving away faster. Would that mean from our vantage point a star could be going backwards in time, in terms of its lifespan? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What is it about my area that makes it so hard for Meteorologists to predict the weather? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-01-17 06:23:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I live in the Inland Northwest in Spokane, Washington. Lately, our city has been under numerous watches and advisories about snow coming. Yet, it still hasn't been here, despite being predicted to start falling Sunday morning. Is there a reason that it is hard to get the weather right in our area? Or is it just a world-wide thing? 

For example, right now on two local news stations they have snow maps of the area. One station says a town will get 12 to 18 inches of snow, another says 1-4 inches for the same town. How can they be so different? Another example is today, in the process of looking at the weather, I looked at NOAA for my neighborhood three different times. Each time, in the space of 12 hours, had almost completely different snowfall amounts and temperatures for tomorrow.

My overall question is, is this difference in predicting due to the geographical area I live in? Or just meteorology in general?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I attend a small liberal arts college with a small Physics department. Inside that physics department we have an even smaller Engineering department. But a couple of friends and I want to start a community help based Engineering Club. My main questions are:

* Does anybody have any tips on making a small club have a big impact?

* Do you guys have any ideas on some projects we can do?

We are trying to keep it within the bounds of what we can do at our school and within what we have learned. Most of us our getting Engineering Physics degrees, because actual engineering degrees aren't offered. But we believe that having this experience will help us on the way to Grad School. Thanks for the help! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> What Causes a Tail to Appear on the International Space Station? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-08-22 06:49:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First, background: I have watched the ISS many times before go over my city and out in the country. This is the first time I have ever noticed something out of the ordinary.
My dad and I were watching the space station go over tonight, and both thought our eyes were deceiving us. The station appeared to have a tail pointing towards the horizon. In all honesty, the best way I could desribe it was it made the space station look like sperm, with a straight tail. When I grabbed the binoculars to look at it, through magnification, it had no tail. But through the naked eye, it did have a tail. Can anyone explain what this "tail" was, and why I have never seen it before?

Some Quick details:

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> First off, I live in Spokane Washington. Many Boeing test flights take place nearby or overhead. A lot take place out of nearby Moses Lake. One thing I have noticed with the 747 test flights is that they have a chase plane. Or atleast thats what I think it is. Multiple times this summer and last my family and i have noticed the little jet on the tail or wingtip of the bigger 747. When tracked on Flightaware, I can only find the 747, not the smaller jet. My question is, what is the little jet, and what is it doing?

[Here](http://flightaware.com/live/flight/BOE8/history/20110731/2100Z/KMWH/KMWH) is the flightpath of one I seen with a jet on it. </TEXT>
