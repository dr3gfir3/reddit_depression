	<TEXT> When I was 3, my mom and I were picking up my older brother from school. As we were walking home, I decided that running away from my mom was a great idea. I was looking back at my mom and as soon as I turned around, my forehead connected with the notch on the side of a fire hydrant. My mom's white t-shirt was completely stained red after that. Still have that scar on my forehead today! </TEXT>
