	<TEXT> Alright, go ahead and believe what you want.  I'm tired of trying to help the average layman understand how to interpret scientific literature when they read it like religious text.  It doesn't make a difference to me, every puff of tobacco or e-cig is another dollar in my pocket. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The paper you're citing is written by a psychiatrist one professor.  The 95% comes from what the vaping material is made of, not its affect on human health.  And none of these papers cite the long-term risks or tracking individuals over time.  It just has describes who is vaping, not what vaping is doing to the body.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't matter.  Extreme heat to any compound will cause the compound to denature.  Although weed is less addictive to tobacco, prolonged use still damages tissue inside your body, especially your lungs.  I'm sure you can google pictures of lung tissue. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know about the two together, but I even without comprehensive long term studies, a organic chemist can confidently tell you that vaping is bad.  It has no system for regulation, and ingredients are not disclosed to the public or regulators.  You don't know how the heating element creates free radicals, ie atoms with unpaired valence electrons, and you don't know how much of it is heavy metals.  The label claims to tell you what 95% of the eliquid is made of, but chemicals and heavy metals at few parts per million can do lots of damage! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Everyone knew what they were doing, and I was out of shape.  But I shouldn't be surprised since I didn't do any real exercise for a few months.  Baby steps.  This is going to take at least a few months before I get into the flow of things.  Also, most everyone spoke Spanish, except when they spoke English a few to times to explain things to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool film.  It's hard to feel determined to things that require lots of time and effort.  Sometimes something traumatic happens, sometimes we don't have the energy, and sometimes we're just bored.  We have to remind ourselves that you just have to want it, despite circumstances. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm really interested in joining a boxing gym, but part of me feel intimidated by athletic and experienced guys.  I'm not really athletic, and I'm a really nerdy guy.  I'd also be the only Asian guy at the gym.  I know I'm overreacting, but how would you suggest overcoming this? </TEXT>
