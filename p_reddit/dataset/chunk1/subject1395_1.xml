	<TEXT> It's tough. Prices should start to drop soon hopefully as the original cast pretty much split. You can enter the lottery if you live within an hour or two of NYC - if you win (very low chances) you get 2 front row tickets for $10 each (but you need to get there in time). Other than that, get a lot of money. I think PBS is airing a recording of original cast on like October 9th or so. That's gonna be cool, and accessible to us normies.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Got it. I actually desoldered the cap I thought was at fault, but it turns out the leaking I thought I was seeing was elsewhere on the board, as the cap tested fine on its own. 

Basically my work was scrapping an $800 Samsung tv that isn't going out of standby, and I started my job last week so I'm trying to impress them. Figured it was worth checking with a dmm. 

I actually have a cheap Westinghouse tv at home that's doing the same thing, and no solution for that either. 

Do you think it's worth buying replacement caps for both psu's? Or does it make more sense to just order replacement boards from China? 50-60 for each one

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Backstory: trying to fix a dead tv at work.

Should a dmm on a capacitor always approach infinite resistance? Like a cap that goes up to 600k (instead of going to 1.0 on the meter) is passing current even though it's full, right? That's bad. Right?

I can't find any bad caps on the power supply board, but one of them doesn't seem to charge and discharge properly. It's a 47uF 50V cap, so I should be able to replace it easily, but I'm not sure is this is the problem or not. 

Any help is appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Idea for a new gadget (maybe to replace some redundant Nitro?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-08-02 06:50:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok, so in Rainbow Six Vegas (and RSV2) you had an optional  gadget called a motion sensor. It was a little doodad you stuck on a wall, and it emitted a laser beam. If an enemy walked through this beam, you got a ping on your map showing where they were. 

This could be integrated into RS6S pretty easily as a defense gadget, and it would be nice to have fewer C4 ops. Instead of showing a ping on a map, it could show on your compass, sort of like how a friendly ping does, or possibly as a tag (as per drone/camera tagging). 

Keep in mind, we now a ton of Nitro Cell ops: Smoke, Mute, Pulse, Kapkan, Bandit, Valkyrie, Caveira (+Frost before patch). Anyone else sick of it? It doesn't feel unique to defenders anymore, and it is frustrating how shield operators just don't feel worth it anymore. In fact, there are more C4 defense ops than non-C4 defense ops. 

Other gadgets just don't feel as meaningful. It would be awesome if you had a nice surveillance tool that wasn't quite as powerful as Valk's cams. 

Any thoughts?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My friend has been talking about building a computer with a budget around 1200. I've built a few computers before, but he doesn't seem super interesting in learning HOW to pick out parts. Thing is, I'm not confident enough with today's hardware to set up a list for him. He just purchased a Zotac GTX 1070, as he's been watching for them to get in stock, and his attitude now is "Now what?"

I'm trying to get him to look at ATX cases he likes, LGA1151 DDR4 compatible mobos, etc. His other friend says he should build for 2k. I'm really not sure what kind of price hit this means in terms of monitor, or processing needs for CPU. 

Any advice? </TEXT>

My friend is looking for something to game on. I may have finally convinced him not to buy a gaming laptop. He's super new to the process, so I feel like I'm baffling him with things like DDR3 vs DDR4, CPU socket types, etc. I want to figure out a good base i5 6600+ build for him to work off of. He's super interested in the new GPUs coming out, so I figured we would wait a month or so and see what options we have. I don't know if he can spring for a 1070, but we'll see what the rest of the build comes out to. I threw in an SSD, because he's not like me; he doesn't find reinstalling an OS to be a fun daytime activity. I want to stick with an IPS display, case isn't listed because he'll want to pick one out online (or I might drag him to Microcenter). Does anyone have input?

	<TEXT> Bought this guy on black friday 2014. Honestly, it's probably exceeded expectations so far - a $200 trash tv should have died sooner. Basically for the last six months or so I've had to power cycle the tv multiple times to get it to power on (it's probably been power cycled over 1,000 times at this point). I'm not sure if it's the tv or the outlets in my house (either I'm getting 82VAC on all my outlets or my meter is broken). At this point it just won't turn on at all. I still get a red standby led, but can't get it to power. I finally caved and popped the shell off to look for distended caps or broken solder. No luck so far. Any thoughts?

	<TEXT> I was thinking... It seems like most of us use wget to hoard massive amounts of data. Personally, I tend to use "-wget -r -np -i Queue.txt", and leave a text document with my download links in the directory. 

I was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about a Chrome extension that would add "Add to queue" to the context menu in Chrome (or Firefox, or whatever). It would save a lot of copy paste, and it seems like a very easy app to build. I have little experience in this field, so any recommendations would be super helpful. </TEXT>

I'm connected with a powerline adapter to a Netgear R7000 (which is in the DMZ of my ISP router, Actiontec mi424wr). UPnP is enabled, PS4 is DMZ'd on the R7000, static IP is set for PS4.

Not sure what is causing this, or what has changed. Does anyone have any ideas?

As I'm posting, I realize now it seems to be getting worse. Now I get error WS-37397-9 when trying to Connect to PSN. The step right before NAT test. Is my network adapter failing or something? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As the title suggests, our fire alarms keep going off in the middle of the night. We have 8 Kidde k12040 alarms on 120v and one on battery only. The battery one goes off at the same time as the others, and they start at the same time. I checked some of the ac connections and standard outlets, and it seems like we're getting just 85v in all our receptacles... Weird. I guess this could cause the ac units to go off, but why is the battery alarm going off too? It seems unlikely that the ones in the downstairs kitchen and hallway would go off at the same time as the ones behind closed doors upstairs. Any have a idea?

	<DATE> 2015-11-10 04:35:04 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I bought a cheap tv last year on black Friday. 40" for $200 seemed reasonable. That being said, after about seven months, the tv stopped turning on. It stays stuck in standby mode. I end up having to reset it between one and fifty times before it will turn on and stay on without problems. I talked to Westinghouse, and their customer service is awful - it would cost more than $100 to fix, and they seem to have decided I don't have a warranty. 
I'm pretty good at repairs for the most part, but I've never worked on a tv before. Does anyone have an idea of where I should start? Or is there like a good irc channel for electronic repairs? Any help is greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Build Help] What should I upgrade? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-17 00:22:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I built a computer about 2 or 3 years ago (with /r/buildapc assistance of course), and I was walking around Microcenter today thinking about updating it. What do you think my weakest link is? 
I just bought a new mouse, keyboard, and external sound card (I like having it external ;D) - [Logitech Hyperion Fury](http://gaming.logitech.com/en-us/product/g402-hyperion-fury-fps-gaming-mouse), [Corsair K70 RGB Brown Switch](http://www.corsair.com/en-us/corsair-gaming-k70-rgb-mechanical-gaming-keyboard-cherry-mx-brown), [Creative Sound Blaster Omni Surround 5.1](http://us.creative.com/p/sound-blaster/sound-blaster-omni-surround-5-1). I'm thinking about new monitors, but my desk fits mine perfectly for now, and that might come later. Otherwise, I was looking at different mobos and possibly a nice cpu cooler. Do you have any recommendations for upgrades?

Of course, now my master boot record is all kinds of screwed up, and I get a GRUB rescue prompt whenever I try to boot up.

	<TITLE> Help with trash Vaio </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-05-30 20:46:28 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys. I found a Vaio in the trash outside of an apartment yesterday. It's a Vaio VPCSA-113T. It seems like a Chinese graduate student tossed it when they went home. It was in a bag with a charger, and seems to be in pretty good condition. However, it will not turn on. I've taken it apart and it doesn't seem to have any damage (blown caps, water damage). I tested the hard drive, and it's working fine. 
The thing that strikes me as odd is the dc jack. It's the usual pin-tube-thing, but the female side of it has two pins instead of the usual doughnut shape. Is this damage? Or is this a difference in Chinese models? (The ac plug is Chinese and requires an adapter)
The adapter is I-100-240V AC 1.5A 50-60Hz ///O-19.5V DC 4.7A. 
Thoughts? Is this fix as hard as buying a new DC jack? Or did I just find myself a brick with a free 750GB hard drive in it? </TEXT>

My Steam directory on my C drive (SSD) is empty and my Steam folder on my F drive (old HDD) says it's corrupted. 
If I boot into windows on the F drive, everything is fine. I tried backing up all of the files on the F drive, but the backup froze up 20 minutes (99%).

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey, I'm a 24 year old male, and I've been bothered by some sort of chronic urticaria for 365 days tomorrow. I have spent the last year breaking out into hives, which are absolutely miserably itchy. When I scratch them, they just itch more, hurt and get worse. I have had them on the back of my scalp every single day since last December, and they spread most often to points of friction (waistline, armpits, elbows, chin) and often my face and hand swell up from them. On rare occasions, my esophagus seems to swell, and I have trouble swallowing (never any difficulty breathing). I have been to my primary care physician, a secondary physician and an allergist. Between the three, I have been told to try to cut out allergens, take nasal steroids year round and "learn to live with it". I'm very frustrated with these answers, and I refuse to believe that I am going to be scratching until I bleed for the rest of my life. I have tried zyrtec, benadryll, fluticasone and prednisone, where the only thing that was effective was the prednisone. Does anyone have a recommendation? I'm seeking a referral to a dermo from my primary next week. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I figured I would update last night, and upon waking this morning (slow download servers), I found that not only was my GPU driver outdated, and my CCC wouldn't run, I could not use my second monitor. I fixed the GPU issue, but the multiple display issue baffles me. The OS treats it as if it's connected, but the monitor itself won't leave sleep mode. I can set it as my primary display, and this lets me move the mouse into the space it is supposed to occupy, but I still get no picture. I've tried setting it to Duplicate/Extend, etc, and gotten nothing. It's an ~17" old Dell flatscreen from like 2008. My primary is a very new 23". I figured maybe Win8.1 changed the signal sent to secondary monitors, but that just wouldn't make sense. Has anyone else had this issue? </TEXT>

I believe this has something to do with cones being concentrated in the center of your eye so you can see color better when focusing, and rods on the outsides so you can identify objects in your periphery to focus on.

Anyway, this trick is extremely useful when trying to find your way back from the bathroom at night. </TEXT>

It's definitely the Windows 8 Action Center, but it's not telling me what the problem is. Here's a shot of the system monitor and system tray.

	<TEXT> So I have a slightly older laptop that has just recently stopped booting XP. I have done everything I can think of to fix it with zero success. First I tried getting it into Safe Mode, but I can't get anything after the BIOS splash. My next attempt was to connect the notebook's HDD to the SATA port on my desktop. This worked, but I did not have read permission to access My Documents, and most of the files I need are in there. I did a chkdsk /r, but it did not help. My hope at this point is to just clone the drive onto a spare I have (assuming the notebook HDD is damaged/wearing out.)

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just built a new computer. I unfortunately did not budget for a new monitor, and I'm having a lot of trouble using my old one. 

Build:
* ASRock Z77 Extreme4 * 8GB Ripjaw Memory * 1TB WD HDD * GIGABYTE GV-R787OC-2GD Radeon HD 7870 GPU * Intel i5-3570 (Stock heatsink for now) * Rosewill Redbone Case * Antec 520W PSU * Ubuntu

So my old monitor is a Dell LCD from about 7 years ago. It only has a VGA connector, so I need to plug it into my mobo, as my gpu does not have a VGA plug. The problem is that the computer seems to default to the GPU HDMI port, as when the GPU is connected, I don't even get to see my BIOS screen. I would like to be able to use the GPU I purchased, but I can't find a way to do it. 
I previously tried changing the BIOS to use the onboard GPU as a default display, and it works fine, but if I plug in my GPU, I get errors telling me it won't work if it's not primary.

	<TEXT> Hey, so I just built myself a new desktop, and it's great. The big problem is that I don't have a wireless adapter for it as of now, and I don't have the extra cash to get one any time soon.
As far as I know, I should be able to connect the desktop to the internet with a network bridge and the wifi card in my laptop.
I set up the bridge on my laptop though (Vostro 1500, XP), and while my desktop (running ubuntu) seems to see me plugging it into the laptop, it doesn't seem to be able to find a connection.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this is kind of a long story, but I am looking for a good way to get a Windows variant on my new desktop. I just spent the summer building it, but did not remember to budget for an OS.
The build is as follows:
* ASRock Z77 Extreme4
* 8GB Ripjaw Memory
* 1TB WD HDD
* GIGABYTE GV-R787OC-2GD Radeon HD 7870 GPU
* Intel i5-3570 (Stock heatsink for now)
* Rosewill Redbone Case
* Antec 520W PSU

I also ripped apart an old HP Notebook and put the 320GB HDD in there, which still has Vista on it.
So now I can boot from the 320GB HDD and run Vista, but it's ridiculously slow. I was thinking of just running a Windows Repair CD, but the fun part is I did not spring for an optical drive. I know this can be done by USB, but I didn't want to commit to it if it isn't going to work. 

So my question is: Can I use a USB Repair Disk to fix Vista? Additionally, I was wondering if I could move Windows to the 1TB HDD without my serial key.

Thanks a ton for any help you can provide! </TEXT>

So far I've only purchased the case and power supply, as I figured those would be the hardest to mess up. I bought the

I found a nice deal on Newegg where I can get the [MSI 990FXA-GD80V2 and the AMD FX-8120 Zambezi 3.1GHz](http://www.newegg.com/Product/ComboDealDetails.aspx?ItemList=Combo.1026665).
Conveniently enough, the deal also comes with [Team Xtreem Dark Series 8GB](http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820313080) free. Even if it's not the best reviewed memory out there, it's free.
I guess what I want to know is whether or not this is a good looking deal, and what to consider for GPUs.
Any help is greatly, greatly appreciated.
Thanks! </TEXT>

Here's the build I've just come up with. I should preface with the fact that I have absolutely no skill or experience at building computers. I am however, very good at building everything else (and taking computers apart), so I am not worried about assembly or anything, just things like bottlenecking. Could someone take the time to look through this build and tell me if everything there is necessary, or at least a good idea? I have spent a few hours doing research, and I'm finally confident enough to post a list, but I really wanted to budget this around $700. All help is extremely appreciated!

EDIT: I live very close to a Microcenter, but I haven't been giving them my custom based on some terrible repair jobs. Would they have any of these parts at better prices? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for a new mouse... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-04-12 01:10:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm looking for a new computer mouse. My cheap retracting-cord color scrolling mouse just died, and I only have a Belkin the size of a lighter. I used to really like the Thanko Silent Mouse, but I don't think it's being made anymore. I would prefer a wired mouse, since I don't like buying batteries, but I'll accept arguments for wireless as well. 
Otherwise, what kind of mouse do you use? I'd like to keep it under 30-40, but I could be swayed for extra programmable buttons or something. </TEXT>

Does anybody know of a good place to buy a broken (screen, gfx card, hdd, whatever) dv5? I would love a chance to frankenstein them together and make one working machine again. I tried ebay, but had no luck. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> (xpost on /r/music was unhelpful) So during my life, I have seen a few music genres come and go, and I realize one thing about it: no matter how little you like it, it's here for the next five years. I generally have a lot of trouble getting into popular music, and that is half me being stubborn, half me knowing virtually nothing of music outside what I listen to. I did have a noise rock phase though, and that's about as closely to dubstep as I've ever appreciated. That being said, I really don't know how to begin with the genre. Can anybody help me approach it? I don't guarantee that I'll like it, I just want to try. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Erratic memory problems and fps dropping. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-03-07 02:26:11 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> For the past few days, my computer has been having trouble with processing things that, a week ago would have caused no problems. Mainly, this is evident when I try to play a game. Games that would run at 25+ fps a week ago, now run consistently at 5-9 fps. I see the problem in web-browsing and file transfers as well.

The weird thing is, once in a while, everything runs smoothly. I'm not sure what that means, but it never lasts long. 

I am running XP SP3 on a Dell Vostro 1500 (I know, it's a piece of garbage), ESET NOD32 Smart Security and occasionally Adaware. I also use CCleaner very regularly. I've tried a few things: safe-mode deep scanning, defragging, uninstalling unused programs, etc. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I figure my graphics card might be the problem, but I don't honestly know how to fix something like that short of buying a new one.

Thanks for your help! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Steep Learning Curve? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-02-29 12:22:43 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Nice to meet you, /r/battlefield3. 
I'm very new to this game, but a veteran to the Battlefield series. I just bought the game (for 360 - sorry gaming master race) and I have been noticing that the learning curve is very steep. I don't mean necessarily that the game is unapproachable, I just mean that as someone who started playing the game four months late, I find I'm rage quitting a lot. 
I know what I'm supposed to be doing, and I know (theoretically) how to do it, I just get stuck somewhere along the way. 
Does anyone else have a history of this? Does anyone want to play a bit online? (I promise I'm not useless) Any tips would be welcome. Thanks! </TEXT>
