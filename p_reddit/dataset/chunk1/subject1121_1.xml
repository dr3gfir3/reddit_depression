	<TEXT> My Girlfriend is looking to purchase a new mouse for work computer, which is some sort of newer iMac I believe. The current apple mouse hurts her hand, so we are looking to purchase a more ergonomic mouse with a budget of ~$60

As for functionality, the only function of the mouse that she is particularly fond of is the mouse's ability to swipe and switch between screens, so ideally we would like something to preserve that function.

Thanks </TEXT>

	<TEXT> For Rogue One, I want to do a different sort of 'Star Wars' Marathon, where I watch films that inspired the movies, rather than the movies themselves.
I already know a few films that should definitly make this list, and was wondering if you guys have any suggestions. So far im at:
1). The Hidden Fortress
2). Original Flash Gordon serials
3). Wings

I know those were all big inspirations to George Lucas, but I don't know about what inspired/informed other directors/writers at the helm. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am going to be driving from California to Wisconsin at the end of the month, and realized I never updated by inspection sticker when I moved from Maine two years ago.  I still have my Maine plates, with up to date registration and insurance. California, to my understanding, doesnt have car inspection the same way Maine does, and has a smog test.  I never got smog tested because...I dont know. never had problems though
my question is
A). Do states enforce out of state inspection stickers being expired?
B). if yes. will a CA smog test be fine, seeing as Maine requires a different sort of inspection
C). Any other road trip related laws I should know about?

thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> How smoothly do various paradox games run? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-06-07 20:26:55 </DATE>

	<TEXT> Hi!
I've been playing a lot of CK2 and have been thinking about checking out some other paradox games.  Here's the catch:  Im using an old netbook (1ghz processor, 2gb ram, idk any other stats off the top of my head).  CK2 runs at maybe half speed with a bunch of graphics turned off (worth it).  its pretty smooth, except for the menus for choosing marriage and save time is long.

Basically, I was wondering, compared to CK2, how smoothly do EU4 and Vicky2 run?  They all seem to have similar system reqs, but if they run less smooth than ck2, but computer might explode.  and that'd be a bummer.

The reason I'm on a netbook is a recent move and an inability to easily get my old desktop out here.  Its also a broken desktop computer, so my motivation to get it out here and fix it is low.  but thats neither here nor there. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi.  I love CK2, but recently moved and won't have access to a working desktop computer for a while.  My only computer is a fairly good netbook, but still...its a netbook.  It should be able to run CK1, but  is it worth it?  Or will I find it frustrating after having played CK2

Alternatively, has anyone been able to run CK2 on low end computers?  I have a 1.0 ghz processor  and 2 gb of ram (though games requiring a little more, such as civ 4, have performed well).  That said, I doubt it will run ck2, which needs like 2.5 ghz to run.

Anyhow.  CK1.  Thoughts?  any good tutorials and such? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently started working at a telefundraising company.  I've done alright, but want to do better.  What is your secret to surviving in telemarketing or telefundraising?

Also if you have any good stories, those would be appreciated.  I recently had an old woman with heart failure who told me that "death could not come soon enough" before agreeing to donate $10 to the charity I was calling for. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi.  I work in the prep kitchen of a restaurant and have a real onion problem.  My eyes seem to be extra sensitive to onions and onion juices, and I cry every time I cut them, which slows down my productivity and is kind of awkward.  How do you deal with cutting onions?  Are there any tricks to stop the tears? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey, just curious where you guys go/went to school for film (for those of you who went) and how you like it.

I'm at Emerson college right now, and I like it. Some equipment shortages and not the hardest grading scale in the world, but upper level film classes are dope.

How about you guys? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Ideal Director for Episode VII </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-01-19 20:09:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We know JJ Abrams said no. Zack Snyder has his own side Star Wars project going on, so he wont be doing VII, Guillermo del Torro said no, Joss Whedon said no, Tarantino said no, the guy who did "Safety not guaranteed" is busy, and Spielberg said no.
I know a few others did but I cant think of them off the top of my head.
That being said, who is your ideal director for Episode VII
Personally I would like to see something from a director who works primarily outside of the action genre (Irvin Kershner did mostly character dramas, George Lucas did star wars right after a teenage comedy). 
I was thinking the Duplas Brothers would have an interesting take, as would Lena Dunham. Both of them work with down to earth dramas that are very rooted in reality and I think both directors understand how people work. And they are young, which is nice.

Anyhow, what are your thoughts
