	<TEXT> The VP of Comcast has been clearly against net neutrality. What do you reason he's doing as the special advisor to the DHC? He cannot give himself that position. And what does he see in Hillary Clinton that he's donated his prestige to raise money for her? </TEXT>

My point is that "Republican" and "Democrat" alone doesn't tell the story of how someone will act because influence is being worked on within both parties. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Be cautious and watch the political deal making more than what a candidate claims. A couple have already lied about their history in a very easy to prove way, such as on the topic of [fracking](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/23/hillary-clinton-fracking/)

Example of deal making: 

The [Vice President of Comcast](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/) has been seen working with Republicans and Democrats.

David Cohen is the **special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee** and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast, overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy.

And despite **hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer,** Cohen has **spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress**, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate. </TEXT>

Similarly, typing Hillary Clinton ind on Yahoo and Bing suggest phrases that link Hillary Clinton to the possibility of being indicted as a result of her email records.

On Google, however, typing Hillary Clinton cri results in suggestions for Hillary Clinton crime reform and Hillary Clinton crisis. Similarly, a search for Hillary Clinton ind brings up suggestions on Hillary Clinton and Indiana, independents and India, and not indictment.

	<TEXT> I'm not a leader with an organized plan, but I can suggest trying to find ways to resist this trend. If these things upset you as much as they upset me, you'll get good feelings from little ways you can resist them.

I try to stay informed   track sources, so that I can show others (online   IRL) exactly what is happening - backed with hard to deny evidence. That's something the Internet currently gives us, e.g., primary source documents on NSA programs, articles about thousands of innocent people being misclassified as terrorists under SKYNET (actual name of program), how the UK government used its censorship powers to hide coverage of Trafigura's waste dumping into drinking water, how money is funneled, and many other stories.

There are countless stories that speak for themselves on why certain things are bad. And I've had success changing people's views from even defending censorship   surveillance to realizing they are abusable powers that have already been abused.

Also as a tiny bit of resistance, I use TOR for almost everything. If I can make marketing and government surveillance a tiny bit harder, I am also doing something better than sitting and feeling dread.

There are organizations that are already combating these trends that we can donate to. They are experts in their own fields, like security or law, unlike most of us. </TEXT>

Meanwhile, ["Forty-One Secret Service Employees Punished For Illegally Accessing Congressman's Private Data In Hopes Of Discrediting Him"](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160604/13455634625/forty-one-secret-service-employees-punished-illegally-accessing-congressmans-private-data-hopes-discrediting-him.shtml)

In all, the conduct of 57 Secret Service personnel was reviewed, including 11 at the SES [Senior Executive Service] level. Of those, 41 are receiving some level of discipline. This discipline includes a letter of reprimand to one individual, suspended discipline contingent on no further misconduct for a period of five years, and suspensions from duty without pay for periods of up to 45 days. The one individual found by the Inspector General to have disclosed the private information to an outside source, the Washington Post, has resigned from the Secret Service.

As is often the case, the employee whose misconduct was the worst slipped out the door before the hammer could come down.

Note what the "punishment" was. Heck, the [first known iteration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_Awareness_Office)* of these modern surveillance programs was started by [Admiral Poindexter](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter) - a man who lied to Congress and got away with it.

	<TEXT> Idk, it seems a lot of comments are dissecting the issue more in depth. E.g., identifying that Schmidt himself has ties to Hillary (using sources) and Google's only tie to Hillary is keeping "crooked hillary Bernie" with the removal of "crooked Hillary" from auto complete.

[Removal of British political speeches](http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/13/conservative-party-archive-speeches-internet)

[Campaign promises from US President](http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2013/07/25/obama-promises-disappear-from-web/) - however it has been said that there was no malicious intent in the promises disappearing, still, the Archive makes it much harder to rewrite political history.

There are many more, but don't have time to dig deeper now. I hope it is already clear to most here that censorship is growing on [a global scale](http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/02/government-censorship-21st-century-internet/385528/), and it is in all of our interests that we have the Archive to retrieve what is removed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Literally every one of those things can be learned by having a conversation with someone

I almost agree. There are things some people say online that they wouldn't say in an conversation because they think they have more privacy behind a pseudonym.

The larger point is that the information can be data-mined for future analyses with rapidly improving algorithms in a booming industry.

Most peoples reddit accounts are just a conglomeration of the things that they like to do. Nothing important.

Well, interests are already marketable data and contribute to building profiles on individuals. Behavioral data, like how you speak, if you upvote articles before reading them, etc are data that can also be mined, extracted, and saved as part of a person's history.

I'm not saying that all of these things are currently being done on reddit - but it can be done and has been done for research purposes and by a very large data company. Surely you've heard a few examples? I don't mind citing them if you want. Like I said, it's a booming industry and examples are easy to find. </TEXT>

I highly recommend you check [this aggregate list of cases](https://stallman.org/facebook.html) where Facebook has quite indeed taken privacy from unsuspecting people. 

Facebook, as an "experiment", collected the text its useds started to enter as status updates and ultimately did not send. 

This page gives details about how much Facebook tracks browsing, which applies even to users that don't have Facebook accounts.

Facebook's tracking of users through cookies combined with Like buttons violates EU law. [note, social media buttons track online browsing simply by loading a page with the button on it]

Facebook asks its useds to provide their entire list of other people's email addresses.

In addition, Facebook secretly collects useds' phone numbers. [the author forgets to cite a source, so [here](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/28/facebook-android-app-phone-numbers_n_3518652.html)]

Facebook's mobile app snoops on SMS messages.[more informative source](http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/28/facebook-reading-android-users-texts-well-hold-on/)

It's a huge reason as to why the company has such a sketch reputation. I think you'll be hardpressed to find many real people who truly trust the company.

The old mods were removed (and they made a huge stink over it) and one of the redditors who revealed this was happening became a moderator here! Amazing story.

Some great [quotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/undelete/comments/1zcqvm/7129932470_verizon_ceo_lowell_mcadam_suggested/cfsq39d) from there too, this one from /u/maxwellhill (the same redditor who also posted this story today):

Other mods (not all) disagreed with such topic or domain being in r/technology. I think it is because it's sort of politics related rather than being purely a technology post or the domain is considered blogspam. I am intrigued as to which subreddit it should be if not r/technology. I doubt if it is suitable for politics... any idea?

I still think such posts are precisely what r/technology is about eg. SOPA, net neutrality, Internet-related posts, privacy issues, NSA etc.

Unfortunately such posts are invariably politically related. If we exclude them we miss out on many interesting discussions in r/technology eg the technology used by NSA to eavesdrop etc. But these are just my own opinions which the other mods would probably disagree with.

	<TEXT> The people you're referring to might be intelligent or educated, but I wouldn't call them informed on this issue. We're all capable of strong biases. Perhaps they've ignored information about the abuses or they just haven't seen a trustworthy source talk about it yet.

	<TEXT> I agree. The source of the Panama Papers talked on your last point in [this article](https://panamapapers.icij.org/20160506-john-doe-statement.html) You might find the rest cathartic to read as I did.

 In Britain, the Tories have been shameless about concealing their own practices involving offshore companies, while Jennifer Shasky Calvery, the director of the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network at the United States Treasury, just announced her resignation to work instead for HSBC, one of the most notorious banks on the planet (not coincidentally headquartered in London). And so the familiar swish of Americas revolving door echoes amidst deafening global silence from thousands of yet-to-be-discovered ultimate beneficial owners who are likely praying that her replacement is equally spineless. In the face of political cowardice, its tempting to yield to defeatism, to argue that the status quo remains fundamentally unchanged, while the Panama Papers are, if nothing else, a glaring symptom of our societys progressively diseased and decaying moral fabric.

But the issue is finally on the table, and that change takes time is no surprise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Another redditor gave term for it: [Regulatory Capture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_capture)

Regulatory capture is a form of government failure that occurs when a regulatory agency, created to act in the public interest, instead advances the commercial or political concerns of special interest groups that dominate the industry or sector it is charged with regulating. When regulatory capture occurs the interests of firms or political groups are prioritised over the interests of the public, leading to a net loss to society as a whole. Government agencies suffering regulatory capture are called "captured agencies".

Recently, some members of the US Copyright Office said some [strange things](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20160517/17541834469/dozen-bad-ideas-that-were-raised-copyright-offices-dmca-roundtables.shtml) even after the EFF sent them an [excellent list of take down abuses](https://www.eff.org/document/eff-512-study-comments) (see page 12 onwards)

Edit: For anyone who doesn't see powerful minority interests influencing both parties, see [my other post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/4l5j1n/gop_pushing_bill_that_guts_fcc_authority_kills/d3kohcp) where I show a Comcast VP literally working inside both parties (among other people) </TEXT>

Thanks for sharing!

Edit: Clarifying to anyone confused, this term isn't directly relevant to the story here except that there are multiple ways a powerful minority are influencing the system. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It doesn't even end there. [From the Intercept](https://theintercept.com/2016/05/11/lobbyists-dnc-2016-convention/). 

1.

**David Cohen is the special adviser to the [Democratic] Host Committee and serves as the executive vice president of Comcast,** overseeing the companys lobbying and regulatory strategy. 

And despite hosting fundraisers for Clinton at his home last summer, Cohen has spent heavily to help elect a Republican Congress, including recent donations to the NRCC; Sen. Toomey; Sen. Scott; Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H.; as well as $33,400 to the NRSC, a committee for helping elect GOP members to the Senate.

2.

The Host Committees finance chair is Daniel Hilferty.

Hilferty has also donated heavily to Republicans this cycle, giving $10,000 to Prosperity for Pennsylvania, a Super PAC supporting the re-election of Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa.; $1,000 to the PAC supporting Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah; $1,000 to Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C.; $2,700 to Chris Christies presidential campaign; $25,300 to the NRCC, a GOP committee designed to re-elect House Republicans; and $2,700 to Jeb Bush. Hilferty also gave $2,700 to Hillary Clintons campaign.

3.

The Philadelphia Host Committee chair, former Gov. Ed Rendell, headed for Wall Street as soon as he left office and has since represented a number of controversial special interests. In 2011, as New York was debating regulations on fracking, Rendell wrote a pro-fracking opinion column in the New York Daily News, while failing to disclose that he was a paid consultant at a private equity firm that had investments in the industry.

That same year, Rendell started providing paid speeches on behalf of the Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK), a fringe Iranian exile group that was considered a terrorist organization by the State Department at the time (it was delisted in 2012).

The former governor also joined the group Fix the Debt  an organization backed by private equity billionaire Pete Peterson that advocates for cutting Social Security benefits  co-chairing its activities alongside Judd Gregg.

And more of us should be paying attention to [AIPAC](https://theintercept.com/2015/11/05/leaked-emails-from-pro-clinton-group-reveal-censorship-of-staff-on-israel-aipac-pandering-warped-militarism/), as their practices seem like a scary threat to self-determination. E.g., donors to the group might succeed in pushing the official future US foreign policy in a particular extreme direction.

Note how in this post, I cited individuals funding Republicans and Democrats. These parties have increasingly represented a powerful minority with deep pockets and connections. </TEXT>

I remember seeing many commenters adamantly defending Cisco's role in selling surveillance equipment to China that was [**advertised** to hunt down a religious minority](https://www.wired.com/2008/05/leaked-cisco-do/)  "that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance" ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong))

See the [brutalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) of these people, such as **"some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008"**

Now contrast that with what commenters here were saying [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/2ao2m9/falun_gong_is_a_qigong_discipline_combining/)

Top comment (and many more below that one): 
I usually see the Falun Gong defended on reddit, or at least given sympathy, when they smuggle notes into handbags/toilet seats etc saying they are being worked to death in Chinese prisons.

For context, the Falun Gong are straight up insane. They are like the Chinese version of Scientology and like everything in China, it's bigger, crazier and completely illogical. They believe all sorts of insane shit - stuff that would make L. Ron Hubbard blush.

They are evil and twisted. They get no sympathy from me.

Historians can easily recount how issues involving taxation and imbalances of power have led to revolutions in ages past. Then, military might was necessary to subjugate peoples, whereas now, curtailing information access is just as effective or more so, since the act is often invisible. Yet we live in a time of inexpensive, limitless digital storage and fast internet connections that transcend national boundaries. It doesnt take much to connect the dots: from start to finish, inception to global media distribution, the next revolution will be digitized. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sometimes it's funny when you put into context exactly what some of these arguments are okaying. Tons of these programs are targeting millions and millions of people, which totally sounds like 'just governments spying on each other duh, we shouldn't be questioning them /s' Congress even shut down a [very similar program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness) under Bush - and the founder of THAT program is none other than the [man who was caught lying to Congress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Poindexter) about [a secret program that WAS illegal and unconstitutional](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair)

Among the tons and tons of things in the Snowden documents, NSA actually weakened security standards that companies use. Most infamously was getting NIST to approve an [obviously weak cryptography algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_EC_DRBG) (many experts knew at the time, but NIST defended their trash), and then **[bribing RSA $10 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_BSAFE) to put it into one of their security products.**

They also [compromised systems at Google and Yahoo,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUSCULAR_%28surveillance_program%29) leeching data from their unwitting users. Officially these companies have denied involvement, which if-true, is another case of the NSA attacking US tech companies. 

[OpticNerve:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optic_Nerve_%28GCHQ%29) " surreptitiously collects private webcam still images from users while they are using a Yahoo! webcam application. As an example of the scale, in one 6-month period, the program is reported to have collected images from 1.8 million Yahoo! user accounts globally."

The NSA also intercepts packages so they can put hardware backdoors into products in shipments, which has [absolutely tarnished](https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140523/18092027352/ups-insists-that-it-is-not-helping-nsa-interdict-packages-to-install-backdoors.shtml) the reputation of sellout corporations like Cisco who once enjoyed selling surveillance equipment to China (see what [role](http://www.wired.com/2008/05/leaked-cisco-do/) they played in [brutalizing these people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) in China.) </TEXT>
