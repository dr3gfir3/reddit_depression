	<TEXT> Ritalin doesn't build up like some other meds do.  It either turns on a light bulb or it doesn't.  It may be helping in subtle ways you don't notice yet (in which case staying on it will help you cope better), but it's very possible you need a bigger dosage. Call your psychiatrist's office and ask what they think. 

The single most annoying part of medication for ADHD is that it's trial and error.  Concerta or OG Ritalin (or, who knows? Adderall?) may also help better--everyone's different. You might not know what works for you until you've tried a few different things. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is on the doorway of the Meijer (Grocery/merch store like Wal-Mart without most of the suckage) store at 1997 East Beltline NE in Grand Rapids, MI.

All I've been able to find is it has something to do with a public TV series in the Netherlands about the labor movement over there. This area has a strong but traditionally conservative/anti-labor Dutch population, and the Meijer chain was started about 20 miles from this point by a member of that community during the Depression (there are maybe three Meijers closer to the actual birthplace), but beyond that I can't find any connection at all. No one I've talked to at the store knows a thing about it.  

Anyone additional information would be much appreciated. </TEXT>

- The Bissell Pavilion at the top of the hill/end of the funicular at the zoo is a much less creeper-ish option and it offers a similar view.

- Belknap park, natch.

- This is a weird one: the parking lot of the Showcase Cinemas on Alpine is a good spot for this too.

	<TEXT> It's...complicated. Taste isn't a factor so much as aversion to food is.  I seem to remember^[citation ^needed] that appetite suppression has been linked to the patient's genetics, so YMMV. This stuff is used to treat eating disorders, though, so that gives you an idea of how powerful it is in this respect.

The effect only lasts so long as you are actually on the meds, so breakfast (and probably dinner) shouldn't be affected at all.  Methylphenidate already has a rough comedown, though, and low blood sugar makes it much worse, so it's not a good idea to let yourself have two meals.

Speaking personally: sometimes it's a simple matter of the MPD turning my focus into a freight train that barrels right past the feeding cue station and does not want to stop.  It honestly doesn't occur to me to eat, and I receive none of the classic hunger cues from my body except for my blood sugar inevitably crashing.  

SOMETIMES though it causes revulsion to the thought of food. I liken it to that feeling you get when you've eaten too much and someone offers you more food.  My body finds it hard to *believe* that it could need sustenance, and my brain doesn't appreciate being taken off hyperfocus mode to do something it doesn't think it needs to do.  

Pushing past this can be tricky but there are always things I can find that my body will be OK with.  I'm not a picky eater, but MPD makes me one.  Little snacks help but it's better to bite the bullet and eat a full meal on schedule.  I also have unrelated colitis, so this may be a factor in my case.

Honestly, the comedown from MPD is the biggest problem for me.  I turn into a big bearded diva if I'm not careful, so I NEED to remember to have lunch. This will seem unmanageable at first but go easy on yourself in the late afternoon (taking a 5 mg ritalin at around 2:30 also helps soften the down curve for some), and it will subside after awhile

Was the doctor putting you on *both* atomoxetine and MPD though?  As I said Strattera would be the bigger concern for me with the things you listed.

PS: Yeah, people can negative about this med.  I keep coming back to it though, and recently went back on after 2-3 years without anything.  People have cause to be negative about all of the meds, though.  Nothing is going to be 100% take-the-good-leave-the-bad.  It's a matter of finding what works best for you.  Adderall, for instance, is not something I want to touch ever again.  Other people on this sub will tell you the opposite, but that's just what works for our individual brains. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Obligatory disclaimer: Everyone reacts differently, and side effects scale with dosage.

I went on the stuff when it came out, went back and forth over the years trying many other meds and no medication, and here I am back on the 54. It's the devil I know at this point.

The lack of appetite is likely going to be the big one for you.  I've never really found balance beyond remembering to eat on schedule as if it were a chore. The good news is this only happens when you are on a dose.  Note also I am on a high dose, and it's not really a problem for me at lower doses.

As for sleep, I haven't had a problem with that since high school-just do your best to stay on a routine. Avoid caffeine. Seriously, don't even cheat a little. It will mess with the efficacy anyway.

No version of methylphenidate has ever done anything noteworthy with my BP, and honestly I wouldn't worry one bit about exercising on it. 

Strattera, on the other hand, makes me sweat like I'm melting. I thought you should know this happens to a lot of people.

	<TEXT> WARNING:long.

I have to weigh in on "show them how to X *instead of medicating them*."  One of the cornerstones of something being a medical disorder instead of a habit is maladaptivity--medically, CAN'T ADAPT.  As in, no amount of applying head to wall is going to create a hole. 

Medication is supposed to help with this by, among other things, helping the person cope with exactly the same frustration/inability to relax that you describe--something they may have a drastically reduced ability to do for themselves until something is there to help them do it first.

You are advocating an authoritative approach to teaching coping mechanisms.  This is great.  If it could replace medication, don't you think doctors would be prescribing a lot less?  No one really likes giving kids these side effects.

I've never met a good doctor that says that medication is the only solution.  But for some ADHD patients it is absolutely the foundation of the solution, and it's a bit dangerous to say otherwise.

I don't like meds. Let me be clear on that.  I've been on most of them, hated 90% of it, and would rather never see a pill again.  I get why people are reluctant to give this stuff to their kids.  But I've become a published expert on the disorder in my twenty-four years of being treated for it, and some days I know I need a Concerta in the morning, and I'm damn glad my parents knew it too.

I'm commenting because I've experienced way too many people who think ADHD can be taught away, and frankly that's a pet peeve of mine because it feeds into something horrifying: many parents have trouble accepting that ADHD (and a probable need for medication to allay it) is a part of who their child is, and therefore have trouble accepting their child for who s/he is before the ADHD is 'fixed.'  I'm not suggesting this is anywhere near where you are coming from, but anti-medication stigma and "learning not to be disabled" are big parts of what enable people to think that way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Vibranium in the comics](http://marvel-movies.wikia.com/wiki/Vibranium) comes from Wakanda, and they aren't keen on sharing it. In Cap 1 Howard Stark says that the shield is made from all of the stuff they have found, and that of course gets iced with Cap. Stark apparently worked on synthesizing it and couldn't, so he hid his notes for Tony to try again once technology was sufficiently advanced. Also note that it isn't explicitly stated in screen that the element was Vibranium, though apparently it was in the novelization.

	<TEXT> I admit this is a weird thought and it's certainly not going to show you the beauty in things (at least not in any conventional sense), but going through a depressive episode myself and I happened to pick up Slaughterhouse Five the day I lost my job.  In terms of granting perspective I found it very therapeutic. 

If you were looking for something more uplifting, though, I second /u/enoculous above.  Bryson does a great job of hammering home just how special our very existence is. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As with everything, the insurance company will only pay for so much, but usually that's enough.  The key word above is BMW.  Dealership/body shop labor costs typically bump the ceiling of what an insurance company is willing to pay (most dealers farm it out to a glass company whose labor rates are acceptable though), and premium shops smash right through it with their insistence on use of OEM parts sourced through their own supplier with their own markups. 

I've had more than one BMW shop rep flat-out tell my insured right in front of me that I was trying to screw him/her--This while quoting a $2000 price for the part when I was looking right at the NAGS list and it said $4-500.  

A lot of high-end places won't even go through insurance channels because they don't expect to come to any reconciliation on price.  Doesn't mean the insurance company isn't going to fully pay for the family glass company down the street to install a quality windshield and back it to the hilt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't know where you are of course  OP, but California law states that an insurance company has to replace parts with ones of equal or greater value, OEM or not.
 Thanks in part to common law (and a dozen or so regulations) this means most windshields available through insurance in the US are of close enough quality that no one cares about depreciation unless they're dealing with a snooty premium dealership who thinks every part of the car should be treated like an organic grass-feed golden goose pooped it out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't think of an (North American) insurance company that would change a person's rates after one windshield replacement. Most allow one or two a year per vehicle before they raise an eyebrow. Also if the shop happens to be network, the insured gets a lifetime warranty on most cases. This is maybe the one one situation where I advise people to claim it without a second thought. </TEXT>

I'd guess any incompatibility is a digital version vs. hard copy thing rather than a Plus/non Plus thing. [Here is a CAG thread](http://www.cheapassgamer.com/topic/302105-retail-to-digital-save-compatibility-list-for-retail-games-on-psn/) listing most or all of the games that should work if so.

	<TEXT> Try to think about this medically. A psychiatrist is a medical doctor who treats disorders of the brain. Being a neurological disorder, ADHD fits the bill for that. Medically speaking you're visiting a specialist just as you would if you needed a consult with a hand surgeon after a car accident. This is not, NOT about being crazy or emotionally disturbed. Banish that thought from your mind. There is hard medical science behind the diagnosis and treatment of this disorder and they aren't going to toss antidepressants or what-have-you at you without a good medical reason.

That said some antidepressants are used in treatment of certain types of ADHD, and there's nothing wrong with taking them. There's a lot of stigma surrounding psychiatry and psychopharmacology and for the most part, as you are expanding firsthand, that's all hurtful bullshit to those thinking they may need help from meds. It's just medicine. You aren't any less of a person on Ritalin or strattera than someone with myopia would be wearing glasses.

Most importantly, though, share your concerns with your psychiatrist and be honest and upfront with him or her. This person's job is to help you, and they need you to be open with them for them to do their job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Recently retired my old HTC G2 for T-Mobile's LTE version of the Galaxy S3. It was the most economical upgrade available to me (wanted an HTC One tbh), and i  have to say I was expecting more positives out of the upgrade. 

I love the screen, the speed, the camera, even many of the tacked-on features of Samsung's rendition of Jelly Bean (as compared with my Nexus 7), but I could swear sound fidelity over earphones is nowhere near as good in the low range and after the aluminum-lined tank that my old phone was I feel like this thing is going to snap in half in my hand. Also, the G2 ran two days on a charge under normal use. Yeah. </TEXT>
