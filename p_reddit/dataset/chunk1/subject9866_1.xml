	<TEXT> A little back story necessary for the engagement story:

When we first started dating we went bowling with a group of friends. He bought me a silly zebra striped acrylic ring from a vending machine. I promptly lost it a week later. Thus began a 5 year joke of "How can I buy you a real ring if you can't even hold onto a 25 cent ring?"

It was the weekend before Christmas and my then boyfriend and I were exchanging early Christmas gifts to avoid dragging presents to another state.

He provides me with my final gift. It's a small red box, filled with acrylic rings in plastic bubbles. My eyes tear up and I say "I can't believe this is still a joke. You're ridiculous. He says I should put them all on, so I begin opening bubbles and putting on a dozen or so rings, laughing the entire time.

He then says I missed a bubble. I look down and he must have snuck in one more. Inside it is not an acrylic ring, but a diamond engagement ring.

I start crying. He squeezes me hand and asks the big question.

/r/ISaidYes

Bonus: He couldn't get the right amount of plastic bubbles to put the rings in (which came from Amazon) so he went to the local grocery store and with the help of a little kid who was there with his mother, proceeded to get a dozen or so toys out of the machine. He gave the toys to the kid and kept the plastic bubbles. </TEXT>
