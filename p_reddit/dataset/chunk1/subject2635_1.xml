	<TEXT> Our concept of justice seems to differ by society and era. Different concepts appear to center around rehabilitation, or vengeance, or deterrence, or any number of other philosophies.

What is the philosophy behind the justice system in your era and area of expertise? For example, were problems brought to the Chief who unilaterally determined the repercussions? What did they do with offenders, especially repeat offenders and those who acted contrary to the needs of the society? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I got it- the flu. I tried to deny it, but my body seems to disagree with me on it. As a result, I've hardly eaten anything since the day before yesterday; like literally almost nothing. I've been working on bulk, and making good progress there, and been seeing some encouraging muscle development.

I always hear that when you don't eat, your body might start eating the muscle. If I'm not eating much, but moving as little as possible, am I going to lose anything?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> As we all know, Walmart employees are threatening to strike on Black Friday unless working conditions improve. Of course, Walmart stands to lose a lot of money and would have difficulty hiring replacements in that amount of time. Walmart also wouldn't want to face the PR nightmare that massive layoffs before the holidays would bring. Is it possible that they might keep their employees through the profitable holiday season, then quietly lay them off once it's over? There would be some outrage, of course, but not nearly as much as if it was before the holidays- customers would likely sympathize with the employees and would be angered by the impact to their shopping. Is it pessimistic or realistic to think that Walmart will merely placate their employees while it's financially beneficial?   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is killing me; I saw a video of this guy and would like to see the rest. He was doing stand-up, and it looked like some sort of special. He had red hair and I think facial hair (it wasn't Louis CK). He was doing a bit about parenting, and then said he likes to tell his friends with kids that he'd be a great parent because he has a dog and watch their reaction.

Then he moved into how he didn't realize that his dog was feeding off his rage; that he'd be yelling at the football game on TV, not realizing that his dog was in the corner chewing the hell out of his bone and "agreeing" with him. He was talking about taking his dog to the trainer, who told him that by racing the dog up the stairs and wrestling with it everyday, he was teaching him to take the high ground and fight for it every day, and then about going on walks with the dog.

I know that's not a lot to go on... any one know who this is?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More than anything, I want to formally adopt my 13 year old step-son; I've been in his life since he was two, and both of us see our relationship as father and son. My wife (his birth mother) wants this as well, and the birth father willingly gave up all parental rights (which is a moot point, since he meets the criteria for abandonment anyways).

Last I looked into it, there was a very high cost to do so, and home visits to schedule... Since everyone wants the same thing, is there a less expensive way to get this done? Has anyone ever done this?

Note: I'm not requesting legal advice; anything anecdotal would be swell. Also, anyone's experiences with the process would be very enlightening!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've read the FAQ, and I'm confused on one small point regarding the relationship between Total Daily Energy Expenditure and my fitness goals.

The FAQ says that one should adjust their caloric intake relative to their goals- take in more calories than your daily "allowance" to build muscle, and reduce the intake to lose fat- by up to 500 calories on either side. 

My goal is to gain mass (which seems to require that I increase my caloric intake), but I have a little bit of a gut left that I don't want to add to. How do I build mass while losing body fat?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We're likely all aware of [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk0aqyMltRA feature=related) 911 recording, where 17 year old Jake Evans calls 911 to confess to killing his mother and sister. I was amazed at how calm and collected the operator was, and how she was able to put aside anything that she was feeling and focus on keeping the kid alive and diffusing a potentially dangerous situation before the police arrived. 

911 operators of reddit, have you ever been in a similar situation?

1. What was the nature of the crime?
2. What were you thinking while they were telling you what they had done?
3. Were they still a danger to themselves or others?
4. How did you keep them talking or diffuse the situation?
5. How did things end up, if you know?

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Years ago, I worked at a gas station that also had a car wash. The prices were fairly reasonable, the cheapest was $4.99. An older gentlemen came in complaining about the prices, and completed his rant with "Well, I could just go downtown and get a handjob for that much!"

I was a well-trained, professional gas station attendant and managed to keep a straight face after well, at least until he left.

When have you had to keep a straight face against insurmountable odds?

Edit: he had clarified that he meant a "hand car wash" when he remembered the name of the place. A handjob in that town would have been at least a dollar more. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-08-10 20:17:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Biology / Sports Science question:

The 10k Olympic swim event is on, and I was wondering how the athletes can continue to exert themselves without "refueling". You see runners and cyclists carrying food and water with them, because the body (AFAIK) simply can't store that much fuel; and the swimmers are slim enough that I can't see the body storing enough for the entire race.

Runners, cyclists- they stop to eat/drink or do it in-stride... how do swimmers condition their body to work so hard and so long without food or drink?

EDIT: Further on in the race, I saw the answer: they have water (with additives, maybe) lowered to them while they race and they backstroke while consuming it. TIL. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> step-parents of Reddit; have any of you adopted your step-kids? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-08-04 19:44:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a step-son (13) that I love more than anything- he's an awesome kid, and I've been in his life since he was 2. I consider him to be my "real" son, but I understand the legalities and would really love to formally adopt him. His birth father is in jail for murder, and has already waived his parental rights. My wife agrees with the adoption, too. 

Have any step-parents of reddit done this, preferably in California? Are there any emotions that I/He needs to be prepared for? How can it be done quickly and without too great a cost? Any thoughts or ideas would be very appreciated.

Note: I'm NOT asking for legal advice (per the rules)- I'm asking for personal experiences. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I understand that a manned trip to Mars is in the planning phase. How long will it take to get there, and how will our astronauts store enough water for the trip, exploration and the return?

Will the VASIMR rocket technology be mature enough by that time to reduce the travel time to only 40 days each way? If so, I assume there would be less of a requirement, but that still seems like a lot.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've always had trouble understanding this one. How do you legally use product names or companies in fiction? If I'm writing a story, can a character legally "tweet" something? 

My confusion comes from what you see on TV, when someone might not use chirper to send a brief "chirp" to their friends, while enjoying a refreshing Dr. Popper drink and waiting for their Pizza Tent delivery to arrive. 

How could you reference products in works of fiction without being sued or going for wacky names?

	<TITLE> World hunger (including in your home country)... what can be done about it? [X-Post from Askreddit) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2012-07-18 17:21:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ask reddit came up with some good thoughts, but I realized THIS sub is a concentrated group of people with good hearts and great ideas.

I'm working on a personal project, and it includes coming up with an exhaustive list of what can be done about hunger, both foreign and domestic. This affects nearly 1 BILLION people to greater or lesser degrees (per worldhunger.org), so it's a significant issue.

What is the average person able to do about it? Big or small, what could -I- do?

I've thought of the following:

1. playing freerice
2. donating to one or more of the many fine hunger-related charities
3. donate to a soup kitchen / food bank
4. volunteer at a soup kitchen / food bank
5. urge your nation to keep their promise from the [Monterrey Summit](http://www.poverty.com/internationalaid.html)

Can reddit think of anything specific that could be done by citizens, rather than waiting for the government to do something? 

I appreciate any ideas.

	<TEXT> From reading the accounts of war refugees, I've been very interested in the stories of those that have had to flee or go into hiding. I'd appreciate hearing the perspectives from anyone that's been forced into hiding or has been a refugee. 

1. How old were you?

2. What were you hiding from? What would have happened if you were caught?

3. What measures did you take to stay hidden? If you were hiding "in plain sight", how did you handle those around you?

4. What did you to to entertain yourself or stay busy?

5. Assuming you're no longer in hiding, what ended up happening?

Thanks! </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2012-06-26 17:32:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I enjoy talking with my kids (7 and 13) about history, especially when they're able to realize that there's something "more" than they're learning in school. For example, my oldest was under the impression that we won the revolutionary war because, hey, we're freakin' awesome! He was surprised to learn about how the hessians had canceled their routine patrols due to weather and the role that the french navy played at yorktown. For a bonus, we discussed how the vilified Benedict Arnold nullified the British fleet at Valcour Bay.

It's not that I believe that the schools are failing to teach appropriately, but I do recognize that the teachers have a limited amount of time to cover a great deal of information- so it becomes the role of the parent to supplement their child's education with details and to instill a love for learning. What other commonly taught facts about history could be supplemented in such a way (or, in other words, "what's your neatest, most coolest history nugget??") </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm in over my head here, and I have to put something together for my boss. Hoping one of my smarter-than-me redditor friends can help me come up with something.

I need to create a form that integrates with outlook 2007 to enable document staffing. Essentially, the user (there would be several, so finding out how to integrate it into outlook is another challenge) would be able to select "New" then "Staffing" from the menu to use the form. Then, the user would attach the document for staffing and select the recipients (like with checkboxes, which are linked to email groups). The user would also be able to add information, select a due date, add a POC and use a checkbox to show the recipient what to do (sign, review, etc).

Then the recipient would be able to select concur, concur with comments or non-concur with comments, much like the built-in voting buttons that outlook already has. 

I'm aware that you can create or edit forms and add them to the default list, but I'm not sure how. I was trying to base it on the meeting request template so I could see who's received it and their status, but it no workie.

Any tips or, ideally, already published forms?

	<TEXT> I think I found the Hadith that I was asking about earlier, but I'm afraid I don't really understand it. Could someone help explain what it means? It is saying that an action with a good intent is a good act?

I heard the Messenger of Allah:
The actions are Innama (only, certainty) tied to the intentions and every person will earn that which he intended. Therefore, he whose migration was for Allah and His Messenger (sallallahu alaihi wa-sallam), then his migration will be for Allah and His Messenger; and he whose migration was to achieve some worldly gain or to take a woman in marriage, then his migration will be for that for which he migrated.

which I found at http://ahya.tripod.com/niyah.html. But I don't understand what it means. Could you please help educate me on this?  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 6 easy, effective things you can do TODAY to combat hunger  </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-11-21 18:01:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> World hunger often seems like an insurmountable problem. But there are several things that you can do today in order to help make a difference. With enough people making a contribution, we can have an impact.

1. Play freerice (www.freerice.com). This quiz game donates ten grains of rice for every right answer through the UN food program. To date, millions of people have been fed through this game.

2. Urge your government to keep their promise. In 2000, all 189 countries of United Nations agreed to spare no effort to free our fellow men, women and children from the abject and dehumanizing conditions of extreme poverty, to include hunger. This was followed by the 2002 Monterey Conference, in which the wealthiest 22 nations agreed to a certain level of international aid. See how your country stacks up [here](http://www.poverty.com/internationalaid.html) - only five have met their goal. Don't like it? Send a [letter](http://www.poverty.com/printletter.html) to your government.

3. Join a regional outreach effort. More likely than not, hunger exists in your community or the surrounding area. The hungry are not always holding a sign near the freeway- they're also the working poor that recently suffered from layoffs, or the single parent trying to make ends meet. Fortunately, your area has groups like food banks, the Salvation Army and other specialized efforts. You just need to find them!

4. Donate to the World Food Program. If you're able, a donation to the WFP goes a long way; the program has a [wall of recognition](http://wall.wfp.org/) for those that participate.

5. Encourage education. The WFP maintains [lesson plans and study guides](http://www.wfp.org/students-and-teachers) to help teachers effectively address the problem with students.

6. Encourage involvement through your place of worship, community group or friends. If they get involved in combating hunger as well, there will be a greater impact. There's power in numbers! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> 10 quotes about world hunger
 </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2011-11-20 21:09:53 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> "If you desire peace, cultivate justice, but at the same time cultivate the fields to produce more bread; otherwise there will be no peace."
-Norman Borlaug

"There's enough food to feed everyone on this planet twice over, why, why, why are people going hungry?"
-Harry Chapin 

"If we can conquer space, we can conquer childhood hunger."
-Buzz Aldrin

"Peace can only last where human rights are respected, where the people are fed, and where individuals and nations are free."
-14th Dalai Lama

"It is important for people to realize that we can make progress against world hunger, that world hunger is not hopeless. The worst enemy is apathy."
-Reverend David Beckmann 

"School feeding not only fills stomachs, but has a proven track record of boosting enrollment, attendance and academic performance. For just pennies a day per child, this program changes lives  and ultimately can impact the futures of poor countries around the world in a profound way."
-Drew Barrymore

"When you give food to the poor, they call you a saint. When you ask why the poor have no food, they call you a communist."
-Archbishop Helder Camara

"35 million people in the U.S. are hungry or don't know where their next meal is coming from, and 13 million of them are children. If another country were doing this to our children, we'd be at war."
-Jeff Bridges

"Most of our citizenry believes that hunger only affects people who are lazy or people who are just looking for a handout, people who dont' want to work, but, sadly, that is not true. Over one-third of our hungry people are innocent children who are members of households that simply cannot provide enough food or proper nutrition. And to think of the elderly suffering from malnutrition is just too hard for most of us. Unlike Third World nations, in our country the problem is not having too little  it is about not caring enough! Write your elected representatives and promote support for the hungry."
-Erin Brockovich

"If we are going to stop wars on this earth, we are going to have to make war on hunger our number one priority."
-David W. Brooks, member, Presidential Commission on World Hunger

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I feel very strongly about the problem of world / domestic hunger, and am working on a new subreddit for that cause. In order to highlight the human side of this issue, I would really like to be able to AMA someone that is suffering from acute hunger or starvation. 

This would be someone that involuntarily consumes much less than the required ~2100 calories a day and faces undernourishment. 

EDIT: I didn't, but should have, included people that at one time suffered from acute hunger or starvation, but do not any longer. </TEXT>
