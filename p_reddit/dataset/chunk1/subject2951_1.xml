It looks like your father was quite well aware of your uncle's abuses, but for some reason seems to care more about what people think by covering things up and bullying you into lying about it. It's hard as fuck, but it seems like you need to turn your back on them and stick with your sister. Abusers have a horrible way of making us feel small and insignificant, and you do NOT have to take that from anyone.  </TEXT>

I once tried to contact my half brother because I wanted to know if he would be open to communication, and he just ignored me. Just like his father I guess. It would have meant the world to me for him to have even said hello but I didn't get that. It's worth noting I once tried to contact my father to see if we could ever have a relationship, and he told me to go away. So yeah. I know how this goes.

	<TEXT> Oh boy. Yeah that's a real let down. I see other people asking if he's likely to have something planned for later, but I get the impression that's not really his style? 

You're not overreacting, your reaction is totally valid since he seems to have issues with communication and made a promise he can't deliver. The crux here is that he made you a promise that both of you probably knew he couldn't deliver. He shouldn't have made it, and you (knowing that he was bad at this) shouldn't have expected him to be able to do it. The problem is that peoples' behaviours don't change unless they actively make efforts to change them. It sounds like his therapy needs kicking up a notch, or you both need to realise this isn't going to be forever.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Your mother's behaviours seem like response behaviours to existing in an environment where she's been heavily controlled. You mentioned hoarding and her obsession with your making your bed, and the barrage of phone calls etc. I get the impression that OCD might be a factor here which can be very hard to rein in. Asking someone with OCD not to compulse, is like asking them to stop breathing. It doesn't work (My background is psychology).  

You've basically got two choices here, 1.) move out and talk to her about some therapy that can help her get a hold of her control issues. 2.) stay home and talk to her about therapy to sort out her control issues. For your sanity I would recommend the first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay let's look at things from another viewpoint. If her parents have raised her this way, it might be all she's ever known. It doesn't matter if she's seen other places that are clean and tidy, but kids follow the behaviours of their parents. If that's the environment she was raised in, that's the environment she's going to be used to. Take her out of it, show her what clean and tidy looks like and show her how to achieve it. If you love her, tell her you love her and tell her you want to help her. 

You also need to remember that there might be other issues at play. If anyone in her family is suffering with any kind of depression, then that can have an enormous effect on being able to keep things clean and healthy. There are a lot of outside factors that could be causing that level of squalor, but feel them out first before you do anything. I lived with someone like this for a while and he was just a lazy shitbag, but don't write her off until you know for sure.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know how that goes sweetheart. You can't breathe without your whole chest feeling like it's going to collapse. Eating and drinking is impossible because your stomach is in such a knot that you'd vomit if you tried. This is the worst part. You have to ride it out. If you want to cry, then cry. Sob it out. It's going to take some time and it's going to hurt for a while, but you can get there. Sip iced water regularly although I know you won't want to. It's hard to see past any of this right now, so don't even try. Focus on what you need to do to get through small blocks of time.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Whatever you decide to do, you need to be careful about it. Reading between the lines, this seems that you have a lot of feelings for him that whilst you commend him for being supportive and wonderful, you also seem to want to figure out a way to put him in your social circle. The gifts you've gotten for him and your desire to do that, look a lot like you have feelings for him that go beyond just wanting friendship. Be cautious.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Men have meaningless sex all the time sweetie, it's what they do. It sounds like both of you are under pressure from your parents and there are your insecurities that you need to work on, along with your temper. He might be scared of you. There are a lot of what ifs. If he can't make up his mind about things, you need to make up your mind for yourself. It's hard to get past that horrible gut wrenching sick feeling you get when you break up with someone, but you can't let that do the thinking for you. 

We are all capable of platonic friendships with the opposite sex, but you need to stop getting angry about his business partner. If he can't handle being with you because of insecurities and pressure from parents then you're just going to have to let him go. Take things five minutes at a time. It's hard to see past heartbreak when every fibre of your being hurts, but you CAN do it.  </TEXT>
