	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This post comes out of a fiery/friendly discussion about diplo, mainly, that 'theres no one makes music anything like him'...yu huh.

and so


Diplo wasn't always major lazer, and he didn't always have that style of music. In fact, i'm pretty sure i can trace the time he changed his style to when he joined Dimmaks european tour, i think late 00's. The tour was all about Crookers, who really broke out at that time. (I can testify, the shows were intense, electro was huge at the time and crookers were at the extreme/noisy end of that spectrum) After that, he worked seperately with phra and bot (crookers), released some remixes and at the same time, started the whole major lazer thing with Switch. 


But anyway. Details aren't whats on my mind. Its insane tracks like this that are. Stuff like this simply wouldn't get played out nowdays. (unless it had a diplo co-prod on it....)

and from their later Dr Gonzo record

I urge everyone to go listen to the whole of 'Tons of friends' and 'Dr Gonzo' records. Loud.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've seen a few threads saying how its good that the show hasn't really spoiled any of the future books, because the stories are so different. But, WHAT?! I would say its the worst possible situation. We are left in a position where we don't know if what's happened in the show is a spoiler or not.



From the Shireen burning, to the battle, to Stannis, to Myrcella even to whats happening at the wall and in Meereen. Basically, its worse because i don't know how pissed i should be. At the show and the books.  There's already enough implied spoilers this series merely by the absence of certain characters. I just really hope TWOW is out before the next series. For the love of Rhllor George, save us from the show, please. </TEXT>

With no set up i guess the show isnt going with the ghost warg as is likely in the books, but instead did a insanely lazy piece of writing to get mel back to castle black. 


Can i just underline the facts jons last words were Olly. .... .. fuck you D D. Stop bullshitting about not having long enough to fit storylines in, when you create characters and shitty stories to go with.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However shocking the Baratheon family bbq was, more shocking for me was the fact Daario not only survived but wasn't revealed as working with the sons of the harpy. 


Book and show wise i was convinced, and yes maybe there is a chance that he still is in with them, but surely its less likely. So its not Daario and not Hizdhar, who the hell is it?!



That scene also may have introduced the pale mare. I was wondering if and when the flux/pale mare would get into meereen but now its inside the walls in the form of Jorah. So bookwise, i suppose with all the build up and paragraphs about the disease a pay off is expected, so with a casualty in her inner circle? I know its dangerous to apply show logic to the books, but if they are heading in the same direction? .....

Dany stole them and they are still the biggest waste of money of all time. I know bookwise its different, a million miles away. But Seriously wtf. They are useless against peasants with daggers. And don't give me the crap that its not what they are trained for. They are soldiers but somehow forget everything, no, the only thing, theyve been taught their whole lives?!

[the pit] (http://share.gifyoutube.com/y0zRjz.gif)


Seriously tho, the impact that it had in the book will be lost on screen. I imagine it will be far more concerned with how the fight scenes play out, which is ok i suppose, as its a visual medium after all. However, show watchers will miss out on what a release Drogon was. 



After the long slog of Meereen, Dany being manipulated more and more, losing power, losing herself. She was lost in Meereen, was basically forced into marriage, had to re-open the pits. She was almost powerless in her own city. 
The tension was so high reading that chapter, we all knew something was going to happen. Tyrion possibly meeting her, Strong Belwas dinner problems, will Daario show, Yunkai ready for war. And then boom, Drogon is back. And as everyone runs or trys to kill him, Danys running towards him. Her saviour. 


**"to touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow."**




And off she goes.



None of that tension exists on screen. And it will suffer for it. But still, Drogon. He's back, finally! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Is his involvement in the crowns current financial situation.


This has been talked about a lot on the forums in regards to the book at least, where its more apparent that he's been up to something. But its unclear what exactly. I hope, as Mace and MerrynfckinTrant are in Braavos for a meeting with the bank, more of the realms financial situation will be brought to light, which should also include what LF has been upto.

LFs shrewd financial skills gets discussed a lot, i think on the show, he's praised for it. I'm sure Tyrion gives a line about "making money out of thin air". Which is why a lot of people think he's upto something. Preston Jacobs has done a few vids on the LF debt scheme, which i think has a lot in it. As the show seems to simplify everything, maybe during this meeting something will be revealed along those lines.


LF is pretty much my favourite character, and in the book at least, i'm desperate to know HOW MUCH of a sneaky genius he is.

It makes no sense to be lancel, but i'm not sure that would stop D D. I've heard speculation on Gendry, but really? Not seeing or speaking about him for so long then just to have him back, oh yeah btw no one knows who i am, but i have a claim to the throne? hmmm another stretch.


I don't know. I'm thinking of powerful eligible young bachelors and two come to mind. Robin and Trystane. But how they could effect things in kingslanding is another thing. I would love to see young robin ride back into town, older and fight ready, but if that happens, surely he would be headed for winterfell. As for Trystane, well, i don't know. I'm struggling. Ideas? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was so disappointed with this scene. It was such great writing in the book that it was almost impossible to mess up on screen. But no, they found a way.

Seriously, why no 'fetch me a block'? The suspense when he sends him to be hanged, only to stop, equaling huge suspense after hours of reading for this pay off, then bam. 

I will not hang him, said Jon. Bring him here.
The smile that Lord Janos Slynt smiled then had all the sweetness of rancid butter. Until Jon said, Edd, fetch me a block, and unsheathed Longclaw. 

I just. Like. Seriously? Why mess with that scene. wtf are you doing. You've re-written a scene to make it worse. Why?! 


At least the nod was there. Altho even the editing on that was sloppy. ...

	<TITLE> (Spoilers All) As Sophie Turner is hype queen atm, a little thought on Sansa </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-20 20:19:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A thought struck me at how show Sansa might 'die'. Wishful thinking ahead.

I stated in a previous post that i think Sansa is doomed, a pawn, 
who will think shes getting somewhere, before 'exiting' the show. A lot of readers seem place hope in her that she will somehow manipulate her way up the ladder, and i think at least show wise, it will seem this way, less so in the book. But i think LF and Sansa will become a bit of a duo onscreen.

So anyway, the hypequeen herself has previously said she has a 'traumatic scene' and the latest 'slip' (yh right) is that season 5 will end with the "most ambiguous thing ever that happens to her". (The more she speaks, the more it fits in with my long theory that she will mistakingly be killed, which is probs wishful thinking, but anyway, onwards.)



The iron bank will not be happy with LF, he's got the crown into debt they can't afford and is now elbowing (fingering?...) his way into their territory. They will want to punish him, and make a call to the faceless men, who now has our little Arya at their disposal. She's a master sneak at this point and goes about observing. So LF is sat counting his money from all the favours he's earned, he bites down on each coin to check they are gold. Hmmm. 

Later, shes back explaining her actions to, lets say, jaqen. 
However, all that planning didn't count on our Sansa sauntering in to have a chat with LF whilst he's counting his monies. So you see where i'm going with this....
 LF "have a chew on this love" oh dear, red face, poisoned coin,  dead. Or is she? END SCENE. 

So yh, tinfoil. But i really liked that little chapter with arya, and it would be a 'nice' way to include it? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Sansa and The Execution Of Lady Jane Grey </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-02-11 22:32:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There's been a bit of talk of Sansa lately, so i thought i'd add my two bits and share a bloody great piece of art at the same time. Basically, ever since Baelish has got his hands on her, the image of ['Lady Jane Grey'] (http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/cb/PAUL_DELAROCHE_-_Ejecuci%C3%B3n_de_Lady_Jane_Grey_%28National_Gallery_de_Londres,_1834%29.jpg) for me, has become Sansa. or, uh, vice versa. 


A painting, i've seen twice in person, by the great Paul Delaroche. Briefly for those not familiar - Lady Jane grey, known as the nine day queen, has become (mainly through delarache) an icon of doomed innocence. Manipulated into the throne, then beheaded and replaced thanks to her fathers rebellion. Its quite an interesting little [story] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lady_Jane_Grey) and worth a read, as well as a good stare at the painting ;) Many question how sweet and innocent she actually was, but thats the basic image of her now. And thats how i see Sansa, manipulated into power before an enevitable doom not of her doing. All the while oblivious to how shes being used. 
There's something about those hands reached out infront of her, being guided as she reaches for the block. In my head, i forsee a Sansa beheading, to everyones dismay. 


.


So, a lot of people see things in Sansa that i don't think are really there. It seems people want Sansa to get through this story, learn from all thats happened, grow into her 'womanhood' see the light and exact a revenge in the stark name. But, i just don't see it. 

She's been a pawn her entire journey, manipulated by anyone who can use her. Her marriage to joff, held as a hostage, married to Tyrion, and now LF's got his hands on her, finally.
 She's shown kindness from a few, Tyrion, and the hound for example. Tyrion seeing something in her submissiveness that impressed him was an odd one, altho i took it to be her survivavbility. And i think there was a lot of pity in that. Even the hounds interactions were shown to be naive, reading much more into it than it was on her part. She was crushing on any knight who looked at her around that time. And the future doesn't look too bright either. LF's clearly got plans for her, not yet revealed, but we can assume a play for winterfell at some point, which i can't see going well considering who wants and has claims to it.



 Sure GRRM may twist it round an reveal that Sansa has been playing her game as much as anyone else, and it would be cool to see. The way she's portrayed in the show seems to be headed that way. That may be a positive to some, but all i see there is a false hope, that will twist on us just as we think she's getting somewhere. 

So yh, its been a while since i've read the books admittedly, and this may come across as random brain spewings. But basically, rightly or wrongly, i really can't shake the image of Delaroches 'Lady Jane Grey' for our little Sansa Stark.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Forgive me if this has been discussed before, cuz it almost certainly will have, but does anyone know if the next series of GoT will definitely overtake the books? 

There seems to be a danger of this in a few storylines. Specifically, i think Littlefingers/Sansa and Brans, whos stories have been tweeked already.  Obviously this would annoy every book reader, so i doubt it would happen, but i guess that means leaving out a few figures in the tv series.

(altho sophie turner hinted at a traumatic scene in the next series. Which in theory, would push her story past the books, as i can't think of any 'trauma' on her arc that we haven't yet seen)

Just wondering if anyone has heard anything else from actors, writers, crew members etc

	<TEXT> is definitively a Targaryen? Am i right in thinking that only Varys knows for certain? 

Illyrio may know, aswell as connington and a few others. But only varys would have known if he smuggled a child out. Clearly Varys is using Aegons claim for his own ends somehow, altho i think what he really wants, is still a mystery. (like i'm really not sure whats driving him if aegon really isnt a targ) So he isnt likely to say otherwise anyway, unless in a pov.

So is there anyone else who would know if the boy really died, or, if the boy was switched with another? 

(I'm of the opinion that Aegon really is a targ and will eventually join with Dany. Mainly becuase its a hell of a lot of writing only to have him as a fake but mainly becuase of Varys. I mean he's pretty smart, but this would be the longest and riskiest long game ever. And why? Whats his motivation if not Targaryen loyalty and legacy?) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Arya and Sansas future....tinfoily madness. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-20 20:31:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The more i think about where Aryas story is heading, the more viable possibilities arise. A common thread however, seems to be that it won't be a happy ending.

As i understand it, the story left Arya as a damn good assasin. Working for the people who every big dog goes to when they want someone knocked off. So, this is the most likely way Arya will return to Westeros. The potential hitlist in Westeros has to be pretty big, so heres my theory, based on a few 'facts' but mostly tinfoil.

Right.. The lowborn Petyr Baelish, drizzy draking it up, Lord protector of the vale. Described by varys as one of the most dangerous men in westeros. (Which is why i like him, he's self made. He's not a nice guy, but you don't get to the top being nice. He's basically a crafty little fucker, just like varys. Varys repects him, but fears his potential) Which is why his, apparent, very successful manipulation of Sansa is a big problem. I think i'm right that Sansa is still disguised under the name of Alayne, but tinfoily me, thinks that Varys, having his little birds, knows otherwise, and can predict how Baelish will use her. So, he puts in the call to have her removed from the equation. Not wanting to attack the lord protector of the vale himself and the backlash that might unleash. No one but Baelish will care if 'Alayne' dies.

Back in braavos, sat round the table, the name comes up. Baelish's bastard daughter is up for grabs. Seeing revenge and maybe a pop at Baelish himself, Arya, now very good at lying, denies she knows anyone involved and takes the mark. A long journey and a few chapters later shes managed to get close enough without seeing Sansas face. (Dyed hair remember! yh, right) So, dead of night, sneaky sneaky, oh shit its Sansa! moment. Oops, too late, Baelish just stabbed me in the back.

But wait! Aryas a stark. She's been sleep warging into nymeria forever. (nymerias survived her feast on the freys btw) So when she awakes, there she is, wolfaryia. And what does everyone seem to think they need to get a stark offspring back at winterfell? Yep, there it is. In all its tinfoilyness. Wolfaryia finds Sansa again. Shit happens, she rips Petyrs throat out. She has her revenge. Sansa gets back winterfell, marries. Done.

(btw i quite like the idea that she stabs sansa anyway, only to realise too late that its her, but that would send Arya off running again, and i'm stretching this tinfoil thin as it is)

Theres probs many holes in this theory, so please feel free to point them out. I would love to hear your predictions for Arya, she's got such a long arc, its so hard to see where shes heading.

TL;DR Arya comes back to westeros to kill 'Alayne', realises its Sansa, is killed. Bonds to her direwolf Nymeria.

(btw, this is partly inspired by Sophie turner, who plays sansa in GoT, recent comments that she had a fav, but upsetting scene. I first thought that would be her raping little robin, but i like this one better)

	<TITLE> (Spoilers All) Gerion, Brightroar, Lightbringer </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-29 17:15:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> New to this sub, but after finishing the books i couldnt resist. 

One (of many) things that really bugs me is Gerion. It was a massive wtf, learning about another Lannister that sailed off with a huge army never to be seen again. Surely thats cheating, literally, he could sail back in at any point, deus ex machina style to 'save the day' or not as is usually the case. Altho it would be about the right time to come back with a crap load of gold, men and 'weapons' as the lannisters are pretty much in ruins. Either way, its cheating george, you're not allowed to do that.

Anyway. As much as i can tell, he went off towards Valyria in search of brightroar, an ancient sword thats precious to the lannisters, but doesn't say why it is? 

Is it too much of a stretch to posture that Brightroar could be Lightbringer? And Azor Ahai, Gerion, 'Born amidst smoke and salt' (Valyria) ? I think its safe to assume that stannis sword is a fake, but am i right in thinking the lightbringer can be any sword?
 I've seen the theories about Euron possibly intercepting Gerion and the sword etc, but it seems too perfectly set for Gerion to return at some point. 

Any thoughts on this?

Sorry if this is an ident of some another post but i haven't seen it. Would love to hear any theories on Gerion. </TEXT>
