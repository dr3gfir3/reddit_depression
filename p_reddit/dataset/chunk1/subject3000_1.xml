	<TEXT> I got it as a free GwG a while back and I didn't touch it until maybe a month ago or so. After episode 1 I beat myself up for not playing it sooner, AMAZING game. TWD s1 and 2 still  for me, but is on par with Tales From The Borderlands. I can't wait for the new TWD season, but I always wait for all the episodes tp be released first on TellTale games. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha, sometimes I wish I lived in the Scandinavian part of Europe. I don't think violence and gore should be removed from media/games, but for me I view it worse than sex. Not that I view either as bad, but in the grand scheme of things sex (consensual of course) is so much more benevolent than violence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the conclusion I've come to, more or less. In the US we have demonized sex for so long that we can view blowing people up, ripping them limb from limb, etc as more acceptable than skin/sex (whether pixels or real). A parent will buy their kid GTA 5 KNOWING how violent it is, but when they find out it has sex in it they'll be at the store pissed off demanding a refund. Their kid going on gore and blood filled murderous rampages is more acceptable than animated nudity and sex.

I mean I owned GTA 3, Vice City, and San Andreas when I was a teen and I don't think it's bad if a teen owns and plays these games, that's up to the parents judgement on how well their kids can handle the exposure, at least before a certain age. But seriously, it just seems so odd to me when the violence is A okay but nudity or sex is the devil, so to speak. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest though, parents SHOULD be having this talk with their kids (several times) IMHO at least.

My mom, for example, probably had 5 talks with my siblings and me between the ages of 13 to 16/17 becoming more "age appropriate" so to speak the older we got. She drilled using condoms, being safe, not getting STIs (STDs), etc in to us while also letting us know sex isn't some horrible thing that can or will ruin our lives or make us go to hell. That it should be with someone we love, but we most likely will have it with people we don't but to be safe about it.

Sex discussions may be hard and awkward but I think their vital and needed. Of course I'm not inherently trying to be holier en though and every parent has different methods, views, and priorities. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Talking more towards video games, but a broader discussion is welcome. Parents will buy GTAV for their kid thinking it's just violence, but when they find out there is nudity they will come to the store pissed that they weren't properly warned about the sex. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ah, in my area within like 5 miles we have like 4 stores and I forget sometimes not everyone has that.

My advice (if not already tried) call 611 and immediately ask for customer loyalty. Don't even talk to the regular care rep. If you're a 5 year Tmo vet I'm sure they'll get you squared away. I hear good things about Tforce (social media cust support) but my 2 experiences with them have been eh. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, they want to try to keep you as a customer for those 2 years. Obviously there's no contract so you can pay off the rest and cancel if you choose, those bill credits are just incentive at that point. 

I mean no real complaints from me, unless Tmo really screws up I have no plan on cancelling so I'll just take the 6$ off haha. And if they do screw up badly it's not that much to pay off and won't make me stay.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You should have called your local store, I called 611 to just find out the deals (the website and PDFs confused me) and called my local store to make sure they had the Stylo 2 in (which they did, and the employee said they have a bunch). Of course mileage may vary on stock.

By the way have you had a Stylo before? I loved my Stylo 1 (16 GB model) and am just as happy with my 2. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's 10$ from what I was told, but only 4$ will go towards the Stylo so I get ~6 off my normal bill. Downside is I can't pay the Stylo off early, from what I was told, or I lose the bill credit. I was thinking of paying the last 110'ish off and pocketing the 24 months of 10$ off haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just want to start with: I've only been a customer since August.

So Tuesday night I call 611 to find out more info on the Black Friday deals, I find out I can get an LG STYLO 2 for 32$ down and then get 24 months of bill credits of 10$, giving me the price of the Stylo paid off. I double and triple check it'll only be 32$ down, stupid me didn't think to have her notate it.

So I go into the T-Mobile store yesterday to get my Stylo, I had a Stylo one I loved but hard bricked after the 1 year warranty, find out it'll be 132$ down. I say F it and pay it down, pay the 20$ in store fee. I get home and call 611 and ask to be forwarded straight to customer loyalty and crossed my fingers.

Lady was real nice, straight up told me what I already knew of: the longer you're with them the more they can do for you. She couldn't get me 100$ refunded, of which I was positive I was qouted (several times) and she agreed if I had the rep notate it it'd be a bit different. She did reverse the 20$ in store fee into a bill credit though. I was also curious about opening up the 3rd and then 4th free line. I got an uneeded sim kit with my Stylo and she sent me out a free sim kit for the 4th line. 

All in all, for me for being a customer for a bit over 2 months I feel like the loyalty department treated me pretty well (T Force really was no help here tbh as I did try them first). So +5 for Tmo from me. I wish I had saved that 100$ but that is (a bit) on me as I knew better and know to have a customer care rep notate every damn thing haha. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're basically lease to own a phone that you pay X a month for on top of your service bill, (or in the promos case TMo pays the X for you if you stay with them) if you leave early of course they'll want the rest of the money for the phone. I did a BYOD and I cancel anytime. You can also pay for the phone in full, or by a cheaper but used second hand TMo device to do a BYOD to not have to worry about the remaining MSRP balance.

But I mean it seemed pretty clear to me you can get a free phone but stay with TMo for 2 years (or cancel early and pay what you have left on the phone) or BYOD or pay in full. I don't really see how any of this could make someone mad, seem underhanded/lying, be called unfair, or etc etc etc. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Having issues with a game update. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I bought Dying Light after watching my roommate play it on his PC, all excited for it I let the update download (just a bit over 18 GB) after installing the disk. That went well until it hit 100%, now it's at almost 20 GB downloaded and seems to be a never ending download. 

For the most part if I just let it go the total download just raises everytime .01 GB is downloaded and always shows 100%. I tried power cycling my console 2x, first time I turned my modem off and it showed the download progress at 104% 19 (aprox) GB/18 (aprox) GB when turning on my modem and the Xbox connecting to the Internet/live it changed to 100% and the total needed to download just went up everytime .01 GB was downloaded again. 

The second power cycle I left the modem on and right out the gate started at 100% (not over 100% like when starting up offline). I've looked online and couldn't seem to find anyone else having this issues,  much less a fix and was hoping for some possible help here. I'd really like to not have to uninstall/reinstall as the first time the 18 GB was painfully slow (I have the best net I can in my area and 18 GB takes the better part of a full day best case scenario).

I've tried power cycling

Stopping and starting the update

Just letting it run (seems to just go up indefinitely )

Edit: spelling </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I came to the reddit to see if there was any posts on the login problems and had to make an account  (I pretty much just lurk) to express my surprise. Maybe my local store is just really great but I've had only good experiences there. Switched to Tmo in mid August, a bit before the One plan rolled out, and the sales guy (who I assume was the manager) was listening to me talk about I had always had prepaid and this was my first time going post paid.

He basically hooked me up by waving my deposit on my phone (80$ I think it would have been), waived the activation fee, and took 10$ off my bill (was getting the unlimited simple choice plan).

Went in to switch to the One Plus plan (no internet where I live except Sat so the unlimited tethering is enticing ) and  same guy gave me 10$ off that too since I told him I wouldn't do autopay so it sucked I couldn't get the discount. 

Now on the other hand this is the 3rd friggin time since I've had Tmo that there has been some major problems. Haven't been able to login to the website since like 8 PM yesterday and I know many others have been experiencing similar. </TEXT>
