	<TEXT> I grew an extra tooth between my incisors, had to get it surgically removed because it was pushing them apart. Got it all for free because the dentist managed to get two researchers or professors or something that really wanted to see it. 

Also, my body likes to bleach moles. It has happened a couple of times where I used to have a mole somewhere and suddenly there is a white spot where it used to be. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There is also a difference between being angry and screaming abuse at the poor person. If you genuinely have a problem and/or they haven't been able to solve it for you then getting a bit angry might be justified. But it doesn't justify abusing the poor worker who's just trying to help you.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This one wasn't that bad but it was pretty funny seeing it. 
So I work at a Chinese Takeaway. This guy comes in and says to me: "Chicken, rice". So I'm confused because that describes like 10 different dishes we have. So I ask him if he can be more specific. He says again: "Chicken, rice". So I explain to him we have many dishes with chicken and rice. Does he want the chicken fried rice, or a chicken stir-fry with rice, or the roast chicken on rice? 
Apparently he gets frustrated with me and storms out, but not before delivering the great parting words "Nyeah Nyeah Nyeah Nyeah" while making talking hand gestures. Amazing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So glad I popped a Lure about an hour ago. Been getting really nice catches. Got a Totodile, Bayleef, Sentret (which is freaking everywhere), and a Wooper (my first).

Edit: servers are melting down for me at the moment. Just missed a Totodile and a Chikorita, ran like all the way around the block while standing still, and can't catch anything or spin pokestops. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's just the graphic glitching, because the game thinks the attack fainted your pokemon when instead you dodged it and it updates it after a second. You can just keep attacking and even use their charge attacks if you can figure out if it is fully charged. Annoying, but not game breaking. </TEXT>
