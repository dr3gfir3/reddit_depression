	<TITLE> Most reliable way to normalize data from cells: by cell number, protein, DNA, something else? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-04-29 04:35:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I often find that when I do an experiment, normalizing the cell number per sample alone is highly unreliable for producing consistent results.  If I use a coulter counter, many times I'll put '1 million'  cells in every sample, but if you look at the pellet sizes they're different.  I know cell size might change based on a treatment, so you can't just eyeball pellet sizes.  However, I also use the Countess to count cells and still can get inconsistent results that can vary wildly in some assays.  For example, I'm doing what is supposed to be a simple assay for measuring microrna from the same cell line after treating with 3 different concentrations of drug.  I use 1 million cells for every sample every single time and count, pitpette, and aspirate as carefully as I can every single time.  No matter how hard I try, I can not get reliable expression measurements of a microRNA I'm looking at from replicate to replicate for the same condition.  I have a feeling it is due in large part about the unreliableness of using cell counting to normalize sample input.  

Many literature publications use DNA or protein to normalize data to.  How reliable is this strategy?  Are these far and away better and more reliable than a simple cell count?   </TEXT>

Also, it seems like the flasks are made out of cheaper plastic now, because the flasks look quite similar to some smaller flask samples we get all of the time from salesreps that come in from much smaller scientific supply companies.

	<TITLE> Absolute values vs. relative quantity after normalizing? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-02-08 21:15:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I'm running an assay where *you are supposed* to be able to obtain absolute copy numbers of miRs per cell.  The problem I'm having is that there just seems to be so much variation between biological replicates of the assays.  Thus, if I just use absolute quantities of miRs per cell, the error bars are huge.  However, there appear to be consistent trends during each run (the same ones go down every time).  If I normalize the values in each biological replicate to the controls and then combine the normalized biological replicates, the data becomes better.  

Is this OK?  I mean it would be nice to look at absolute quantity, but I'm also looking for consistent trends.  I feel a little like I'd be falling into some sort of pitfall here.  

For example:

Day 1: miR X   has absolute values 1000, 500, and 100 for the control, treatment 1, treatment 2.  
Day 2: miR X has absolute values 10000, 5000, and 1000 for the control treatment 1, treatment 2.  

These values were also obtained after normalizing to an internal spike in control in order to control for the assay efficiency.  The same amount of cells were used every time.  So if I combine the absolute quantities, of course my variance is huge.  But if I normalize to the control, both sets have a fold change of 1, 0.5, and 0.1.   </TEXT>

For example, I can do a 1:10 or 1:20 passage and the flask will be confluent the next day.  What might have happened?  None of our other cells lines do this, and there is no evidence of contamination in any of our other lines.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> A co-worker asked if they can analyze their decelluarized matrix for contamination with EDTA and triton x-100 via HPLC.  Detecting those molecules should be straight forward, the only thing that I'm not sure about is how to go about processing the samples.  I don't see why those molecules shouldn't just be simply soluble in water (so just soak the matrices in water for a while?) OR if the problem is that triton x-100 and EDTA get trapped in the matrix.  Is there some sort of matrix digestion or hydrolysis that should be done?  The issue then is if you digest the matrix and need to use some sort of enzyme, you might need EDTA buffered solutions for that which might also contain a touch of detergent as well.  If the former method should work where we just try soak the decellularized materials in water, should we precipitate proteins out before HPLC injection?  A simple RP-C18 column should work from what I am gathering.   </TEXT>
