	<TEXT> I see this as the same question as the one above so I'll give the same answer. I believe it was when my parents divorced when I was younger. My father left without ever saying a word leaving me to take care of my mother and sister. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Drastically. There are a lot of nights were I can't sleep because of anxiety or fear which makes me tired throughout my entire day so I don't get out much or end up taking long naps. I'm not very good at talking to people, I tend to have extreme opinions and say whatever is on my mind.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Stuff like this usually tends to take anywhere from 4-6 weeks to actually have an effect, and I've been on them for 4. So far as I can tell, no they are not working. Hopefully that will change though. </TEXT>
