	<TEXT> In my experience most people don't actually want to be alone. When people see someone eating by themself, or not going out on weekends, etc, we assume they want to be alone, but it might just be that they have no one to hang out with and they just want to pretend like they choose to be alone so they dont seem embarassed. </TEXT>
