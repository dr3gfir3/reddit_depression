	<TEXT> We know they didn't have a contact with the aircraft, but what I don't understand is how come they didn't see that flight losing altitude before going of the radar. Looking at the timeline they should have appeared in to Vietnam air traffic control at 1:22am. Malaysian air traffic control lost contact with the flight at 2:41am I know they can't pinpoint location, but based two oil spills and last radar reading they should have good idea of where they should look for it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm looking in to purchasing condo and I started so look online to get the idea of what is in my price range. Most of the sites list asking price only and don't include things such as maintenance and taxes. I was wondering if there is real-estate website that will list all of the expenses associated with any given listing. 

One more question. How is closing cost calculated and how much can I expect to pay for it? </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I'm really proud of what Celtics are doing right now. It looks like Brad Stevens and the bunch of bench players, rookies and over payed has beens was not told enough times that they suck. Yes, they don't look good on the court together and the " stars " of the team have more bad games than good ones but it looks to me like they started to figure stuff out. I'm not saying they will make playoffs this year or that they will be relevant team in the next 2-3 years, but I do want to give them a credit for working together and competing every single game.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So this is my pet peeve. I get it he is a good player and he can win a mayor but compared to these three tennis greats he is just another player. He has been around for as long as Djokovic and his accomplishments are not even close to any of these 3 players. In my opinion he still needs to prove him self as world number# 1 and hold that position for at least a year or two before we can legitimately consider him tennis great and include him in to the " Big 4 " phrase. After all tennis is competitive sport and not a popularity contest.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> When will NBA start implementing serious test and penalties for taking performance-enhancing drugs? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-08-01 06:37:56 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I was just reading some article about A-Rod and 8 other players about to be banned from MLB. I love the game of Basketball but it bothers me that NBA is the only one of mayor 3 team sports in USA that does not pay attention to HGH and other performance-enhancing drugs. Every once in the while we hear that some has been like Hedo Turkoglu was suspended for like 6 month or something like that. 
 In my opinion they will have to do something about it sooner or later and I would really hate to see some champions, allstars   hall of famers in the same situation that A-Rod and Barry Bonds are in right now.   </TEXT>
