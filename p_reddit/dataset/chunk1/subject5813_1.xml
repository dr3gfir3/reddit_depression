	<TEXT> "That I was manipulative, selfish, and dishonest. She was right, for the record."

This is exactly what all of my exes would say, and just like you they would not be incorrect. My current girlfriend doesn't trust me and the last two dumped me because I went through great lengths to hide certain things. I don't blame them at all.

My biggest issue is I am utterly selfish. I had my heart broken by my first girlfriend and decided at that point to essentially shut out all feelings. However, my last girlfriend made great progress in getting me out of that hole, unfortunately she was the sacrifice girlfriend considering our relationship was unrepairable while going through my process of emotional evolution.

My new girlfriend and I are happy, and I figured out a way to control myself: If I think about being with someone else, I imagine what their reaction would be if they were in the same room. Literally imagining breaking the heart of the person I love is enough for me to control myself.

TLDR: I was a terrible person but changed via an intense relationship and self-evaluation. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why is this surprising to anyone? Windows 8 is an entirely different OS compared to Windows 7. A majority of machines are not optimized to handle Windows 8, IE no touch screen. Windows 8 is beautifully fluid with one, but is very clunky and odd without one.

Nobody wants to run a new OS and only grasp half of its features. Therefore, rather than simply upgrading older computers like was done with Windows 7, people have to go out and buy all new computers to truly experience Windows 8.

I fully expect that Windows 8 will catch on once older machines are replaced, but since 7 support is still strong, this will not happen for awhile. I don't see what the surprise is as far as these sales figures are concerned. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know a friend who went through the probation system for a DUI/assaulting a police officer. He learned a valuable lesson about driving while intoxicated (havent done since and will never do again), but he still liked to enjoy an occasional beverage.

Note that I understand that every probation/person is different but this advice applies to people who got caught in the wrong place and the wrong time more so than the person who really needs to use these probation terms as a guide away from alcoholism.

Here is the summation of his experiences:

Terms of probation:
-Random alcohol tests
-Outpatient counseling
-Alcoholics Anonymous bi-weekly
-1 year minimum license suspension, with evaluation for reinstatement after suspension

Alcohol tests: If you still want to drink, buy yourself a breathalyzer.  This is the one I use to this day; it attaches to my keychain and is very accurate (BACtrack). Make sure that you subtract 2 hours per .015 BAC from the time you are scheduled to test. You will blow a .00 every time. Not really a lie, but advice on how to avoid something idiotic.

Counseling: Always claim that you have been sober since the court can last prove you drank (IE the date of your incident). Talk about your hobbies and how you dont hang out with the same people that you got in trouble with. You will have to keep this up for a couple of sessions until you are determined to be low risk and released. This assessment plays a big role in getting your license back, if need be.

AA: This is the biggest farce of the entire system. Probation officers collect evidence of attendance by having you keep a sign in sheet; a piece of paper signed by a random member at AA. The courts are not allowed to confirm any of the participants on your sign in sheet exist in any manner, as it is Anonymous. Go to one meeting to see how things are ran, and fill in the rest of the sheet yourself with fake names and fake phone numbers. Again, the courts legally cannot check these.

License hearing: Never admit to drinking, dont bother to learn the 12 steps or Serenity Prayer and claim lack of participation on being agnostic/atheist and only going to the meetings due to court order. Memorize the date of your initial incident and state that this is the last day you had alcohol. Stick to that gun and you dont even need a lawyer, pending you filed the paperwork correctly.

This is the fastest and simplest way through a probationary period.

	<TEXT> To clarify, what I am essentially saying is posting an electronic transaction to pay for your credit card. Most credit cards are paid via EBT, not a check (unless you write one, in that case this doesn't help). Credit card payments are posted regardless of your overdraw settings on your bank account. This way you can use your credit card until you get paid, at which point your account goes positive (hopefully!). Thus the only penalties associated with this are the (usually $32) overdraft fee, rather than the mounds of interest you would need to pay back on a payday loan. As a former just-college graduate and intern, this method saved me hundreds of dollars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Regulate the cost of college tuition. This will be the next biggest bubble to burst. Without regulation, there is no money for the entry level working class generation to spend on the economy. They can't afford houses, cars, etc. There's a reason the median age to live at home with the parents has increased to over 25 in the US: people can't afford to leave. I myself have a great job coming from an excellent institution, but am saddled with approximately $80k in student loan debt, equating to around $800 a month out of my paychecks. The scary thing is, I'm not nearly the worst of my friends in that regard. There is now a terrible decision that every high school graduate must make, and that's "don't go to college and never get a good job" or "go to college and be stuck slaving for 15+ years to pay off said education"? I calculated that at my current salary with student loans versus a McDonald's manager straight out of high school, it will take me until I'm 35 to break even (just break even!) with that person's earnings. Something isn't right there, and it needs to be fixed to straighten out this economy. Just a word of advice, I had some German exchange student friends that gushed about their education system; I'd look into that if you want to find a reasonable solution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Lost a championship hockey game and was driving back home. Car pulls up behind me and starts tailgating me on the freeway. I was pissed and sped up well past the speed limit; he does the same. At this point I'm doing 40 over. We drive under an overhead light and I see that there is a light bar on top of the car...."shit", I say.

Cop pulls me over, walks up to my window, and says, "you had no idea I was a cop, did you?" 
"No sir", I say.
"Do you know why I pulled you over?", he asks.
"Because I'm fucking retarded", I tell him.
"Oh? You're fucking retarded eh?", he replies.
"Yep, fucking retarded."

He laughs, then proceeds to write me up for the full 40 over. Not exactly a funny story for me, but hopefully there is entertainment value in my misery. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What you're about to read is the summation of my night. I couldn't make this stuff up if I tried:

 Walked half way down Woodward to meet up with friends, realized I forgot my wallet. Walked all the way back and up 25 flights to my apartment only to realize it wasn't in there. Had to go all the way back down to my car to get it, where I found it sitting in the front seat...minor inconvenience.

 Get back later and I'm watching TV on the couch. my phone slides off into the cushion in the most perfect spot, I can't grab it and it won't come loose. I even flip the couch and shake it in an attempt to jar it out, but to no avail. I finally get down in there and catch a corner of it and pull it out, in the process jamming the power button into the bezel so the phone just keeps turning on and off over and over...major inconvenience, but not the worst of it.

 Now the fun begins. I go to get a glass of water. I pull the knob up and what happens? Said knob shoots right off the faucet. Now water is spraying like Niagara Falls all over my kitchen. The knob was perfectly deposited into the food disposal drain like Dan Marino throwing a touchdown pass, so I can't find it.

 Meanwhile, I go to quickly move all of the stuff getting showered on via the fire hose exploding from my sink. I'm in about an inch of water at this point. I pick up my toaster, and it promptly electrocutes me, which feels something like I would imagine an electric chair would feel like.

 So here I am, freshly shocked and covered in a monsoon of water. I open the cupboard below and turn the cold valve off, then go for the hot valve. By golly, to my total surprise (sarcasm...emphasis on the sarcasm) the valve is jammed and will not turn.

 So now I have boiling water shooting all over the place like a hot spring geyser. My being the Hercules that I am, I grab a towel and twist as hard as I could on the valve. What gives first instead? The pipe fitting. Fantastiballs!

 Good thing at this point I notice that there is a flex pipe that I gained some slack in while wrenching on the pipe like the Jaws of Life tearing through a vehicle. I pinch it and Mt. Kilimanjaro finally stops. 

 Now I'm stuck sitting in said water with nothing to tie the pinch off with...fantastic. I dig around blindly in the junk drawer right next to my sink, and promptly shred my hand like it was against a cheese grater against every sharp object ever. My eventual savior? A banana clip given to me as a white elephant gift. I don't know why I kept it, I don't even eat bananas! I clip it on and finally, crisis averted.

 It's now 4 in the morning and I have Lake Huron in my kitchen. It took me four full sized bath towels and an hour and a half to sop all of the water up.

 Quick summary: Odd string of bad luck led to no sleep. Needless to say, I will be out all afternoon like Mayweather punched me in the face while holding a dumbbell. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I currently live in Detroit as a 27 year old program manager of all accounts for a local automotive OEM; let me also clarify that I am white... I have grown up in the area my whole life. I love Detroit and would never want to live anywhere else. 

Here is the current status of the city as I see it:
-Everyone wants to talk about how Detroit is bankrupt. While true, the reasons are because of the sheer square mileage. It's 139 square miles, which is one of the biggest in the nation.

-Because of the sheer massive size, there are not enough resources to keep all parts of the city fully functioning. There are, of course, many dangerous areas of the city that you always hear about on the news, but what gets largely overlooked is the progress and what it means. Let me clarify below.

-There are beautiful areas of this city. I currently live downtown, which has a 100% residential occupancy rate. The core of the tenants in this area are one of the highest percentages of 21 to 30 year olds in the nation. A vast amount work for Dan Gilbert, the owner of Quicken Loans who decided to base his headquarters here.

-Speaking of Dan Gilbert, he is the sole reason that the downtown area is flourishing. He buys real estate and evicts it's old tenants, remodels the building, then sells his newly remodeled buildings at premium prices. This is how he has been able to gentrify the core of the city.

-With this new core, there are signs that this is moving outward throughout the city. Midtown is now at 99% occupancy with this happening in a similar manner as downtown. Corktown (home of the world-famous Slow's Barbecue) is next after a fierce bidding war last month.

-The reason for all of this activity is because Detroit is slowly once again becoming a desirable place to live, despite the reports that are often shown regarding it being like a "war zone". The media has completely blown that out of proportion, which is a shame.

I run a twitter account regarding the positive aspects of Detroit, but refuse to shamelessly promote it, which would effectively ruin the credibility of this post. I wouldn't live anywhere else, that's the honest truth. It's a shame that the focus isn't on the city's revival but instead on it's past. I'd love to get into further detail if anyone so cares. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I stumbled home from a work party and proceeded to lock myself in my water heater closet at my apartment; I couldn't see a damn thing. In my drunken stupor, I kicked the pipe at the bottom and busted it off the heater, which proceeded to start filling said closet with scalding hot water. At this point the drunken panic sets in: I find the door and push the handle and it won't budge. I begin to think I'm going to die as the scalding water and steam start to fill this 4' x 4' closet, so in my state of drunken adrenaline I grab the heater, rip it off the pipes, and start ramming the door in hopes that it would open. In realizing it won't and thinking I'm going to die, I lay against the wall in defeat. I turn the handle one more time with tears streaming down my face...I pull the handle and it opens without a problem. When I was trying to open said door the first time, I tried pushing only...$2,000 and an eviction notice later, still the dumbest (and weirdest) thing I've done while drunk. </TEXT>
