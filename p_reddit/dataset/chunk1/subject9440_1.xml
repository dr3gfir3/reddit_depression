Someone claiming to work on the show [posted some spoilers](http://boards.4chan.org/co/thread/67780030/which-are-you-more-excited-for-the-arrow-vs-ras) on 4chan.  Keep in mind these could be totally made up.  But anyways he claims that Bryan Cranston (playing an ex-ARGUS tech agent) breaks Slade and Boomerang out of prison.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Generally, im very good at differentiating from CGI, In Game and Pre-Rendered cutscreens.  But yesterday they released this [footage for Battlefield Hardline](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kk34yU1BGiU) that has me stumped.  The opening video clearly looks pre-rendedered with in game assets.  But the same level of fidelity is clearly shown through out the video.  
  
Is the beginning of this video actually in-game?  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I went to Gamestop yesterday afternoon and was awestruck by a playable x-box one sitting in the corner.  It was the first time I have touched the controller or have seen the console in action.  The demo was for Forza, which I was under the impression ran at 1080p and 60fps.  The demo felt extremely slow to me.  The car would physically slow down, as if I didn't have total control.  The loading screen was riddled with "Buy this console" non-sense and it took two minutes before the game would start.  The entire experience really bummed me out.  
  
Does the actual game take forever to load?  
  
Do the cars feel like they are always going 20mph?  
  
Does the game take away your ability to drive the car the way you want?  
  
Is the feedback in the triggers adjustable? I could hardly feel it.   </TEXT>

Last night I managed to adjust the steering and re-gain control without hitting anything.  It was fabulous.  I wish I could of had a recording of it.

I really don't like the game's layout, you have all these levels that are just 'pass this many people' or 'race to the checkpoints' there isn't any variety and the game constantly resets you if your more than a few feet away from the designated track.  Im also not in love with the weird hybrid storytelling where half the game is told with in game audio or cutscreens and the other half is text during load screens. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What are some of the movies and game references you noticed in the game?

* The beginning was from the movie Predator, with the sunset and the helicopter.  
* Zinyak's death scene was from Chronicles of Riddick.  
* They took alot of inspiration from Matrix, They Live, Mass Effect, Crackdown and Prototype.  
* The Metal Gear Soild level  
* The Streets of Rage / Double Dragon level  
* "My god, it's full of stars" is from 2001, when you first meet CID. 
* Mat Miller's rescue has some Tron, Atari and Zork  
* The intro, with the president sitting on the throne with the saints staff reminds me of the ending from the first Conan movie  
* During the final mission when you get the power armor, the music and the subsequent dialogue with Zinyak (Why throw away your life so recklessly / That's a question you should ask yourself) is a reference to the 1986 Transformers the Movie.  
* Asha's missions are play on titles from the James Bond series. Three Count Royale/ Casino Royale, Kill and Let Die/ Live and Let Die, Saintfinger/ Goldfinger  
* Matt Miller's rescue mission was titled Zero Cool, which was the main hacker's handle in the movie Hackers.  
* The Murderbots are the T-800 from the Terminator franchise.  
* Various clothes and weapons from Firefly, Star Wars, Star Trek, Blade Runner,   Always Sunny in Philadelphia.   
* Keith David and Roddy Piper recreating the ally fight from They Live.  
* The chicken taunt is from Arrested Development  
* A blowup doll piloting the ship/in the pilot seat, which is a reference to Otto from Airplane.  
* The cargo hold in the ship is almost identical to the back of Serenity (Firefly)  
* The scene where you're escaping in your ship before Earth is destroyed is Star Fox 64 (Do a barrel roll!)  
* "Leave it to The Saints" is Leave it to Beaver, a TV series from the late 50s / early 60s  
* Shooting the cannon on the lawn at the White Crib, turns into Space Invaders.  
* Kinzie's super appearance is Raven from Teen Titans  
* Pierce's super appearance is Kung Lao from Mortal Kombat  
* Ben King's super appearance is Morpheus from the Matrix  
* Keith David's super appearance is Lando Calrissian from Star Wars. It really fits the traitor-turned hero thing he's got going on.  
* When Zinyac blows up the earth, you can hear a million voices crying out in terror...then are suddenly silenced.  
* The entire White Crib level is very simular to the West Wing.
