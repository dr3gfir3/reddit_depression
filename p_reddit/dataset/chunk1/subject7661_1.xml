	<TEXT> Last time I checked numbers were up to 500+ which is brilliant. But they need to start more plans for relocation. I hear there's a lot of politics involved and they won't allow any lions to be moved. Which I don't think helps to get these lions back into the wild! Which is what the main aim is for any species of endangered animal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well now way is chelsea a bigger club than arsenal in terms of fans worldwide or local! That can be seen by ticket sales   revenue from merchandise! Chelsea have won more recently yes but that don't make them bigger  most premiership clubs that have won cups sellout don't make them bigger tho!
Man city couldn't sell their allocation of tickets for community shield @Wembley but they have won more than arsenal recently   more than chelsea but that make them a big club  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chelsea has a lot more fans in USA because they been touring the country during preseason. Wenger doesn't like to make players travel far before start of season. But we did travel to far easy last year! We have a lot more Asian fans than chelsea! 


This is the current Forbes valuation!

http://www.forbes.com/soccer-valuations/list/?view=pc

All I can say is that chelsea fans are like the new Man U lot! Glory hunters!

As arsenal fan let me tell u, times are bad but they still charge you 90 a ticket to see ur team lose to Man U. How seats do u think would be empty at Chelsea's ground if they started losing? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My mum battled it for long time. Longer than anyone could expect. She was strongest person I know. Last couple years though she couldn't fight it. 
Royal Brompton hospital treated her more like a test guinea pig than person. Nurses   staff great. But for Dr. Seem like they was using her for case study. Never saw same dr twice. Only met prof in charge if clinic twice. Just my expirence of royal Brompton. She died over 2 years ago. Life changes after. Things never go back to how they were. If they can find cure or help live with symptoms then worth the effort.  </TEXT>
