This is weird logic to me. 

So because artists sometimes do stupid things, then we should just ignore everything artists say ever? Nothing wise can ever come from their mouths or is worth repeating?

Why not just take the quote for what it is?

	<TEXT> [Part 2 on Cultural Evolution](http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/07/08/cultural-evolution-2-thanks-for-the-meme-rise/) is worth checking out too:

Cultural evolution can happen when one group in a society outbreeds another. The Amish population has increased twenty times faster than the non-Amish American population in the past century. At a constant growth rate, itll be only another four hundred years or so before America is an Amish-majority nation. More seriously, some people expect something like this to happen with high-fertility-rate immigrant populations, like Latinos and Muslims. In cases of strong differential fertility rates, cultural evolution becomes a race to see if the faster-growing minority can reproduce faster than the majority can assimilate them. However, despite dire predictions of all of us being crushed under the Amishs quaint hand-made boots, people had trouble thinking of historical examples of something like this happening. Sure, populations have replaced other populations  like the Anglo-Saxons replacing the Celts in England  but its tended to occur alongside military invasions. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many phobias are learned too, that doesn't mean they aren't real mental disorders. 

Just because the brain is plastic doesn't mean that it always changes in adaptive ways, sometimes it changes in maladaptive ways. PTSD is one of the most extreme examples of this, and I'd doubt you'd consider that not a real disorder.

The article kinda falls into a "biological trap." Most psychologists recognize that mental disorders can be caused by a variety of biological, social, environmental, and psychological factors. This is why the proper term is "disorder," not "disease." 

"Disease" is a semantic trick here. It implies that all mental disorders have to be rooted in purely bottom-up biological causes. Which isn't true. And most psychologists understand this.

General rule of thumb: "A neuroscientist says..." articles are typically unsubstantiated bullshit. Just because one professional thinks X doesn't mean it's true. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Between 2001-2011 there were roughly 176k homicides, and 88k black victims, 80k white victims. White people are not dying at ten times the rate of black people.

But 50% of those homicides were committed by blacks, even though they make up 15% of the population. And an overwhelming majority of those black victims had black perpetrators.

Blacks in America disproportionately kill compared to whites. Fact.

Now we can most certainly mention that poverty is a big influence here - and more blacks suffer from poverty and dismal circumstances that push them to murder and crime. The War on Drugs is also a big influence here, as people in poverty tend to get pushed into the black market where many disputes end up being settled through violence.

But why do you have to twist every fact to fit one narrative? Why can't you accept a piece of evidence as is - even if it doesn't tell the whole story? (and no single fact tells the whole story) 

I agree the article oversteps by saying this is proof that the "racism narrative is false," but it still brings up some relevant evidence that I think we should be willing to accept and talk about, not just try and explain away.

When I first saw these statistics, I was very surprised. I think most people would be. The news puts a huge emphasis on white on black crime, and I would've never guessed that blacks actually commit a disproportionate amount of overall homicides.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Although it wasn't ordered by Lincoln, a U.S. Army Major sent troops down to Fort Sumter days *after* the secession. That alone can be considered an act of aggression.

2. Confederates demanded a surrender of the fort (since they were seceding and didn't feel comfortable with union troops around) *before* they initiated attacking. 

3. It takes more than "first shots" to start and continue one of the bloodiest wars in America's history. Lincoln was persistent that his goal was to preserve the union at all costs.

	<TEXT>  For example, there is vanishingly little proof that 'brain training' is of any general benefit in the manner implied here (e.g.),

Well to be fair, the infographic doesn't mention online "brain training games" per se. "New environments" and "learning a new language" are *pretty good* research-supported recommendations for improving (or at least maintaining) cognitive ability. I think the key is to keep your mind stimulated with new things. Doing sudokus everyday probably isn't going to cut it.

I do agree however that "neuroplasticity" is essentially a buzzword. Every new habit is going to change your brain in some way, and it's not necessarily a good thing.

	<TEXT> I'll share my comment from /r/zenhabits here too:

Yes, I think meaning and purpose are important.

I first noticed this when I became an atheist as a young teen. Like many newborn atheists, I fell into a "nihilistic trap." If life is just nature, evolution, and random chaos, how can it have any intrinsic meaning? Surely, any meaning we do find in the madness is all "make believe?"

Needless to say, this perspective made me very depressed. I felt like a meaningless cog in a wheel, without any real control over my life or what happens to me. Life is what it is and I'm just a passive observer.

My problem was I was looking for meaning "out there." I wanted an answer to life, the universe, to God - and all the big ideas that are seemingly ungraspable.  

But what I should've been doing was looking for meaning "in here." What's meaningful *to me*? Meaning is an inherently subjective and contextual thing. 

Now when I think about meaning, I always remind myself to ask, "Meaningful to who?" 

Meaning is a product of consciousness. That doesn't mean it isn't a "real" thing though. It took me awhile to make it over that hurtle in my thinking.

In general, I think a sense of meaning and purpose are a great buffer against daily stress, and this is why they are associated with both physical and mental benefits. 

**Having a sense of purpose reminds you that you're contributing to a "bigger picture" (your family, your relationships, your work, your community). It reminds you that you're *not* just a passive observer, but an active participant in this world - even if it's only within your small sphere of influence.**

A friend of mine recently said, Nihilism is one infinitesimal grain away from being true, but that grain makes all the difference. I believe that grain represents our own daily choices and actions, and the small influence they have on the world we live in. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One way I try to "learn" from the psychopathic mentality is by watching good TV and movies that portray highly functional psychopaths.

For example, I love watching scenes with characters like Walter White, Hannibal, or Frank Underwood. Their ability to keep their cool in high risk situations, their social charm and rapport building, and their clever, off-the-cuff thinking when met with unexpected challenges are - by themselves - really interesting traits that I think we all wish we had.

Am I saying I like meth dealers, cannibals, and corrupt murderous politicians? Of course not! I don't think finding something good about a person means I think they are a perfect moral human beings.

(I also understand that fictional psychopaths aren't the best examples of average psychopaths. But that doesn't really matter to me, I'm trying to dissect characteristics I admire in other people, fiction or not). </TEXT>

2. Yeah, this was my own twisted interpretation. Those in power work harder to maintain their power, that's just human nature.

EDIT: No, my interpretation isn't "contradicted" by the actual conclusions (and TheEmphaticPotato even agrees it's "true to a degree"). All I'm doing is restating the phenomenon of *loss aversion* in the context of power - people often work harder to avoid losing what they have then gaining what they don't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think a big reason for the growth of NRx is also the rise of left libertarianism, especially the spreading of feminism and multiculturalism into American libertarian/anarchocapitalist rhetoric. 

There seems to be an unquestioned consensus that free markets and libertarian economics will naturally serve progressive values. But that's not necessarily the case - and that's not necessarily a bad thing either.

Unfettered markets lead to unequal outcomes. And that's something that left libertarians are having trouble coming to terms with. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, as a basic rule of thumb, I consider all psychological traits as on a spectrum. [Trait theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait_theory) is actually one of the more dominant theories in personality psychology these days.

If you can conceive of autism on a spectrum, with "functional" on one end and "nonfunctional" on the other, I don't see why a similar spectrum can't be applied to psychopathy.

To be clear: saying that there are "functional psychopaths" doesn't downplay the seriousness of "criminal psychopaths" anymore than saying that there are "functional autistics" downplays the seriousness of "nonfunctional autistics." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you take the assumption that our society is well-designed and functions well then your position makes sense.

No, my belief doesn't require that assumption. Mostly because I don't hold it. 

Like all people, I think society could be better. But functional psychopaths running society is nothing new, and it's not merely a byproduct of current systems.

**My aim is *understanding* why people in power are in power, not *justifying* it. I think this is important to understand because if you want to change society, you need to first know how power is created and maintained (at both an individual + group level).**

For example, I wonder how Bernie Sanders or Rand Paul would rank on the psychopathy scale. Though they are individuals who want to "change society for the better" - in their own different ways - they are also supremely focused, ambitious, non-conforming, and have the social skills and social charm to gain significant followers.

	<TEXT> Now that I've written that, I do think the idea of sociopathy as a spectrum is interesting, but is this current psychiatric theory? I had always read you either are one or you aren't, and to talk of non-sociopaths as having similar traits of sociopaths is to confound the idea of a sociopath.

There are indeed psychologists who conceive of "psychopathy" as a personality trait that lies on a spectrum. And there are tests designed to measure these traits in a normal, non-clinical population. See: [Psychopathic Personality Inventory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathic_Personality_Inventory)

You should...check out the book. :)

	<TEXT> "Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand." - Homer Simpson

There's interesting evidence in the book that psychopaths can be very good at empathizing, they just don't sympathize. This is what is meant by "cold empathy" vs. "warm empathy."

One study showed psychopaths are better at picking up microexpressions. Another study showed psychopaths are especially good at picking up on other people's negative emotions (like fear).

Empathy (and "emotional intelligence") are just tools for understanding others. They don't automatically lead to moral behaviors. One interesting article on this idea is: [The Dark Side of Emotional Intelligence](http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2014/01/the-dark-side-of-emotional-intelligence/282720/)

Psychopaths, believe it or not, can be incredibly emotionally intelligent. That's a big reason they can be so manipulative and persuasive.

	<TEXT> *To elaborate, I have a strong bias against sociology.

Clearly. And I totally understand that bias - it's a good heuristic - but I feel like you're kneejerking a bit here, maybe falling trap to your own "memeplex." (ie: social sciences = progressive propaganda)

For starters, you're never going to be able to study society in the form of "controlled experiments." The best we can do is collect social data and try to find patterns and draw inferences based on that. There's always going to be some level of interpretation. And no study is going to paint the full picture.

Sociology is particularly bad not because of the social data collected, but the narrative they constantly form around it. Specifically, they favor evidence that fits one narrative, and are against evidence that goes against that narrative. 

As you mentioned, this study doesn't explicitly say what I am suggesting it says ("Ethnic cohesion = healthy"). If it did, it probably wouldn't have been published. That's part of the sociological bias.

However, I do think one task of NRx is to take social sciences and re-interpret them.

We're rarely going to see a psychology or sociology study that explicitly points toward a NRx idea. But the truth is: a lot of the data doesn't fit the progressive narrative, and we need to highlight that when we can. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, it does not mean "in Detroit," regardless of what you say. The paper says "Detroit Community-based Sample," which is very different.

Assuming the sample is representative of the population, you can generalize the results to "Detroit." That's how science tends to work. If you think the sample is not representative, at least explain why.


Don't wed yourself to this study just because it confirms your preconceived worldview. It is a common temptation, but junk science is junk science.

I'm not wedding myself to anything. I'm sharing a study that indirectly "hints" at a DE-related idea. There's no reason to cling to any single study, I just think this is *interesting* and *relevant*.

Yes, that's why I said "in Detroit" - where whites are a minority.

Blacks showed no difference in telomere length between poor and non-poor samples. And for the Mexican group, those in poverty were more likely to be immigrants or maintain ties to their Mexican heritage, such as speaking Spanish at home, which the paper theorizes is why telomere lengths were actually *longer* in poor vs. non-poor Mexican samples.

These results, to me, hint at the importance of social identity and ethnic cohesion when it comes to health and community. Albeit, it's just one small finding.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's the passage for those interested. It does include a study in addition to the speculation, but it's hard to say for sure without measuring suicidal intent while the attempt is happening (which is obviously hard to do):

But its also true, in most Western countries, that more women attempt suicide than men. One reason a higher number of males actually die is their choice of method. While men tend toward hanging or guns, women more often reach for pills. Martin Seager, a clinical psychologist and consultant to the Samaritans, believes this fact demonstrates that men have greater suicidal intent. The method reflects the psychology, he says. **Daniel Freeman, of the University of Oxfords department of psychiatry, has pointed to a study of 4,415 patients who had been at hospital following an episode of self-harm; it found significantly higher suicidal intent in the men than the women. But the hypothesis remains largely un-investigated. I dont think its been shown definitively at all, he says. But then it would be incredibly difficult to show.**

	<TEXT> I'm confused. Do you think conservatives are against food security, parental education level, school quality, or the ability of parents to provide enriching activities outside of school? This sounds more like economic disagreements, not psychological ones.

Conservatives talk frequently of the influence of traditions and cultural values - they most certainly acknowledge that outside forces play a role in social outcomes. Most of them aren't nearly as "rugged individualist" as they pretend to be - they are cultural warriors coming from a different point-of-view.

First, it's true that conservatives tend to *overestimate* the role of personal responsibility, but that doesn't mean that it plays no role - or that people are completely powerless over their circumstances. There are other factors that correlate to success too: willpower, grit, delayed gratification, growth mindset, etc.

Second, "personal responsibility" isn't the only socially conservative value. They also tend to value things like "hierarchy," "authority," "family," and "sanctity" - and in certain contexts, these aren't necessarily bad social values (again, see Haidt's "The Righteous Mind").

Hell, even as an atheist, I have to admit religion has shown to be beneficial toward psychological and community well-being. And that's something that tends to be a conservative talking point.

Critical thinking tip: If you think someone has absolutely nothing to offer to a conversation, you're probably the one who is biased.

We're in a vastly different environment today than our ancestors were, but that doesn't mean evolutionary instincts don't play out in new ways (Or even, that culture itself isn't a byproduct of evolutionary tendencies).

Unfortunately, I feel like a lot of people take this "all evolutionary psychology is speculation" and then conclude, "ergo it's all socialization." And that to me is just as bad of a reach.

Sometimes, I really just want to grab people, shake them, and say:

- "Dear feminists, evolution plays a role in human behavior!"

- "Dear evolutionary psychologists, culture plays a role in human behavior!"

I thought the nature-nurture debate was "settled," and we agreed it was a mixture of both. But it seems whenever we start talking about gender than the shit throwing comes back between both sides.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Diamond Water Paradox](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paradox_of_value)

The paradox of value (also known as the diamondwater paradox) is the apparent contradiction that, although water is on the whole more useful, in terms of survival, than diamonds, diamonds command a higher price in the market. 

Basically, just because X is being sold at a higher price than Y, doesn't mean society thinks X is inherently more important than Y. Prices are influenced by many factors (including supply and demand), not just raw perception of "value." It's like thinking water should be sold for a million dollars per bottle because it's *so* important and essential to life. </TEXT>

Do you think water should be sold for a million dollars a bottle because it's *so* important and essential to life? Or because a bottle of wine is more expensive that we, as a society, think wine is more valuable than water?

	<TEXT> I agree I would like to see specific citations of studies, but it appears the article is based on the book [Warriors and Worriers: A Survival of the Sexes](http://amzn.to/1cDIhbY) by psychology professor Joyce F. Benenson. 

On the page, the book also has an endorsement by E.O. Wilson, who isn't exactly a no-name when it comes the intersections of biology and sociology.

It's not controversial that men have more testosterone than women. And there are a slew of studies that show how testosterone is linked to higher risk-taking. Here's [one](http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/10/financial-risk-taking-behavior-is-associated-with-higher-testosterone/) when it comes to financial decisions. 

In general, I think these biological differences do have some say in the economic differences between men and women, though certainly society and culture have an influence too. 

I like to just play it safe and say it's "50/50" when it comes to nature/nurture, but depending on your field there tends to be a bias (feminism = bias toward cultural factors, evolutionary psychology = bias toward biological factors). </TEXT>

For those that may not know, this is often the reasoning behind the "dodo bird verdict" - the idea that most therapeutic models are equal, and instead there are [common factors](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_factors_theory) at work behind all therapies that make them effective.

I think there is a lot of truth behind this. It doesn't matter how effective the model is if you don't really care about the well-being of your client and don't truly listen to them. At the same time, I think psychologists can use the tools of CBT, DBT, and psychodynamic therapy (all "evidence-based") to help improve their practice. </TEXT>

Is there a lot of lame shit out there? Sure. Is it cringe-worthy? Yeah.

But the genre is stronger than it's ever been. And a couple white guys making cheesy acoustic covers isn't hurting the genre at all. Or black people. Have a little perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   In that context, the re-appropriation of black art often ends up diluting the impact of the original work because it has been co-opted by a far larger group, in this case it's white people who benefit the most from this system.

Please. These are just people making harmless covers on YouTube. No one is really "benefiting" from covering an acoustic version of a rap song. They certainly aren't taking any money from the original rap artists, or stealing fame, or diluting the original work (not anymore than any other cover is).

On top of that, I'm always very skeptical of claims of "cultural appropriation." Where is the line between borrowing from other cultures and appropriation? From my experience, it almost always comes down to arbitrary and subjective tastes - and the end-result is just restricting the free flow of ideas.

Hip hop especially borrows from ALL sorts of cultures, including European cultures (sampling classical pieces, pop songs, etc.) Afrika Bambataa's infamous "Planet Rock" sampled both Kraftwerk (Germany) and Yellow Magic Orchestra (Japan). Hip hop is one of the most "appropriating" forms of art out there. But that's also why it's so diverse and awesome.

	<TEXT> I get why people think this is silly (and Jezebel seemed to have a field day over this), but there are countless studies that show children who grow up in single parent households do worse than children who grow up with both parents. This is especially a problem in black communities, where single parent households are statistically way more common. It's definitely a factor in what keeps blacks in perpetual poverty and crime, though it usually means more when it comes from within the black community. 

EDIT: As far as bringing in Rand's personal history, it shouldn't take away from the overall message. And anyone who is being honest knows a few parent mishaps isn't nearly as bad as a child literally never seeing their father, ever. All things considered, the Rand family is doing quite well. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes. That's also why there is a difference between saying "Gamers are sexist" vs. "Sexists use video games to be sexist."

Perceived anonymity, lack of consequences, high arousal state - all of those conditions make video games a particularly "good" place for sexists to be sexists. That can make sexism seem prevalent among gamers even if it's only being committed by a loud minority.

	<TEXT> According to your link and this study, yes there is more mobility between middle quintiles. It states that ~40% of children born at the very bottom will stay there, and ~40% at the very top will stay there. That's of course a significant influence, but that still means the *majority* of children born at the very top and the very bottom won't stay there into adulthood. That may not be the most optimal social mobility ever, but it is still mobility.

	<TEXT> It's not the "inverse of mobility" - that would be stagnation. It's ~50% mobility. Of course moving from the very bottom to the very top may be rare, but moving up one or two quintiles is much more do-able and happens more frequently. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  ...participants assumed that only 39% of individuals born to lower-class parents were able to make it to the middle or upper classes later in life, when in reality 51% did so, and they assumed that 61% remained in the lower class, when in reality only 49% did so."

That still seems like a significant difference to me. ~50 mobility from lower class? I would actually expect it to be less myself. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The correlation between parents' income and their children's income in the United States is estimated between .4 and .6. 

So it's about 50%. That seems like a significant amount of social mobility to me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> However, in areas with more regressive policies, such a policy will just further entrench those policies. You will basically get bigot enclaves across the country. Small pockets of regressive ideals that refuse to change.

Which isn't *necessarily* a bad thing. Let the homophobes have their own little community. They don't have to be around gays, and gays don't have to be around them. It's kind of a win-win for everyone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Maybe some colleges are more lenient than others. [Smith definitely discriminates](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_College#Residential_culture_and_student_life):

Transgender women, however, are not allowed to attend Smith unless all their legal documentation consistently states they are female. This policy came to public attention in March 2013 when Smith rejected the application of a trans woman named Calliope Wong. In the rejection letter, Smith's Dean of Admission Debra Shaver wrote "Your FAFSA indicates your gender as male. Therefore, Smith cannot process your application." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What about "women only" or "men only" colleges? These institutions are discriminatory against ways people are born. And while I personally find them a bit silly, and I would never wish to attend one, I don't think they shouldn't be allowed to exist.

If a person doesn't want to associate with you, for whatever reason - justified or not - do you really want to be around them anyway?

	<TEXT> How this squares with his views on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 is anyone's guess.

It's pretty easy to square it if you know where he's coming from. 

Rand supported the Civil Rights Act sections on prohibiting forced segregation by government (Jim Crow laws), but disagreed with it in one section: private business are allowed to discriminate, based on property rights.

You don't have to agree with that, but it's not hard to see where he is coming from, especially from a libertarian viewpoint.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the study:

These statements were based on those utilised in the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI) (Raskin   Hall, 1979). The NPI is a viable tool for the measurement of the general construct of narcissism and is the most common measure of narcissism validated for use with nonclinical populations (John and Robins, 1994 and Raskin and Terry, 1988). 

Don't forget that narcissism is also measured as a personality trait. This doesn't mean that women prefer men who literally have Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

makes it sound like some moronic red piller saw a study he didn't understand and wanted to write about it...

The study itself uses the word "narcissism." This isn't a "red piller" interpreting a study to fit what he wants. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am I the only one who thought the show got *better* as it went on? I knew they were going to introduce new characters eventually, and it may have been a little too fast, but I thought watching how the dynamics change with each new character was pretty interesting. And now you can see it progressing to them starting to build their own little community/society.

It has the potential to become like Lord of the Flies with dumb, incompetent adults in a near post-scarcity society. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here's a personal criticism of one of Haidt's points.

At the end of the book, Haidt acknowledges the "miraculous" effects of free markets, while at the same time acknowledging that some government is necessary to suppress the "superorganism" of corporations from becoming too powerful.

A few things he doesn't consider: 

- There's no "superorganism" greater than government. If corporations need to be kept on a leash by government, what must exist to keep government on a leash? I assume he'll say something about democracy here.

- The "superorganism" of most corporations is actually a mixture between big business and government. So it's erroneous to think of these superorganisms as *solely* a product of the market. Haidt actually acknowledges how corporations "capture" government regulations (but doesn't consider that it's the regulatory process itself that allows "regulatory capture" to happen in the first place).

- Who is to say businesses that are a product of the free market couldn't be better, more adaptive superorganisms than government? Why does government inherently have to be the biggest "superorganism?"

	<TEXT> Haidt does briefly go over some Sanctity foundation within progressives, including their views on the environment, GMOs, and fair trade. Seeing outgroups as "evil" or "disgusting" would probably more-so fit with the Loyalty foundation (Loyalty toward other progressives). It's true that progressives aren't much different than conservatives in this way, just different triggers for these moral receptors. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See sidebar. Progressivism is a religion.

Okay, but my assumption is we want to get rid of much of progressivism. Given the evolutionary adaptiveness of religion, is there another "religion" we want to replace it with?  </TEXT>
