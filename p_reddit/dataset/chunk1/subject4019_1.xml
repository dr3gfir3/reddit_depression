	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The tumultuous waves crashed into the Caribbean-esque shores. With them, me. I stood up on the white sanded beach and looked out into the great blue yonder. The water was so blue and clear, I could've sworn I was in the Bahamas. A moment later, I smelled iron. "Blood" I thought. I ripped off my white cotton dress shirt and saw the the blood oozing out of the deep lacerations on my torso. Then, the smelled of something being grilled filled the air. "There's someone else on the island. I ran to the smell as fast as humanly possible. It was the most difficult thing I've ever done. I ran so fast my muscles started to hurt. I tripped over rocks and branches multiple times which exacerbated the lacerations. When I got to the barbecue all I saw were servants and a woman in a red dress. She was no older than me, twenty. After looking around, I collapsed. The next thing I remember, I was in a huge cave. Except, it didn't look like a cave. It looked like a regular home. I opened my eyes and saw the immaculate kitchen, it was like one you'd see in a five star restaurant. Annexed off the kitchen, there was a beautiful dining room. However, I got the feeling that it was just collecting dust. I was laying on a black couch big enough for two people and was snuggled up in a flannel blanket. I wanted to get up but I debated if it was worth losing the warmth. It was decided, I'd get up. As I got up, I heard a woman say "Woah, easy there". She was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was like something out of a Greek mythology tale. She had long dark brown hair braided to the side, warm brown eyes, and smelled like honeysuckle. She looked very Mediterranean. For example, she had olive skin and strong facial features. Her voice was soft and when she talked, it sounded like angles were singing. If I didn't know any better, I'd say she was Aphrodite. "What's your name," I asked. "I am Calypso and you are on Ogygia" she smiled. "After we eat, you can go home if you'd like". "Can I think about it" I said looking at the island. "Sure," she smiled. "Now go back to sleep, you need rest". A moment later, my eyes were closed.
                *****
When I opened my eyes, I saw her smiling over me, her teeth were pure white. How could I leave her? "It's time for dinner" she said playing with my hair. When we walked out of the cave, it was night. How long was I asleep for? The only source of light were the stars and the moon. Since there was no light pollution, you could see the faintest stars. It was beautiful. On the white beach there was a blanket and several baskets. "It's a beautiful out here. Is it like this every night?" I said looking up at the stars. "Yes it is " she smiled while looking up at the stars. The baskets had everything in them. Literally, you could think of food or drink and you'd have it. After dinner, we walked on the shores. "Will you stay with me?" She asked. I could hear a hint of nervousness in her voice. I thought about my life in the real world. I had no family, no friends, and no money. I had nothing. Why wouldn't I stay with her? "Of course I'll stay with you" I said leaning in to kiss her.

I hope this wasn't that bad. I'm pretty rusty. Please don't be to mean. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok guys I think this girl likes me. When I was at high school I knew she liked me but I graduated. She lives across the street. Whenever I do anything on social media she does. Let's take today for instance. I changed my picture on instagram to me in a st. Party's day themed hat. Then when I check her profile, she changed her picture. And whenever I see her out of my window, she always has a blank look on her face. What does this mean?
1) Sat next to me.
2)Looked at me. (In the mirror on the bus and when we weren't on the bus). When I'd look at her back she'd turn away.
3)Played with hair etc.
4) Talked in a really soft voice. I had no headphones on and I could barely hear her.
5)Always wanted to be where I was. I'd post something on Facebook and she'd be like "I wish I was there".
6)She always talked to this guy ONLY when I was around and it pissses me off! If there any girls around please tell me what the hell this about!
7) Only posts on social media when I post something. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. I post a picture on instagram, she posts one.
8)When I was walking around the halls before class, she followed me. Naturally because I'm extremely shy I kept running away. She finally just went to class.

TR;DR: Does she like me?

P.S. She's now 18 and in high school. I (a guy) am 19 in college. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why do some Brits hate and make fun of Americans? I'm an American with English ancestry and I think England is pretty cool. I haven't been there but I'd love to! They always say that we're ruining English. I mean, I know we talk and write differently but you don't have to go that far. I've also heard some Brits on here say "Americans think they invented the language". I don't. I know the history of English. It makes me sad to hear my cousins across the pond make fun of me and my fellow Americans (although there are some Americans who make fun of Brits and do deserve this. I am not one of them though). My question is, why do some Brits make fun of Americans? I'm not trying to troll or anything like that this is a serious question. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Am I a country boy? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-03-07 21:03:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hello everyone, I was wondering, am I a country boy? I mean, I ask because this girl I like said I was a fake. I was born and raised in the suburbs (I HATE IT HERE!) and don't care too much for the city either. The reason I'm not living out there is because I'm a teen and still live with my parents. I don't hunt or fish (no one ever took me) and don't drink beer (I have members in my family who drank and I didn't like what it did to them, that turned me off to alcohol). I LOVE country music, I've been listening to it since I came out of my mother (no seriously, it was the music I listened to on the first car ride home). I do like camo and the only music I listen to is country. I also enjoy fixing things with my hands. So am I a country boy? I'm 18 and a guy. She's the 17 and a girl.

**tl;dr**: I'm just asking if I'm a country boy because a girl I like said I wasn't. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Now, don't get me wrong, I am funny. I'd classify my humor as dry/deadpan or sarcastic.  I read and write a lot and play brain and vocabulary games (try not to make fun, I love words). Sometimes I say something witty but I'd like to be even more witty. It's not like I'm learning to be witty out of nothing, I already kind of am. If you guys could recommend some advice, that be great. I also watch smart TV shows. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello everyone :) I was just wondering if you guys had some advice on how to become witty. I am naturally funny though, I just want to become witty. I would describe my humor as dry\deadpan and sarcastic but occasionally it's something "intelligent" (if you know what I mean). Am I already witty? What kind of things would help me become wittier?

I like shows like Parks and Rec, Arrested Development, HIMYM, Friends, Rules of Engagement, Big Bang Theory, 30 Rock, Breaking Bad, and Family Guy. It doesn't really matter to me that's it old, I like a lot of older shows. So what do you guys think, will I like it? </TEXT>
