	<TEXT> You look like you've fought pretty hard for the past couple of years to escape your family's constant torment and wailing on you. You kept telling yourself that they weren't right, and through the cuts, burns, and bruises (most of them self-inflicted) you also had to withstand an awful abortion. And the truth is? That baby would have grown up to be even more fucked up than you *and* your eyebrows. Your parents would say you fucked up, call you a slut, and even now, even after reading this; it will be years before you finally accept it as truth. And you'll finally fix your eyebrows. (do you see the theme? Eyebrows. Eyebrows and abortions.) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Rules. </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey there, welcome to Project Butterfly. Some may see this as a Cicada ripoff (looking at you APLA01), and while this *was* inspired by the Cicada program, it does have many differences- one of which being the fact that it is very user-friendly, meaning that we actually allow you to submit puzzles and such, as long as they obey by the rules. And if you're wondering what the rules are...

* **Keys unlock all doors**. Make sure that if you post something with an encryption, include the key inside of it (it doesn't matter how cleverly you hide it, as long as it's there)

* **Only submit puzzles, questions and recommendations for Staff Members**. Anything that isn't a puzzle, question or recommendation will be promptly removed.

* While you *are* allowed to submit puzzles and codes of whatever difficulty you like, **be sure that what you are submitting is relevant and makes sense** given what we have here.

* **Be mysterious**. Granted, there isn't much mystery surrounding this type of thing- but we want to maintain an aura of perplexity, confusion, and -in some cases- creepiness. If your puzzles or codes don't meet these criteria, they will be removed.

* **Don't be stupid**. This one should go without saying, but I just wanted to mention it anyway. If you post a comment or a text post, don't be stupid with it. If it's too easy to solve or just outright dumb, it'll be deleted. Keep that in mind.

* **Be civil**. I'm not asking you to be nice, because, c'mon, this is *reddit* we're talking about here. But if you are going to be an asshole, make sure that the points you make are backed up by facts and sources and not just your dad's opinion.

* **Don't feed the trolls**. 
Just don't do it.

* **If your name's Greg, get out**.

* **Have fun**. 

Follow these rules (Except for the Greg one, that's a joke), and you'll be fine. If you don't then the Monarch will devour your soul.

	<TEXT> The Midnight Lurker.  
A documentary.
Forevergallifralone		

An unexpected visitor.

I wake up suddenly. My eyes are groggy. I blink a few times, and check my watch. 1:00.
I get up to use the restroom, and hear a hissing noise. I look towards the sound. Tippy, my cat, is sitting under my bed, seemingly mad. I go back to sleep.

Trapped.

I wake up again. Im getting tired of this, I think. I look at my watch. 3:20.
I look towards my closed bedroom door, and my cat is sitting in front of it, staring at it intently. There is a sound from behind the door I had not noticed before. A slow thump, thump, thump.  Spaced out by a span of about three or four seconds, with a bit of rumbling behind it.
I go back to sleep.

It gets in.

I wake once again. This time it is 4:30. My cat is still staring at the door. I try to get up to let her out. She hisses at me. I lay back down. I cannot get back to sleep. I close my eyes to a slit, and wait. The thumping and rumbling stop. I hear the doorknob turn. Padding footsteps make their way over to the head of my bed. I am still, but stiff as well. I am breathing heavily. I try to calm myself. I go limp, and try to slow my breath. My cat hisses. The footsteps fly out of my room. I think my cat scared him/her out. I swiftly twist my head towards the door. It is shut. All is still. The rumbling continues. I sit at the foot of my bed, curled up with a pillow at my lap. My cat looks at me, then to the door, then under my bed. She continues this. Door, bed, door, bed. My life flashes before my eyes. Tears stream out of my eyes, down my face and my neck. Call for help. I tell myself. At first, I whisper.  Someone, please, please help me. Then louder Help me, please. Now I am shouting. Please, anyone help me! Nobody comes. I wait around 45 minutes, and try again. MOM, PLEASE HELP ME! after a few seconds, I hear a door open. The rumbling ceases, as do the thumps. I hear a high pitched yelp, like a growl. My mother comes in through the door. I start crying so hard, I feel like I am choking. I say to her; Something was out there, it got in! She tells me it was probably just the cat outside my door. I dont argue. I tell myself that she is right. But I cant fool myself. Tippy was in my room the whole time.

I am scarred, I am scared, and I am too young to fear sleep.

	<TEXT> This all started off about a month ago... So let's just start there.

I was having a hard time sleeping, so I decided to just take a walk outside to calm my nerves. I live in a highly wooded area and the moon creates shadows with the trees, so it's normal to be slightly creeped out-- especially if you just moved in, which i had.

  As I walked, I heard shuffling behind me, as if I were being followed.
I turned, but saw nothing behind me. I was extremely nervous... I started walking back home, and heard the sound again. I ran. I ran straight home, because I didn't want to die. I looked out through the tall grass, and saw a giant shadow looming back to my left. I sprinted inside, and locked the doors. I picked up my shotgun, sat on the side of the bed, and waited. Nothing happened at all until morning, when I felt comfortable going outside. I looked into the woods and saw a large shadow. standing, watching. Waiting. I picked up my binoculars, and looked at the thing. It's skin was a Tar-Black, and moving, as if it was a billion millipedes taking the form of a man fifteen feet tall. and It's mouth was very light gray, and pulled over It's eyes.

It's Eyes:
It's Eyes were the darkest black I'd ever seen. They weren't gleaming, in fact; they were quite the opposite; the were sunken in and looked as if they sucked in light itself.  They were small and seemed to be circling around it's head. My mouth dropped open. I blinked. Again. Then, It simply vanished. as it looked at me, I knew it could see INTO me, as if it were looking through my very being, into my Soul, Watching it. 


What should I do?
Please help me.
 I'm being stalked by The Soul Watcher. </TEXT>
