	<TEXT> Since the update my s6 has been lagging and slow when I text a specific person,  there is a five second delay to bring up the keyboard to type and and 3 second freeze when I send the message to the specific person. I have tried turning my phone off and on again,  but it does not fix anything.  I haven't had any issues with my phone until the update :( I am disappointed and want help </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nursing questions?
Ok so I'm 18 male and about to graduate high school, which I didn't do so hot at due to a 4 year struggle with depression and finding myself. Anyway I am planning to pursue a career in nursing and i was wondering where do I start. I'm planning to go to lone start for 2 years and transfer to a university.  My question is what colleges in texas are the best for nursing?  What colleges are realistically in my league to transfer to after lone star? ( I plan to keep a 4.0 gpa at lonestar...  Im a smart kid I just had a lot of issues in my life throughout high-school) what are the pros and cons for a male nurse and salary wise for an rn in texas? And finally is it better to have a masters,  bachelor's or associate degree in nursing?  I know this a lot of questions,  but the more feedback the better. I really want to help people out and make a nice living out of it :)  and Ty for reading this </TEXT>
