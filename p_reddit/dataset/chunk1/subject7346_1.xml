	<TEXT> Well, my husband and I met back when I was 13. It was actually at a trail ride; a big event for our area where a bunch of people gather to ride mule-pulled wagons or horses (some straight up back woods country kinda stuff). Anyways, I was riding my horse when I noticed couple of boys following me. I knew one of them, but not the other. I turned around on my horse and asked why they were following me, and without missing a beat, my now-husband, grinned ear to ear and said he just liked keeping the view of a pretty girl riding on a pretty horse in his sights! After blushing and shying away, he managed to catch me later at the big barn dance held that evening and charmed me into a young romance! It didn't last long lol but we remained friends for over 10 years until about 4 years ago, we started taking our relationship to a serious level up... then next thing you know, we get married! May will be our 1st year anniversary! </TEXT>
