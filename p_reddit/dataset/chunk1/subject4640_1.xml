	<TEXT> Well, if you mean that's a technical burden for Microsoft, that's not true. Current implementation of WebGL in Firefox for example is based on Direct3D, so this should really be not a problem for Microsoft.
Update: I see, you were aware of that, Angle does the same. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is done using Adobe Alchemy (http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/). Basically, you recompile it using the alchemy compiler which compiles C or C++ code into Actionscript 3 bytecode for the Flash VM. Recompiling is not the only thing, you have of course deal with some of the changes like resource loading, input handling and write a bit of code for this, but it's not that much work. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> that's just a moving 2d texture clipped by a circle, no 3d in there. Look at the border of the sphere, the texture doesn't get skewed at all. I wouldn't call this 3D, and it's running impressively slow for such a simple effect. 

And I don't think that just because I'm using Opera? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same happend to me as well (google terminating my adsense account and keeping all the remaining money without telling me why) and according to the amount of people coming to my blog by searching for things like "banned from google adsense" and similar, this seems to happen a lot.

But when this happened to me, they at least sent me a link to a webform where I could make them recheck teh account manually, and they unlocked the account again after some weeks. Maybe this guy simply overlooked this link?  </TEXT>
