	<TEXT> Brought up in a strongly fundamentalist home and raised on a steady diet of Jack Chick tracts and the like. About the time I started 10th grade, our church created a school using the Accelerated Christian Education system (based out of Texas, naturally) so I was attending church every day as part of the school program plus evenings on Sunday and Wednesday. 

But after college, the deeper I got into scripture the more troubling things I noticed; like Luke 19:27 or Ezekiel explaining that Sodom was destroyed for not being good hosts and not because of homosexuality. Speaking of that story, the whole thing with Lot having sex with his daughters and how it was clearly just propaganda to justify the Israelite's campaign of genocide against Edom and Moab.

But I started stumbling across things in the early days of The Web like a Rice University professor's page on 500 Things Creationists Hate (which I can't find now - sad) and Thomas Jefferson's views on Jesus and that got me devouring the old back issues of Biblical Errancy and popping into Farrell Till's Yahoo group. Discovered Robert Ingersoll and bought the CD of his collected works and read through most of it.

That all happened over the course of a good 4 or 5 years so it wasn't just, "I believed for 38 years, woke up one day and now I don't believe in any Sky Daddy." But by the time I was 38, I was wholly decided that, as Laplace might have told Napoleon, "I had no need of that hypothesis."

Funny enough, my wife actually pushed that process along by asking me why evolution being true was so problematic. That lead me to an FAQ on the Answers in Genesis site that basically laid out the argument that if Adam   Eve weren't the 1st humans and others had died before him, then God lied when he said that eating the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge would make them die. Obviously, they didn't drop dead right away so what God *really* meant was death would enter the world when it hadn't existed before. If things - including proto-humans - had lived and died previously, God's a liar (and I thoroughly enjoyed the Skeptic's Annotated Bible's section on "Does God Lie" by then).   </TEXT>

Ireland's Ballyhoo Examiner newspaper has issued the following "correction" to a previously published article: "Lawyers for wild man rock star Lemmy have complained about a story in Saturday's Ballyhoo Examiner entitled 'MOTORHEAD's Lemmy In Bondage Romp', which told how the 55-year-old MOTORHEAD rocker handcuffed his lover to the bed for a three-day sex and bondage session. Mr. Lemmy's solicitors said: 'It was not three days and she was not handcuffed to the bed. It was seven days and she was hung from the ceiling.' We apologise unreservedly to Mr. Lemmy for any damage caused to his reputation."

 In the second screenshot those percentages are reversed, even though the number of precincts reporting results has only increased by 6 percent. Look at the number of votes in each column and you will see that hundreds of thousands have been jumped from supporting to opposing the measure. </TEXT>
