	<TITLE> Why is your version of the fastlagsbulle/semla wrong? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> http://da.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fastelavnsbolle

As a swede, I take pride in our fastlagsbulle/semla. It's a wheat bun with almond paste, whipped creme and powdered sugar on top. Not jam or vanilla cream. What is wrong with you?

[This is a fastlagsbulle](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/SemlaFlickr.jpg/1920px-SemlaFlickr.jpg).

[This is not](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/Fastelavnsbolle_3_%28ubt%29.jpg/1280px-Fastelavnsbolle_3_%28ubt%29.jpg).

Please - explain. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Looking for old time eastern asian pork dish </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-09 14:37:01 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi. About two years ago I watched a food show with some chef going around the world trying different local foods. And in one episode he cooked both chicken in a huge (like **huge**) ceramic vase/bowl. He also got to try and prepare a very interesting dish made out of pork (I'm pretty sure it's pork) that was shaped as a big square block that they cut thinly in to a really long "ribbon" that they put in a metallic pyramid and cooked. 

After that they kind of assembled this "meat pyramid" and garnished.

I'm sorry if this sounds really confusing but I hope you understand. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [MOD POST] Update of rules and such. Please read before posting. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-05 14:55:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Ok. It's a new year and new life and yada yada yada. This year is also going to be filled people we want to punch in the face. Some old and most likely some new ones.

We, the mods, here at /r/punchablefaces have also some rules that we want you to follow.

* No political discussion or politically bias titles.

This means that you aren't aloud to post people solely based on his or her political choice. For example, don't post someone just because he or she is a republican.

Also, please keep the political discussion to a minimum. Political discussions takes place in /r/politics, not here.

* No posting/asking for personal information

This one is pretty self explanatory. Before you post someone here, make sure that no username or personal information is shown. Some people that are posted here are easy to use google image search on and some don't. If the person is a big celebrity (no, 70k followers on facebook does not count), then it's a difference.

* No posts/comments with racist, sexist, or homophobic content

Guys (and girls). There are subs for really hating on people and calling them such things. This is not one of those subs.

* No memes

Fortunately, we haven't had to deal with these yet.

An addition to the rules that I have had to explain a dozen times to people getting banned:

* **Rape. Is. Not. Ok**.

As a mod, I do not give a shit if you're joking.

* If you are banned and think that it is an unfair decision, you are more than welcome to [message the mods](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fpunchablefaces), but dont expect being treated with kindness if your reply to being banned is "fuck off" "go fuck yourself" "hope you get raped" (Seriously things people have written to me when explained to why they are banned).

* Please check the banned faces section on the right. I update it about once a week. Some people will be removed after a while and some are there to stay. 


I think that's all from me now. Have a nice week. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, so a friend of mine posted something about "blue bean" on facebook a week or two ago. I wasn't 100% sure that it was the "female equivalent" of blue balls, so I asked. Apparently it's when your clitoris hurt from the same lack of stimulation as the balls during blue balls.

As a male, I have never heard of that expression (or the existance of something like this) until now. Are there more women who can confirm this? </TEXT>

This kind of freaks me out (but hey, everything does). But is there anyone else who have heard or read anything about this or is it just some asshats way of trying to make muslims look bad? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, as a barista in training I have gotten a few "a double *espresso based drink*, please" and for me, a "regular" cup is based on a double espresso. I don't make it from a single if the customer don't specifically asked for it. I'm from Sweden and all baristas I know have a double as a regular. It's mostly English speaking people who say "a double" when they order.

So I wonder, is it normal in countries like America, England etc to normally serve the drinks with only a single shot of espresso when not asked for a double? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've had this problem for a few weeks now. Sometimes, mostly while joining games, the game just crashes. No "This program is not responding", no hour glass to show that something fucked up, no nothing. It just crashes.

Well, up until like a day or two ago when it actually started freezing while joining games and then sometimes crash, and then sometimes not. I have to force shut down my computer since nothing works to exit PD.

I've also experienced a lot of problems regarding the black loading screen before pre mission lobby. Where the wheel just spins around and round and round.

I am currently using Windows 8.1 and have only had this occur on one game before and that was Skyrim. And it only happened once. </TEXT>

We have no idea where she came from, but she is well fed, very cuddly and very social.
There is no collar and from what I could see, no ear tag either.
Only "faults" on her otherwise are a few scars on her right ear (that are healed) and a bit of loss of fur just in front of the ears.

Any advice on how to take care of a "runaway" cat for over the night? My mum has knocked on the neighbors doors, but no one is answering.

We can't (and we're probably not aloud to either, by law) keep her permanently. </TEXT>

So I ask you - how many of you (North Americans) refer to your stronger beer as "malt liquor"? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm watching a review of the Garbage Pail Kids and came to wonder;
how is it that collecting and trading cards became such a huge hit?
I don't mean such cards as Pokmon, Yu-Gi-Oh, Magic etc.
I'm talking about Baseball Card, Hockey Cards, Football Cards.
I understand why people would buy, collect and trade cards such as the Pokmons - They had a meaning since you played games with them.

But why did the other cards that didn't have any real purpose except for collecting become such a hit? </TEXT>

I am currently suffering from depression, anxiety, claustrophobia and other rather unpleasant diseases.
