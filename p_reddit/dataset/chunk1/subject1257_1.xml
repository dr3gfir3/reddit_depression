	<TEXT> Thank you for your kind words. I did ask my doctor and saw her after 80-85 days of my 106-day cycle, she sent me for blood tests and an ultrasound, which were mostly normal (TSH was 3.89 which I find borderline too high, and I had a 3-cm kyst on my ovary which will be checked again on Jan. 12). I did mention PCOS because I noticed some symptoms (acne, no period, greasy hair, tiredness/depression, facial hair), but I am really not the "typical" PCOS profile so we'll keep an eye on that but she didn't seem to convinced for now. I'm just hoping this bad joke is going to end soon without a PCOS diagnosis. Fingers crossed! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same here! I haven't even had a proper 2WW yet in 5 months, I'm just waiting ALL. THE. TIME. To ovulate, to try to see if I even did ovulate, urgh -_- So I'll just keep peeing on all the OPKs and temping like my life depends on it and hope to see something, anything!
Other than that, stressing out about the holidays is a frequent pastime for me recently, freaking out about not feeling up to the holidays and feeling like an ungrateful shit for that, on and on.
So I'll just go finish wrapping my presents and baking my goodies! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, thanks for this! I was looking at posts about OPKs as I need help... I don't know when I'm supposed to ovulate (irregular cycles since getting off the pill after 11 years), so I've been doing OPKs for over a week now (OPK on CD12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20). They were all negative, but I had a very pale line on CD 19 and then a squinter (really really faint) on CD20. WTF is up with that? DH is away for work since CD19 and is back tomorrow (CD22), I'm just terrified that I'll ovulate for the 1st time in 5 months while he's gone.
Also temping and have not had a clear rise, I had a 97.5 temp on CD17 but had had a few drinks the night before. All my other temps are regular, between 96.5 and 97. Please developmentalbiology use your science powers on me! I love science (but definitely not understanding what the hell is going on right now) *thanks!* </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks, I didn't know about the possible lower threshold for TTC... I've been feeling off for a while now, always tired and shit, and everything pops up "normal" on my blood tests. However, my Mom has Hashimoto's thyroiditis and my grandmother had nodules removed from her thyroid, so I will definitely keep that in mind if I am still feeling crap and not pregnant in a few months (read: January after my follow-up ultrasound I will definitely call my doctor and ask her about that). Thanks! </TEXT>

Side question for you: what was your TSH level, and how do you know when it's too high? I had blood tests a few weeks ago, my TSH was 3.89 which I was a bit worried about, but the internet says that below 5 is not a concern, however, I see that another critical level that is sometimes used is 3... Thanks for any info on that pesky thyroid -_- </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm newish as well (trying for 5 months, but on TFAB for 3 weeks), and it is a bit intimidating... I generally like to be informed on whatever I'm doing, but of course I'm no expert when I just start out at something. I may have asked questions that I could have found the answer to on yahoo answers, but honestly? I'd much rather have you guys' opinions than someone on yahoo answers. I don't feel like those of you who have been on here for long necessarily do it on purpose, but I think that generally, snark levels increase with the number of months TTC and that's just normal.
However, if I take into account my anxiety about every little thing in life, and seeing how having a baby is a major fucking deal, I don't see how I could possible be more zen, even if I haven't been trying for over 6 or 12 months. I just think the support is great, but the hive mentality can sometimes get the best of everyone and blow something out of proportion.
I kinda wish I had kept lurking for longer, but my desire to butt in was stronger...

I'm glad that you feel well taken care of by your partner, that is really precious. I know it may feel very personal and hard to talk about, but I think that letting it out can help you in the grieving process (and never forget you are allowed to hurt and to grieve). </TEXT>

I've been off the pill for almost 5 months and my body is doing crazy shit, like a 106-day cycle. I am temping, charting, OPK-ing and all, but haven't even been able to see anything conclusive in terms of ovulation, and I guarantee you that what is stressing me out is not knowing if/when my body'll be normal and able to make a baby, not the temping and OPK-ing. On the contrary, knowledge is power :) </TEXT>

Fairly consistent, on weekdays at 6 a.m., and on weekends if I open my eyes around 7-7:30 I'll just temp and go back to sleep... I haen't been able to make out much of a logical pattern though (thanks, 106-day cycle). I'm just truckin' on with my temps, OPKs and CM tracking (and that sucks too because my body doesn't seem to be making any CM at all) </TEXT>

I wish she'd just give me SOMETHING to kickstart the process. I hope you can get your doctor to give you progesterone to move things along, and I hope 2017 brings a BFP! </TEXT>

Monday sucks, especially since DH is leaving for work today and will be gone 4 days, during which Glow predicts I will ovulate. I'm hoping Glow is waaaay off so that I only ovulate once he's back but hey, with my luck the first time I ovulate in 5 months will probably be when I'm home alone. Grrr, I just hate everything today, stupid body, troll brain, crappy uterus and non-cooperating ovaries! kbye  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Monday rant--  Everything sucks.. Been trying for 5 months and are only starting our 2nd actual cycle because of my fucked up body trying to recover from BC since August Well Glow estimates that I should ovulate this week (but my negative interior voice doesnt believe it, because last time Glow was off, predicted a 37-day cycle when it lasted 106 days). Anyhow, DH has to leave for work, from today until Thursday, missing 4 of the 6 most fertile days if Glow was accurate. We had decided to at least have sex this morning before I left for work (at 6 a.m) Well, first time this happens, but DH was not able to finish at all. I feel like a failure, a bad girlfriend who puts too much pressure on the guy, bla bla bla So now Im almost wishing that I dont ovulate until he comes back so that we might have just a little chance! To add to it, Ive never been able to see a positive LH surge on OPKs, so I dont even know for sure that my body is able to ovulate.
Just feeling overall shitty today and dont know who to tell except you guys At this rate Ill never see a BFP, and I hope that the situation with DH was a one-time thing, the worst that could happen is that he cant get it up for fear of not being able to perform, BECAUSE of me.. End rant.

However, I have seen quite a few BFPs with long cycles.. Doesn't matter when you ovulate, as long as you do.
I also recommend asking your doc for blood tests as soon as you can, it's always better to start checking things out before the 6 or 12-month mark, I personally asked for bloodwork during my first cycle (which lasted 106 days btw), and was told to go back and see her in 2 months if things are still unbalanced and all...

	<TEXT> Congrats!!! I'm so happy to see that someone with irregular, long cycles got a BFP! This gives me hope that it'll happen for us someday (currently CD 12 of my 2nd cycle, 5 months in though).
Best of luck for your pregnancy! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But how do you know when your symptoms are "bad" enough to count as PCOS? I never had regular periods before starting BC at 16. I've been off BC for 5 months, had a 106-day cycle, just starting out my 2nd cycle so I don't know how long that one will last, I don't know if I ovulated, and at an ultrasound I passed around CD 90 last cycle they found a 3-cm cyst on my ovary. I'm not overweight, my blood tests came out normal but I don't think they tested for androgens. 
I also have a lot of acne since stopping the pill, and I find I have a few more hairs on my upper lip and chin (but were they there before and I hadn't noticed or did they just grow recently, I'm not sure). So basically I have sooo many questions and so few answers :/ Going back for a follow-up ultrasound in January, hopefully I will get more answers after that </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just like so many of you, my Facebook has been rolling with the wedding announcements, pregnancy announcements and baby pictures. So far so good, or at least somewhat tolerable. However, my childhood friend just announced her pregnancy to me in a message. She's back in university, just bought a house and I didn't even know she and her boyfriend were trying. I really am super happy for her, but boy am I glad she told me via message and that I saw it while I was alone at home... I started bawling of course, AND another acquaintance has just announced as well.
I just had to get this off my chest, can't do that with anyone in my  real life without sounding like a whiny jealous ungrateful bitch, so here it is.

Thanks for listening as always! Have a great weekend y'all! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Exactly this!
-"I think the hardest part is not knowing whether you can get pregnant until you try. If I knew I'd be pregnant sometime within a year, or whatever time frame, I'd relax and enjoy the ride. It's the not knowing that kills me. I'm not very good at giving up control."

I could have written that myself and this fear is always there, what if I can't?
Trying to stay positive, fingers crossed. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Glow shows you the 7 days during which you are the most fertile, and if you look, your predicted ovulation is usually one of the middle days. If you have sex every 2 days within that week, it gives you pretty good chances that the sperm hanging out in there will meet your egg once you do ovulate. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never had an abortion, but before taking BC at 16 I never had regular cycles at all, and I was always left with a little nagging voice in my head saying "what if you can't have babies?" This is 99% irrational and unfounded, but it's still in the back of my mind. We started TTC in mid-August and my first cycle lasted 106 days. I thought I would die from the anxiety, the stress... which might have made my cycle even more wonky! The point being, I decided to try and speak louder than the negative voice in my head, while still taking charge of what I could (temping, CM monitoring, OPKs). Best of luck to you, and try to drown out the negative. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Welcome! I'm also a few days new on here :) I also use Glow, not FF and I find it to be more visually appealing and user-friendly.
I stopped BC back in August, thinking that things would regulate quite quickly and almost expecting to get pregnant either in September, October, or November. Well, my first cycle lasted 106 days, currently just starting my 2nd cycle 5 months in, trying to be patient and staying zen. My advice, start temping and monitoring CM (even if you don't obsess over it, loosely starting to get to know your body really helps), have fun and good luck!

	<TEXT> I went to my family doctor after I stopped BC and had no period for 3 months, and she sent me for blood tests and an echo, which returned normal (except a 3 cm kyst on an ovary). She told me if 3 months later I still had irregular periods and was not pregnant to go back and see her, and has prescribed another echo follow-up 8 weeks after the first one. AF finally arrived at 106 days, starting my 2nd official cycle right now. I'm temping, trying to monitor CM and will also try OPKs (although I have no clue when/if I ovulate).
Anyhow, my point is that I did not want to wait 12 months before starting to figure out if we'll need extra help to get pregnant, and my doctor was perfectly fine with that, I was afraid she would tell me I was paranoid and exaggerating, but she was fine. I say to start planning for your next steps if you think you'll need extra assistance to conceive, always better to plan in advance than to scramble last-minute to try and get appointments!
Good luck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Omg, so sorry about that. Her attitude sucks :( I hope she just doesn't realize how hard it can be, and hopefully she doesn't get pregnant her first cycle and starts to understand you! My best friend and I started trying at the same time (I started 2 weeks after her), she's 4 months pregnant now and I JUST started my second cycle (1st cycle lasted 106 days)... At least she isn't rubbing it in my face, but I know that she won't understand how desperate I feel, wanting this and waiting and obsessing. She gave me the whole "don't think about it too much and just relax" speech..
Best of luck :) </TEXT>

I'm hoping I will too, my best friend got pregnant on her 1st cycle, and I still have trouble seeing her, as she asks me every time how I'm doing.... Of course I wanted to keep private about how we're TTC, but I am a 100% open book, can't keep a secret to save my life, and plus we had been talking about how fun it would be to get pregnant around the same time...

	<TEXT> Thanks! I'll keep that in mind :) I was also trying to track CM but I am not as disciplined as with BBT charting hahaha.
I did get bloodwork done, but my doctor never called me back so I'm assuming things were in the normal range, and I'm not sure if they checked for everything or just the basics. I guess we'll see!
Thank you :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't despair!
We started trying mid-August, and I was overly positive as well. We went on a 2-week trip to Portugal, no stress, lots of sex, but no BFP. I came back from Portugal to my best friend announcing her pregnancy on her first cycle. I thought we'd be in this together, living through it at the same time... Turns out my cycle lasted 106 days this time around, I'm just starting my cycle #2, 4.5 months in! No Christmas announcement for me either :( But honestly it's up and down, I just have to balance myself between being too optimistic and easily let down and thinking it'll never happen for me. I'm not losing hope, we'll have another shot soon (I hope). I just hope for my sanity that I get pregnant before she has her baby in May.

As for activities to distract myself? Well heck I indulged a little bit with alcohol during my period, and binge-watching Netflix shows makes you think of something else! </TEXT>

I've been with my boyfriend for 6 years, in our house and more financially stable for 3 years. We both went back to school 2 years ago, and that was the only thing that made me wait until this summer to officially start trying, BUT my brain has been wanting a baby for at least 2 years, so I get you! For everyone, we just started trying, but mentally I feel like I've been waiting for 2 years already </TEXT>

And as for my cycles, they were pretty irregular right up until I started the pill, if I remember correctly they were between 35-70 days... Not much help when you're trying for a baby! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Uh, I feel you. I just joined the group, and was in the same situation. Stopped bc on August 14, got a period on Aug. 17, then nothing until December 1st (106 days)... It's really frustrating not knowing if you're even ovulating at all, and wondering how long the next cycle will be... I saw my doctor after 2.5 months and she didn't seem worried, but I'm not the most patient person, so good luck to you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 27, Quebec, Canada. Here's my situation, I'm happy to have found a place to hopefully share with people going through the same things as me :)
My bf and I have been trying since mid-august, when I stopped my birth control. Had been on bc for 11 years (started at 16 years old, never had a regular cycle before that), and somehow was overly optimistic about my body's ability to bounce back... My first cycle lasted 106 days :( Not even sure I ovulated at all...
Downloaded the Glow app on my phone, been charting my BBT and took a few OPKs (but how am I supposed to guess at my ovulation date with a 106-day cycle?).
I saw my doctor after 2.5 months, went for blood tests and an echo to see if everything was ok. Nothing blatantly wrong with me at first glance. I have a 3 cm kyst on an ovary which apparently is nothing to worry about (I'm worried though, will try to get it re-checked in a few weeks). I'm not sure I like the emotional roller-coaster, and I know we haven't been trying for long yet, but I can't help being discouraged if we're only going to have 1 shot every 4 months!
And the cherry on top? My best friend, who started trying at the same time as me, got pregnant within 15 days of stopping the pill... Any and all encouragement will be gladly accepted. Thanks! :) </TEXT>
