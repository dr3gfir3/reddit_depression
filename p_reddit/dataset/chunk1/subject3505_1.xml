	<TEXT> Try downloading and running a speed test app on the FireTV device. See what kind of bandwidth you are getting.

http://www.amazon.com/Ookla-Speedtest-net-Mobile-Speed-Test/dp/B00F9F1G4U

Then you could try connecting the stick via an HDMI extension cable to see if moving the stick to a slightly different position increases bandwidth. Sometimes something as simple as getting a device out from behind a TV can make a big difference in a Wi-Fi connection.

I have Comcast 105/10 service   all my other services work fine: Netflix, Amazon, Acorn, Showtime, etc. 

The Speedtest App shows the Roku running at 50.12 Mbits/sec.

For whatever reason, the HBO Go stream is unusable. I too had to download the movie I wanted to watch.

	<TEXT> It is worth putting up a roof mounted antenna and seeing what you can get from the north. That said, you might have better luck with a roof mounted antenna pointed to the southwest. Depending of course on the terrain. TVFool documents a significant number of channels from the southwest.

You are going to have to do a bit of experimenting with an outside antenna to find usable signals. If you are not able to get up on the roof yourself, call an antenna company to come out   do the install. Remind yourself that you have no monthly fees after the initial investment in a good antenna. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A very interesting read!

I'm all for getting rid of retran fees. If a station wants the free use of public spectrum to broadcast, the signal should be available to all within the DMA for free under a compulsory "must carry" rule.

You could get the content from an OTA antenna, or free as part of a cable or satellite service.

If you allow retran fees it creates a perverse incentive. Stations find it in their financial interest to broadcast a lousy signal in order to get citizens to sign up for cable or satellite and pay carriage fees for a broadcast signal. </TEXT>

As you can see, you have access to a substantial number of broadcast signals. An outdoor antenna pointed at 50 deg true north would get you all major networks, PBS (WNET) and a bunch of independents. Add an OTA DVR and you are set to watch a lot of content   skip commercials if you desire.

My favorite set top box is a Roku because it is simple to use and has the most programming choices, but many of the newer STBs should do what you want.

	<TEXT> Because podcasting is an important form of disintermediation, which is one of the big reasons for cord cutting.

Video   audio podcasts are a major source of content for many cord cutters. You can watch or listen to what your want, when you want it, on whatever device you prefer.

It is interesting   significant when traditional media (e.g. NPR) embrace podcasting.

	<TEXT> Thanks. Looking at the report it seems clear that you have no easily accessed content from broadcast TV. I think you should investigate a basic cable subscription to get broadcast signals in your region.

An alternative would be a minimal satellite subscription that would get you broadcast networks and a few cable channels.

	<TEXT> Sadly, ReplayTV is essentially useless. I owned one that I sent to recycling a few years ago. The device has an analog (NTSC) tuner. US broadcast signals have been digital (ATSC) since 2009.

Also, the DVR uses data from an Electronic Program Guide for most operations. However, the guide ceased distribution back in 2011.

I did salvage the 160 GB hard drive from my unit before I recycled it.

	<TEXT> If I remember correctly, the guide data are required by the FCC for broadcast signals. They are organized by each broadcaster and encoded in the vertical blanking interval of each channel's data stream. Typically, they reference only a few hours of content. 

In contrast, most cable   satellite program guides cover the next 14 days. </TEXT>

The price of broadband service to consumers has been going up.

An example: Walmart has a decent no-name 40 inch LED TV for $229.

You will also need an antenna if there is not an existing antenna that can be connected to the new TV.

	<TEXT> No. Buy a proper reflector   LNBF.

Besides the fact that FTA is linear polarization   DBS is circular there are two additional problems.

1) DBS LNBs are designed to receive frequencies that are just above the Ku band. They don't work well for Ku frequencies. You would need a Ku LNBF.

2) The reflector is too small (18x20). DBS birds have higher powered downlink signals and can work with smaller reflectors. Ku signals are lower powered and generally require a 30 inch or larger reflector in order to produce a usable signal. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Airbox is a service broadcasting 8 channels of Starz   Showtime content in mp4 using ATSC digital sub-channel bandwidth. It requires a proprietary receiver/dvr. It provides a program guide   dvr for all regular OTA broadcast channels in addition to Starz   Showtime. 

Key thing is that it is all based on broadcast spectrum. No broadband service is involved.

Also, these are linear channel streams. No VOD, which makes the DVR service very useful.

	<TEXT> Sounds like the second TV is configured for cable reception. 

Most TVs have a set-up menu that allows you to configure the TV's tuner for either OTA antenna or cable connection. The cable configuration remaps the channels and puts a lot of mid-band frequencies where you would be expecting UHF signals from an antenna. Find the configuration menu on the TV and see if you can reconfigure it for use with a broadcast antenna signal. That should fix the problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you are looking for the greatest variety   quantity of streaming content, the Roku is clearly the preferred device. Over 1500 streaming services, not counting private channels. Way more stuff than anyone has hours in the day to watch. 

Two of my favorite services are Acorn ($5/month, try if free for a month https://acorn.tv/featured) and MHz (free, http://www.mhznetworks.org/). Acorn has non-US programs in English, MHz has world news services in English and crime/mystery shows in various European languages with English subtitles. No commercial interruptions with either Acorn or MHz.

	<TEXT> If you want Comcast SportstNet and live in one of their DMAs, I think you will have to buy a cable subscription from Comcast. If you do not reside in a Comcast market you won't be able to subscribe.

In most metro areas you can get a lot of other sports content with an antenna. You can also pay for a variety of sport specific streaming services delivered over the Internet.

"Comcast SportsNet HD is a high definition simulcast of select programs from Comcast SportsNet including live sports and series. Each regional channel has its own separate HD feed (many also have an alternate HD feed as well) and decides what will be broadcast in HD."

I have Tracfone prepaid mobile phone service at $8.50/month.

I presume that Cablevision may offer some kind of special HBO Now offer to their broadband customers, e.g. only $10/month instead of $15/month from some "outside" provider. Otherwise, the only reason to choose Cablevision would be the convenience of having everything on the same billing statement. </TEXT>

If you are a Cablevision broadband customer   want HBO cable with the HBO Go streaming product, then you must also pay (an extra $30?) for a bundle of  basic cable channels in addition to paying for HBO cable.

If what you want is to get local stations with an OTA antenna and also have HBO, the HBO Now product is how Cablevision broadband customers would do that.

	<TEXT> This post doesn't mention it, but using an antenna with a DVR to record OTA TV and play it back without commercials can make a huge difference in being a successful cord cutter. 

About 1/3 of the content I watch is recorded via my antenna from the approximately 70 channels broadcasting in my community. This consumes no broadband data, is generally of very high quality, and lets me skip all those annoying commercials when I watch a program. Plus, you will save a lot of time. It's a real treat to watch a 1 hour program in 42 minutes and eliminate 18 minutes wasted on commercials.

	<TEXT> From a consumer's point of view this could be either good or bad news. Depends on what the Downloadable Security Technology Advisory Committee (DSTAC) comes up with. Potentially, they might define a standard that would allow a person to buy an advanced STB from Best Buy or Amazon that could function as a traditional cable box, Roku, and DVR all-in-one. 

That said, I'm not very optimistic about the outcome. There are a lot of incumbent players looking to avoid competition.

	<TEXT> If we pause to consider a tax on "infringing" satellites, the big problem is: what is up there that could be taxed? Answer, not much.

All the standard communications satellites are in a Clarke Belt orbit 22,300 miles above the equator. They are not over anything north or south of the equator.

They only birds that might show up over a US state would be spy satellites, weather   earth observatory satellites, some satellite phone infrastructure, and the GPS fleet.

Slim pickings.

The increased price did matter to me. Also, "free" users were reporting lots of problems with downloads, making RapidShare an undesirable service for most users.

When my RS subscription expired I started using another service with a rate well below $100/year. I am quite satisfied with my new service.

Fox made a deal with some of the larger MSOs to pay them a small fee in return for carriage. After a year Fox stopped paying for carriage; the channel was offered for free to cable companies, and then began a slow climb from a penny or so per month to the present fee structure.

	<TEXT> I have no doubt that this service will be well received by many. But I will not be a subscriber. For me there are 2 problems. 

1) ESPN is bundled into the package. If it were an option, I might be happy to sign up minus ESPN. The ESPN channel is the most expensive item on basic cable. About $5/month in carriage fees paid by the largest cable companies. That means everyone who subscribes to the Dish service is paying at least $60/year for ESPN. I don't watch ESPN   I'm not the least bit interested in paying $60/yr for something I don't watch. If customers could subscribe to the service without ESPN for $15/month I might be on board.  

2) But that brings me to my other problem with the Dish service: no DVR capability so I could watch on-demand and skip commercials. Right now I almost never watch live TV. I record programs, watch them when convenient, and skip the commercials. In addition to avoiding a lot of very annoying commercials this lets me watch a 1 hour program in 43 minutes. I don't want a system that would compel me to watch commercials and cost me an extra 17 minutes for every show I watched.

I'm happy Dish is introducing this OTT service,   I hope it does well. But I'm going to wait for more a la carte granularity and DVR functionality before I dump my current satellite service. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting! It never occurred to me that Google Fiber would not be covered by the FCC attachment fee rules. Google provides broadband and subscription TV services to households. Why wouldn't they be treated just like a cable company? 

Telco   cable companies pay these fees to whatever entity owns the poles. They must be allowed access (at fair market rates) to hang their wire/fiber unless the pole has no unused capacity. In modern distribution systems there is almost always unused capacity. 

It's been a few years since I looked at this, but typical attachment fees were running about $9-$12/year per pole under the FCC formula.
