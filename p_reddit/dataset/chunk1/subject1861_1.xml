	<TEXT> I'm living abroad for a few years and don't really use a TV (laptop for streaming mostly) so it's 100% in portable mode for me. I wish it could play on the Mac but it uses a HDMI output and not input ;-; Will probably just use the dock as a nightstand or charge outlet, idk. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My BoTW is arriving 1 day after my Switch (thanks Amazon) so I'll definitely be getting this and playing it with my boyfriend on launch day! Sadly some of my friends aren't too hyped for it - I showed them the demos and they commented that it was a stupid game. Ugh. College kids. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My housemate [23/M] keeps using my scooter [21/F] every day </TITLE>

	<TEXT> Hi reddit,

One of my housemates [23/M] asked if he could borrow my scooter as he was late to college. 

I bought a scooter at the start of last year to ride to school. However, I found that the scooter placed more strain on my ankle and caused it to hurt badly whenever I needed to brake. This has led me to walk to college daily instead and to use my scooter recreationally (once every month or so) and when I'm running late to college (not often). 

I thought that him using the scooter was a one time thing, but he has started using my scooter every day to ride to college which makes me feel uncomfortable as it would wear the scooter down and when I wanted to use it this week, it wasn't there to my annoyance.

I have brought it up to him, but he brushes it off saying that "it's fine" and since I don't use it that often, it's okay if he uses it. I have suggested that he gets his own but he does not want to (he's not in financial difficulty at all). Any advice on what to do?

TLDR: Housemate uses my scooter every day, does not want to back off even when I tell him I don't feel comfortable with him using it every day. </TEXT>
