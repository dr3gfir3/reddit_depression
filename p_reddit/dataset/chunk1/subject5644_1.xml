	<TEXT> I agree with you on point A (probably because it leans somewhat more to the point I tried to make). I'm just slightly cautious because by now we are very aware of the easter eggs in Breaking Bad and BCS. I've gone from just watching BB to watching BCS expecting every scene to have some sort of meaning or easter egg </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Anybody else notice that the scene where Kim sit's way in the back and Jimmy walks in could be a representation on how she feels about him at that point? Anybody? Or am I looking into this way more than I should?

	<TEXT> Agree with what you said. My theory is that:

1) it's also a clue into the black and white "Cinnabon" scenes. Maybe down the line close to the end of the series he gets arrested and jailed. The Cinnabon job could be some parole condition. When he hesitates to open the emergency exit it shows that he's turned his life around. The evolution from Slippin' Jimmy to Saul Goodman to Good Guy Saul.

2) The Cinnabon job is his escape to obscurity (now on the run) and knowing that the police will come when he opens the door, he doesn't want an authority figure to maybe recognize him?
