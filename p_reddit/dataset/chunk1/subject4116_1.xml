You didn't explain how this works, what mechanisms might cause this, what the demand increase would look like. All you've done is state your correctness then assert it's obviousness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Having an indexer doesn't mean you have everything you could ever need. Ask your parents to set up any indexer to give you pings depending on very specific search parameters. Could they do it?

Well my dad is a System Architect, so he'd be much better at doing so than I am. But I get your point, I just don't see the relevance. So someone who knows nothing about poe couldn't set up searches? Are you saying that your issue is you don't know what to search? Because if so, I would recommend starting with things you want to buy.

If it's so easy to do, how come not everyone is doing it?

In the past 3 days I've linked over 25 Vinktar flasks in my guild chat, showing all the currency I made running Vinktar maps. Yet not a single person in my guild tried running Vinktar maps. 

In the past 3 weeks I've linked countless chests and weapons I've scour chanced, showed all the currency I've made from it. Yet only one person tried to do it, to great success, but they only did it to get their own chest then never tried again.

People are lazy, or at least not particularly self-interested.

And if everyone is already using those tools, why not just put them in the game instead?

First off, not everyone is. Secondly, I have no idea. Why would you ask me about the motives of another person? I have no more insight into GGGs doings than you or anyone else. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You don't have to use these tools, it's up to you. If you don't you wont have the same advantage as other people, that is true. But no one is forcing you to do this. Just like you can buy a razer mouse and set up macros so you can play the entire game with just your mouse, but you don't have to achieve that advantage it's completely optional.

I for one have never parsed the API personally, I've used poe.trade woops but hardly ever, not a single time in the past week or so. Yet I have a char worth 30-40ex, about 23ex currency, 4 +1 arrow Signal Fires, and more. API parsing is not in the slightest bit necessary, I got most of this currency just by playing the game, running Vinktar maps and Chayula breaches. </TEXT>

So you bitch when you don't believe you have the tools, complaining that you have to be a computer programmer to do this shit. And then when I explain that people have created these tools and you don't need any expertise your complaint is that you can use those tools? Either you're a troll, or you're intellectually dishonest. Either way, fuck off. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If the only way to can think of to gain an advantage in trading is through parsing the API then it's obvious you're not very adept at treading in this game. 

And even if that were the case. Multiple people have released quality API parsing scripts/guides, so the only thing between you and doing it yourself is about 15-30 minutes of downloading, booting a program, then figuring out how to use it. You most certainly don't need to be a competent software developer, you barely need to be a competent computer user. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My point is that people like Danny are thrown out on the street when they do need help. Hospitals like this don't have funding to keep people who are screaming under bridges against their will.

That isn't true of every such hospital. New York City is a very wealthy area for the most part, I guarantee they would have many well funded mental hospitals. 

I think it's harmful because people imagine that places like this do exist. They don't see a need for more funding for mental healthcare - or they have unreasonable expectations about what can be done when people do need help.

Are you under the impression that every single public mental health facility in the United States is a run down hell hole or something?

And seriously, you're being ridiculous. This depiction isn't going to make people believe mental healthcare in reality is amazing any more than someone watching Batman is going to make them think Gotham city is real. This is fantasy, the majority of people are perfectly capable of separating reality and fiction.

Of course people can be held against their will, but there are a lot of processes. If Danny isn't there as a criminal defendant, then he's there on a hold against his will without any hearing to determine if he's a danger to himself or others? 

That would be a reasonable explanation, but no explicit statement is made.

It makes sense if it's corrupt, but the other patients make no sense.

What about them makes no sense? We see a man who claims to have tried to commit suicide 4 times, with the scars to prove it, another man who beat a woman to death with a hammer, another man who we're told is a paranoid schizophrenic, what exactly is your issue here?

	<TEXT> Well first off they made not a single mention of that, so if that's their point they made an awful job of explaining it. 

Secondly, that's not really true. The only times they dopped him up were when he first got in there and they were under the impression that he was prone to violence, hence the straps, and then the two times he actually had a violent outburst. Other than that he was on some of what were probably anti-psychotics, which is perfectly reasonable considering their perspective. Imagine it from the view of the hospital workers. You're holding a man who was brought to you because he shows obsessive, his stalking of Joy and breaking into her house, and delusional, his claims that he is a person they believe died 15 years ago, behaviors. And that's not even getting into what Ward probably would have told the hospital. Then throw in his assault of another patient, you and I know it's self defense but they dont, and his trashing of the doctor's office. I'm no psychiatrist, but based purely on the facts just listed I'd be quite fearful of what such a person might do.

And there's no dichotomy between constant medication and psychiatric evaluation. I'm not sure how well you remember the episode, but they did evaluate him. He had several sessions with a doctor, eventually managing to convince the man that he is actually Danny Rand. But then he ballsed it up by telling the doctor how he was taken in by warrior monks and given special powers from a dragon. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Except that was far from the first time he spoke with Joy. In fact that wasn't even the first time he tried to convince her of who he was.

	<TEXT> Really? Because my eyes fell out of my skull from excessive rolling by episode 2 because Danny still hadn't told anybody facts that only he could possibly know. I mean seriously, it took 3 episodes and some prompting from another character for Danny to finally do it, when the first episode he meets Joy he could have just been like "Hey, remember that time we ate M Ms as a kid and left all the brown ones?".  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What the hell was going on there? First off Danny kicks Howard in the face, then just runs off in a straight line rather than taking the gun away and ending the fight there. It took him longer to run straight forward away from Howard, than it would have to just bend down and pick up the gun. 

But I guess I can sorta understand that, they could have gone about it better but they needed more time for exposition. But then we have Howard beating the shit out of Danny in a straight fight. That makes no sense at all. Even if Danny had 2 arms tied behind his back and was blindfolded, based on every fight we've seen with these two throughout the series, Danny should have easily bested him. It makes no sense at all the Howard would have any chance in that fight, so I just don't understand it. Why not just not have him lose the gun if you wanted the fight to keep going? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off, Sell v. United States created stringent limits on the rights of the lower court to order forcible administration of anti-psychotics to criminal defendants. It has nothing at all to do with administering medications to mental health patients. And it doesn't require, as you say, "a ton of hearings". It just limits the scope of lower courts previous power to order such medicines. 

Secondly, since you'd like to talk about legal precedents lets talk about 5150, also known as the Involuntary Psychiatric Hold. With probable cause a qualified officer or clinician can issue a 5150, probable cause being evident danger to one's self or others or a major disability, a 5150 allows that the person in question is held for psychiatric evaluation. Now this isn't technically relevant to the show, but it both proves a point, and is a good example because it's often featured in popular media because it's Californian law. New York, the state/city the show takes place in, has similar laws that you're more than welcome to research yourself. 


Finally, "This depiction feeds into the idea that even people who aren't mentally ill get permanent housing." that is the most non-point out of all of them. Just to start, there is no doubt that Danny honestly needs mental health help. Then there's the fact that he was held for a psychiatric evaluation in order to determine whether he would be held more long term, so I have no idea where on earth you're getting this idea from. As far as I can tell you're just pulling this out of your ass. There is absolutely no details that speak to this sentiment.


To sum up, you're full of shit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Incredibly vague? Well yeah, it's an analogy. If analogies get specific then they fall apart, because no two things are truly analogous just partially analogous. 

And I could make the same comment about your critique. It's incredibly vague, you don't actually give any details just "your analogy is vague, it's not coherent". How isn't it coherent? Where exactly is the disconnect? Just saying "there is no coherence", that may be so but that's still a terrible critique. If I didn't see this lack of coherence before, then why would I see it now just because you merely alluded to it's existence?

To try and explain my analogy, the highway speed limit is the animation speed stat. Just like animation speed dictates how fast your character does things, highway speed dictates how fast cars can move. Movement speed is being compared to how fast your car is capable of moving. The car is your character. So in the analogy, say the highway speed limit were reduced by 10 miles, your animation speed is slowed by 10%, your car would be slowed down by 10 miles. Now if you had a pass from the cops, Kaom's Roots, that said you don't have to abide by this new speed limit, your reduced animation speed, you would keep going at the same speed. But let's say you run over a nail, you get reduced movespeed, well it doesn't matter what you got from the cops your car is still gonna slow down because what's being affected is not the highway speed but rather the speed your car is a capable of moving. 


Obviously if you get to far into the it the analogy falls apart because cars can move faster than the speed limit, and the cops are never going to tell you that you can break the speed limit, and cars can still drive even with a busted tire, and many other discrepancies with reality. Hence why the analogy has to be vague. </TEXT>

Do you know what the term "artificially" means? Because there is no such thing as a non-artificial drop rate, low or high.
