	<TEXT> Oh gosh, really? Thanks! The general consensus is that the driving one is the best, which is good to know, but I've always thought that mirror was the best selfie I've ever taken (except for toilet). 

I've gotta look into this hair thing. I go to an old friend from high school who has her own salon, maybe she could help me out on a style.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly no, I'm pretty shy but even when I do go out of my comfort zone it feels like they just tolerate my presence. Maybe it's psychological, maybe it's Maybelline. I'm not sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been working out for a year now. Mainly cardio and stuff, just to compensate for the new desk job. Zero muscle gain (except maybe abs and legs), but I've lost ten pounds. Thanks for the feedback! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The driving selfie and beard pic are probably a month apart? Maybe a little bit more. Thanks for the kind words! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wow, great to hear such honesty. For the record, I hated the beard and only had it superstitiously (Go Stars), my normal look is the first picture. 

As for the glasses, I literally only wear them at my computer at work so I'm not straining, very light prescription and I don't use them any other time. 

Thanks!! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the honesty. I've had the same haircut since I was 10, essentially haven't bought clothes since high school because they all still fit. Looks like I need to find a style!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is good feedback. What could I do to my hair? I'm blessed with a gigantic cowlick on the front of my head, so my options are kinda limited.  </TEXT>
