	<TEXT> Right, but marijuana alone will never be patentable in any meaningful sense until they approve GMO-based marijuana for human consumption.    

Another big battle for marijuana is in agriculture.  Soon corporations will be demanding to grow MJ in quantities high enough to export to other weed legal states.  That will require federal legalization.  Then we'll see marijuana effectively take over for tobacco as a cash crop, that will be insane.  It will change tobacco country overnight.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We already have CBD oils that work.  There is also nothing to patent.  The processes they use to make CBD oil are 100's of years old.  The new stuff like electronic-assisted vaping technology is based on patents from the 1970's when Playboy used to sell those old spherical vaporizers for $29.99 in the back pages.  They were transistor based and heavily patented,  those patents are expired.

	<TEXT> I wish people would stop saying that the right wing in the UK is like America's modern democrats.  It sounds correct if you know nothing about UK politics, but when you look at the details of policies espoused and policies followed it is a patently absurd statement.  

The Tories are not just destroying decades of policies built upon by Labour governments like the NHS.  They are going after good sense bills that were put there to prevent climate catastrophe because it goes against their narrative that more industry is good.  The Flood   Water Management Act in the UK is criminally underfunded, there isn't even enough money allocated to it to do the studies that the law itself requires because those studies make farmers and industrialists look bad, and those two groups vote Tory.

The Tories are fucking their constituents, future floods will now happen because they stopped what should be to any reasonable person a common sense technocratic law to prevent economic damage and loss of life as a winkwink to their deluded/malevolent supporters.  That sounds a lot more like Republicans than Democrats to me.
