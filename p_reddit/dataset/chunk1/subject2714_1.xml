	<TEXT> I'll try not to, I'm not sure it's wise to wait. I couldn't cut so I hit myself with a metal pole, swallowed glass and deprived myself of air for a bit. That wasn't a suicide attempt but I tied a shoelace around my neck.  
I'm sorry about the worry, but thanks for the support. I will do and I'll try to.  
I haven't heard about that before, I'll take a look. And yes, UK. </TEXT>

I don't, my therapist said she'll ring me up and tell me, but she said hopefully within the next couple of weeks, but if it gets any worse to let her know and the appointment would be ASAP.

	<TEXT> I completely understand, thanks for the help.  
I have been, I can't stop doing it. I've relised on the days where nothing seems real I'm more likely to self-harm and want to go deeper.  
I have explained about me seeing things, me not eating, and things not seeming real, but not anything else. I did have to leave in the middle of a lesson yesterday because I was getting freaked out because things didn't seem real, but when things don't seem real it can happen for days at a time.  
She has discussed meds, but she's getting me an appointment with the psychiatrist within the next couple of weeks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok, first a little bit about me. I was hospitalized about 3 years ago and was diagnosed with PTSD and Severe Depressional Episodes with Psycotic Symptoms.
 I've been in therapy since I was discharged.
 I got sick of therapy and I've just gone 5 weeks without before I was forced to go back.
 Now my voices have complete control, if I don't do what they say I get so depressed, I'm now seeing things too. I did see shadow people, but now I'm seeing stuff like a poster being on fire or a floating gold orb in the middle of my room. I've never seen this stuff before. Nothing seems real anymore.
 I'm cutting everyday but I really want to cut deeper, that's all I can focus on at the moment, only thing that I care about apart from my music. What the fuck is going on? </TEXT>

For those that don't know what it's like, imagine a bully following you around that knows your every weakness and flaw, who won't leave you alone, no matter what you do. And won't ever shut up.  
I've been bullied by my own fucking mind and I hate it. I wish I wasn't a coward.

My parents think I'm doing ok-ish, they know about me not eating much. I do not talk about my feelings at all.  
The thing is, I've tried to kill myself at least 6 times, and they only know about 2 of them. Apart from knowing my luck, I'll probarly fail or chicken out. AGAIN. Unless I get drunk before and jump in front of the train, I know where they don't stop. At least my voices will finally leave me alone.  </TEXT>

Home, College, Over tired, voices getting worse, ect.  
On top of this, a couple weeks ago after bodyboarding, my sister noticed the scars on my legs from the cuts I made about 3-4 months ago, and yesterday one of my friends noticed the scars on my arm from a couple years ago.  
I'm now feeling a tad self-concious about that.  
I also checked my emails and got one from the Funding and Residental department who wants to chat to me so now I'm shitting myself.  
And it's not my egs I want to cut, it's my arms. And it's summer.  
I might just scratch it a bit with a paperclip.  
Edit: Paperclip didn't help. Might just cut myself after all. </TEXT>

I'm pretty sure when my ID gets here I'm likely to drink...a lot.  
I have mental health problems, and when I drink it makes me feel normal and forget stuff. I got drunk a week ago, I have felt cravings for another drink since then.  
Getting drunk helps stop the MHProblems, and I AM going to therapy but it isn't working. They always come back.   
When I drink they don't bother me. I can't cut like I used to as it's the summer and me and my sister like going bodyboarding, so I can drink instead.
I can't wait till my ID gets here.  </TEXT>

I'm not sure if they do want to be friends with me or not, or if they do or not and I'm not sure if anyone else even likes me.  
It is pretty scary, epescilly if they bring in nucler arms. I like in the UK so be close r to the fallout if they did.  
I don't kniw and if they did they won't admt it.  
Tbh honest that's truve even if it is just in College :)

I know crying is normal but I hate it because you feel horrible and your nose gets sniffly and it makes me feel weak.   
Your Nana seems like an amzing peron to be able to become a nurse.  
I don't know if I do make a differnce though, the only main diffrence I can think is my 2 friends will stop hanging out in my room at break at lunch.  
I know people are trying to help and I'm trying to take the advice on board but it feels too much.  
Well, I'm pretty sure my sister is my fave chiild of my parents    
College I'm worried about what I'm doing next year and the fact that I'm doing a work pacement next week but I'm not sure what I'm doing at my wp  
I hear voices, I did learn CBT but  its not helping and even though I'm seeing a speclaist for them it's not helping  
I feel like my friends are tired of me and are talking about me  
I can't get to sleep to like 2-3 am in the morning (its 1 now)  
And this mighr seem silly but I'm worried about the fact their mighhtt be a war cause of Putin even though I don't like in the Ukraine or Russia </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've been trying to tie a fucking noose for at least an hour and now I've just gotten so frustrated I've started crying - AGAIN. I'm a fucking idiot. I'm 18, not 8, I shouldn't be crying cause I can't do something. But then again, theres a good reason why I'm getting frustrated. It may be that fact that I'm trying with my belt, not the fucking rope I can get tommorow. I may have to wait till tommorow to die. How fucking fantastic. </TEXT>

I'm scared of actually surviving the attempt.  
If I do, it's gonna be fucking painful.  
I know I want to do it, I'm 99.9% sure.  
It's just if I survive.  
I've done my research though, found a very informative website, and it's a 95% fatality rate.  
I know people from this subreddit is trying to help me (and I thank them very much for trying, and all the others that give advice) but it's just too hard now guys, I'm sorry.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there, I decided to post here instead of /r/suicidewatch because I feel like I'm bothering them.  
My mental health has tanked recently, yet again in the suicidal state.  
On Friday, I tried entering a 9 story building so I could jump, but you needed a key and passcode to enter.  
Tonight, I was looking for something to hang myself with. I was about to get my shoes on to go down to the Tool Store when I know there's good rope there when suddenly...I had a phone call from a friend who's fell out with his Dad. He was pissed off and he knows I'm a non-judgemental person who'll help.  
The phonecall lasted 45 mins. It's just hit me how close I came again.  
1 proper suicide attempt and 1 nearly if my friend didn't ring...2 in one fucking week. He doesn't know what I was about to do.  
This is what I felt like before I got admitted a couple years ago.  
I still don't want to live.

	<TEXT> I can't live anymore. I'm getting sick of everyone and everything, nothing is intresting to me. I've been going to Therapy for my voices, but it isn't working anymore, they just won't stop.   
I'm not eating or sleeping that much and I'm feeling ashamed of myself that this isn't working and the fact is I'm getting worse again and treatment isn't working. This might seem stupid but I can't go a day now without an enegry drink or I get more pissed off then usal.  
I'm beginning to loathe any times I have to speak to someone.  
I feel like a burden and a failure.  
So I've decided. I've been planning this for a couple months now, and I still got ideas from a couple years back.   
I've done my reseach on how tall building must be and stuff like that.  
My College Class is going on a trip. Found out on Tuesday. I've only been thinking about jumping off a buiding/bridge is from where the place we going is. But I've had a worse day then usal and it's came to a head tonight.  
 I've researched  the tallest building nearest, and there's one a 20 mins walk away. If that fails, there's the bridge I could take a bus too. Sorry for the rambling or formatting but Atm I can't care less. </TEXT>

I was diagonesd with PTSD, Severe Depressional Episodes and Pycosis.   
I'm starting to slide back down into the slippery slope but luckily my Dad noticed and talked to my College, now I'm seeing a counseller untill the referall for the specalist that deals with voices comes through.

 I hate the fact that I'm not strong, fed up that my Mum won't be at home for another 2 years, at least.  
I hate th fact that I can't get to sleep anymore, I just stay awake. I should stop eating. I hate that my CBT won't work on my voices anymore, I hate that I can't talk to my Dad about this as I don't want to make him worried.  
I want to cut but I can't in case Ollie sees and now Blake knows.  
So I've decided to try others like bruising and overdoses.  
The ODing works good for me, but I can't get them as I look under 18 and my Dad won't get them for me.  
I hate my PTSD I hate my thoughts I hate everything and everyone and I think I shouldn't be here anymore.

	<TEXT> This is to do with my mental health, rather then my phyiscal.  
For the last couple of months, my voices have been back, and so are the shadows which appear in my vison.  
I did have to be hospitalized for 7 months back in '10, for PTSD, Depression and Pyscosis. I've already noticed my PTSD has been triggered by me going to College, but I can deal with my PTSD quite well now.  
But how I'm feeling and reacting to this now is different.  
The shadows can come across my vison now, making it seem like I'l looking through a black spiderweb.   
My CBT isn't working for dealing with my voices, and I can't ignore them, but I've been having conversations with them. There are 2, they both say bad things to me but 1 sems good but is actually helping the other to undermine me again. Back when I was in Hospital, there were 3, I knew who the voices belonged to. But I don't know who these 2 voices are.  
Instead of the sadness I used to feel and suicidal thoughts, it's just me sitting in my room for hours trying to convince myself that people aren't watching me, or the BEKs or demons under my bed aren't going to get me. I feel like I'm getting tracked or being watched through my webcam too. This happens nearly every night.  
Also, I've gone back to self-harm, but it's mostly taking tablets now. I'm not really eating or sleeping (It's 1:36 AM)  
I know I shoud go back to the Doctors but I just can't be bothered.  

Edit: Wait, thought of something phyiscal! I have really poor circualation in my hands, so they're always cold. Been that way since I was little. Also most recently, back aches and I'm feeling sick for no reason, but that's most likely because of my self-harm.  
Sorry for the long post, spelling and formatting. </TEXT>

So my fear of survivng and coming out the other end with their dissapoinment, being judged for it and being hospitalized.  
There's also the possible permant damage involved with my favorite method, along with the my fear of heights.
So yeah, mostly fear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how to get to sleep. I'm too scared to sleep, and when I finally do get to bed, it takes ages for me to fall asleep.  
I suppose I could with the School Services but I don't want to feel like I'm wasting their time. </TEXT>

Sorry if that's not clear, but that's how I can explain it. None of the stuff in my room is moveable, but thanks for the advice.  
How did you deal with the shaking when it came on? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know how, but College has made me worse. I got bullied in School and I have PTSD, so it might be that.  
The voices are back, I'm self-harming again and not eating that much.  
My sleepings gone bad again, I'm convinced people don't like me and I'm getting depressed again. I feel bad for feeling like I should die though. I'm residental on College, so I'm away from home 5 days a week. My mum is in Hospital and I think I'll run out of money. 
I've been getting more tired but not wanting to sleep, and more recently, I have been thinking about S.Methods again. I've already tried kiling myself before 3 times.
Sorry if it's not clear and all shambled, but I don't want to fight against my mind again.   
Also, I've just keep shaking for no reason sometimes, and that's annoying too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not exatcly sure who I would talk to.  
The main reason I don't want to ask is because I'm sick of having to talk to someone, even though I hate having them.  
This would be the 4th time in 3 years, it would feel like I'm wasting thier time, because like a couple months after I start talking to someone, I slowly get worse again. But I'm sick of having these problems, and I'm sick of having to talk to someone about them.  
Also, my PTSD got set in the middle of class today with no obvouis trigger. It was really bad the first halfhour, but the last hour and a half it was a bit milder. How it affects me is it depersonalizes me, and about 2-3 people noticed in our class of 12. I have no idea why, and that scares me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My Mental Health problems are getting worse now. It's not just hearing the ocosanail voice like it was a couple months ago.  
I'm pretty sure College has triggered it.  
My PTSD is getting worse, I'll just zone out at random times now, forget something from 5 minutes ago or a period of time...as I live in Student Accomadation, I have to have the door locked at all times, even when I'm in the room, I still can't keep the door to my Bathroom shut either.  
Let's see what else...I'm starting to skip meals, I tend to aviod human contact when possible, I've started to cut again, and the voices are worse. Also, I belive the College is watching me through my Webcam, may be using a Keylogger on me annd other stuff.  
I'm worried about the future of my Country, and I can't help but feel that Life is only gonna get harder. I won't get help as I feel like I'm wasting their time, and I can't be fucked to try to get rid of these again. I'm 18, and I've had Mental Health problems since I was 12.
I'm also having sleeping problems, genrel fear and people are watching me and are trying to spy on me and doing stuff to get inside my head. People don't like me and it'll be benifical if I was dead.  
And this has only started today but I keep on feeling insects crawling on me, but when I look, there's nothing there.  
 Yes I know spelling, grammer and formatting might be fucked. In this moment of time, I couldn't care less.

	<TEXT> I think the College is watching me through my Webcam, using a Keylogger on my Laptop, and I think people are talking about me behind my back. I have to keep the door to my dorm-room locked at all times, even if I'm in here, because of trust issues. I have to keep my en-suite door open if I'm giong for a piss or a shower. The voices have also decided for this to be a great time to pop up again.  My eating is going rapidiy down. I really don't want to ask for help a second time.
And I used to self-harm at 12-16, did it a couple times at 17, and now at 18, I want to do it again. Fuck.  

Sorry, I really can't be fucked with this, and sorry if your not allowed to swear here.
And sorry if this ain't the right place to post this.
TL;DR Mental Health problems are getting worse.  </TEXT>
