I get bugged by this when they're too loose with it, but in every superhero show at some point the writers come up with a new power or conveniently forget an old one because they can't make their script work otherwise. See: Smallville, Flash, etc.

My opinion, based on what we've seen: no. If he can shave his head with the cheapest disposable razor on the market, I think he should probably keep his eyes closed. </TEXT>

Seriously, it is something you really have to watch. I certainly do. I'm naturally much less likely to want to check the facts of a story that seems to "make sense" to me, so I try hard to check them just as much as I do the stories that are, to me, flat-out wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spend time with non-white people?

I'm sure there are guides and tips online somewhere, but the very best way to write believable, non-cardboard characters is to talk to (and, more importantly, listen to) other people besides the ones you're used to.

If that's too tricky or time-consuming, watch or read things created by people who don't look like you. But keep in mind that there will be jokes you won't get, influences you won't have, and comments that would be out of line for you to make. That's where a POC friend would come in handy, you see. </TEXT>

I was and still am an atheist, and frankly this isn't amazing knowledge passed from on high, it's common sense. But it was what I needed to see at that point in my life, and it's stayed with me ever since. Made a huge difference to my state of mind in the car. </TEXT>

You write the stories you want to see that seem cool and logical and right, and then the show/movie/book series you're writing for suddenly takes a turn into a direction you didn't see or has a flashback that flatly contradicts something you wrote. How do you react? Do you stick with your now-AU universe and move forward? Do you use elements of the new direction and strike a balance? Or do you abandon your direction and follow established canon?

Does it make a difference if you think the new official direction is good or not?

(Obv if you started out writing AU or changing things from Chapter One, this doesn't necessarily apply.) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I read fanfic, I want the funny. The situations can be serious but I need wiseass characters and great dialogue to keep my interest. (Also the sort I prefer to write.) This week I found [Unpretty's work](http://archiveofourown.org/users/Unpretty/works) and loved it, and now I want more.

Who's your favorite funny fanfic writer? 

Edited to add: Thanks everyone for the great suggestions so far. As I say below they don't have to be fandoms I favor, funny is funny and good writing is good writing whether I've seen the source material or not. But if it helps, the stuff I'm most familiar with is: Firefly, Doctor Who, Star Trek, Buffy, Angel, Dollhouse, Sherlock, Marvel Comics, DC Comics, and Pixar. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Yeah, it's been awhile, but I'm *still* annoyed that Amazon bought the company that made my favorite ebook reader so they could let it die. One update, to make it more compatible with later iOS updates, and that's it since 2009. But none of the other readers had the same robust mix of features that were important to me. 

Last month I finally made the switch to Marvin 3, mostly because Stanza had started throwing up the occasional error or locked screen and I didn't want to be caught short. Reading ebooks is the single most common thing I use my iPhone for, with navigation, messaging and social media fighting for a distant second. (Actual phone calls are way down the list.) Marvin 3 is fine and does a few things better than Stanza, but I still miss it.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi folks! I'm writing a short story about a musician in a local rock and roll cover band (70s, 80s, 90s). A musician once told me that in his last band they always started out with a specific song because he also had to handle the soundboard at the side of the stage and enough of that song could be played without using his left hand to let him adjust levels at the same time. I'd love to include that kind of detail but I don't remember what song he mentioned. Any ideas?

(Editing to clarify: the band was a moderate success but has sunk back down to playing dive bars. Running the board like that is not intended to be practical or effective, just another way to show how far down they've come.)

Any help is appreciated. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Local video store had this and I checked it out a few times, but they caved under Blockbuster pressure back when it was big. Called, I think, "Bodies in Motion," it was a series of video vignettes of naked people. One was a nude woman lying in a dark room with a light pulled over her, so it was like watching the sun rising and setting over a mountain range. One clip was a slow-mo (for the time) of a boxer punching a heavy bag where you could see just what that does to the body. One was two modern dancers performing a routine.

I'd love to see it again, but "Bodies in Motion" brings up way too many Google hits and I can't remember anything else about it to help refine the search. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [IIL] "Hamilton" (but still dislike hip-hop), [WEWIL]? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-01 14:15:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I know the [IIL] Hamilton question has popped up here many times already and I've listened to a lot of the suggestions, including Lin-Manuel Miranda's Spotify list of songs that inspired him.

Didn't help.

I love the dazzling word-play of "Hamilton" and the energy and underdog arrogance of rap translated into the story of the American Revolution. but I'm still not hearing any other hip-hop or rap I like. The subject rarely speaks to me (middle-aged white dude) and the pounding club beats turn me off almost immediately. Also, "Hamilton" has a strong sense of humor running throughout, and that's important to me.

(Which may also suggest why I like Weird Al's parodies of rap songs more than I like the originals. I also appreciate some of MC Frontalot's work.)

What I like are the rapid-fire lyrics that express complex subjects in inventive ways while avoiding nonsense phrases just to force a rhyme, but I may be coming at "Hamilton" from the Gilbert   Sullivan, Stephen Sondheim direction. I love the songs "Stone Cold Crazy" by Queen and "Walk This Way" by Aerosmith, for example. 

What else might I like, rap or otherwise?

	<DATE> 2016-06-11 16:08:22 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My friend Dave wants to start cycling again, we both stopped years back once we moved into a house in the woods with a mile of soft, sugar-sand-filled dirt roads before the paving starts. But he's getting back into shape and misses his biking days, and he [found this one](http://www.sun.bike/product_detail.php?cl2=CRUISER cl3=SPIDER).

Questions:
So what is a moto-cruiser? Company-specific brand name? New style? Or is it just the old beach cruiser us old guys are used to, with fatter tires?

Instead of getting this one for $800 (which won't be happening) could he make something similar by putting big tires on a beach cruiser? Or are there features to this one we're not seeing? (Maybe a wider forkend to accommodate the tires?)

Are there other suggestions for a good soft-sand bike that runs around $300-400? A more expensive bike may be in his future, but he doesn't want to go big until he's sure he'll keep doing it.

Any help would be appreciated.

	<TEXT> Why aren't there any new novels in the world of the BBC's Sherlock?

Would it be a licensing thing? I had thought Sherlock Holmes was in the public domain now, although I understand some of the classic elements that were added in later productions aren't yet. Would it be a control issue? They don't seem to have that problem with Doctor Who.

As long as writers don't make any lasting changes or reveal any past history that would conflict with the creators' plans, why not? I'd think it would be an obvious merchandising tie-in and some excellent works. Has anyone with the show ever said?

More to the point, I WANT TO READ NEW SHERLOCK STORIES. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have a novel in my head. It's been there for nearly a decade now, in different forms, and I've tried writing it over and over. Here's my problem:

I know what the story is. I know what the underlying themes are, who the characters are, and how I want it to end. But since I've started I've changed the POV from 3rd to 1st back to 3rd, had breakthroughs that led to big changes in how the story progresses, and, most recently, realized that the whole first third of the book, taken out of context, could easily be seen as insensitive to some real world events.

So I have 7 or 8 rewritten versions of varying lengths, some different styles and a wide range of changes, and now I'm stalled in the water. I still love the story in my head but I'm having real problems finding the way forward. Any suggestions? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Back in the early 90s there was a 16,000 Movies videostore nearby that carried a lot of strange and obscure videos. One of them was called, I believe, "Bodies in Motion" and it was a series of short videos that all displayed human bodies. 

One was a nude woman lying on a floor in a pitch black room while a single light moved over her back and forth, creating amazing landscape effects, like time-lapse sunrises. 

One was a boxer, slamming his fists into a heavy bag in extreme slow motion (for the time) so you could see just what that does to the human body.

One was of a pair of naked dancers performing ballet. (I think. I also rented "Oh, Calcutta" around the same time and I may have those confused, but I'm pretty sure there was dance involved.)

There were more but I can't remember them. It was a cool video but Blockbuster bought the place out and I missed buying a copy when I might have had a chance. Decades later, you know what happens when you Google "Bodies in Motion"? Yeah, no luck. I'd love to know where I can get a copy.  </TEXT>
