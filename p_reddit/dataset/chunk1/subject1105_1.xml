	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi! I've been playing the RTS for about less than a month and am super addicted, but I still haven't fully grasped team building for different purposes. I don't have any 5 stars so I could really use the best team composition I have. Here are the good 3/4* toons I have:

4* fast Siddiq

4* fast Jesus

2 x 4* tough Shane

4* Olivia

4* alert Maggie

4* fast Abraham

4* Denise

4* Hershel

4* Amy

4* strong Heath

4* Lori


3* Dr. Stevens

3* Holly

3* Axel

3* "Miles Behind Us" Rick

3* "Made to Suffer" Rick

3* strong Eugene

3* Sandy

They're not all maxed out yet, but assuming they are, who should make up my raid attack/raid defense/zombie/human teams and their corresponding leaders?

Thanks for taking the time to read this! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I recently just got back into watching kdramas and really like Descendants of the Sun and Cheese in the Trap. I like rom-com shows that are light but captivating with characters you get attached to, or those with a very strong plot going on. Also it helps if the guys are cute too (lol). Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi, I'm looking for a compact camera and there are far too many options in the market that I can't decide (also, I don't really know what to look for). Currently, I just take photos with my iPhone and I know the quality is decent, but I'd like an even better one. I don't plan on venturing deeper into photography, and all I'm after is the quality of photos and the convenience (nothing too bulky/heavy). My budget would be around $500 to $600. Thanks in advance! </TEXT>
