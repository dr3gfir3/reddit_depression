	<TEXT> The "stranger danger" campaign has unfortunately backfired in North America for this very reason. Kids need to be aware that any unwanted touching, or going anyplace with anyone they know or don't know without a parents permission, is wrong. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I just found out the abusive mother I had no contact with few years died in 2012. I feel relieved, so I know the feeling. Your mother sounded like a narcissist. Come join us at r/raisedbynarcissists, a completely supportive and fantastic community here on Reddit for the unfortunate offspring of narcissists. In the meantime I hope your brother is doing well, you, I believe, will be just fine.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, exactly. Death is a part of life, so is pain. They need to know that she was spared from pain, that it's okay to be sad and that they can remember her and keep her in their hearts always. Frame pictures of her for the kids, tell silly stories, hug each other and cry together. And tell them it WILL be okay. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I look at it as "Who is the adult?", "Who is the child?". My mother (and my father, who love him, not narcissistic but a little co-dependent) had complete role reversal thing going on with me. Not my brother as much. It's like I'm the only person in my family who can function in society. Well, two of them are dead now, but my brother is a narcissistic drunk, just like my mother, thankfully I'm NC with that train wreck, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't ever forgive her. There isn't a bone in my body that could. I would have considered it if my apology for the abuse would've have been forthcoming, but smearing me to my relatives to make herself look better and turning the whole abuse situation around on an innocent child is unforgivable. I have, however, learned to move on. All my memories of her are bad. Literally. So any peace I have with her death is the fact that she can no longer poison my life. And that feels FANTASTIC. </TEXT>

I made a lot of changes to MY lifestyle in those two years, however, lost 120 lbs, started running, eating right. I've kept the weight off for the most part (I fluctuate up up down 30 lbs). My mother died of cancer. I don't know what type, but my bet is on lung cancer, she was a two pack a day smoker for 40 years. I quit smoking around the same time I went NC. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm so sorry for the loss of your husband :(. She was only 56 so while I kinda HOPED she'd die, I didn't think I'd be so lucky, so young. Ugh. That sounds bad. I mourned for few days because the "fantasy" that she might show up and apologize and be the perfect mother was dead. But that never happened, and wouldn't have ever, so for my life, at least, her being gone is a big plus. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That is exactly the part that I mourn. I lost my "good" parent, my Dad, in 2008. And while it was a bit of a shock to stumble across her obituary, I wasn't surprised no one let me know. She told her sister and mother that she cut ME out of HER life because I was a drug addict/alcoholic that wouldn't let her help me (Sigh, lies, you know the drill). The only thing that REALLY bothers me is that neither one my parents lived past their 61st birthday. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In a little over a month and a half you'll be gone five years. I can't believe it. Sometimes it feels like you've been gone for an eternity, sometimes it feels like yesterday. I think about you every single day. Not one goes by where I don't miss you. It seems I always see I joke I know you'd like, or a fishing or golf related item that I would've bought you for Father's Day or your birthday. You would've been 65 this year. The day after I turned 37 and four days after your oldest grandson turned 17. He's gotten so big. Both the boys have. They miss you so much, too. I miss you for them. My heart aches when I see their pain. As the anniversary quickly approaches I wonder if it ever gets better. Will it ever hurt less? Will I ever not regret that our last words were spoken in anger? Do you know how much I love you?  </TEXT>
