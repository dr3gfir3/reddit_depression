	<TEXT> My source is the blu-ray collection's commentaries and interviews in the bonus features so I will undoubtedly be missing many more examples.

To give context, remember that in the OT, blue screen was used for cockpits and space fights, matte paintings were pervasive such as the exteriors of Sky City and the farther backgrounds inside the Death Star.

Digital must have made the most sense to Lucas. Audiences had been loving ILM's photorealistic work (which he founded) on Jurassic Park along with nearly every nineties blockbuster, to increase to an epic scale and have certain things like the duel on Mustafar it could not have been done otherwise, and they did have a budget.

I think there's a misconception there is more blue screen than actually used because the prequels are the most obvious example but that had been the trend in blockbusters, the original trilogy didn't use it nearly as much because the technology was nascent but now nearly every movie and show uses it for even basic scenes, and aesthetically it looks so clean that real objects are mistaken for digital as you'll see below, but it makes sense to the story as the Republic was at peace.

Lucas due to his mandate to show audiences new things as he had with the original trilogy at times took it too far but that's from a well-intentioned desire and boldness that we loved the OT for.
On location: the Tattoine scenes at the homestead, around Mos Was (with some comped in miniature models of houses for the background), Padme's palace was shot in Italy, Padme and Anakin's retreat was shot in Italy at Lake Como

Set in a studio: Padme's bedroom, Count Dooku's spaceship where Anakin kills him, the Tusken raider village, Coruscant exterior sports club, interior sports club, Jedi council room, Dex's diner, Jedi library, the spaceship corridor in episode three where Obi Wan, Yoda and Organa escape was built to match episode four's opening corridor

Miniature models: exterior of Coruscant, Utapau sink hole and Grievous' headquarters on it, Mustafar (lava world), Kashyyyk (Wookie world) landing beach, Kashyyyk tree/headquarters, the droid tanks which were exploded practically, podrace stadium
Full models: Obi Wan's plane, various cockpits and wings, Mustafar dueling area, Anakin's ship </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2015-09-26 18:38:18 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Firstly, they look similar.  They also both started out playing cocky doofuses, Seann in American Pie and Chris Pratt in Wanted and Parks and Rec, then they started to scruff up with facial hair and bulk up, Seann with The Rundown and Stark Raving Mad, Chris with Guardians of the Galaxy, but Chris hit the mainstream while Seann has an enviable career as well.  

I'd argue that Chris has a less weaselly face, more broad-jawed, and the Parks and Rec role helped humanize him, while Seann didn't have that role; this limited Seann's appeal whereas Chris's appeal expanded.

Seann needs to get on that sitcom. </TEXT>

It asked if I wanted system restore, I clicked yes, startup repair still in progress.

System repair finished though wasn't entirely successful.  Don't know what happened with system restore as though I clicked yes that second time, no further action by computer was taken.

The computer turned off, I freaked out a bit, turned it back on and selected start normally and prayed, it did start normally, no longer stuck at the update screen, I saved all my important files to my flash drive, tried turning Windows update off from task manager but it turns back on and gobbles up my computers resources, so I'm going to step away for a bit and let it do its thing.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They took something I love and made them fight to the death.  And they made me complicit by watching and paying for them to put on the horror show.  I liked the dinos more than the cold-but-comes-around ron howard in a wig and heels, the arrogant and unwantedly creepy and got what was coming to him billionaire, and the annoying teen who grows to love his brother - yawn.  I hated the humans for making the dinos for their amusement and profit, then making them choose between their dino-bros or humans (the velociraptors).  We did not need dino-hybrids, because you may have no imagination and love the original dinos doesnt mean we lack.  We did not need a military team going in to kill dinos, imagine if you had to watch Harry Potter and his friends get shot up, or the animals at Seaworld.  And we are supposed to care when the pterodactyls attack humans?  When they have dino-shamu in a itty bitty tank and make T-Rex fight and get injured in their battle?  If they're trying to make a point that we are guilty, make it in a documentary not a summer blockbuster.  Just rewatch the original instead because the real monster is this movie.

	<TEXT> When I don't dress up or I haven't washed my car, the cashiers aren't nearly as nice if I do.

I was in line first but the waitress stops checking me out as I'm paying and checks out an older man.  

I see a cashier flirt with a handsome customer and when I come her smile disappears.  

A rich man asks only me to move away at the bar so he could watch tv though there are many other people there.

A Vegas dealer asks only me to stop bending the cards though I'm not the only one doing it.
