	<TEXT> Yes, and I try to crouch it in age appropriate terms. My last major self-harming session, my youngest was only 4 and didn't really understand what was going on with mom. My older one and I have had talks about BPD and depression. Mostly I state how some people have different ways their brain works, and my brain works so I feel really big emotions. We also talk about self-care (I take a lot of time out for me whenever I feel overwhelmed). I also take medications, and we talk about how some people just need it in order to help them be better as a person.

I can probably get my older son to answer some questions from his point of view as well, if you have any for him. </TEXT>
