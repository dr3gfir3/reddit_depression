	<TEXT> cooking, but more specifically breakfast. There have been countless times where I wake up hungry and have been able to fix myself some nice eggs and toast, or even an omelette in quick time. Otherwise you have to drag yourself out of bed to go out or just warm up some pop tarts. For other meals, you have a lot more time to prepare and you're already out.  </TEXT>
