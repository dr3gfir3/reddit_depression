	<TEXT> the learning curve isn't such that your second time you will be massively better that the first.

Maybe I didn't put it right, sorry. what I wanted to say is to get a bit trained on paid sex not exactly couple of times . the thing is with the depression, my self esteem is already low. and Its not easy to handle the embarrassment, otherwise for a fully healthy person with no self respect issues what you have said makes sense.
