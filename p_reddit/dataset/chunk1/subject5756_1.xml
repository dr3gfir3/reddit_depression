	<TEXT> The Panache Jasmine came in, and

1) I'm not even as I thought, I'm not very full on top, and

2) I made the mistake of doing this in the middle of my period - never realized that my breasts swell up during that time

Wearing a 30 felt wonderful, even though the straps were kind of uncomfortable.  I'm not sure why that was, although they seemed to hit wider than I'm used to (closer to the shoulder than evenly between my neck and shoulder).  I'm hoping the 30F fits better than the 30FF.  If not, do you know which styles are better for full on the bottom and not-so-much on top?

Edit: Just looked up the scoop and swoop - now only a little big at the top!  This will do nicely as a period bra. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I got it at Rabbit Rescue, which is also where I adopted my second bunny. They don't sell items online, but I purchased it when I adopted him. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's so beautiful!  I would love to build something more permanent, but my bunnies love their 4 story Maze Haven mansion.  They're really big on remodeling, so I just change out the cardboard every so often (that way they're not remodeling MY furniture, if you know what I mean...).

	<TEXT> My bunnies hate being put on their backs, so I found a way to minimize the time I put them in the bunny burrito (covering their eyes and petting their heads for a bit while they are in burrito does seem to calm them down a bit though).  My shower has a little seat on it that's the perfect size for a bunny to lay on, so I put them up there to clip their front paws.  I let them get comfortable and then clip their front nails one at a time, turning them to the side for better access.  They were squirmy at first, but they got the hang of it after awhile.  The back nails still need to be trimmed in a burrito, though.  Sometimes I hold them under an arm, but other times I hold them between my thighs so I have the usage of both hands. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your specific feedback.  I just purchased a Cleo Lily in 30F and a Panache Jasmine in 30FF so I can get a feel for which is best. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> [Measurement Checks] From 34B to 30F/FF... really?! </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-07-19 04:48:20 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I did the measurements, but am still in disbelief about the results.  I actually had measurements done at Victoria's Secret years ago and she told me I was 36A.  I always wore 34B, but most of the bras I used at that size didn't fit properly.  Anytime I wore a bra that was less than full coverage, I would be spilling out.  

I used the 5 measurement numbers and the site provided which say that the 30F/FF in UK terms actually translates to 30G in the US - where I am from.  Here are the numbers I came up with for measurements (in inches):

1. 29.5
2. 27.25
3. 35.5
4. 38
5. 36

Also just found out that my breasts are projected, narrow, and even using the other measurement charts here.
