	<TEXT> I agree :p.  
I know sometimes people don't like that so many of Lette's filings are ganache, but I think they're done very well. Definitely my go-to when I go to LA. Although, Laduree is making its way to the Grove in the near future,  which will be nice. I still think I like Lette better though. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Haha basically. Ever since I saw a macaron with a curd filling, I've been in love with them. I used to always make white chocolate ganaches (I never liked the taste of buttercreams), but would have issues if the fruit had a subtle flavor, so it wasn't able to cut through the richness of the white chocolate.  
I don't really have this issue with curds. Well, it's a slightly different problem. For non-citrus curds, I use some lemon juice and this can be a bit overwhelming if the fruit is super subtle (like dragonfruit).   
That, and I'd always just guesstimate how much cream to add and would always end up splitting my ganache. I was getting tired of frantically running around trying to save it. (I really wish I could replicate good ganaches I try at places like Kesourine and Chantal Guillon in the Bay Area or Lette in SoCal).  
Oh, also I am pretty happy with how curds absorb super nicely into the shell. I used to always make my ganaches too thick, so they wouldn't really absorb and leave a cruchy macaron -__-.  
My favorite filling, by far, was a taro halaya [I've also really liked ube halayas]. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I do. For the shell at least. The filling for this was a mixture between a curd and a ganache because I skipped an ingredient for the curd and it never thickened, so I added some white chocolate. I'm sure a curd, made well would have been fine though.  I'm copying and pasting the recipe I posted [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/food/comments/5as6dh/homemade_dragonfruit_macarons/) or from [Mario'z Eats](http://bit.ly/2eT7P74).  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
41.66 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. If you want food coloring, add it at the soft peaks stage.  
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Rambutan Curd  
1 cup fruit of choice pureed (this doesn't have to be super precise, since you can always just reduce down your mixture for a longer or shorter time) [for these rambutan ones, I pureed 5]    
50 g granulated sugar  
16 g cornstarch  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (sometimes less)  
 nbsp;  
1. Puree and strain. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar and sifted corn starch. I also just add the lemon juice, so that I can make a nice non-lumpy mixture.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up juice onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the pot and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste.  
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time.  
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.  
6. See my post above on how to do the swirl thing.  
7. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness! The flavor tasted much better after resting as well.  
Gluck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I removed a small amount of batter out before it was fully mixed and added food coloring to that. I piped out the main macarons and then added some of the colored batter in the middle and swirled it around with a toothpick.

	<TEXT> Just make sure not to overfold your egg whites into the rest of your batter. If you haven't made a sponge before, check out videos on Youtube on how to make a roll cake. This recipe interestingly doesn't have you make a meringue and instead just has you beat the egg whites. Still worked, though.  
Also, it says use medium peaks. I think I did stiff peaks and I had some difficulty fully incorporating without deflating. So yea, would recommend taking it to medium.   
Gluck! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure thing. I followed the recipe from [The Little Epicurian] (http://www.thelittleepicurean.com/2014/03/matcha-green-tea-swiss-roll-strawberry-mousse.html) .  
I filled it with a guava whipped cream. I used 3/4 a guava to make the puree and cut up the other 1/4 and placed it in the whipped cream before rolling. I didn't add any gelatin and I also found that her recipe involves wayyy too much cream. I only used about 235 g  (1 cup) of whipping cream. 250 g will probably be safe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And for the recipe: make two different lava cake bases, one dark chocolate and one guava.  
This is only for like 4ish servings.  
NOTE: The guava puree made the base a bit runny, so I threw it in the fridge to cool a bit before piping it into the ramekin.  
 nbsp;  
69g chocolate [dark or white depending on base]  
20g butter  
40g sugar  
1 egg  
35 g guava puree  (strained)
25g flour  
 nbsp;  
1. Melt chocolate and butter over a double boiler.  
2. Take off double boiler. Stir in sugar and mix until smooth.  
3. Add egg. Mix.  
4. If guava base, add this now. Mix.  
5. Sift in flour (or add presifted flour). Stir until smooth and put into a piping bag.  
6. Pipe the chocolate base (I go in swirls from center outward and then along the sides.) to "coat" the ramekin. Then pipe the guava base within this chocolate one. Finally cover up the top with more chocolate base. Chill in fridge for a bit (10-15min is probably fine). I actually didn't chill these guava ones and they were okay. However, I think I got lucky.  
7. Bake at 450F for 9.5 min (that's what I did and it worked). I scrape along the sides of the ramekin and then put a plate on top and flip over.   
Try a single tester one first to see if it's able to come out nicely. If too runny, go for another minute and not runny, then bake for less. When it's in the oven, the center should not be drooping down and should not look wet.  
 nbsp;  
I plated it over some guava puree, which helped add some more freshness. </TEXT>
