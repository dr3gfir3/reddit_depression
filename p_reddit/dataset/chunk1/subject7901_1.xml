Long-term care is a social cost and a social responsibility.  The answer to Pay or Die should not be the rich live and the rest of us are discarded. </TEXT>

Market forces determine that consultants will be weeded out of the consultant selection pool if their findings are adverse to industry interests. The real problem is that we have outsourced the brain work needed to implement policy to a class of actors whose methodology reflects private rather than public interests. Unless this systemic problem is consciously recognized, the restricted range of questions that these consultants analyze will be taken as the whole picture, and ICF will pass muster as doing "state of the art" analysis. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Comment by Don McCanne:  Sen. Bernie Sanders chaired a Senate committee hearing on what the health care system in the United States can learn from other countries. Tsung-Mei Cheng provided an excellent overview of single payer and of the sharp contrasts between the United States and other nations. Her 28 page statement is well worth downloading to use as an information resource in educating others about single payer.
Other informative presentations included those of Victor Rodwin on France, Ching-Chuan Yeh on Taiwan, Danielle Martin on Canada, and Jakob Kjellberg on Denmark. Even the presentations from the other side by Sally Pipes and David Hogberg were helpful in that they showed how silly (sadly) their views were when contrasted with a group of experts who understand well how systems based on solidarity work.

China is the source of some of the largest counterfeit manufacturing operations that we find globally, said John P. Clark, Pfizers chief security officer, who added that Chinese authorities were cooperative.
The United States has become so dependent on Chinese imports, however, that the F.D.A. may not be able to do much about the Chinese refusal. The crucial ingredients for nearly all antibiotics, steroids and many other lifesaving drugs are now made exclusively in China. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pipelines would make sense if fossil fuels could continue to be used at the current or an expanding rate for decades -- long enough to pay for the new infrastructure and its maintenance over time.  But climate risk is real, and fossil fuel use must be capped and ratcheted down over time.  Long-term investments like pipelines don't make economic sense (they're only attractive for developers who will take the money and stick the taxpayers with the cost of the environmental damage and decommissioning of stranded assets). Now it is clear that the short-term alternative, the rail system, is inadequate for even the current output of oil.  
This reflects a failure of public policy to take responsibility for feasible consequences.  It is the price of not committing to a rapid transition to renewable alternatives to fossil fuels.
The shale oil boom has hit a transportation wall.  Shale and tar sand oil are not energy solutions -- just seductive mirages that have kept focus off of the urgent need for development of an energy efficient and renewable future. </TEXT>

 The role of the British and the French was even more sinister, as they actually colluded with the Serbian architects of genocide. This was confirmed at the highest level recently by the White House historian Taylor Branch in his book The Clinton Tapes (2009). In taped interviews with Branch, which were released after a ten-year hiatus, President Bill Clinton recounted how the British and French insisted on maintaining the embargo on the defenseless Bosnians: "They justified their opposition on plausible humanitarian grounds, arguing that more arms would only fuel the bloodshed, but privately, said the president, key allies objected that an independent Bosnia would be `unnatural' as the only Muslim nation in Europe. He said that they favored the embargo precisely because it locked in Bosnia's disadvantage." Branch, in conversation with Clinton, continued: "When I expressed shock at such cynicism, reminiscent of the blind-eye diplomacy regarding Europe's Jews during World War II, President Clinton only shrugged. He said that President Francoise Mitterand of France had been especially blunt in saying that Bosnia did not belong, and that British officials also spoke of a painful but realistic restoration of Christian Europe." None of this was lost on Serbian leaders like Radovan Karadzsic, Momcilo Krajisnik, or Nikola Koljevic, who would repeatedly state that they were actually doing the West a favor by preventing the emergence of a Muslim-majority state in Europe.

A large enough security force to genuinely protect public diplomats would have required a quasi-occupation force, like that in Iraq and Afghanistan.  That was politically untenable. The alternative was to gamble that control by friendly locals would be achieved before hostile forces mobilized themselves to strike.  That proved to be wishful thinking.

	<TEXT> Steve Kornacki on MSNBC floated a different theory about why Christie's people shut down two-thirds of Fort Lee's GW Bridge access. There's a billion dollar development project in Fort Lee, right next to where the lane closures occurred. The project is Mayor Sokolich's major accomplishment in office. Close the lanes, and the entire project could be derailed.
What Kornacki doesn't say is that closing the lanes would demonstrate that the project would not be viable without the cooperation of Christie. Demonstrating his ability to cut access to the bridge means that the developers would have to pay to play -- contributions, jobs for cronies, etc. It would show that Sokolich could not deliver the basic service of mobility without Christie. Unfortunately for Christie, this act of intentional sabotage succeeded too well. Too much collateral damage. Too much public outcry. And the tissue of lies that Christie's cronies had set up as a defense -- the traffic study for the "Reallocation of Lanes on the GWB" was totally unconvincing. When they saw they were in trouble, the coverup began. And the coverup will be the basis for future indictments.
It is now clear that there was a conspiracy to deny their involvement by Christie operatives. Christie had a need not to know what was done on his behalf. The fact that these folks used more muscle than brain has got them into their current fix. It's hard to believe that they were smart enough to shield CC from contagion. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Those of us who have always been for Healthcare for All were very clear in laying out the problems with the current law, at each stage of the many "compromises" that got vested interests to sign on.  We see private insurance companies and other major corporate players hijacking a vital human service to maximize profit.  That is what has made American healthcare so unaffordable and dysfunctional.  ACA deals with some of the problems, but creates others, and leaves many problems unaddressed.  Single Payer or Medicare for All points us in the right direction -- looking at providing quality affordable healthcare for all.  But slogans are not answers.  The substance of building a decent healthcare system requires many actions, such as investing in the education of medical practitioners so that they don't have to charge a fortune to pay back their med school debts.  Once ACA starts saving lives -- and it will -- it will become clear why it can't be repealed without a better law to replace it.  Then the serious conversation can begin. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point of looking at the many unintended consequences of the ACA is not to go back to a mythical market solution, but to learn and change what is wrong.  Healthcare should be allocated based on medical need, not ability to pay.  We pay for national defense to protect us.  We know that we can't afford to defend ourselves, gun in hand, when the scale of the threat goes outside the range of personal confrontation.  For healthcare, or fire or police protection to work, or to get from place to place, we need to build structures in common, which are publicly funded.  Insurance schemes are not the right way to think about healthcare as a societal problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  This comprehensive report lays to rest once and for all the the rumor that physicians are leaving Medicare in droves. Most physicians accept new Medicare patients, and less than 1 percent have formally opted-out of the Medicare program.
An improved Medicare would be even more attractive to physicians, especially if it covered everyone. It would dramatically reduce hassles with intrusive third party payers so that physicians could spend most of their time doing what they devoted their lives to - taking care of their patients.
As far as the threat that physicians would quit if we enacted an improved Medicare for all, first of all, very few would leave - likely less than 1 percent - and, second, since most of those who would leave seem to be more interested in money rather than patients (think concierge), we really dont want them around anyway.

	<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  To pass the Affordable Care Act, President Obama was convinced that he had to gain the support of the health financing and health care industries. He did. Look who's profiting.
Who loses? Those who will have to pay much more out of pocket for health care because of higher deductibles. Those who lose choice of their physicians and hospitals because of narrower provider networks, and end up losing catastrophic protection because of care inadvertently received out of network. Those who will be contributing through taxes or insurance premiums far more than they should have to because of the profoundly wasteful administrative excesses of our dysfunctional financing system. That's most of us. The improvements in insurance plans for the few - guaranteed issue and community rating - do not begin to offset the deterioration that is beginning to take place in the employer-sponsored plans where most of us receive our health care coverage.
There are a few of us who will gain, some by being enrolled in Medicaid and some by receiving subsidies for exchange plans, but the numbers of us who will lose is far greater than the numbers who will win.
We could have had reform in which we would all be winners - an improved Medicare that covers everyone. Even those who will gain through Medicaid or subsidies would gain much more under a single payer system. But no, political feasibility dictated that the vested stakeholders of the medical-industrial complex be the ones who get the money, while the rest of us pay more and get less.

	<TEXT> Marx is useful in providing tools for the analysis of how societies function.  For example, ideologies don't come out of pure thought but reflect material conditions and interests.  Unfortunately, "Marxism" does not stand outside, looking down on the world, as some Marxists seem to believe.  Marxism is a part of the world it wishes to analyze, and got used to defend some terrible regimes.  The useful question for me is: how can we organize production to meet human needs.  I think that capitalism creates more problems than it can solve.  Profit motive doesn't work when trying to defend the environment.  If global warming cannot be ruled out as a risk, then it must be the basis for a global response.  We must live within our planetary resource limits and produce enough to meet basic needs.  In short, there is more than enough real work to be done for everyone, and much of the reward in living must be non-material.  What we can afford to be is spiritually ambitious.
The trick is to use all of the tools of self-organization, not just the profit motive, to move us towards a humane and sustainable world.  The sense of pride -- the story that makes our lives worthy of remembering by future generations -- is not in our accumulation of toys, but in how we express ourselves, work together, and treat each other.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  The value-based payment modifier - an adjustment in payments to reward physicians for improving value in the health care they provide, or to punish them for providing lower value - is yet another example of the often misguided measures in the Affordable Care Act allegedly designed to improve our health care system, when, in fact, the fundamental reforms in the health care financing system that we really needed were barely touched upon, in deference to the private insurance industry.
It will be difficult to change from a volume-based system (fees based on volume of services provided) to a value-based payment system when we still do not know how to define the value of physician services, as Drs. Berenson and Kaye explain to us in this NEJM article, though they do suggest some other modest measures that might have some benefit.
It is fine to continue research on measures that have a potential for improving value in health care, but it is almost criminal to ignore a concept that has already been proven in other nations to dramatically increase value - potentially a far greater increase than all of the other measures combined that are included in the Affordable Care Act. Of course, that concept is single payer financing. Lets first enact an improved Medicare for all, and then we could tweak the system with measures that might provide incremental improvements in value. But first things first.

	<TEXT> Nordhaus is rational and not a denier of science.  So he recognizes the problem.  But he fails to understand the game-changing requirements for any solution. The problem with Nordhaus' methodology is that commodified wealth, valued in money, is his universal metric.  This leads to the fallacy that if you have enough wealth, you can buy anything, including mitigation and adaptation for climate change.  But that disregards every form of wealth that cannot be bought and sold.  Degrading natural wealth in the service of commodified wealth is how we got to the fix we're in -- not only on climate, but in many other dimensions.  Mobilizing resources to fight climate change is not a market function.  It is a global and governmental function.  It requires making the transition from following the agenda of private accumulation to that of meeting common needs. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don McCanne Comment:  The new health plans to be offered in the exchanges are avoiding excessive premium increases by using narrow networks of physicians and by lowering payment rates for health services. The leaders of our nations leading organizations of health care professionals are concerned enough about what this might do to patient access that they met with Obama administration officials at the White House.
The administration officials were already "acutely aware" of these problems. Of course, they were. They result from fundamental design flaws in the financing model of the Affordable Care Act. The model was designed by and for the private insurance industry.
It is likely that members of these professional organizations are not only concerned about the patients, narrow networks and lower payments have a direct effect on their livelihoods. In a well designed system, patients must always come first, but the professionals taking care of the patients should be content as well. Grumpy doctors and nurses detract from an optimal patient care environment.
There will be more discontentment as the Obamacare model of high-deductibles, narrow networks, and payment restrictions extend to employer-sponsored private plans. These trends will no doubt expand with the proliferation of private insurance exchanges catering to employers - exchanges outside of the government-operated Obamacare exchanges. Even the private Medicare Advantage plans are being modified in response to their overpayments being pared back. UnitedHealth, the nations largest private insurer, has notified thousands of physicians that they are being dropped from their Medicare Advantage network.
Do we really want to keep headed in this direction?
The traditional Medicare program does not use narrow networks. Patients have their choice of their health care professionals. Medicare payment rates are higher than the rates expected to be offered by most of the exchange plans. It would not take much to improve Medicare, and then it would be an ideal program for covering everyone.
You can bet that the representatives of these professional groups didn't ask for single payer to be put on the table. Too bad.

	<TEXT> Don McCanne's Comment:  Insurers will be paying physicians less through their exchange plans than they do through their existing commercial plans. If the rates turn out to be typically 30 or 40 percent less, as this article suggests, they will have problems maintaining adequate provider networks. An insurance card is of little value if you cannot find physicians who will accept it.
As we said from the start, those designing health care reform were making a terrible mistake when they decided to make health insurance premiums affordable while largely ignoring health care costs.
Look what they did:
* They assigned very low actuarial values to the plans that most individuals will select, leaving 30 to 40 percent of health care costs to be paid by the patient, though some will receive inadequate subsidies.
* They designed plans with very high deductibles, causing the large percentage of patients who need less care to receive virtually no sickness or injury benefits from their plans.
* They reduced the size of their provider networks which will reduce spending by making care less accessible, especially specialized care.
* Now it appears that they will be reducing provider payments to levels that will be rejected by many physicians. Although employer-sponsored plans are moving in the same direction, it is likely that many physicians will limit their practices to these plans and cash-paying patients, while avoiding patients in the exchange plans and the chronically-underfunded Medicaid program.
* As part of the SGR fix, legislators are considering not allowing any inflationary increases in the Medicare program for the next ten years - keeping the payment rates flat. If so, physicians are apt to leave the Medicare program as payment rates approach that of Medicaid.
As we approach $3 trillion in health care spending, this is criminal! For that kind of spending, everyone could have high quality health care. Instead, we get a system that perpetuates disparities in health care while creating financial burdens for precisely those individuals who most need health care.
The entire health care system will not collapse, but this experiment will perform so miserably that most will consider it to be a failure. We dont need to go back to the drawing boards. We merely need to enact a system that we already know will achieve our goals - an improved Medicare for all.

	<TEXT> Americans are over-medicated. And under-medicated too.  The trick is to provide everyone with appropriate care -- where the incentives do not drive the treatment plan.  The hopeful aspect of Obamacare is that it is an attempt to address real problems.  It has broken through the cowardice bias that lets politicians avoid difficult issues. And now that the mold is broken, now that the rolling collapse that was the old system cannot be re-established for anybody, we will be forced to save ourselves from the many unintended side-effects of this new course.  Talk is no longer cheap.  There are consequences.  Denial and passivity are no longer options.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This 2013 survey sponsored by the Commonwealth Fund is very helpful during the Affordable Care Act transition because it tells us how the United States is doing compared to ten other industrialized nations with universal systems. Our results are terrible, and when we look ahead at the changes yet to be implemented, it is clear that they will have an almost negligible impact on correcting the serious deficiencies in the United States.
Our per capita costs will remain far higher than those of other nations. Our insurance products will remain very expensive yet highly flawed in design since they leave those individuals who have significant health care needs with high medical cost burdens. The excessive complexity of our insurance products will continue to waste hundreds of billions of dollars that could be used on health care. Measures intended to provide much needed reinforcement of our primary care infrastructure are all too meager, so timely access to care will remain impaired for too many.
Three-fourths of Americans believe that we need fundamental changes or complete rebuilding of our health system. We have a far greater percentage dissatisfied than are in the other developed nations. Although it will be several weeks before the exchange plans and the Medicaid expansions will be in effect, most Americans will not be able to detect any improvements in their health care financing and access.
In fact, many will have greater out-of-pocket costs because of increased shifting of costs to patients through measures such as high deductibles, and others will lose access to their current health care professionals and institutions because of the greater use of narrow provider networks - further reducing choices in health care. In spite of the noble intentions of the Affordable Care Act, most of us will not see any correction of the serious flaws demonstrated in this international survey which shows how costly and dysfunctional our system is, and too many of us will be even worse off.
As we watch the 2014 implementation unfold, we have to keep in mind that it didnt have to be this way. We could have had and still can have a single payer national health program - an improved Medicare covering everyone. With what we spend, we should be at the top in these international comparisons. Single payer would get us there.

	<TEXT> The deeper problem is in the design of the law itself. The flaw of Obamacare is that it tries to use an insurance model as the means to answer a problem which is not susceptible to private insurance: the compelling moral responsibility of society to provide healthcare to sick people who can't afford it. The best way to do that is to cover the cost through taxes, based on ability to pay. Instead, a government-rigged private insurance model has been created that misrepresents what people are paying for. There is an insurance component which should be priced at the actuarial value of the benefit. When people can't afford to pay. the difference should be subsidized through taxes -- not tacked onto the insurance premiums of those who happen to be at low risk for needing healthcare. Of course, Medicare for All would have avoided these problems. If we had gone that route, we would be talking about the real issues -- like providing enough service at a price we can afford, with enough compensation to keep doctors and hospitals doing their jobs.  Doing the right thing, in a way that would work, means healthcare for all Americans will cost more -- not less.  But if that is spent on real service rather than on profits and waste, it will be money well spent. </TEXT>

Another approach is needed.  Once the U.S. renounces its self-proclaimed entitlement to superstate violence, it may have a chance at redeeming some credibility, and if it works really hard, trust.
One opportunity here that has not been looked at is the political opening offered by the new President of Iran, Rouhani, who has denounced the use of chemical weapons, although he does not blame Assad for their use.
Let the scientists look at the evidence, and confirm Assad's role.  Let Iran know that it is not the object of encirclement, in preparation for an attack.  They have a legitimate interest in protecting the Alawite population of Syria from jihadi annihilation.  But that does not mean they need Assad in power.
A move towards recognizing Iran's long-term defensive needs is a prerequisite for peace in a post-Assad Syria.

	<TEXT> General Scales points out that only Eisenhower understood war well enough to avoid war, despite political pressure.  And that is true.  Eisenhower had enough gravitas based on his commanding role in World War II, to sidestep the trap of the fact-free ideology known as "bipartisan foreign policy".  He refused to entangle the U.S. in Vietnam -- neither to support the French imperial war, nor to militarily engage on behalf of South Vietnam. Eisenhower and his Secretary of State, John Foster Dulles, aggressively used U.S. power to topple democratic governments and support dictators.  Dulles advocated "brinksmanship" -- going to the edge of nuclear Armageddon in order to win a Cold War point.  But Eisenhower had the strength and personal credibility not to use the troops or the bombs or the missiles, because he understood that you do not want to win in your own name.  Because then you become an occupier, and are bled to death, like colonial Britain and France.  Since Eisenhower, American Presidents have been too weak to avoid demonstrating their masculine resolve.  In the name of showing the "credibility" of American power, we have been in near-constant war.  Even under Bill Clinton, Iraq was constantly being bombed.  That ultimately paved the way for Bush's war -- the post-911 demonstration that America was not impotent.  Except it proved the reverse. Today's Iraq is the land conduit for Iran's military support of Assad.  Enter Barack Obama -- a man who once understood what was wrong with America's bankrupt foreign policy.  But now he is "in charge", and it is his "responsibility" to make the same mistakes.  The difference is that he so clearly doesn't really believe in the storyline that he has a terrible time acting the part.  And the audience is walking out on the show.  It can no longer suspend disbelief.  "Trust" died with the meltdown of the credit system. John Kerry's delusional arrogance is not mistaken by almost anyone as expressions of wisdom and principle.  And so it goes.
Now, we learn from General Scales, even the generals no longer believe they can save the day, and come to the rescue of the politicians. (Or, as he calls them, "the U.S. military's civilian masters").
Finally it is time for new ideas.  Since we cannot annihilate nor occupy Assad's Syria, the usable power of the United States is insufficient to counter-balance Assad's calculus. He'll take the punishment and gas his way to victory.  
Only when we see U.S. "enforcement" as counterproductive. can we move on to a new paradigm which is post-superpower-hegemony. Rather, we must recast ourselves, in our own eyes and that of others, as one nation among many, in a world which may be governed by consent and contract, but which cannot be controlled by force.
The real response to Assad's crimes against humanity is to build international solidarity against his regime, shaming those who have supported him into dropping that support. Containment of a pariah state is only possible when a single standard of law and morality is applied to everybody -- to the U.S. and Israel, and to China, Russia, and many others. It is a long haul towards civilization. But we have run out of short-term fixes.
Syria is a good place to start building a sustainable world order. We must call for scrupulous respect for the U.N. investigative process, and prepare charges that are well-documented before the International Court of Justice.
Our immediate task should be to shelter the innocent victims of wars, not create more of them.
A new internationalism based on law seems like idealism, but we cannot afford the burden of being the one superpower -- the one self-appointed adult in charge of all the unruly children. It doesn't work, and it is beginning to look pitiful.
Admission that the old foreign policy has failed would provide the clean break needed to help build a world whose moral roots would be strong and resilient enough to outlast tyrants like Assad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I haven't been able to locate the CPUC document that is the subject of the story, but looking at the CPUC site, it appears that energy storage is rated with respect to its ability to meet peak load demand.  The argument is that to the extent that energy storage can substitute for building additional transmission and distribution capacity for the highest expected peak hours, it is worth a lot in costs which would otherwise have to be undertaken.  In a recent document from EPRI, the default peak period is four hours.  I assume that the 1.325 gigawatt capacity would be continuously available for the four hour period.  Here's the citation:
Cost-Effectiveness of Energy Storage in California
Technical Update, June 2013
http://www.cpuc.ca.gov/NR/rdonlyres/1110403D-85B2-4FDB-B927-5F2EE9507FCA/0/Storage_CostEffectivenessReport_EPRI.pdf

Qualifying capacity is a measure to make sure that the battery has the required duration to  meet system capacity requirement. The default assumption for the duration requirement is  4 hours, which means a 50-MW/2-hr battery would earn value as a 25-MW/4-hr battery  for this service. The qualifying capacity in this case is 25 MW

	<TEXT> If there is convincing evidence, then there is a strong basis for an international diplomatic consensus on action to prevent future use of chemical weapons by the Syrian government.  But a military attack by the United States, especially with the explicit purpose of aiding Assad's opponents, will harden Russia's and Iran's support for Assad.  The only party to "benefit" from such a U.S. attack are the friends of endless war in the Middle East -- those whose status quo interest would be harmed by conflict resolution.  This includes, but is not limited to, the Netanyahu regime. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that Assad does not care about moral condemnation by me or anyone else.  But if the monstrous consequences of his victory plan cannot be denied by anybody -- even the Chinese and Russian states that don't normally give a damn -- then we start to have the basis for long-term collective action.  First comes undeniable facts, then revulsion, then the need to act.  Intelligent appropriate action is more complex.  Start with a ceasefire in place.  All outside players must apply pressure on their clients to give up winner-take-all goals.  Risks taken for peace should be rewarded.    Assad's Alawite base, like Saddam's Sunni base, is composed of real people, who  have to be protected, even as they give up privileges given them by the dictator.  Oppressed Sunnis in Syria, just like oppressed Shi'a in Iraq must not be vengeful.

	<TEXT> President Obama said on "PBS NewsHour." "But we do have to make sure that when countries break international norms on weapons like chemical weapons that could threaten us, that they are held accountable."

That is right.  But the administration's contemplated military action is simply reactive to Syria's crossing Obama's "red  line".   It does not make sense.  It would hurt, not help, in achieving greater security against chemical weapons.

Assad is fighting for his life.  He will do whatever it takes to stay in power.  He knows that military intervention and occupation by the U.S. is not possible.  Therefore, he believes he will survive, and, if he does, he will be seen as stronger for outlasting any outburst of U.S. pique.

And free to use chemical weapons again.  They are the least costly way for his regime to remove opponents from territory Assad needs to control, without destroying physical assets like buildings and infrastructure.

Then what does a shamed and apparently impotent United States do in response? We have too much recent history not to know this recipe for disaster.

Assad needs to normalize the use of chemical weapons in order to take back opposition strongholds.  He wants to re-occupy and re-populate territory, cleansed of opponents -- a truly diabolical crime against humanity.

The usable power of the United States is insufficient to counter-balance Assad's calculus.  Only when this is recognized can we move on to a new paradigm which is post-superpower-hegemony.  Rather, we (I am an American) must recast ourselves, in our own eyes and that of others, as one nation among many, in a world which may be governed by consent and contract, but which cannot be controlled by force.

So if a majority of people who are working earn less than what people on assistance get, it says a lot about how much harder it is for most people than it used to be.  The best incentive for more people to work is a healthy job market, where competition for labor pulls up wages. For a short time, during the housing construction bubble, it looked like all boats would be rising.  But that was an illusion.

The attempt to sustain inequality is anti-human, and there are lots of people who won't let their humanity stand in the way of their support for a brutal failing attempt to tighten the tourniquet on the flow of people across borders.  American well-being rests on the illusion that you can always have cheap goods and services produced by the third world poor, either in their own countries or here as illegal immigrants.  By not understanding the shortsightedness of this, we get both poorer and meaner.  Moving toward global sustainability is a generational task that leads towards equality.

	<TEXT> People of low-socioeconomic status who have high-deductible health plans have 25 to 30 percent fewer emergency department visits for high-severity medical conditions - conditions with a high probability of needing ED-level care within twelve hours. That can't be good.

Since similar trends were not found in people of high-socioeconomic status, the authors suggest that deductibles should be means-based - lower deductibles for those of low-socioeconomic status. But that would add more administrative complexity to our system already overburdened with administrative excesses.

The purpose of the deductibles is to reduce health care spending, but we don't want to do that by not taking care of individuals with high-severity medical conditions. It would be far more efficient to simply eliminate deductibles for everyone and use better, patient-friendly methods of controlling spending. That's what single payer is all about - people getting the health care they need while making it affordable for everyone.

	<TEXT> The attempt to have total surveillance, plus irrational fear, are the foundational structures for totalitarianism.  How close we choose to get to self-imprisonment for the sake of security is the public question raised by Snowden's outing of the surveillance state.
Instead of connecting a limited number of "suspect" dots, there is now a surfeit of dots. They must be processed using an analytical model -- a profiling machine.  Dots can then be selected which are deemed "suspicious".  
The model, itself is a product of an agenda which is never disclosed.  The model that can turn us into suspects is outside our control.  The way to become "noticed" is to dissent from the agenda of those who embody institutional power.  Welcome to  the managerial revolution -- the great convergence that unites the U.S., China, global corporations, etc. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Acts of world-historic courage make us uncomfortable.  What Snowden did was make us confront our loss of control over the apparatus of the state.  The balance between security and freedom has radically shifted. In the name of defending our security, we have been giving those who are supposed to represent our interests an unprecedented ability to control our choices and destinies.  Snowden sees clearly where this leads. Without our ability to control the controllers, we lose the dignity of a free people.  We need not be respected.  An agenda which is not ours will determine our future.  This is where Tea Party and Occupy people, who already understand the threat, must come together to at least try to stem the drift towards a dark new order.  Cynicism is as much an enemy as complacency.  The question is: what steps take us off the path to serfdom?  One thing I know, for myself: Edward Snowden has joined Bradley Manning and Daniel Elsberg as a person who has acted out of conscience for all of our sakes.  There can be no higher reward in life than to follow in their path. </TEXT>

Greece's debt level thus remained undented, but it was now owed to the IMF and euro-zone taxpayers instead of banks and hedge funds.

Comment: Like the bond rating agencies, the IMF analysis of risk was determined by the need for a market-supporting result.  Now that the IMF has acknowledged its intellectual bankruptcy, it is time for a total reorganization.

	<TEXT> The Obama administration's handling of the Benghazi affair reflects business-as-usual politics, brought to a boil by proximity to the 2012 election.  The real problem is that politicians never want to admit that the world, under their watch, is not in good control.  The European and American decision to jettison Qaddafi was not the product of a plan, but an attempt to catch up with spontaneous revolutionary events.  The West sided with the insurrection to recapture Libya as an orderly business-friendly state.  That was what the CIA and Ambassador Stevens saw as their mission, in the face of continuing chaos.  The U.S. government could have withdrawn from the game.  But it could not have guaranteed the safety of its mission against attack, without a massive and infeasible military intervention.  Playing out a weak hand is embarrassing.  The less said the better.  The problem with that default setting is that the public is never treated as adult, never told the risks and complexity.  And an ignorant public goes on to support ignorant and increasingly bellicose politicians, until the cost of ill-conceived interventions becomes both too high and too difficult to hide. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The union anthem, "Solidarity Forever," declares that "no force on earth is weaker than the feeble strength of one." That's why workers need to bargain collectively.  Asymmetry of power makes workers exploitable in the market for labor.  Exactly the same relationship exists -- but even more so -- in the market for vital health services.  This is not like choosing between health clubs, or among yoga instructors.  The newly released database reveals how dangerous it is to rely on "competition", or on the integrity and good faith of health care providers.   When your life is at risk, your decisions are, at best, only partially informed.  You must place your trust, at some point, in people who know things that you can't know.  You need to band together with other people.  You need a powerful advocate.  In a properly functioning society, people would trust the government they elected to perform that function.  (Americans used to trust their government only 50 years ago. Perhaps that was misplaced, but there was a basis for it in the New Deal's response to people's needs.)  Today, there is a lot of wishful thinking covering over deep fear. Many people claim to believe that the market can and will protect their lives. (That works fine as long as you're healthy.)  They have become convinced that the government cannot be used to protect their interests, because, whatever it says it is doing, it is actually working for the interests of others. (Left and right differ as to who is in control of the government's real agenda.)  So, where does that leave us?  With a dysfunctional social order that is threatening our well-being. The U.S. health care system is only the most glaring example of a social disease -- the collapse of institutions that address the overarching causes of systemic problems. I believe that cynicism is a one-way trip to depression and irrelevance.  The re-invention of a collective common will (a society worth fighting for) will require people building institutions that they can again trust, through their own involvement in participatory and democratic movements.  Occupy Wall Street was a first, and faltering, step in the right direction.  More difficult steps are required.
tl;dr: The health care mess won't be fixed until government works.  Making that happen is our job. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Single Payer is not The Answer.  It is simply the first step needed if we are to go in the right direction.
The real problem is that health care -- especially for the aging -- is not appropriately addressed by "insurance" at all. Just like "fire insurance" is not the same as fire protection, health insurance can in no way assure that our health is adequately protected.
That requires provision of a health infrastructure and capacity that must be available to all -- because public health is the most essential public good. If my neighbor and the people I buy stuff from get sick and are untreated, that unnecessary misfortune is contagious. If they go to inadequate congested emergency rooms and I have an emergency, my life is in jeopardy.
We need enough hospitals, clinics, and trained medical personnel so that medical services are not scarce. That is the first step in assuring that they will not be expensive.
A second step is to make sure than new technology -- drugs and medical devices -- are not the source of huge monopoly profits. Much of the R D that gets incorporated into medical advances has already been paid for by the public. Only the profits are privatized.
Funding real health services is not a private responsibility. The ever-higher costs and ever-poorer performance of our current system provide compelling evidence that we can't afford a profit-incentive large enough to make that happen.
Republicans are true believers in the myth that the private profit motive is the great solvent for all problems. It is a simple faith. No further thought is required.
Against the purity of Republican ignorance, the Obama Democrats mounted a deceitful response. By aborting consideration of Medicare for All, and requiring everyone to buy private insurance, the Democrats gave up on a principled alternative to Ryan's  proposed voucher system -- Medicare for None.
It's time to recognize the real problem, and take that first step in the right direction -- Single Payer. It's not so difficult. Imagine our police and fire departments billing indiscriminately for their services. What a mess that would be. We receive a far greater value by using global budgets based on department needs. In the same manner, our hospitals should be globally budgeted based on the health care needs of the community.
We are capable of self government.  Let's do it. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If there is a public benefit from the development and commercialization of  new technologies, how can this best be done so that private funds are induced to evaluate the risk, and undertake the venture (because they determine the reward is worth the risk)?  The best way is for the government to guarantee the purchase of the new product, if, and only if, it meets performance specifications.  Then, if the price needed to induce private investment proves to be excessive, it is a clear indicator that more basic R D is needed.  That could be the signal for direct investment in that work through a national lab.

I heard the report today on NPR about "Family Doctors Consider Dropping Birth Control Training Rule."  Is it your intent to attack women's reproductive health care access?  Remember what happened when the Komen Foundation politicized its mission by defunding Planned Parenthood.  That has not been, and will not be, forgotten.

Your proposed changes to the Family Medicine Program Requirements take out contraception and options counseling for unintended pregnancy and don't include training for miscarriage and abortion.  These changes compromise the care we depend on.

I am very concerned that the proposed program requirements will leave family physicians unable to provide basic reproductive health care, such as birth control, pregnancy options counseling and care for miscarriage.

Women's health is basic health care.  The Family Medicine Program Requirements need to be strengthened, not weakened, to ensure that:

**Family physicians can provide all FDA-approved birth control options, including IUDs and contraceptive implants.
**Family physicians are trained in pregnancy options counseling.  Having a child is one of the most important decisions a woman makes in her life.  Support for healthy families requires nothing less than well-trained clinicians who can counsel women on all their options.
**Family physicians can support women in all of their pregnancy outcomes.  This includes being able to manage miscarriage.  Training in uterine aspiration needs to be included.

Women need to be able to get all their basic health care from their family doctors.  This means improving the family medicine residency program requirements for women's health.

	<TEXT> See Lord Stern's new report, Unburnable carbon 2013: Wasted capital and stranded assets
http://www.carbontracker.org/wastedcapital

Our last hope for averting disastrous climate change depends on drawing a line that contains in place Athabascan tar sand oil. If we are serious about changing course, the Keystone XL pipeline makes no sense. The necessary restriction on carbon use over the life of the pipeline will mean that tar sand oil will not be able to compete economically against other cheaper sources that will fill the quota of allowable carbon emissions. When Trans Canada fails, who will pay the cost of decommissioning the pipeline and restoring the environment?

Of course, it would be wonderful news if you can prove that climate change is not a problem. But if it is, and we have to ratchet down greenhouse gas emissions globally, then the cornucopian promise of an abundant fossil fuel supply only makes the global political task more difficult. The chances are that we will choose an energy high until climate disruption is the only thing people can think about.

Behind all this is climate change. As global warming shrinks the polar ice, resources such as rare earths, iron ore, oil, and gas are becoming more accessible. At the same time, a northern sea route is opening up that is ice-free during the summer months, which could cut 30 percent off Chinas shipping costs to Europe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the study:
Yet bonding and insurance companies may be reluctant to 
provide coverage for water contamination from fracturing, at least until the risks are better understood. One response, then, is to limit fracturing to companies with significant capital, and 
to require parent guarantees to keep firms from avoiding liability with thinly capitalized subsidiaries... If insolvency turns out to be a problem, a mixed liability/government insurance regime
may be needed. The Price Anderson Act, which applies to nuclear power, is one model. The Oil Pollution Act, governing oil spills, is another. In this spirit, any energy company that engages in fracturing could be required to contribute to a general fund, which would cover the damages if the responsible energy company is insolvent. If the fund is exhausted, taxpayers 
would make up the difference.  </TEXT>

Kevin Trenberth, climate analysis chief at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, a federally funded university-run research center, said the report didn't take into account the lack of snowfall in the Rockies the previous winter and how that affected overall moisture in the air. Nor did the study look at the how global warming exacerbated the high pressure system that kept the jet stream north and the rainfall away, he said.
"This was natural variability exacerbated by global warming," Trenberth said in an email. "That is true of all such events from the Russian heat wave of 2010, to the drought and heat waves in Australia." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The report itself is more nuanced than the coverage.  What is clear is that climate models did not predict this drought.  That could mean that the underlying destabilization of the planet's climate patterns is well understood, and this drought was a once-in-x-hundred years anomaly.  Or, it could mean that the energy build-up associated with the net absorption of solar energy, leads to even greater non-linear complexity than can be simulated by current models.  Trenberth's reaction is conjectural.  It is not the outcome of a fully modeled analysis.  That does not mean it is wrong -- or right.  The test will be whether this extreme departure from prediction is, in fact, a singularity, or, the harbinger of unpredicted climate catastrophes coming at accelerated frequency. </TEXT>

Under such complex and uncertain conditions,  designing a system that is both worker-friendly and work-friendly is not simple.

If there is a political will for it, the high cost for developing a non-fossil fuel alternative for transportation should be a public cost -- like defense.

It is pure money illusion to think that our "wealth" is real if the productive basis for meeting real needs is lost -- not only through climate change but also the waste of natural and human resources that accompanies our economic system.  That system (private capitalist, or state capitalism as in China and the old USSR) allocates resources based on the cornucopian assumption of unlimited supply.  It is assumed that there will always be a substitute or a technological advance called forth by profit or command.  The credibility of that assumption is now reaching its limits.  Coping with the complexity is getting increasingly harder to do -- which is seen in money terms as more costly.  Projection without vision is the surest path to destruction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This shows the downside of the Chinese state capitalist model when applied to developing new technology for a green economy.  They understand how to ramp up production but do not understand what they can't control -- how that product can be successfully marketed.  If China had committed itself to bearing the high initial price of photovoltaic electricity as part of a long term plan for sustainable development, they would not have precipitated a collapse in the market price of solar panels, nor depended on exports for that market.  But state capitalism, like private capitalism, can only imagine short- to medium-term profits.  Neither can plan for a future in which production must be structured differently from the present.  There are too many unknowns.  Long-term planning cannot be assumed away if the world is to manage climate change and resource constraints.  No existing political-economic system is prepared to take on this task. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The tragedy of Newtown should be the end of Gun Entitlement and a return to the original purpose of the Second Amendment, which says: "A well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."  It is the Federal government which is prohibited from infringing on the rights of states to form arms-bearing peoples militias. 
One way to return to the original sense of the Amendment is for states now to establish such voluntary militias.  A well-regulated militia, like any arm of the state, must have rules.  Thus the bearer of arms also bears a responsibility as a member in a state's voluntary militia, to act in accordance with the rules of that militia.  Establishment of a people's militia could provide the opportunity for everyone to receive training, not only in the use and care of weapons, but also in emergency response of the kind needed in an age of increased extreme weather (think of the inadequate response during and after Hurricane Sandy).  It would thus provide an organized network of people who have chosen to serve in times of public need.   </TEXT>

The real world has shaken that faith, but it remains essentially intact.
This election has made taxing the rich thinkable, but it has not changed who rules, and for whom. Obama now wants to allow marginal tax rates to return to pre-Bush levels for the top 2%.  But that's not enough to fix the deficit.  
Now consider what would happen if tax rates were set to return the U.S. to its pre-1980 income distribution.
The Congressional Budget Office estimate is that the top 1 percent's share has more than doubled from 8 percent to 17 percent.  The system that produced that exploding inequality has been fraught with speculative bubbles and financial crises.  That the two phenomena coincide is not a coincidence.  Profit-driven expansion, made without considering any systemic consequences, is a recipe for overshoot and crash.
Tax away the excess now going to the top 1%, bringing them back to their pre-Reagan income share, and you have more than eliminated the current deficit, with lots of funds left over to invest in the infrastructure required  for a sustainable economy for the 21st century.  The key to that new economy is  eliminating the waste of scarce resources -- energy, environment, talent.  We have to focus on real needs  -- building healthy livable communities.  When considering that task, it is clear that the rich have done a god-awful job.  It is time for them to give up their baseless sense of entitlement to rule, and to seek honest employment mobilizing our productive forces for the work that must be done.

The Congressional Budget Office estimate is that the top 1 percents share has more than doubled from 8 percent to 17 percent.  The system that produced that exploding inequality has been fraught with speculative bubbles and financial crises.  That the two phenomena coincide is not a coincidence.  Profit-driven expansion, made without considering any systemic consequences, is a recipe for overshoot and crash.  
Tax away the excess now going to the top 1%, bringing them back to their pre-Reagan income share, and you have more than eliminated the current deficit, with lots of funds left over to invest in the infrastructure required  for a sustainable economy for the 21st century.  The key to that new economy is  eliminating the waste of scarce resources -- energy, environment, talent.  We have to focus on real needs  -- building healthy livable communities.  When considering that task, it is clear that the rich have done a god-awful job.  It is time for them to give up their baseless sense of entitlement to rule, and to seek honest employment mobilizing our productive forces for the work that must be done. </TEXT>

The drillers punched so many holes and extracted so much gas through hydraulic fracturing that they have driven the price of natural gas to near-record lows. And because of the intricate financial deals and leasing arrangements that many of them struck during the boom, they were unable to pull their foot off the accelerator fast enough to avoid a crash in the price of natural gas, which is down more than 60 percent since the summer of 2008. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is hard to imagine that a Constitution that requires amendments be approved by 38 of the 50 states would find sufficient support for the simple abolition of the Electoral College system, which over-weights the power of voters in two-thirds of the states.

A more modest reform may, however, be palatable. We learned from the recent Greek elections that under their system the party with the most votes gets a 50-seat bonus in Parliament. A similar formula might be possible here. 

For example, an additional 438 votes could be allocated in proportion to the popular vote. For the most part, these electors would cancel each other out. But if the popular tally were in the opposite direction from the Electoral College, then the candidate with the greater popular vote would pick up one more elector for each 700,000 votes that candidate had accrued greater than their opponent. This would also give representation in the Electoral College for third and fourth party candidates who garnered more than 700,000 votes nationally. In this close election, both the Libertarian and Green parties would have a shot at making a difference in the final outcome, without being labelled as spoilers. The whole process would be invigorated and American voter participation rates could once again demonstrate that we act as citizens of one country, and that we do give a damn about the direction our nation takes. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the painful follow-up to Kristof's powerful column, A Possibly Fatal Mistake.  Scott Androes was a risk-taker.  But the gambling table was rigged. "Your money or your life" is not an easy question to answer if the money is more than you can afford, and the risk to your life appears remote.  Scott could not afford to play it safe, and he lost.
In this column Kristof responds to the many heartless comments his first column evoked.  Perhaps, out of this dialogue, we can identify a new social disease: Empathy Deficit Disorder.  It is the disease of the socially atomized who do not understand that their lives depend on the existence of a functioning human society, where empathy is the glue.  For a while, for some individuals EDD works just fine.  Some even become rich.  But if too many people feel and think and act this way, human society collapses into the dystopian ideal: The War of All Against All -- Winner Take All. </TEXT>

Can it earn enough foreign exchange by selling goods and services that other people want to cover vital import needs -- food, energy, advanced technology, medicine, etc.?
Governments should have the welfare of their own people as their highest priority.  But after the post-2008 financial meltdown, each country at risk has been forced to sacrifice its people in order to prevent a loss of confidence in the world capital market.  The highest priority has therefore been to avert contagion which could spread to many countries.  The true loyalty of nation states has thus been revealed.  Capital rules.
No people with any dignity would submit to such a loss of sovereignty without a fight. </TEXT>

At the very least they should be denied the vote.  That part of the plan is already in progress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Todd Akin is not an outlier in the anti-abortion world. The belief that pregnancy only occurs when a woman is "open" to it is a foundational myth. It simplifies the morality of forcing women to bear the fruit of conception: they wanted it when it happened, and now they are responsible for the result of their moment of passion. If you believe that, then there are no "unwanted" pregnancies -- only a moral failure to take responsibility for one's own actions. And the Republican Party has made this part of their implicit articles of faith. It is the only moral basis for denying women the right to abortion, even for pregnancies from "nonconsensual" sex. For more moderate Republicans, women must at least prove "forcible rape" to be allowed to terminate a forced pregnancy. If the rapist does not concur with that allegation, then the woman's case must presumably rest on the results of a trial and conviction -- a process likely to take more than nine months.

	<TEXT> The desperate clutching for measures to restore Confidence does not inspire confidence.  The discipline of the market -- letting credit markets collapse -- is the cure that kills the patient.  The alternative being proposed is "unlimited funding" -- the abandonment of all market discipline. That could lead to unlimited indebtedness which gets monetized into unlimited inflation.  But probably the funding will be restrained by a political imposition, allocating funding in accord with political power.  This is where international democratic socialism starts to look like a less corrupt, more transparent way to go (a la Syriza in Greece).  Stay tuned. </TEXT>
