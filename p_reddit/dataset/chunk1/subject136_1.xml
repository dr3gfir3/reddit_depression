	<TEXT> I've had points where I thought about death a lot, but my two brothers always made it so clear that they cared about me that there would be way too much guilt for me to off myself. Plus, there have been three suicides in my school in the last two years. I know the damage it causes on the community, and I feel as though my pain does not justify hundreds of other people hurting far more. </TEXT>
