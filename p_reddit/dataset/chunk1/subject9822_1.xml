	<TEXT> Well the training he has me doing is a blend of exercises, mostly aimed at muscle growth but a lot of fat burning mixed in also. Not worried about that portion because I'm seeing positive change. I just need to get my damn diet down, if you would have told me a year ago I would have problems not eating enough I would have punched someone hahaha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi gymbros,

I'm a six foot, 22 year old male weighing in at 250. Lost about 80 pounds over the course of a year and recently have started working with a trainer doing resistance/weight training. All in all I work out about three days a week for an hour each. The goal is losing fat/gaining muscle...essentially a body recomp.

My problem is my diet. When I started with him I was eating about 1,500 calories and he obviously told me I needed to bump that up. However, since I started working out with him I can barely eat anything at all, I simply have no desire to eat. I can barely throw down breakfast in the morning and I have been sitting here trying to eat my lunch for an hour. I know I need to be eating enough calories but at this point I could eat less than 1,000 a day and be totally fine, which is obviously no bueno.  Is this normal in the beginning/what can I do to help get some appetite back. Thanks!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I posted some variations of this question awhile back on reddit and didn't really get any answers that seemed solid so I figured I would ask again and be a little more in-depth with my question.
Backstory: I'm a 22 year old male at exactly six feet tall. At the end of September of 2014 I weighed in at 331 and thought "fuck I'm going to die a fatass." Therefore I tackled the issue head on and changed my diet/exercised. I was eating around 1,500 calories a day and keeping the carbs below 50g, all while doing intense cardio three-four times a week. Here's some before and after pic http://imgur.com/xFiq3R4

Fast forward to today and I weigh 250lbs and have started with a personal trainer. We went over my goal which is to obviously be around the 190-200lb range and be sexy af. Now before I beg the question I just want to say that yes, I trust my trainer and yes, I know that I'm paying him this money and should be trusting him but dammit...I just need more than one confirmation here. I'm a man obsessed and just want to be 100% with my plan.

The plan with my trainer is I meet with him two days a week for about an hour, doing resistance weight training. We typically hit every muscle group from legs to arms and I build up a pretty decent sweat. He has me eating around 2,000-2,400 calories a day, keeping my carbs low and protein high. He says with the workouts we are doing and what we plan to do, I will be able to build muscle and burn fat.

So the question is...will this plan work for me? I'm just so nervous to switch up from what I was doing but I know weight training is so important. I know doing this will help my health in the long-run obviously but dammit I just want to look hot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Backstory: started in September of 2014 at 331, now down to 250lbs about 6 foot even. I have seen major progress but now want to take it a step further. I was eating around 1,500 calories a day and less than 50g of carbs, doing a straight hour of cardio every day at the gym. I was just becoming a smaller version of my already fat self and visibly losing muscle tone. 

I want to totally re-shape my body to have less fat/more muscle. I want to be healthier, want to wear clothes I want and dammit I just want to look good. I read on here/heard several times that resistance training eventually needs to be added into a routine to gain muscle...duh. Unfortunately, I had no god damn clue what I was doing. So, I went and got a personal trainer. 

Fast forward to now, been working out with the trainer for a couple weeks. Simple resistance/weight training eventually leading to more intense workouts. When we started going over my diet, he looked at my BMR (2,405) and said I should be eating at least 2,400 on the days when I'm not at the gym and 3,000 on the days when I go the gym and at least 250g of protein. I feel like this is a ton of calories compared to my usually 1,500 and truthfully, I'm scared of eating that much and gaining my weight back. HELP ME for I am dumb and no nothing. 

Edit: looking to be in the 190-200 range by the end of it all.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I figured with my proten shakes I drink + meals throughout the day I could get into the 150 range so that's great...don't know if I can push for the extra 100 though that's a stretch.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Then really you have to see it from this side: if the accounting company that he works for does internal auditing, IT control and any other business process type consulting, that deals with highly sensitive information, even for Comcast. If he is name dropping, that's a bad deal. Source: I am an accounting in an auditing position.  </TEXT>
