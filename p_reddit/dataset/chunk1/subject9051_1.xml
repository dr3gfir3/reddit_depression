	<TITLE> What is it about this game that affects us so much? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-22 14:54:58 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have been trying to figure out why this game affects me and others so much. I'm a 26 year old guy who has never cried to a game or movie before, and I've seen so many other people here say similar things. This game gets to people who don't usually get emotional... why is that?

I think the game constantly has this feeling... this aura... of youth, nostalgia and childhood. Max's innocence and shyness, Chloe's rebellion, the American high school setting, all the sunsets, the rekindled friendship/love between Max and Chloe (who always talk about their childhood by the way, running around like pirates) - all these things makes it instantly nostalgic, despite the fact that I can't relate to most of it.

That's just one thing I've been thinking about. It's one part of my quest to figure out why this game affected me *so* much. The writing is really good too, plus the fact all these decisions are *yours*, makes the consequences get to you even more. I know I also fell in love with Chloe so seeing all these things happen to her... broke my heart a little.

I think it's also because there are no other games like it. I've never played a game about an 18 year old in high school girl before. :P It's new, it's fresh and it's an immersive experience.

I'm interested to hear what you guys think, why did this game affect you more than other games? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm still affected by this game days later. It's the Titanic of video games, it makes grown men (like me) cry.

The ending where Chloe sacrifices herself, is it the saddest ending ever? It's sad on so many levels, the more I think about it the more it hits me.
Max fought so hard to save Chloe, even watched her die over and over again yet lost her in the end. Chloe in that timeline hadn't even met her again. No one will ever know what Max went through or that Chloe actually did sacrifice herself. And that kiss... oh man. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Chloe is the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. It's weird that I'm so obsessed... she's a character from a video game.

But this game really gets to your head, it's so emotional. And goddamn it, Chloe is pure perfection. I saw a pinterest pic of Chloe with the comment "Chloe Price is literally the embodiment of everything I want to be in life.", I totally get that. I want to be with her, hell, I want to *be* her.

Oh I'm a 26 year old guy. I'm hella weird... but I can't be the only one, right? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-30 23:13:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This is a follow-up to [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/masseffect/comments/5a3ma6/i_finished_mass_effect_2_today_everyone_but_2/). I loaded an old save and did 2 missions before the cutscene where the crew gets kidnapped, is forced on me (because I got the Reaper IFF). I don't have an earlier save.

So I upgrade my ship and start the suicide mission. Now instead of having all but 2 characters dead and a dead ship crew, I got away with only 3 character deaths.

That's the difference between casually playing and preparing. Boy was the ship empty after my first playthrough. :P So thanks for the advice!

And now that I've had sex with Jack, I can finally move on from this game. (_) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Spoilers ahead, sort of?

Yeah so I experienced something I reckon you guys could relive again. I played the ending of Mass Effect 2 for the first time... and apparently I suck because *everyone* I like, died. Everyone except Mordin and Grunt survived. I did save the game before the ending, while helping Samara (btw I failed the conversation with her daughter, what should I have said? yeah I suck)

So... what did I do wrong? What should I do, to have as few teammates as possible die during the "suicide mission"?

	<TEXT> The hype was so big and so many people got hooked. We're almost all still here but for a different reason... we need to let off some steam for the biggest gaming disappointment ever (for me, the biggest). Everyone here shares their experience with the game, good and bad. Mostly bad.

It's a big therapy session at this point... I think it's kind of funny how this place has changed.

Edit: Like I say below: "It's like Alcoholics Anonymous, we all say hi and tell everyone how horrible the game was to us and how it ruined our lives." </TEXT>
