	<TITLE> Meditating With Prayer Beads </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-07-29 20:54:31 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So today I decided to try out meditating with prayer beads where I would count a bead in between breaths (not literally count, just grab the next bead). It made it much easier to focus on my breathing and kept other thoughts from entering my concious. However, I felt a lot less of an effect today than I usually do from meditating. Am I doing something wrong? Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you very much! Another question if you don't mind, are Bhaisajyaguru and Akshobya just two different names for the East Buddha? I recently purchased a statue that I was told was Akshobya but whose imagery more represents Bhaisajyaguru. Upon research it's unclear whether or not these are the same. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I've read online that they're supposed to represent the 5 qualities of Shakyamuni Buddha, however the fact that Amitbha is there throws me off as I've always known him to be a separate Buddha. Are these 5 actual celestial Buddhas and is the concept saying that Shakyamuni encompasses all 5? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The book Siddhartha made a translational error in that sense and referred to both Brahmins and Brahman as "Brahman". It was very confusing to me when I read it. A Brahmin is like a Hindu priest (see Spursa's comment), whereas Brahman is the Hindu impersonal pantheist monotheistic God. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1) Understand the Doctrine of No Self; you cannot be bothered if there is nothing to be bothered. Also try to limit the desire to not be bothered, this can be done by living by the Noble Eightfold Path.

2) Meditation isn't just sitting like a stone in silence focusing on your breath. Meditation is something that should be practiced at all times by understanding all the experience that arises in everyday life.

3) When one is enlightened, they may become an Arhat which means they will attain Nirvana at death and be freed from Samsara (the cycle of life and death). One, however, may choose to become a Bodhisattva upon enlightenment, which means they will continue to exist in Samsara in order to help rid the world of suffering. They will remain in Samsara until all beings have attained Nirvana, at which point they will then attain the ultimate Nirvana themselves. Mahyna Buddhism often involves praying to certain Bodhisattvas that are believed to exist somewhere else in the universe.

4) Cursing shouldn't be a bad thing as long as one is mindful of the meaning the words have and does not use them to incite anger or in other acts of malevolence. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've never been too familiar with Buddhist iconography but I'm starting to look into it more. Recently I realized that many of the statues and statuettes of what I thought was akyamuni may have actually been Amitbha. Looking at depictions of them online, they seem to be depicted very similarly. Besides the fact that Amitbha is depicted as being red in paintings and whatnot, what other characteristics can be used to tell them apart? </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-06-02 18:55:48 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> From what I've read, Madhyamaka is one of the main schools of Mahyna that teaches a Middle Way between eternalism and annihilationism while teaching that nothing has independent, eternal nature which makes everything "empty" but not non-existent. I'm just confused on how this differs from what was taught in the Theravda teachings as I'm pretty sure a Theravda practitioner would agree with these claims of "emptiness". </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buddhism I feel is most simply explained through the Four Noble Truths, as the rest of the doctrine may be interpreted after obtaining thorough knowledge about these Truths. That is: 
1) Life consists of dukkha. Dukkha is often explained as suffering, but more closely relates to negativity and delusion. 
2) Dukkha is caused by desire and the belief in a Self which causes egoism. 
3) To get rid of Dukkha is to get rid of desire and the belief in a Self. 
4) Getting rid of desire and the belief in a Self is best done by following the Eightfold Path. 
Once all is understood, Nirvana may be reached and the cycle of birth and death will end, unless one desides to be a Bodhisattva in which case they will exist in a state of Samsara and Nirvana at the same time and stay here to help all other beings reach Nirvana. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the Advaita Vedanta school of Hinduism, one would believe that we are all the same thing, in that we are all the higher reality Brahman. The founder of this school, Adi Shankara, was actually criticized by many traditional Hindus for being influenced by Buddhism. However, in order to believe that we are all one, we would have to believe that there is this "one" constant entity that we all are. Buddhism would say that it is impossible for there to be a constant entity, therefore we are not all one because there isn't a "one" that we all are. The reason why Shankara was criticized for being influenced by Buddhism in that he taught that there is no individual Self, which Buddhism would highly agree with but would extend it to say that there is no Self to anything, including everything as a whole. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good question, one that I tend to think about often. The ultimate reality is one in which there is no Self to anything, everything is just a series of causal relationships. One instance brings upon the next instance, with nothing constant or independent/non-relational existing. The more good karma one produces, the more beneficial these series of causal relationships will become, and thus will help end the suffering of all sentient beings. One can still reject nihilism even when looking at life through the ultimate reality as there is still the production of karma which affects the path in which reality flows. The Doctrine of No-Self essentially states that no one has a constant, unchanging essence to them. That doesn't mean that beings cannot suffer, in fact the suffering would be caused by the conventional reality if anything as the belief in a Self to begin with is what leads to suffering. Buddhism is all about the "middle-way" between annihilationism and eternalism, that is that entities are neither eternal nor nothing. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Buddhism makes the distinction between conventional reality and ultimate reality. It doesn't teach to completely let go of conventional reality, but instead understand the ultimate reality and it's presence in all situations while still living through the conventional reality. Letting go of one's Self is actually meant to be beneficial in compassion, as it prevents "compassion fatigue", a common occurrence in many care providers which makes one cold, hard, and impersonal. If one were to let go of the Self, then the suffering that may come along with extensive compassion will not have an effect. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If a computer really tried to calculate something into infinity it'd run out of memory, despite how little memory running numbers uses (we're talking infinite numbers). So basically if a computer understands that the result of a calculation will result in an infinite sequence of numbers it will either set a cap or will simply not bother processing. For example, if u type a number divided by zero into a calculator, it simply won't compute it because the result will be infinite. However if it were to calculate an irrational number (like pi) it'll usually just calculate it enough for the result to be useful. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hillary:
Positive: She has experience with foreign policy and seems like she would do a good job with moderating between Dems and Reps.
Negative: Her approach to campaigning (media backing and Super PACs) is shady.

Bernie:
Positive: Passionate and has a lot of good ideas and seems like he would do a good job getting those ideas done.
Negative: Too far left to appease the right wing spectrum leading to misrepresentation. Also is very avoiding of questions during the debates.

Trump:
Positive: Hard as nails and his social policies are appealing to the right whereas his economic policies are appealing to the left.
Negative: Runs his mouth too much and oftentimes seems like he doesn't have any real solutions and is running a campaign on rhetoric.

Cruz:
Positive: Well reflects the moderate right wing and has proved himself to be a decent speaker.
Negative: Seems like he would have trouble moderating with Dems and does not have enough power to push through them if needed.

Rubio:
Positive: Probably the most moderate candidate currently in the election. He's also playing a respectable campaign.
Negative: May be too wishy-washy when it comes to actually running from the oval office. </TEXT>
