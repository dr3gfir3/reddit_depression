	<TEXT> I would like to point out that OP has no responsibility for her sister's recovery. Her sister has to want to recover for herself. If her recovery is contingent upon forgiveness, it's going to be quickly derailed by those who refuse to forgive. Making amends is something her sister needs to do because it's right and not solely for forgiveness. 

Forgive or don't, OP, but don't let anyone guilt you into forgiveness you don't actually feel! </TEXT>

I'm not sure about the legalities of this, but it's clearly a sign that your ex cannot be trusted to look after the well being of your child. I'd talk to a lawyer (maybe /r/legaladvice if you can't afford one) and see what can be done legally to ensure that this stops immediately!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what you're going to be able to find using the m-score and stock market reactions because the stock market effect will be directional while the m-score is not. You can probably expect companies to have different reactions to managing earnings up versus down. Additionally, beta is tricky since companies with earnings manipulation also tend to have smoother earnings and, by extension, less volatility in the marketplace. 

I wish I had a better suggestion for you, but tying it to something audit related isn't a bad idea. I hope it works out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think some directness is called for here. I'd say your husband should handle things because it's his friend, but it sounds like you're comfortable talking to him too. Whoever does it, it's a matter of telling him that he has to move out. Give him a hard deadline and do it in writing just to make sure there isn't a problem from a legal standpoint (since he's living there, you'd basically be evicting him). 

I know you feel bad, but you shouldn't. He's taking advantage of you and your generosity here. Lying about how much he makes, eating you out of house and home, and butting into your conversations isn't what good house guests do.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The relationship you have with your current GF sounds really bad. First off, your GF shows very little trust in you by demanding to scour your internet activity in the first place. Second, the conversations you are having after the post was discovered are all about saying mean things to each other? That's really worrisome. The details of who lied when and about what are secondary to what is essentially a very unhealthy relationship. 

I'd accept that this relationship isn't meant to be and break things off. If you feel compelled to respond to the texts, simply say "I'm not going to engage in this fighting any more" before cutting off contact. Otherwise, just go no contact.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think you're not wrong to be upset about this. There were many other ways for him to avoid speaking Korean (as seems to be his goal) without lying about understanding it. It's hard not to wonder if there wasn't some ulterior motive to him not telling you. I would be upset in this situation. 

The real question here is what this means for your relationship. His having lied to you clearly has some impact on the trust you place in him, at least in the short term. Do you think you can get past it? I think that's where you should be focusing your attention. It sounds like you're otherwise very happy with him. To some extent, his graciousness in the face of other people's rudeness is a credit to him. What really matters is whether you feel like this breach of trust is something you can get over. 

At the very least, I think you need to tell him exactly how you're feeling and make sure that he takes it seriously. This isn't a small issue even if you eventually decide to try and let it go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I remember getting the NES version of FFI when it first came to the US. I loved movies about typical fantasy things - wizards and fighters - and couldn't wait to get my hands on the game so I could play it. As an 8 year-old, however, I really couldn't get too far into it as I didn't have much in the way of strategic thinking and found it too hard to play. By the time FF2 came along for SNES in the US (FF IV in the full progression) I was ready and waiting for a comeback.  That was the first RPG game I ever beat totally on my own. 

Nearly 25 years later, I've played them all and can't wait for the next iteration in the series! They're about the only games I play. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While the stuff about his privilege and argumentative personality is concerning, I'd like to take a different tack and point out his statement about "making small talk." Clearly, he finds a great deal of meaning and fulfillment in debating these topics however misguided he may be in his opinions. I know many couples who thrive on this sort of constant debating of topics. 

I think this point has implications for your relationship in that he's unlikely to ever be satisfied without the debates. It sounds like he already has outlets for debating with his colleagues and other friends. Despite this, he's still coming home and debating with you. This is clearly an important form of interaction to him within the context of your relationship.  

I don't say this to suggest you should indulge hm. Frankly, I want to toss myself down the stairs just from reading about these debates. Instead, I'd simply suggest you start thinking about how likely it that you'll be able to reduce these debates to a manageable number. While I like the suggestions of pointing him to other outlets, I get the sense that he sincerely wants to debate with you in addition to other people. Think about how you can find out if that's true and, if it is, how to manage that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sorry that you are in this situation and have to deal with his betrayal. I use that word because that's what he has done to you, regardless of what reason he may give for it. Alcohol, depression, loneliness - these are all just excuses, not reasons for you to overlook his behavior. Not only has he cheated on you, but he's done so on multiple occasions over an extended period of time. To me, that's a signal that no matter how much he may clean up his act in the short term, he'd be hard to trust in the long term. I think it's clear to all of us that you deserve and should seek out a man you can trust and seems on. 

As regards your family - if you don't tell them what happened, they are likely to draw their own conclusions once the break up becomes public. As hurt and sad as they may be, I think you should tell them the truth when you feel up to it.  What little you shared about them makes them sound like the sort of people who will have your back once they know what has happened. 

Also, remember that you have done nothing wrong here. You did your job...it was your boyfriend who did you wrong! You deserve the love and support of your family at a difficult time like this.

	<TEXT> I assumed that had happened to you based on your reaction to things, though I didn't want to interject my assumptions into my initial response to you. With that said, you need to give some serious thought as to how you have dealt with past betrayals as I feel they may be coloring your current relationship and how you view yourself within it. 

I don't want to downplay your concerns about his relationship with this woman...it could be nothing, but it also could (as it always could) be something to worry about. There just has to be a better way to deal with his behavior (i.e. abandoning you without warning to spend an entire day drinking with this girl) than stewing and snooping. At the very least, he has been disrespectful and needed to (or needs to) apologize and make amends. After he does so, however, it's incumbent upon you to accept that and move past it. Wherever things have gone wrong, either with him showing sincere remorse or with you moving on, what matters now is that you focus on dealing with it in a way that leaves you satisfied. That may be a "you" issue or a "we" issue (I don't think it's a "him" issue, but perhaps I'm wrong there), but it's clearly some sort of issue.

	<TEXT> There no need to apologize...you're entitled to focus on whichever replies you find helpful, though I'm glad you're reviewing them all just the same. 

It sounds like this might be an escalating pattern of behavior with him that helps explain your "overreaction" (I use quotes because I'm less convinced that it's an overreaction after reading your reply). It sounds like he occasionally does stupid things and refuses to take responsibility for them. Granted, it'd be pretty easy for someone to simply forget about the implications of having powered through all the hot dogs after a night of drinking. It's also be pretty easy for him, when confronted with his behavior, to say "I'm hung over and was drunk and forgot about the hot dogs. I'm sorry. I'll get more." 

Without passing judgment on your 
reaction, I'd simply suggest that you consider the broader implications of his behavior and whether there's anything for you to be concerned with going forward. It sounds like you're coming around to letting this go, but don't be so quick to think that there's nothing wrong here just because you may be overreacting. I hope that makes sense to you.  </TEXT>

It seemed to me like he was handing over the letter as if to say "Here it is regardless of what you say next" rather than trying to leverage the letter into a date. He probably should have waited a bit longer, but once the letter is written I don't see a problem with him asking for the date. There's basically nothing else he can do for her in a professional capacity at that point.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why does being capable of taking on a challenge mean that challenge has to be financial? Frankly, taking up your parents on their offer could be viewed as a challenge because it gives you no excuse not to do your very best in your new job. Why don't you try redefining what it means to be independent in your own mind. Did you get your trainee position yourself? Did you pass through school yourself? Will you succeed professionally on your own merit? If these things are true, aren't you independently successful?

It sounds to me that you feel guilty about being privileged. This makes some sense, though not everyone feels this way about privilege. I agree with others who suggest you save your money and do something meaningful with it. I bet that would make you feel better than handing money over to some faceless landlord who is probably privileged too.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Our sex education class taught men about men's bodies and women about women's bodies. No overlap because it was a Catholic school. 

The first and only time I had sex with a woman (I'm gay), I tried sticking my penis in the wrong hole...had literally no clue there was a second, pee-dedicated hole down there. :-/ </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure what others will say, but this doesn't sound like an uncommon occurrence among PhD students in STEM fields. I've heard plenty of stories of doctoral students working crazy hours trying to get their work done. 60 hours was common in my own PhD program and mine is in Business, not a field where you work in a lab. My friends in physics and chemistry worked crazier hours than me, that's for sure. 

He's also working for an untenured researcher, which means that she is going to be riding him extra hard because her future literally depends on his success. The best bet here might be to inquire with other professors to see if he can find a new lab. As a second year student, he's probably doing coursework (if it's in the US) and he might be able to find someone in his area who can take him on and provide a more nurturing environment. If that's not a possibility, there probably isn't much to be done. Reporting her to a higher up is likely to backfire on some level - less attention could be just as deadly as more attention, frankly.  

The important thing to remember here is that PhD's are conferred, not earned. If she is going to supervise his dissertation, he needs her to be on his side. This means tolerating much more Crap than we might otherwise prefer.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as I can tell, it's the 0 or 00 on Roulette. As each number has a 1/38 chance of being hit, you'll hit one 2.63% of the time. For standard baccarat with 8 decks, the possible combinations to win the Dragon 7 are around 112.6 trillion against 5.00 quadrillion total possible combinations. That means you can expect to hit the Dragon 7 2.25% of the time. 

You can determine the relative likelihood more easily, however, by simply looking at the payouts. A single number hit pays 35-1 at roulette versus 40-1 for the Dragon 7 bet. Based on that information alone, it's reasonable to conclude that the Dragon 7 has longer odds to occur relative to a single roulette number.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First off...living with each other after so short a time dating? I know you used to see each other...how long have you been going out between the two periods of dating? 

I wouldn't usually condone looking at other people's text messages, but if it was really open and in plain sight then I don't see it as a violation for you to have looked at it and confronted him about it. 

Having confronted him and received what is essentially a deflecting non-response, it's difficult to see how you have much choice but to suspect the worst. If it was innocent, I would think he'd simply say so.  He's going to have to give you something to work with if there is any chance of salvaging things. Otherwise, you won't be able to trust him since you'll be suspecting the worst. 

I'd suggest talking to him again to try and get a real explanation out of him. If he's unwilling to talk or explain things, I'd take that as a sign that your relationship won't work out and act accordingly.  </TEXT>
