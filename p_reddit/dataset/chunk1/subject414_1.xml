	<TEXT> I've used and liked the MXR/CAE MC403 20 outlets, couple of 18V, lots of mA. Designed by a guy that knows his stuff. I've seen them on Reverb for about $150, so not too pricey. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks. Some people don't 'get' the amp look, but we didn't want to build another amp in a Marshall box, although I love the look of a vintage Marshall 50 watt head and cab. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Appreciate that. I've been building 'boards for at least 25 years. Even had a couple of pedalboard companies in the mid-90's/early 2000's. I always have a design or two sketched out at any time. I think I may have a problem... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty fun, for the price it's a cool synth pedal. I need to get my hands on a Boss SY-300 and see how it compares to my old Roland GR-300. Hmmmm... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> OK, cool. The plugs are pretty small (less than 1/2"), but if someone was really smashing the pedals close together, might run into a problem.  I can never get mine too close, guess I have big feet ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Not to be spammy, but I invented them in 2015 and sell them through my amp company 3 Monkeys. Find them at www.dcsolderless.com
Be glad to send you a sample to check out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Built this up to mainly test out the Dirty Robot and Chicago Way. Signal chain is: TC polytune --Daredevil Custom The Chicago Way --BJFE Sea Blue EQ --Digitech Dirty Robot --MXR carbon copy. 

I built the board from a Rubbermade shelf from Lowe's and some U-channel and handles I had lying around. Quick and easy, thinking of doing a video how-to on this style board with parts from Lowe's or Home Depot.

Anyway, thanks for checking it out. I don't get to read this subreddit often enough...
