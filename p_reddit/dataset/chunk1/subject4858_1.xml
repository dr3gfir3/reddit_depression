	<TEXT> It is actually very unbiased and news television has a legal duty to be factually correct and not misrepresent stories. Complaints can be made to a statutory body by individuals. Corrections are often reported and the whole system keep TV sane. People like Glenn Beck, who are not brave truth sayers challenging the system but news clowns acting a character to get ratings to generate profits for Fox media, would not be tolerated on UK TV. 

Google Katie Hopkins she is about as close to the right wing polemicist personality cult the UK has but still so far from the crazy right wing conspiracy market that Fox captures. Print media has a broader spectrum but even there it self restrains if it wants to be taken seriously.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There have been horrendous cases where social workers have "uncovered" satanic child abuse rings. The "evidence" is testimony from young children who have been taken from their homes, then questioned for months by the same social workers until they extract the required narrative. Some of the cases that went to court were thrown out by the judge when it became clear the social workers just kept asking leading questions effectively creating the whole satanic case. Some of the children had been in care so long by the time the case was thrown out they were never given back to their parents. It was found that the social workers involved were driven by ideology and dogma, turns out they were the real evil. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But the articles have no substance. There are no details on what powers are being talked about. A few soundbites from politicians and some amusing polemic from a comedian do not construct an argument  and contain zero facts. The SNP continues to blame everything on Westminster and refuses to use their existing powers to raise new money to pay for their policies hence disastrous police reorganisation, massive college cuts to pay for free universities, a failing education system etc. The only economic levers they have pulled tinker with the cost of buying a house. The Scottish Government have frozen council tax and not used their powers to increase income tax. They don't even use the powers they have yet whine about wanting more. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Education and spending are devolved powers in Scotland so the UK Govt has no powers over school meals in Scotland if they were being stopped in Scotland it would be by the Scottish Govt currently SNP. I only ask because the Op article is about Scotland.  </TEXT>
