	<TEXT> The Gainesville Ripper. Some guy went to a college campus and murdered five students over the course of a couple of days. No one knew who it was until like the third or fourth day..... which is my fav part because for a few days the people in the college had no idea who did it and anyone could've been next  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I gaze as I lay here on the floor,

I gaze longingly at the door,

The door which I dare not try to reach,

For fear of that horrifying screech,

Besides, it would be useless, in vain,
 
To even move would be a grievous strain,

I feel as the cold begins to tug at my toes,

And the smell of blood fills my nose,

I notice the sticky liquid pooling around me,

And the inevitability of death surrounds me,

I don't scream or fight, I focus on the blank space,

I don't  look at the door, I wait for death's embrace,
       
The pain fades and I know I'm near,

The thoughts that were racing become unclear,

But one thought continues to prevail,

What if I hadn't locked myself in this bathroom jail?,

What if I hadn't incanted that dreadful rhyme ?,

I might be living, not dying, not running out of time,

I could've moved passed the mirror, never looked  back,

But instead I saw that woman emerge from the Black
