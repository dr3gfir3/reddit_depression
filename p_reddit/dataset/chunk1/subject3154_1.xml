	<TEXT> I had one of my lamest and boring invasions due to this awesome item. I invaded Harvest valley and the guy I invaded just stood where you find the Branch of Yore after the sickle guys and used the Seed (He didn't kill all of them). Man, he didn't do ANYTHING, I was just staying below him and playing the waiting game. After I decided to Nuke him with Pyromancy he just chugged some Estus, he was trying to shoot me with a bow. That's the only thing he did. I tried shooting him myself but he had the high ground. After the most boring 15 minutes of my life I got sent out of the world. I still wonder how you can rely on that item that much... (He was NG+) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am currently in love with my Mundane Santiers Spear but it is only effective when I'm high level. So my question: Will 200-250 SL still get matched with 150 in NG+? Or shorter will I find any matches? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> I might have found out what causes the so called "baby-jump". </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-04-03 21:37:40 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The "baby-jump" is a bug which causes you to jump shorter and so far it is not clear why that happens. I did some testing and I noticed, that there is a short period of time, where when you transist from running to walking, you will still be able to jump normally but WAY shorter. Also the Jump-Control setting made a difference for me. With the **B**/**O** button, it is still pretty random to me although I had more success with pressing the button faster to avoid transisting into walking mode before jumping, but with the **L3** setting, I was able to control wich of the both jumps I did, the short or the long one. If you press L3 while running, I think you'll do the normal jump but when you transist into walking and then press L3, you always do the baby jump. However this needs more research, if you have some information regarding this, please post it in this thread.

TL;DR: If you don't want the "baby-jump" to happen, make sure to press L3 and never let go of the run button.

Edit: Of course you can not jump with R3, silly me. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, where to start... In my opinion, the area is pretty awful with that nasty orange glow because of the lava, the boss is just an annoying gimmick, the dragon butts in the lava make absolutely no sense, there are like 20 of them...why? Most of them do not even attack you. I like the vacuum-cleaner-squid-monsters though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well but I need to give them credit for Dragon Aerie and Dragon Shrine. Two fantastic looking Areas. TWO bonfires.   Dragon Aerie has a pretty nice shortcut and Dragon Shrine is a pretty difficult area with only one bonfire. Downside: Ancient Dragon. It is just bad/lazy design. This boss is only hard because he has a ton of life and one shots you every time. The fight can be easy if you looked up how to manipulate the AI and that should not be necessary. Same for Vendrick. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah but imagine running from the Crypt to Dragon Shrine, that'd be really tedious and boring. Since FROM decided to make the world consist of different "dungeons" and paths. I think the ability to warp is a very important game design choice. However, my only complain is that there are maybe too many bonfires. I mean yeah, Shrine of Amana is shitty but there are 3 bonfires before the boss, and one after it, and the next one in the beginning of the crypt... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was just derping around in the Royal Woods when suddenly I get summoned as a white into the forest. I'm a forest hunter but I didn't place my sign, also I'm in the DLC area. And to make it perfect: The host was a hacker that you couldn't even hit. So, can hackers just summon people now? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Hornet Ring = Cheap? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-01-12 01:01:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I don't know if this belongs here but I'd like to know why the Hornet Ring is considered to be cheap. It just boosts your crit damage, right?

Edit: Thanks for all the answers. I guess i can use the ring for gankers or for unfair situations, if I summarize the comments correctly. Just to make sure, I am not a fan of the ring myself because it doesn't fit to my playstyle but i watched some videos and many people were ranting about it, also it could have gotten nerfed, I'm fairly new to the game, although I've beaten it 2 times already. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't wanna be a scumbag, but I'd like to know what's so hard about these Archers, i just ran and didn't get hit once. (Shadow Set,    Claymore and Wolfring. First Playthrough) Can somebody explain why so many people hate them. I know some people that hate Anor Londo just because of them and i don't get it. Again, don't want to sound like I'm good. I'm actually very new to the game. Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Is it too late to start playing Dark Souls (xbox 360) PvP? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2013-12-03 19:19:19 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Seriously, I'm a fairly new DS player (SL25) and just tried pvp to see what's going on. So i went to the Undead Burg and started an invasion. What resulted was a guy waiting for me and stunlocking me instantly as i spawn with some kind of magic puke spell bullshit, until i died, i didn't stand a chance. So my question is: Is it worth to play DS PvP or are there only these low level cheeser, and what can you do about it? Or am I just late for this game?

Edit: Thank you all for your answers, really helped me out! </TEXT>
