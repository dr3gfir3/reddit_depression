	<TEXT> It is simple:If you don't enjoy being pressured about your diet, then they probably don't enjoy being pressured over their diet.

It sounds like you have deliberately ostracized yourself. No one likes to be given guilt trips. No one likes to feel pressured or judged. No one like a street-corner evangelist trying to shove his own personal views down the throats of passing pedestrians.  Fuck proselytizing, dude. Walk the walk, and stop badgering people who'll probably ever change their minds now that they know you as an example of the "lifestyle", as you put it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> i am a pastor's kid. i could have had a special rate and my parent's paying tuition at some yuppy private christian schools. because i don't support organized religion as an atheist (even admittedly as an agnostic), I understand that funneling my parents money towards a christian school is a contradiction of my principles. You called yourself an *atheist* and perhaps you are quite simply unconcerned with the ramification and social consequences of organized religion and people being *mis*educated in college, then you should feel fine about being wishy-washy. I, however, have chosen to put myself through school, to stand on my principles. My folks (who i once was estranged from) have grown to be very proud of me for how hard I work. They even brag to their friends that their daughter knows how to take care of herself. This is in contrast to most people my age (probably you too) who haven't the *slightest* idea of how to support themselves. I work full time and take 16 credits. Suck it up, ya know?  </TEXT>

Why not side with the teenagers then? It seems like you assume automatically that the soldiers are innocent, versus the un-armed possibly teens/kids. This is police brutality no matter what the context is. Are you seriously claiming that this type of treatment towards citizens is ok? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Check it out: your wife is not supposed to be a pastor.
As in all the congregations of the saints, women should remain silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak, but must be in submission as the law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church. (I Corinthians 14:34-35) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> it's not always as black and white, miss america. 22 is young enough to feel entrenched in a relationship that's taken nearly 1/3 of a lifetime. plus, they live in different countries, thus the gal might fear having to sacrifice her whole home community to be with this guy. i do think this lady needs to think very seriously about what she wants, because she's not being fair to herself, or those involved. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm a 22-year-old woman and I attend college full-time, dating boyfriend for 3 years. Because I also work full-time to support myself and pay for school, I am pretty busy and stretched thin. Often, at the end of my day, the last thing I want to do is bike (no car) 8 miles to his house. Because he wants to see me, he usually is the one to make that 8 mile trek. Basically, what I'm saying is that given you've only dated for 2 months, the gal's got a lot on her plate and i guarantee that there is truth in her statements about work and busy-ness. It might be more comfortable for her to be in her own environment when she wakes up, because it helps her be successful in her busy days, ie: having all the accessories of home to start her day etc.

tips: make her feel "at home" as much as possible at your place. Cook her dinner, make sure you have food around if she's hungry, toilet paper in stock, clean, comfortable etc. 

oh yeah, and no pressure, no guilt trips. you sound like you're doing well on this already, she's a lucky gal. 

longwinded, but I hope I could be of some help, given my own similar scenario. </TEXT>
