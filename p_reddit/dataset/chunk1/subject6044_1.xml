	<TITLE> Schrdinger's cat, the Holographic Principle and Public Perception </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-01-03 05:44:46 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Schrdinger's cat is the term commonly applied to a model of thought proposed in the 1930s by the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrdinger.

Briefly the construct is that we have certain knowledge that within a sealed box is a cat and a vial of poison which, should it break, would kill the cat. From our vantage point - not being able to see inside the box - the common logical position is that the cat is in one of two states - alive (if the vial is intact) or dead (if the cat has somehow broken the vial).

This is the position of the 'normal' and prevailing model pre-Quantum Mechanics but the Copenhagen Interpretation (which Schrdinger was attempting to discuss with his analogy) suggested that the 'cat' (actually he is discussing photons and atoms) did not exist in either state until observed. So in essence, in the sealed box the cat was in a state of limbo, waiting to be assigned its 'reality' when the box was opened and the observers imposed their own view of the situation. This state of limbo - existing in many differing states - is termed *superposition*.

If we note that Einstein himself was more than a little freaked by Quantum Physics - he initially could not bring himself to accept it - we can gain a valuable insight into the processes of mentation of humans from the highest brains on one end of the spectrum to Redditors on the other. 

Adnan's trial was in fact a 'sealed box' and he was the cat. The jury - and judge - with their own prejudices and biases *themselves* defined the state of the cat when they opened the box. And what they had available to themselves to judge was, in essence, the only things they had allowed themselves to see. 

There is a saying in Pakistan (to reference Adnan's cultural background) "to a hungry man, two and two equals four...... loaves of bread". And so it is with the Justice System. It has its own end-goal and, yes of course, it pays lip service to basic maths but the sum of 2 plus 2 is really not that important. What is important is how much '4' can buy. What does it matter if a witness tells a hundred different and conflicting stories? If you can somehow get to 4 - or life +30 - then the sums adds up. 

The problem many people had - still have - with Quantum Mechanics is that they cannot understand how a state of a 'thing' can be undefined. Much less can they grasp that it is an outside observer that does the defining. The implication that 'reality' is malleable sends some people off their rocker.

And so we come to the sorry state of this sub. Adnan's box was opened and the observers saw guilt. In the first trial if it had been opened the - different - observers would have seen innocence. 

This is not a matter for us as we are not the first-hand observers - we are just discussing the process. But there's the problem: those of us who know this truth - that reality itself is a conditioned mechanism - run head on into the fear and reaction of those to whom this very notion is anathema. 

Those who see the gaping holes in the Prosecution case and who wish for another trial for Adnan (putting the cat back in the box in the hope of more enlightened observers) know that, to quote Robert Anton Wilson "Reality is what you can get away with" (i.e. what the *State* can get away with) - while the more voluble of the Guilty crew are very uncomfortable with the idea of a malleable nature of 'truth' (this idea has been called 'Holographic' by thinkers like Michael Talbot for example - it sees various human conceptions, and indeed Reality/Existence as a whole as 'software' being run on consciousness and having no objective existential status).

Many of the Guilty-viewers are those that deny the existence of Superposition - to them the cat is always alive or dead and it is carved in stone. It *cannot* be possible to them that a cat would exist in an intermediate state and that the end state - alive or dead - is one conditioned by them themselves. 

Yes it revolves just the same as Galileo said. And if you think about it, it's quite ironic because the poster-boy of the Guilty Model is someone who's changing stories and 'Holographic' approach to facts is a form of living embodiment of the principles enshrined in the conception of Schrdinger's cat - they accept the decisions of the Police and the Courts *because* they are the decisions of the Police and the Courts but the idea of a malleability of HOW these decisions are arrived at - that there MIGHT not just be room for error but the result might be *constructed*... well... minds get blown. 

The old ways of thought are dying, yes Quantum Mechanics has been a part of it for a long time but the old ways are dying in all stratas of life. The curtain has been peeled back - more and more each day - and increasing numbers of people are seeing through the shadow-show of our systems of banking, justice, economics and looking to a better world. 

We need to MAKE that world by rejecting the old ways of thought and embracing uncertainty. No outmoded models can help us here. It's time to wake up and realise WE condition our own results and we don't need to accept spoon-fed notions of 'justice', 'guilt', 'reality' or anything else. 

If the Emperor is stark staring naked it's totally cool to scream that fact from the rooftops. We don't need to blindly follow the status quo... we can think, we can be free and we can free others who have been imprisoned by old, dying and corrupt systems - free then from prisons literal or metaphorical. 

The cat may be in the box, may be in limbo ready to be assigned a state when we open it, but we should realise that WE can define that state. For good or ill.... I choose good.

	<TITLE> Problems with some mind-blowing Claims of Jay </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-30 15:10:50 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> This isn't merely about changing stories - that horse has been well and truly flogged, it's an ex-horse that has gone to join the choir invisible - it's about things that can't actually be possible or don't add up regardless of the relationship to earlier Jay iterations: I'll start off:

It was at least a week before she died, when he found out she was either cheating on him or leaving him.....I think shes fucking around. Im gonna kill that bitch, man. 

So this is a pretty definitive statement we can place in time: Jay claims Hae and Adnan were **still dating** a week before and implies that the reason for the murder was to *stop* her leaving rather than *because* she already had and because he believed her to be cheating. 

There's a difference - and it matters. Because this is the motive. It's not just words - on this is hanging someone's freedom. 

There's more: the "I'm going to kill" note is often cited as a key exhibit that PROVES they had split and that's why Adnan wanted revenge. It also places the split at a time much earlier than Jay's statement above. 

So we've got a problem here: how did Jay get this wrong? 

We were in the car together during last periodhe was ditching the last period. And I said, Hey, I need to run to the mall cause I need to get a gift for Stephanie.

What is happening here is that Jay is shifting the timeline but keeping the framework essentially intact. 

Just as he moves the burial forward from around 6pm to midnight (around 6 hours say) he also moves the car borrowing forward by 4 hours: in Interview 2 Jay says Adnan arrived at his house at 11.am (in other variants 11.45) and THEN they go shopping for presents and Jay takes possession of the car thereafter. 

So this occurrence moves forward to the end of school. Again, things are being shifted upwards in time for some reason.

So I go to pick him up, and when I get there he says, Oh shit, I did it. I say, Did what? He says, I killed Hae.

This may not seem important but it is. In previous variants - "I killed the bitch" - Jay was waiting for the call which he knew would come when it was done. Here he is surprised and not expecting a murder call - he has to ask. 

Also no 'killed the bitch' here. The tone is far more apologetic. "oh shit" rather than "Bitch is dead" gangsta style. 

Btw: he also claims here at the Best Buy he does not recognise, see, or know where Hae's car is or what it looks like. Which is odd because he makes a drawing for the police placing it in a specific position. 

We were friendly, we were cool. I might have sat next to him in a class, and joked or something. *But he didnt call me unless he needed something*

The italicised bit is - imo - a reference to weed and suggestive that Jay was Adnan's dealer. 

Why is this significant? Because in earlier versions Jay has Adnan and him cruising around trying to score: something a bit silly as he's sitting on a stack of weed. this happened in the morning but now Jay has moved the timeline forward to *avoid* or nullify the morning this is not needed as an excuse for what they were both doing so he's free to tell this 'dealer' adjustment. 

It can't actually be because he's scared of the cops in the earlier version as he implies because he's incriminating himself in that regard there also - and it's a moot point because he's reached a deal or else he wouldn't be saying anything at all.

I knew him because I knew Muslims in the community from playing basketball at the mosque.

This should be verifiable no? Is it really possible that all of Adnan's buddies and the mosque crew failed to notice this? It's interesting if it's a false claim as it's an insane one to make if not true, but even more interesting if true because it opens up more questions I think. 

Yes. When we were digging the hole, its not like Haes body was just lying next to us. She was still in the trunk.

Seriously? Why would he say this if the earlier story of her being by the hole is true? Why change it? 

Alternatively, if it's true, why lie before? To the cops? What could be gained either way?

Either he is a pathological liar who has been inserting himself into the investigation - as often happens - and the cops believed him/went with it for their own ends or he has a specific reason to change these details. 

I am leaning towards the latter: anyone with any sense would not give an interview now and to this website and would not do it alone and unadvised as he is apparently doing. 

I think there's maybe something he wants to get out there and change/underline. I guess we'll learn more in the upcoming episodes but it could well be that Jay is a fantasist who saw a chance to embroider a whole tale with himself in the spotlight of it and struck gold by being in possession of certain facts. 

It may well be that Jay and his stories have very little at all to do with Adnan's guilt or otherwise in the way he is spinning them.

	<TEXT> I don't mean the RealCat, Mr X or the Westside Hitman (but those are certainly possibilities) but it seems likely to me that someone - let's say a legal/PR advisor rather than 'the third suspect' - put Jay up to the interview.

It's unlikely he is trying to monetise things as I understand that being an accessory he can't profit from any of this (money would have to go to Hae's family - btw, is this true? And if so then why not charge a huge fee and do that if he cares so much?) so money is not a factor. 

It's also unlikely that a murderer would expose himself in this way but Jay is not your normal guy in the street so who knows?

Do you think there is someone working Jay with their foot as it were? A hidden-hand or advisor? One thing re Jay's stories: they do prove he is not the most astute at dealing with his own PR. 

Who is behind this? Jay or an advisor? And what's the end-game?

	<TITLE> What we need to believe for Adnan to be guilty </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-12-22 13:28:38 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> There's many posts along the lines of 'what we must believe if Adnan is innocent' which usually boil down to the one or two points in the State's case that are not 100% dismissible.

I thought maybe we should come at it from the other side: what we need to believe to find him guilty. 

To believe Adana is guilty and to accept the State's argument - as many do here - one must also believe, if even by implication, that Adnan is not only a moron but perhaps one of the MOST moronic and stupid idiots ever to have tried to murder another human being. 

Assuming him guilty for argument's sake, here's a list of his stupidities:

* He plans a murder and does not set up any alibi

* He ropes in an accomplice. Not always totally stupid (well, yes) but to choose one not related by religion or family or some other tie which might ensure loyalty is verging on the insane. And not in a 'psychopath' way. No, he doesn't do that, instead he gets some local lame stoner that is 'the criminal element' of the locality. Someone known to the police and devoid of any trust.

* He then proceeds to ask this guy if he can help bury a body - thus putting his life in his hands. Literally.

* He goes on to compound this stupidity by lending this guy his OWN car and his OWN phone. 

* Then - in the presence of witnesses - he tells a lie that his car is in the shop. The same car that will come to the same location to pick him up after track - and asks for a lift from the victim. Let's say that one again: he attempts to lure the victim into the killing zone by approaching her in public in front of witnesses with a provable lie.

* He kills her in a public space leaving himself the problem of being seen in the act or getting her in the trunk. If he is guilty he apparently got away with that but it's still a very, very stupid gamble to take. And he would have got mega lucky here.

* He calls a girl he wants to get with for a chat. As you do when you've just strangled someone. 

* Doesn't have a plan for body disposal and instead drives around scoring, smoking dope, hanging out with friends and generally acting sketchy while the body is in the trunk and apparently forming no visible plan for disposal of the body which does not seem to be a pressing matter. 

* Knowing the police will call him and grill him about his knowledge of the disappearance he decides to get higher than he has ever been in his life.

* While in this high state - so high he wants to come down - the Police call. He answers it and engages them instead of ignoring the call until he was more together.

* Eventually he gets round to deciding to bury the body. Obviously, not having planned any of this despite it all being premeditated he doesn't have shovels so he despatches the accomplice to go and get some - again trusting that he won't drive directly to the cops or otherwise disappear and leave him holding the body unable to dispose of it. For a burial site he chooses somewhere pretty obvious, near to a road and only bothers to dig 6 inches leaving a shallow grave to be disturbed by predators. 

* He goes home to chill and makes sure when her disappearance is known to do two things: call the cops asking about it and never phoning her so as to rouse maximum suspicion when the cops ask why this is. 

* He makes sure to write "I'm going to kill" on a note of the murdered girl and/or ensures it is in full view and prominently displayed for the cops to find.

* He then waits around to be arrested instead of disappearing himself. 

* He refuses to offer any cogent explanation for any of the above and instead of thinking of any rational explanation in the 15 years he's had to think about it he still claims not to remember.

* He continues over 15 years to protest his innocence and thus ensure he will never be granted parole and will die in prison having spent almost his entire life there if he were to live to normal age expectations. 

If the above is true, is it possible that there is any stupider criminal currently incarcerated in the entire US?

	<TEXT> I have a Netgear router (CG3100) which is in my office and the base of our wireless network. A few rooms to the back of the apartment we have an Apple TV but the wireless connection here is flaky and keeps dropping out so I want to extend it. 

I found an old AE base station (A1088) which is good and working - I understand though that this can't extend the Netgear wirelessly as you need all Apple products for that, but it can extend the network when connected by Ethernet. 

Been searching for how to do this but can't find any info.. can anyone point me in the direction of some resources/how-to for this or let me know how to do it?

Cheers!

	<DATE> 2014-12-10 21:45:06 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> What's your best explanation for why after 15 years Adnan maintains his innocence when it will almost certainly result in him dying behind bars?

Assuming he is guilty he could - at any time in the last 15 years or in the future - admit to the crime (just like many in the guilty camp were quick to jump on when it came out that he wanted a plea-bargain and saw it as evidence of guilt), do a few more years time, show remorse and be out at some point before he dies.

He could theoretically be out now if he had done this. Oth, no parole board will even look at his case sympathetically while they interpret his insistence on innocence as 'showing no remorse'.

So... disregarding his stance at the trial which is a one-off roll of the dice, now he is seen as guilty anyway what's the best explanation of why he - in practice - opts to die behind bars rather than at least have some of his life outside of prison?

Anyone advancing an argument that employs the word 'psychopath' will be berated and/or ignored depending on amusement factor.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> When I was in Uni in Scotland I once went into a bar where there were two guys shouting at each other and generally ratcheting up the aggro. 

I soon realised that one of them was a Rangers supporter and one a Celtic. For any non-Brits this is football (real football) and these two hate each other. One is Protestant, one is Catholic. One is pro-Palestine, one is pro-Israel. One supports Irish Independence, one is pro-British etc. Maybe they just hate each other above all that. Anyway, it's mucho problemo whenever they meet and this sort of situation is typical... it plays out via the football and the teams. 

So these guys are arguing about the teams and the players and God knows what: Celtic vs Rangers (I'm Celtic all the way btw in case anyone wants to take it outside) and it's getting a bit tasty so I start trying to calm them down. 

I know a bit about football so I manage to do it ok but they keep butting in and soon it looks like it's all going to kick off. I have to do something so I say "look guys, no need for violence, let's just chill and have a laugh, it's only a game, there's so many more important things...."

That's when they both tried to kick MY head in. I had to run for my life. I remember them both shouting in the distance "YOU THINK IT'S ONLY A GAME??? YOU BASTARD!!!"

	<TEXT> In Europe we have a law of 'Right to be Forgotten' which essentially was brought in to protect celebrities/politicians from having bad things they've done floating round the internet.

With some Google searches relating to Serial I get the notice that some eta has been removed and a link to [Google's Policy](https://www.google.es/policies/faq/) on this. 

This law requires an individual to request that data relating to themselves be removed from Google searches. When it is successful then you will get the notice saying it's been done but not the details of who (obviously).

So - it seems that someone is requesting pages relating to themselves in relation to Serial/Adnan's case on Google be removed in Europe.

Is there a similar law in the US? Would these pages be visible in the US for a similar search?

In his "I'm going to kill" rants to Jay - which are only half-serious - Jay mentions he could get it sorted as he knows someone who could handle this type of work... agrees to act as a middle-man for a fee (possibly related to the $100 'loan'). 

Hitman does his thing after Jay and Adnan set it up. Then Jay and Adnan cruise around randomly doing stuff and visiting people intending to be each other's alibi.

Perhaps Jay facilitates this guy in some way in keeping with his story or maybe not. 

Afterwards the hitman sees they are amateurs and tries to leverage them some mor with a shake-down.... or Jay does to Adnan on his own initiative. 

Adnan doesn't bite and Jay follows through and tells his stories to the police after cutting a deal to stay out of the picture. Of course he leaves the truth about the hitman out of it and thus his story is confused and muddled as it is essentially a lie - but also the truth. 

Adnan can't take Jay down without taking the hitman down so he has to base his appeals and possible release on something that is true - he did not kill Hae - but is also not true as he was the cause of it. 

The hitman is still out there, or even perhaps 'in there' and able to get to Adnan somehow. 

He's preferring his life +30 to a death sentence essentially.

	<TEXT> There's a lot and I might list them here as I'm reading through but this one needs explaining before all that. 

**From Page 29**

*Ritz: The other conversation you said you had with him and what was that again?*

*Jay: He wanted me to revisit the body*

*Ritz: And when did that conversation take place?*

*Jay: Um prior to Hae Lee's death (!!!! WHAT?)*

*Ritz: How did that all come about?*



Ritz just carries on!! No questions, no pulling up, no elucidation!

You've got to think Jay could not have said this and that if he did Ritz would be like 'whoa...wait...'.

This kind of stinks. Seems some sort of creative editing of which this is an uncaught mistake is the most logical explanation I can think of...

	<TITLE> Most Insane Serial Theory of the Week Award </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-25 10:57:47 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We need one. I am going to petition Reddit. 

There's going to be stiff competition and I don't envy the judges - I like to think my (ignored) Rogue Pyschopathic Cop theory would be in the running but that's last week and doesn't qualify.

So, inspired by the theories I've been reading over my morning coffee - and which shall remain nameless - here's my official entry:

*Adnan is covering for someone else. Someone he cares about enough to take the rap. He enlisted Jay to help him incriminate himself and told him the details of the car, location, other stuff. Then he wrote "I will kill" on the letter and left it for the cops to find.*

*He also planted other 'clues' like the Neighbour Boy story and the Nisha call. This is also why he 'doesn't remember' and seems to have no enthusiasm to exonerate himself.*

Now.... where can I pick up my award? I want to think my agent, my parents, God..and of course SK.... thank you, thank you... words can't express how much this means... (sob)

	<TEXT> Most of the 'he couldn't have done it' theories based on his not being upset about the split seem to cite the fact that he was out there and getting jiggy with quite a few girls. 

But was he? Have we heard from any of these? Anyone post-Hae says they were dating/messing about? Not even Nisha seems to fall in this category.

Is there really any evidence for this claim? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Majorly imo. They are constantly - like every sentence - proclaiming Adnan's guilt. No problem with that as a pov but they don't seem to be looking at any evidence critically at all. 

They constantly say things like "if he was guilty - which of course he is - then blah" and "If you find Adnan likeable - and I like him less and less - blah"

But they dress all this up as *journalism* and accuse SK of not having journalistic integrity. It's just an Adnan bash-fest...give us the **Evidence** to support your argument!!!! 

And kick that girl who keeps forgetting what she's saying off the air! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Nisha Call theory </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2014-11-16 13:19:15 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> How about this: 

Jay has had a thing for Hae for a while. He cosies up to Adnan to get close to her.  He's jealous of Adnan and resents Hae has only eyes for him.

When they split he decides to make his move. But he's too late, Hae is seeing someone else. He becomes obsessed, ignoring his girlfriend on her birthday he decides to meet up with her to lay it on the line. She's not interested, he's annoyed - it ends how it ends.

He panics but thinks quick - he knows Adnan will come under the police microscope as prime suspect so he decides to divert the spotlight to him: he phones the one person in the phone only Adnan knows - or rather he calls the one number he doesn't recognise knowing that later this number will be checked and whoever is at the other end will truthfully swear they do not know Jay but are friends with Adnan. 

On the call he bluffs a wrong number "Is that Carolina Hegelby?" - "no, this is Nisha" or whatever... "oh, sorry wrong number". He gets Nisha's name this way but this is not totally necessary for this theory. Maybe he doesn't and just leaves it at 'wrong number'. The point is he talks and the call is registered.

Later he's got the job at the video store and Adnan is there hanging out. Jay asks him about girls he's seeing and banters in the way guys do about this stuff. Adnan tells him about this hot chick Nisha and Jay knows this is the girl in the phone.

In the ongoing banter Jay gets Adnan to call her and put him on the line (btw, this getting Jay to speak to Nisha has never been satisfactorily explained) maybe by saying he didn't believe him she existed or maybe turning the conversation to how sexy her voice is and getting Adnan to let him hear it...whatever. Doesn't matter. Point is that Jay at this point is essentially **replacing** the earlier call with this CURRENT one which *proves* they are together - thus validating Jay's story.

If it was not for the fact that Adnan had told Nisha they were in the video store and that it could be proved he only worked there *after* the murder then everyone - cops, Nisha, everyone - would have seen the Nisha Call as iron-clad evidence they were together at the murder time.

I don't know which phone called Nisha from the video store but I'm guessing it wasn't the same cell as the original Nisha Call.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Any chance the grave site is the murder site? </TITLE>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've never been 100% happy with the car as the murder-scene myself. We have no evidence for it - it seems the police have no evidence for it either - and the numerous alleged places that the car was located when it happened plays into this too.

Why are we sold on it? Just because Jay says so?

It seems to me that the burial-place was also a kind of place where people might meet to hang-out, drink/toke whatever. Certainly they did at least one time as the evidence there of the alcohol   condom shows. This is either indicative of an ongoing meet-place or else the killers maybe met there for purposes other than just burying the body.

We have no data on HOW the decision for this method of disposal was decided on do we? A discussion of how to do it? At some point the killer must have decided to use this method above others they had considered.

Is it possible the killer decided on this method because they were already there at that spot with Hae when things got dark and Hae got murdered? Perhaps the killer and her had gone there for sex? Or he had lured her there for intended sex on a pretext she fell for unaware of his intent? The rope might be significant here as an intention if we're looking at premeditation. 

The killer gets her there. Tries it on. She resists. It gets ugly. She dies. The killer hides her there and buries her in the same place after going to get the tools to do it. 

Works as well as in the car-park to me. Especially as it circumvents the cameras/witness possibility/get her in the trunk issues as well as the fact that at least two of the places claimed for this to happen must be false.

If you're going to lay a false trail why not lay that false trail three lout three false instead of two: i.e. she was not killed in the car at all.  </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Is anyone else curious about this statement of Adnan's? On face value it is about the police - and most likely it is - but does it have to be?

Even if it does refer to the police (which it probably does) then there are two key aspects to it:

* Who is he saying it to?
* Why is he panicked now? 

This second one seems divergent with Jay's testimony of a totally cool/cold killer boasting and proud of what he's done - sure of himself. In fact, as some here have argued, if he is guilty then it almost is a given that he's borderline sociopathic and while Jay's testimony supports this view then this reaction certainly doesn't. 

Put it this way: if you've just murdered your gf and you're happy cruising round, scoring weed and hanging out getting so high you feel like you need to come down...if after all that on the day of a murder during this monster high you **Still** are confident enough to take a call from the cops and engage them instead of skipping the call.... 

I'm thinking a visit from the cops on another day when you're straight and had got all your crap together might not be so panic inducing.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The detective in Ep8 mentions that in any case there are many inconsistencies that somehow get bypassed - either as Bad Evidence or because that's just what happens in investigations... some things never get wrapped up and in the search for a conviction (as opposed to The Truth) then that's accepted.

Many of the things we puzzle over here will probably end up in that category but there's one that I don't think will and which, imo, is the central core both of the case and the podcast: Adnan's attitude.

He seems to have no passion for his own situation and to 'make it right' or outrage at Jay etc. No sense of injustice. All this is fine if he's guilty but he 's still claiming he's not - but not appearing to act like we would expect someone to do in that situation.  Note: obviously we don't know him or how he reacts so this is not science, nor does it mean he's guilty (or innocent) but what it does mean I think is that there is something else in play... something we don't know about. 

And we don't know about it because it's a bombshell (probably) that SK has found out and that was pencilled in to be the Big Reveal that will tip us to innocence/guilt at the end of the series.

I hope this doesn't happen personally and it is not like this but from my pov it's looking more like it. 

The reason - apart from the moral/manipulative one often discussed here - is that if that were to be the way it goes then it would go right against the spirit of why we all bought into Serial in the first place.

We're all - to some exert - playing the amateur sleuth here and that's a large part of the appeal: making discoveries, doing research to whatever extent or just thinking things over. 

If it looked like we'd been fed info or led along certain paths when the 'real' info was not on the table I don't know how I'd feel. Put another way, as long as we're n the journey together with SK week by week I'm cool with her knowing stuff we don't know (has to be that way) but if there's a big fat elephant sitting there in camouflage from Day One and we've been misdirected from it so it can be unveiled in Ep11-12 say then I don't know how I'd feel.

It would kind of go against the ethos of the show maybe.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's my understanding that the Nisha Call that is SK's 'smoking gun' was a call to her landline. This is the line on which she testified to not having a voicemail/answering machine. 

Adnan when questioned by SK said he was sure she had a voicemail. So the question is: did Nisha have a cellphone too? If so then it would for sure have had a voicemail (isn't it a default?) and could explain Adnan's claim. 

More importantly, it might reveal there were more calls if we knew both numbers. It seems they spoke a lot. </TEXT>
