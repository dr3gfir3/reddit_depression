	<TEXT> This is disappointing. I always looked up to Australia as one of the few nations to stand up for both the environment, health and animal rights -- its recent actions against Japan, for instance, with regard to to whale hunting . Australia has made gutsy moves that other countries do not dare to make, like the banning of certain GMO products, which pisses off several large corporations. 

I'm prepared to criticize the government for this latest reluctance to move forward on environmental issues, but the pieces don't seem to fit. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes! I play SWTOR on an ASUS laptop I got for about $400 -- not a joke. Incredibly, it performs better than my $3500 gaming pc. I wouldn't believe me either. Had to share that, however, because it's true. Caveat: the "w" key flew off the first week but I'm still a happy bish.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The physical key is just a nifty idea for getting and extra $5 from you. The crappy app is their way of convincing people they tried to make it easier...and free? Not sure if the app was free because it never opened on my Galaxy. But then why would it work on the most common phone out there? It's not like they have lots of programmers and money to put into ... oh wait. </TEXT>
