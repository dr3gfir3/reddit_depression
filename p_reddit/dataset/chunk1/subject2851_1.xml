	<TEXT> I was depressed before we moved into the van, yes, but it was manageable
After the van, it became overwhelming.  Why is this so hard for you to understand?

also, January of this year?  Do you not remember the issue you had with staying employed before you got your current job??  I'm waiting for the rug to be pulled out from under my feet again because that's what keeps happening </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Actually, the meds are for my anxiety   just happen to double as anti depressants
I was in therapy for my anxiety only.  I didn't talk much about my depression, more about my ennui,   that was only after my anxiety issues had started to improve. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Seriously?
I'm making up new things to do because I don't want to pick up garbage, not because I don't want us to be in debt, or not be able to go out to eat, or afford healthy food to cook?

I'm married to you   I'm starting to believe you're a troll. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have 3 sets of Prismacolor pencil crayons.  One I spent $200 on, one I spent $50 on,   one I got for free.
All of the money spent on these sets was before I even MET you.

I have also bought single pencil crayons, maybe $50 worth, since meeting you.

Way to misrepresent me even more.

-------------------- UPDATE ---------------------------

Looking back at this comment, I think I took it the wrong way.  I took it as you saying me having the art supplies was a waste of money, but now that I read it again, I think you meant that breaking the art supplies would be wasted money.
Sorry about the misunderstanding </TEXT>

Technically, we've still got an unresolved one from about 3 days ago (I don't even remember what anymore, but I'm left with the feeling of something being unresolved because of it) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You had 4 glasses, 2 plates,   a bowl sitting in the living room yesterday.  I commented on it,   had to yell at you a couple hours later to get you to take them into the kitchen

How deluded do you have to be in order to think you're pretty good about cleaning up after yourself? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So you go out of your way to make me completely dependent on you, tell me you don't want me working outside the home, tell me you don't even want me making any decisions on my own, then decide to just dump me because you can't talk to me?

	<TEXT> You don't see how the depression could fit in.

REALLY???

Despite the fact that I tell you I'm depressed at least once a week?  Despite the fact that I'm unhappy with our relationship   the communication   your motivation?  Despite the fact that I'm still fighting a burn-out from the year we lived in a van   I had to do EVERYTHING?

YOU DON'T SEE HOW DEPRESSION COULD FIT IN???? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wifey dearest here.  I'd just like to clarify a few points that my husband seems to have overlooked

Before I even start: when we got together, I was very up front   clear about the fact that I didn't want children, I'm an artist,   I want to be a housewife.  I didn't lie, mislead, or anything,   he was okay with that.
Now, onto the actual issues:

One: I don't expect the house to be spotless.  I want him to do the dishes (he brings home containers with food   leaves them random non-sink places, so they stink to high heaven by the time they're found).  I used to do dishes, but I started making it his job as punishment because I shouldn't have to deal with this.

Two: The only other chores I expect him to do are laundry, empty out the garbage,   clean up after himself.  I shouldn't have to pick his clothes   anything he's gotten out in the last month up off the floor just so I can sweep (which i would do if there wasn't shit all over the floor)

Three: I'm not a neat freak.  I'd like it if our flat surfaces weren't totally cluttered with random crap,   I get pissed off at him because he just moves piles of junk from one flat surface to another.

Four: He has NEVER brought up 90% of this with me, despite me telling him that he needs to communicate with me   tell me what's wrong.  Apparently he'd rather share it with a million strangers on the internet than the woman he supposedly 'loves'.

Five: My husband neglected to mention that for a year, my art was the only real income we had, while he worked MAYBE 20 hours a MONTH.  His excuse?  "Depression"
Apparently this excuse is good enough for him but not good enough for me to not put dishes away a couple times a week.

Also, while he was only working 20 hours a month, he didn't chip in   help out extra around the 'house' (we were living in a camper van at the time), so I was still expected to do all my domestic duties on top of churning out as much art as I was physically capable of, just to keep us afloat.

Six:
He lost his credit card a couple weeks ago,   tore the house apart looking for it.  Bedroom is still in disarray.  Apparently it's my job to clean up the mess he makes whenever he's looking for something he lost.  I didn't sign up to be a fucking maid.


As for the online game, I wish I HAD done that since I'm being blamed anyway, but no, the internet just went slow last night.  Apparently I'm responsible for shitty bandwidth, not sure how useful a super power that's going to be, but whatever, better than nothing

Also, funny how he noticed me getting drunk but not me crying myself to sleep BEFORE getting drunk.  I'm quite sure I was equally loud both times.

Why did I go to LCBO?  Because he told me that the relationship was over   crying myself to sleep doesn't work, yet getting drunk   passing out works amazingly. (Also, he's either bullshitting about me not saying anything, or he just doesn't listen to me enough to remember, but I said a LOT to him after he broke it off.  I told him I was tired of feeling depressed, I was tired of how I was the one holding the relationship together,   how I just wanted to be happy.  Apparently that's not a word)

Where we're going?  I asked him why he doesn't care about me.  He also said he had 10 minutes before work.
Maybe if he'd actually TALK TO ME I wouldn't have to do this out of the blue when he has things to do.



I won't be checking back here.  The comments are much too hateful from people who only know my husband's misrepresented side of the story, but I figured I'd at least try to point out that no, this is not an accurate representation of what is actually going down.  Just an accurate representation of the problems he's created in his head to make it look like he's not responsible.


Also, I had a job for 2 months.  I was still expected to do everything I'm already expected to do around the house.    he didn't want me having the job. </TEXT>
