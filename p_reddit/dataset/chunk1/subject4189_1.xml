	<TEXT> Someone on IMDB put it so well for people who are criticizing the film

Original thread: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt4263482/board/thread/254016144
 
Here is the post in quotes 

"What does the title card say? "A New England Folktale". It's not meant to be ambiguous or complicated. Think of it like you're being told a story at bedtime or in a classroom. The movie has a very straightforward lesson. 

What's the first scene in the movie? William think he's better and more pious than the village counsel, and says he's happy to be banished. This leads directly to his baby being kidnapped. He ignores this and ignores that his wife is beside herself with misery because of his actions. 

The movie is mostly a catalogue of his lies and hypocrisy and how his poor example spreads to the rest of the family. He lies constantly, about the cup, about hunting, and encourages also his son to lie, even as he tells him to memorize how his soul is riven with sin. Even his baby is filled with sin, in his mind, yet the sin we witness is his constant hypocrisy. 

Things spiral out of control. The children accuse each other, but only because they've learned how to lie for their own safety when convenient, and out of a sense of real danger that their parents will harm them if they're found to be consorting with the devil. They're right to turn on each other! It's only natural in a house as mad as this. 

The father dies, killed by Black Phillip. Why does he accept his death? "Corruption, thou art my father". 

And so Thomasine, left with nothing, turns to the only source of authority and shelter left to her: the evil present in the house. But they had every chance to turn away from evil, to scorn hypocrisy. They didn't. 

So what's the moral of the story? False piety is no substitute for moral substance. Very straightforward, very unambiguous." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> SHe honestly doesn't see that he is an unnatracitve person. Not only physically but he taps into that insecurity with this addict/advice shit because he thinks it makes him come off wise an enlightened but I've only found it to make him more close minded and shallow. For all his self deprication, it's all bullshit. I think that's what having money and moderate success does to people who are able to bag women out of their league. It's not healthy.

I mean, he also believes that deep down people are exactly like him sexually. Just weird and fucking perverted to an almost perverted degree and that's what guise he takes as "real".

It's pitiable really. He's just an empty vessel walking around NYC and doing the road on the weekend. Never knowing what affection or happiness is but he LOATHES the mentally ill </TEXT>

	<TEXT> [Before   After] (http://m.imgur.com/a/IgyTU)

I posted in r/loseit but I thought I would come here and share my story because I love hearing and seeing everyone's stories about being healthy and losing weight.

Mine basically started with the fact that I have depression. Which is something that I've always had to deal with and always will. But around the end of 2014 I had just turned 21 and I realized that I can't change the way that I feel but a lot of the reasons that I feel so shitty is because I'm overweight.

I hated how I couldn't fit into any stylish clothes, just sweats and 2xl t-shirts from Walmart. I know that that sounds vain and conceited but I literally have a closet full of shit that I couldn't fit into anymore. I hated how I couldn't go outside. One of those pics I'm in is when I was in Hawaii and I was MISERABLE the whole time and barely left the hotel room. I hated how food was my only comfort and realized that that's not a very healthy way to live life.

Around Christmans time I decide to change with baby steps. I cut out things in my diet that were unhealthy but I know I wouldn't miss. For instance I never had had much of a sweet tooth so sugar was the first thing to go. And then I cut out alcohol. Within the first month I lost 25-30 pounds right there. Then I cut out red meat, which did WONDERS for my energy. I also started walking EVERYWHERE. Work/school/shopping, and after I stereo losing weigh those walks turned into power walks which turned into jogs which turned into slow runs, you get the picture. After about half way through the year I started taking up a ton of combat sports such as boxing, kick boxing and jiu jitsu. I've always loved MMA and it's amazing what all of those (boxing especially) did for my muscle and weight loss. Really toned up my shoulders as well.

I started to use my NutriBullet and adding Kale to my diet. I hated it at first but when you blend it with fruit and other things you don't notice it and it's so good for you.

Just baby steps. Losing weight got really fun towards the end and it was nice to go outside with out a shirt on.

	<TITLE> Do we all agree that this has been a GREAT year for film???? </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I just got back from seeing Room, and WOW. Amazing film. I haven't cried during a film for so long and I did it twice in this film within 5 minutes of each scene. And I'm walking back to my car and I realize that this has been such a good year for film. Some of my favorites that stand out:

1) Mad Max: Fury Road was a poweful movie and was just so beautiful film to look at. 

2) Sicario: amazing cinematography. And heart wrenching tension. Incredibly cynical and dark with a very realistic ending that stuck with me.

3) Steve Jobs: literally an action film with words. Great performances and it bums me out that it bombed at the box office. 

4) The Martian: A fun film that I enjoyed with my grandfather. It's fun to see a film and enjoy it because of someone else's experience.

5) Inside Out: like I said with my Grandpa, I saw this with my neices and it was fun to see it through their eyes. It's cool to see kids find a movie like Toy Story was to me.

6) Room: I know I praised it already but this film is incredible. It's a movie that I know I'll be thinking about in a week and it just touched me on another level. Brie Larson better win an Oscar. Go see it. It's my favorite film so far this year

Watching previews and it amazes me that with a month and a half left of the year we still have a TON of promosing films to be released or that I haven't seen yet (The Revenant, The H8teful Eight, Joy, Concussion, The Danish Girl). And of course probably the highlight for the world in terms of film and 2015.

Star Wars

What are your guys thoughts???

	<TEXT> I'm listening to a Nopie show and the boys were discussing the Civil War/Lincoln and this hilarious quip was uttered.

Jim: "There were rumors that The Confederacy was sending delegates to meet with Lincoln to negotiate ending the war early so slavery could still stay intact, but because it took them so long to ride North, Lincoln had enough time to reconsider his decision and decided to initiate The Emancipation Proclamation before ending the war."

Anthony: "Really? If I had a time machine I'd go back with a Ferrari and pick them up." </TEXT>
