	<TEXT> It's best to just go back and read each instance.  I doubt the angel who destroyed the Egyptian first-born was just some "dude".  I doubt the angel who guards the way to the tree of life is just some dude (he'd be a very old dude by now).  I doubt the Angel armies whom the prophets servant couldn't see we're just delivering a message.  I doubt the Angels who contended against Gabriel to keep him from Daniel were just some dudes.  I don't think the shepherds were confused by what they saw.  I think Peter spoke to a supernatural being in jail.
If you take he view that the Bible is the true, inspired Word of God, kept by the Spirit of God, and meant to be read as such then things make sense-reality comes into focus.  If you take the view that it's some cobbled-together bastardization of older stories and helpful wisdom, then your life will be one long, frustrating cloud of doubt and questions.
Just read it until it reads you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Mmmmkay-your first source is the Wikipedia page about Sodom and Gomorrah which confirms the accuracy of the site I referenced-it actually references right to the article you disparaged.  Strong research skills there.

The second link in your reply links to some discussion forum from 2011-my article is from 2015.  Again-pretty lazy and sloppy.

Your third reference is run by a foundation that has a person named " FuzzyCatPotato" on its board-very slick.

As to your last comment, a more careful reading of my last paragraph clarifies that we aren't even in disagreement there.  Take a deep breath fella.

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> In America,  where our leaders are ELECTED, and speaking your conscience is the patriotic thing to do, then speaking out against a terrible leader IS submitting to our governing authorities.  What Christian Trump supporters ( I cringe to even type that oxymoron) do not understand is that the authority in our system is the ideals laid out in the Constitution that the President HIMSELF swears to uphold-so the authority is NOT the man, but the Republic as envisioned in the ideals of the Constitution.

Therefore-by speaking out against a bad leader who tramples/perverts/misinterprets the principles of our Republic, I AM submitting.  We don't elect a King or Caesar for 4 years-we elect a President who is bound to a limited role as the administrator of 1/3 of our government and is limited by checks and balances.

By their  logic we should all submit to Roe v Wade, right?  It's the law.  If I can't speak out against Trump because it's not submissive then they can't speak out against Roe v Wade because it's not submissive.  We can and SHOULD speak out against both. </TEXT>

It actually happened and is documented (https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.breakingisraelnews.com/51870/sodom-found-archaeological-evidence-proof-biblical-account-health-and-science/amp/?client=safari)

Feel free to ignore science and archaeology because it doesn't fit your ego-centric Godless world view.

Homosexuality is wrong, but I, for one, do not think it should be outlawed nor should homosexuals be persecuted or marginalized.  Jesus loves homosexuals as much as He loves me!  Jesus doesn't force Himself in anyone and neither should the Church.  We have to submit to what the Bible actually teaches, though.  We don't judge it, it judges us. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Trump said in his RNC acceptance speech that he would be working to allow churches to voice their politics from the pulpit-reversing LBJ who threatened churches that they'd lose their tax exempt status if they openly spoke about politics from the pulpit.
My question-poorly stated, I suppose-is will Trump follow through on that or will he do so only if Christians stick with him?  Will it be principle, pragmatism, or will he simply forget he ever mentioned it.
He could also just dangle it out in front of churches while he abuses those he doesn't like and hope it keeps us quiet... </TEXT>

I will note, and not implying that you personally voted for him, that most Trump voters are, like the man himself, very ready to sling insults but incredibly thin-skinned themselves OR so precious that you know full and well they have ZERO idea about everything Trump has said /done/grabbed/dodged and they just think the media is out to get him because Hannity said so.
I am not implying you supported him with your vote, but neither will I refrain from characterizing him as a primate.  It's (like your vote to me) none of your business, right? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree with you-the people who voted Trump are responsible for this mess and, given that he's simply following through with the terrible things he said he'd do in the campaign, the Church has stained the reputation of Christ by their association with Trump.  You've completely mirrored my own position.
The true Church is going to have to rise up and will likely be hotly persecuted-not by the non-Christians, but by the so-called Christians who've aligned themselves with this demagogue.
John Piper, Russell Moore, a number of other very high profile Protestants have made me proud in this regard. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You've wasted a lot if time and energy responding to what you think I've said rather than what I've said.  You've still not even refuted what I sent earlier!
Mary IS blessed, she IS special, she IS the mother of Our Lord.  But the devotion you posted and praised as so " POWERFUL" is a collection of prayers TO Mary.  We cannot pray to Mary.  There's no scriptural mechanism that guarantees she CAN even hear a prayer directed at her.  We may as well pray to David or Moses or Noah.  
Again, just like God's problem was not with gold, but what the idolatrous Israelites made with the gold at the foot of Sinai, so  His problem is not with Mary, but with what YOUR idolatrous hearts have made of her!  
You've misapplied the verse you cited.  In Revelation the woman is Israel, not Mary personally, as implied by the 12 stars for the 12 tribes.  "But Mary is literally the one who birthed Christ" you will bleat.  If it were meant to be literal then she would have a gigantic ball of fire wrapping her and she would be standing in the moon!  Revelations is mysterious and you apply it literally by your pet theories at your peril.  
My eyes are neither veiled nor scaled in regards to the scriptures' portrayal of Mary.  You would be best served and God most honored if you would reserve your devotion and prayers for Him, and not His creature. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I know the verse I cited was not referencing Jesus's refusal to see his mother.  I just assumed you would be able to find it.  It was illustrating his direct words to his disciples regarding prayer, which is the central issue we are discussing.   He never tells us to pray to Mary or pray TO anyone else-this is a Roman innovation.
You are misapplying the verses from John 8:41-44.  The Pharisees ARE insulting his lineage and essentially calling him a bastard (in the classic sense), but his response is talking about freedom from man-made traditions (v36), not defending his mother.
Marian devotion has the most tenuous biblical support (I would say zero support), Mr. Smith.  It is a Roman tradition and an outshoot of amalgamating true Christianity with pagan mother-God worship to make
It more palatable to new converts. </TEXT>

I'd like to hear from the 18 year old she got dumped for.  I'd like to hear from the guy that left the card in her door.  I'd like to know if anyone has any pictures from the barbecue (the principal, Troy, might)-that way we could see if she was actually wearing the necklace they found pieces of at her house.  I'd like to hear from the old drug store owner with the unique car.  I'd like a list of all the guys she was sleeping with (it might be long).  I realize the GBI probably has a lot of this already.  That's my Christmas wish list.  So interesting! </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So, the fact that her car seat was pushed way back and her keys, phone, wallet, etc were all locked in the house leads me to believe that someone took her car back from where they dumped her body, put all her stuff back in the house, locked the door behind them, then accidentally dropped the blue glove in the pine straw.  What that also suggests is that whoever did that had to be picked up by someone and driven back wherever.  So, at least 2 people.  My money is in the boyfriend and his cop friend (blue glove). </TEXT>
