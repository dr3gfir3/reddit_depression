	<TEXT> It also is all about the angle of the photo lol if this was taken of the front of me it may not have been as flattering :p but then again I also feel like I have no clue what my body really looks like tbh so there's that.

Also I'm totally a potato always! It's funny you mention that, I always call myself one and my friends are like "ur so weird" lmao

EDIT: why did I get down voted :| </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've actually talked about it a little too much with him and he has apologized and seems remorseful. He's been working on being a better and more honest boyfriend and I've seen it, yet I have strong feelings of resentment still :/ I'm just stuck I guess. I hope I don't have to dump him over this because I do think he is a good guy, he just made some shitty, insensitive and immature mistakes because he was dealing with his own issues too. If this resentment is truly something I cannot get over, then it's pretty obvious I'm going to never be able to truly be happy in the relationship  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I've beat the dead horse way to much on it with him that I don't think it's helpful to continue bringing it up. He told me that he can't let this continue dragging him down anymore and that it happened so long ago and it's something I have to work through with my therapist. He has apologized and seems like he means it. He has tried to be patient with me as much as he can but I think he's right in that he can't make it any better and he's done what he can. It's no so much as how he talks about it, but it's what he does that shows me he's working on being better.

My boyfriend also deleted Facebook after one of the incidents involved Facebook. He hasn't had it for over a year and if he needs to check something he will always delete it right after again. If I cry, he will hold me and know that I'm sad about the incident, but I just don't really bring it up. 

That's why this is so difficult. I do see he's trying and he does seem to feel remorseful, but I still cannot get over this and fixate on it every day. It makes me feel really hopeful that you were able to get through it with your SO. I'm sorry that happened to you but I'm really glad you worked through it together!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok not really ED related but for people who currently resent someone or have resented someone.. Is it possible to like stop? A part of me resents my boyfriend for a lot of lying and shitty things that happened in our first year of dating. It causes a lot of tension between us, even though it happened over two years ago. I have become fixated on things that happened to the point where they have been a major part of my body image issues and overall poor mental health. What can I do to really believe that he hates what he did in the past and is a better person now? And also to just feel like I'm good enough for him and I'm all he needs? Please anything would be helpful, thanks! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Does anyone else get really surprised when they see a candid photo taken of themselves? Like to the point where they almost don't recognize themselves? When I look in the mirror I still see myself as a little chubby and could be better. But I seriously did not recognize that this was a pic of me for like a few seconds and was shocked that I actually kind of look like a string bean. There are obviously places I can see that I would like to lose from, but still does anyone else experience this? 


Here is the photo:

Also lmao the explanation of this pic was that I was trashed and was trying to hitchhike home, hence my hand :p  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Same, I have really all or nothing thinking about eating. Either I don't eat much all day and meticulously count every bite I put into my mouth, or I overeat/binge and want to cry and hide myself in shame and try to avoid counting the monstrosity that just took place. Eating a "normal" amount to maintain my weight seems almost impossible, and even if I were to eat that amount I would probably still feel incredibly guilty and stressed out. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Reddit!

My boyfriend and I have been dating for three years. Things have been rocky at points but recently things seem to be looking up for us. We've been living together officially for the past year, and basically lived together in our dorms for the other two years. 

Marriage doesn't seem like something he wants in general at all, so I know it's not just me. When he was younger, his father cheated on his mom and left him, his sister, and his mom alone. He wasn't truly a part of his life until the end of high school (so it seems). 

We were watching a tv show where marriage was brought up and he says to me "I don't even wanna get married". I asked him why and he said "I mean, divorce and all that bullshit. Like I want to be with you forever but just no marriage". I was like "oh, well I'd like to get married eventually" and he said "how about I just buy you a dress and you can wear it around!". I guess he was trying to make light of the situation. We ended up just calmly dropping the conversation.

I'd like to eventually get married because it shows a true commitment, especially if we are eventually going to have kids (something he seems to want some day). I also like the idea of a (small) wedding and having all of our friends and family there for us to support us. Also the obvious financial reasons of course. 

**TL;DR** My boyfriend doesn't ever want to get married due to his fear of divorce. He doesn't think it's worth it. It's definitely in my future plans to get married to someone I love, and while I do love him dearly, this is kind of making me think a lot about what I want in terms of us.
