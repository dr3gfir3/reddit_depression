	<TEXT> Would you like to play a game with me? The rules are simple.

1.	The object of the game is to take control of the game board with your pieces

2.	Move your pieces to take strategic positions on the board *or* block the opponent from getting to a position on the board

3.	Each piece has a defined, concrete type of movement

      a.	Inhibitors can move two spaces in any direction

      b.	Activators can move one space forward or two spaces back

      c.	Links can be placed on the board to connect an Activator to a space permanently

4.	Two Activators can remove an Inhibitor and visa-versa

5.	The player to control more than half of the board after all turns in a round wins


You would? Great! I knew youd like my game. It is very addicting! Just put this headset on and we can begin.

Oh, poor first move. Hey, did I mention what you win? No, silly me, I always forget that part. You win complete control of your opponents mind. Isnt that great?

	<TEXT> I used to work in a laboratory with a sub-zero walk in freezer. We didn't need to go in very often, maybe once a day. Toward the end of my shift I went to put away a CSF sample that we needed to store and when I opened the door a co-worker of mine burst out.

She had been trapped inside for about twenty minutes trying to open the door but it had frozen stuck and she wasn't strong enough to push it open.

They installed an emergency alarm inside the freezer the next day. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good morning, NSers!

Yesterday my eyes were opened to a beautiful truth about this subreddit. The horrible shame boners we all get from reading these amazing stories has actually blossomed into real, unrequited love. There are people freaking getting married! Some of them met on here! And there are Canadians among us... just teasing. Kind of.

So that got me to thinking - what the hell else do I not know about the amazing community that I write to and read from. 

Then I thought so more. Now we are getting into dangerous territory! If I have this many questions maybe some have questions about me. So here we go:

My name is Aaron and I live in Kansas City, Kansas. I am married (six years) and our only daughter just turned one two weeks ago. I have always loved reading, usually gobbling up a book in a day because I didn't want to put it down. 

Parenting took a huge chunk of time away from that so my main form of reading now comes from this sub during my working hours. I have also always enjoyed writing. Poems, silly bed time stories for my friends kids, that kind of thing. 

This sub has inspired me to try and put all of those horrible English classes to good use and get my thoughts on paper. Of course my family is a huge inspiration as well.

All of my stories are based on my life to some degree. The Craigslist story actually happened (except the kidnapping part), the Patient 314 series is based off of a condition I have, over-active heart. 

I hope this was helpful and fun for you to know a little about me. And I hope this was in the right place. If you have any questions you would like to ask me, go for it! I would love to learn more about you, too, so please comment about who you are and how you started writing.

Thanks for being so awesome, NS! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My great grandfather and I were very close. He had a woodshop out back that he would hole up in and tinker with one project or another while smoking his pipe. I would sit quietly and watch him work. I have a few of his pieces of furniture throughout my home as does my parents, grandparents, and pretty much every aunt and uncle. He was incredible with wood. I speak in the past tense about grandad because he died recently of old age. It was peaceful, from what I am told. Heart attack in his sleep that never woke him up. 

Everyone was grieving, sorrowful, wishing for one last moment, but no one shocked. He was quite old and lived a long life after all. And of course he smoked quite a bit for his entire adult life. At the funeral there were many great stories told about him. He loved to spin some yarn and had a laundry list of amazingly fantastic tales that he would captivate us younguns with. Some of the most popular ones were retold, attempting to re-enact the magic that grandad created, some were of his youthful shenanigans, some of how wonderful of a father he was. 

All were true, all were powerful. But it was the story that no one told, my favorite story of his, that stuck out to me and that story is the one I would like to entrust with you today. After the funeral I talked with many friends and family I had not seen in years, maybe even decades for some, and asked if any had talked with grandad about *The Camp*. Most had no idea what I was talking about but his eldest daughter, my grandmother had a very different response. She hit me upside my head and scolded me as you would a dog who just peed on new carpet. 

Dont you ever ask about that again, Charles. Dont you ever!

With that she stormed out and I received quite a few looks and head shakes. Murmurs spread through the crowded living room. *What did he say? Insensitive little shit, isnt he? Such a shame to ruin today.*

I followed her outside to try and figure out what I had done to upset her so badly and found her shuddering with sobs on the front steps of the porch. I apologized, explained that I was confused about her reaction and why no one knew about the story. After a time she caved and told me it was not a story as I had supposed but was in fact true. She couldnt believe that he had told it to me but supposed it was because we had such a special bond. We talked for over an hour - me asking questions, her filling in gaps in my memory and gaps in the details grandad left out.

I left in complete awe, and quite frankly afraid. I will do my best to tell his story.

--------------------

Granddad had been helping Jews hide for almost a year when he was caught. I think they treated sympathizers worse than they treated the Jews, if that were possible. He and those he was hiding were ushered into the back of a truck and taken to a train. From there they were segregated by sex and age and health.

He was still young and strong so he was sent to Monowitz, or Auschwitz III, to work in the chemical factories along with the other political prisoners and Jewish slaves. From what information I can find on the work camp a slave would last on average four months but that is generous according to granddad. He said you try to make friends to endure another day but by the time you know someones name they are already dead.

He never did go into much detail about the camp and his work there but he did tell me he was there almost seven months. An accident in the plant left him with a bad leg that he couldnt hide from the SS officers and he knew he would be dead within the week if not that very day. Once you were too weak to work they would ship you off to Birkenau to be gassed.

At that time the Germans had yet to perfect their methods of killing. They were experimenting with carbon monoxide, Zyklon A, B and C, and innumerable different ways to deliver them. In the middle of the night my granddad and forty or more near-death Jews were ushered into the back of a large van with whips. The van was sealed and left running with the exhaust redirected into the sealed compartment. Granddads van was also equipped with Zyklon C and the combination of exhaust fumes and Zyklon C filled their mobile prison cell very quickly. 

Some of this may sound familiar to you but that is where the similarities end. Zyklon C isnt mentioned anywhere in the history books. I have no idea what it was but I do know that it was only used once. 

Granddad and the other men pounded on the sides of the van, screaming for help, to be let out, for mercy. People scrambled on top of others in an attempt to find non-toxic air. Noses were broken, eyes pushed in, teeth kicked loose. Granddad huddled in the corner praying it would be over quickly. His eyes watered and his lungs burned and his skin felt like he had stepped into an oven. 

He had to pull away from the corner because of the heat. Patches of his exposed skin burned from touching the walls of the van. Others began yelling out in pain and pushed toward the center. The walls began to glow a dull red, then brighter, brighter, orange turned into bright yellow. There was no more air to breath. The extreme heat had sucked it all out and men clutched at their throats, clawing at their eyes as the heat seared their retinas and traveled inward to their brain. 

Some succumbed quickly and others laid on top of their bodies as protection from the superheated floor of the van. Granddad said he thought the entire van had been driven into a crematorium and set ablaze. He gave in to the heat and lack of oxygen soon after climbing above a fallen neighbor. 

He awoke with a start, like being hit with a defibrillator. The intense heat was still present and it made his skin crawl as if it were melting right off of his bones. Each breath scorched his insides and no amount of tears could moisten his eyes. Every centimeter of his body burned and ached. A vast chasm expanded out in front of him and millions of people stood along the edge. One by one they toppled forward. Their screams echoed up indefinitely as granddad watched the horror. After what seemed like hours he felt his body move against his will. One step forward. Then another. With a final step he would be lost in the chasm forever when he was pulled backwards.

Backwards out of a burning van. Bodies were dragged out and thrown into a ditch nearby. Only he survived. He was later told that the engine backfired which caused the fire. Those who didnt die from the gas were boiled alive by the extreme heat.

Granddad was shipped from Birkenau to a large manor in the countryside where officers and doctors questioned him. How did you survive? What happened to you? How long were you in the van? He was hooked up to all kinds of tests, interrogated and tortured for weeks, and finally shipped off to a work camp in case further questioning was needed. 

At first he couldnt believe he was alive. He reveled in it, worked hard, kept his head down. Just as his curiosity began to get the best of him the war was over and he was found and set free. He begged the United States military to take him to the manor for answers and finally they did.

Granddad has survived in the back of that van for over two days while it raged and burned with a heat so intense it melted the frame in some places. They never used Zyklon C again after that but they did continue the use of the vans with just the exhaust directed into the back via a grate on the floor. Rumor spread about the fire and they were given the nickname Hell Vans. 

It is amazing how close to the truth that name was.

	<TEXT> He was not a good person. Not a good husband or father, not a good neighbor or teacher. English class, I believe.

He was, however, an excellent task master. What good are children if not for labor? He had many.

His house was sparkling and spotless. Martha Stewart would be proud. The lawn immaculate, rivaling the cities botanical gardens. Had you been unfortunate enough to be his neighbor you would see his children work their fingers to the bone day in and day out. 
They could not play. They could not frolic. They could not eat until the chores were done. 

I never heard them talk, let alone laugh. But I heard him.

Bite the bullet, girl. You dilly dally now youll miss supper.

Dont you dare cut corners, boy. A man is only as good as the job he does.

Looks like you finished by the skin of your teeth today!

What are you waiting for? The early bird gets the worm!

My wife told me not to interfere. She told me to let the police handle things. I couldnt do that.

------------

I strapped him tightly to a sturdy chair in my basement and slapped his face to wake him up. I forced the mouth widener into his thin-lipped maw. No pain, no gain. My eyes must have twinkled when I uttered those four words because fear dripped out of his in the form of tears. 

Using a scalpel I slowly peeled the gums away from his teeth one by one. 

I am not sure what exactly constitutes a corner on a human being so I did my best. His shoulders gushed from the deep gashes and his feet pumped blood out of the stumps where toes used to be. 

As the color in his skin slowly faded I placed a bullet in between his red teeth. Time to call it a day, neighbor. I placed a punch on the back of the bullet casing and mashed into it with a hammer. 

I hated English. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I knew a Carlos. He would give me purple nurples and Indian burns all the time. He stole my gym clothes and art supplies so I couldn't take part in every project. 

The teachers never listened to me and eventually I had to do something about it. Right in the middle of class I punched him in the face as hard as I could. I doubt it really hurt him too badly but it stopped all of the hassling.

Years later I finally grew up, standing over 6 ft. 2 and bulked up a little. He didn't. I towered over him and he literally acted like my slave out of fear of what I might do in retaliation for the years of torment. 

Stand up for yourself, OP. Don't let him take over your life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you have a really great story that can be "updated" in the course of a night or two I suggest posting the main part and then updating the readers "as it happens". 

If your story can't really be broken down like that but has a natural break, maybe a cliffhanger somewhere in the middle, go a head and make it a two part series.

Otherwise just slap it all in one post and let the readers enjoy all of it at once. </TEXT>

My favorite of my own is the CL mattress story because it is based on a true event that I embellished and the Stick to the Highways story which is 100% true.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The legend has it that st Patrick removed the snakes from Ireland and that is why he is so famous today. This submission is claiming that there never were any snakes and that leprechauns are real, but not in the "tiny little men" idea. They were eradicated for their land similar to American Indians.  </TEXT>

It was my first night without my wife in bed with me in as long as I can remember. I could barely sleep because something was just off, you know? 

Anyway, thanks for the advice and kind words. I am dreading the next hour like I am on death row. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> **This was mysteriously deleted, probably from the makers of the Pool I entered. I am submitting it here again with an update from day one of the tournament.**

Tomorrow the NCAA Tournament begins (yes, the play-in games were Tuesday, no I dont count them) and like most if not all of you I love this time of year. I am in countless pools at work, with college buddies, family, and all the major sports websites that offer prizes for free. It is fun, exciting, and usually pretty free money. Online betting sites offer all kinds of free bets during this time to suck people in and get them to deposit more of their own. I never fall for that and usually dont need to anyway. Ive already cashed out a few checks all from a free $5 bet that one site gave me.

I dont mean to brag but usually I do very well in the pools and make a few hundred on them each year. This year will hopefully be no different. I had all of my brackets set and a few free bets ready to go and was just about to shut down the computer when a pop-up caught my eye. I usually dont get pop-ups which is why I paid attention to it in the first place.

MARCH MADNESS 2017  Feed the Frenzy!!!

That was all it said and below it was a link. The color of the font seemed off to me, a shade of red too dark and less playful than most. It almost seemed ominous now that I look back on it. Upon clicking the link it took me to a very nice, simple bracket layout. It was probably the nicest and easiest to use out of all of the sites I had been to this morning. Oddly enough it didnt prompt me to log in or sign up but simply make my picks.

After the East and Midwest regions were filled out I scrolled down to the lower half of the bracket and that is when I saw a few lines of text concerning the prizes. Basically, each pick that you are correct on will give you a random prize. Each round increases the value of the prize and if you pick the winner of the Tournament the grand prize is beyond your wildest dreams. The prizes are generated once you submit your picks.

Great, I thought. I went back and reviewed the first two regions to make sure I was good with the picks I had made. If each correct pick wins something I wanted to give it my best shot, you know? A few minutes later the bracket was complete and I hit the SUBMIT button which was the same font as the ad. Next to each game two additional slots opened up and a prize popped in to each one. I watched as watches and cell phones and gift cards filled the bracket up. I dont know if it was just coincidence or if the prizes are based off of your search engine results or whatever but all of the prizes were things that I either needed or wanted.

When the grand prize popped up I couldnt believe it. It was a house that my wife and I were lusting after! We are in the process of getting our current home ready to sell to take advantage of the increasing housing prices and all of the renovations we have done and of course we have been looking at homes to purchase once ours is sold. There was one that was perfect for us and our growing family but it was quite a bit out of our budget. And there it was, sitting in the middle of my bracket. I was just staring at it for a while before I realized that another picture was filling in beneath the prizes. I didnt understand at first. Was this like a consolation prize or something? After about fifteen or so filled in my eyes grew wide and my heart began to stampede around in my chest. These were my things! Our things! Home decorations, personal items, my car popped up in the final four. I almost passed out when the last picture popped up. It was a picture of my wife and I at our wedding, smiling from ear to ear.

A new pop-up appeared in the center of my monitor.

Thank you for your entry in the March Madness 2017  Feed the Frenzy bracket pool. You are one of thousands trying to win it all and change your life! For each game you win you will receive a prize personalized to your needs from one of the other contestants that lost the game. If no one loses we will provide the gift personally. For each game you lose an item will be taken from you and given to a lucky winner! Enjoy the Madness!

I didnt give any information. How did they know what I wanted? How did they know what I have?! I am trembling right now. How am I going to explain this to my wife? Someone was in my house! Taking pictures of all of our stuff. I what have I done?

-----------------

After I had posted this I started looking into my internet history, cookies, cache, anything that I could use to try and locate where the pop-up had originated from. There was no sign of it anywhere on my computer. Granted I am not the most knowledgeable IT guy around but I know enough to get me into trouble.

Once my quick search was fruitless I called the police and informed them of the invasion into my home, taking pictures of my more valuable items and stealing information. The operator that answered told me that she had received several calls similar to mine and that the station was looking into it. I still haven't heard anything from them about it.

After I had hung up I called a good friend of mine in the IT department at my work and he said he would look into it for me as well. A quick Google search for the key words from the pop-up did not find any results and I couldn't find anyone complaining about it online so that was a dead-end at least right now. I am dreading the games tomorrow...

------------

**Update after Day One**

I am so screwed up right now. After I drank enough to build up the courage to explain what was going on to my wife she raged on me hard and stormed out. Said she was staying with a friend for a while until I could figure out my addictions. 

I hardly call betting on a few games once a year an addiction but that is beside the point. This is probably for the best anyway. I wouldn't want her to get hurt or anything so she is probably safer being with a friend instead of at home. Hell, I should be with a friend, too!

I have never been so nervous to see the outcomes of the games in my entire life. Normally it is a fun, exciting time for me but not this year. I sweat through four applications of deodorant today at work. I jumped at every cheer. I don't know if my heart can take this for three weeks! 

Usually clocking out at work is a joyous occasion. Not today. I drove under the speed limit, held back at every yellow light. I was dreading whatever may have happened at my home while I was gone.

Finally I made it to my front door. It was closed, locked, the alarm was active. 

I set my keys down and tried to slow the thumping in my chest as  I walked to the kitchen to grab a beer. As I twisted off the cap I looked to my left into the dining room and there, on the table, were fourteen brown boxes. Within each one my prize. When I had cleared out all of the trash and packing peanuts I found an index card with two items listed on it and a "Thank you" hand written at the bottom. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Time is a powerful thing. It dictates how we value activities and what we warrant good enough. You can waste time or be efficient with your time however you can never get time back. It is ever-flowing and only on one direction.


The pleasantly voiced woman turns her body forty five degrees and gestures with her outstretched arm to the gentleman behind her. 


With that being said what would you do if you had no perception of time? Would you live your life any differently? Would you waste time on video games or books or social media? Would you focus on one hobby and perfect it? Would you simply go crazy?


She cocks her head slightly and smiles to the group.


That is what we aim to find out. So far Ian has been living within this confined apartment-style cell for twelve years and four months. We supply everything he needs and asks for barring items such as a clock or calendar. Some of you might have noticed the clock hanging on the wall. Does it look somewhat strange to you?


A hand goes up slowly, nervously.


Yes, what do you notice about the clock?


The young boy timidly responds. It only has a second hand.


Correct! Ian is not the first volunteer for this project. Steve did not last very long, unfortunately. Six weeks if I remember correctly. He made an innumerable amount of comments during his time in the cell about needing to know. Before we placed Ian into his new home we installed a clock with only the second hand in an attempt to understand just how much information we need about time in order to function. Does anyone else notice something different about the clock?


Its too fast, blurted out another child. 


Well done! Yes, we have sped up the second-hand twice now, each an increment of one eighth of a second. It was believed that if done in small enough increments that Ian would not notice and therefore use his time that much more effectively. So far the hypothesis has been correct.

A brief pause, then, Any questions? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The news was on in the break room. The TV is usually never on, and especially not news. It is boring, drab, and depressing, and our office doesn't need any more of that. 

Normally I would have turned it off but the main headline caught my eye. A small child almost died of a peanut butter allergy at school and the parents are being questioned as suspects.

*Why suspects?* I thought. 

My interest was piqued and I turned it up hoping for more details. I was shocked as more information slowly escaped the red lips of the newscaster.

The day prior the parents took out a huge life insurance policy on their child and it looked as though they were attempting to collect on that. What is strange is that they had seven years to do such a thing but only now had the child ever had an accident with peanuts. 

My mind began turning. Was it coincidence that my sandwich was made with a soft white bread and bologna? I began to think not. 

Hours later and hundreds of web pages later an idea formed solidly in my mind. My pb j's have been finding their way into people's lunches with nut allergies. Sometimes it killed them, sometimes simply hospitalized with a full recovery. However, in each instance there has been foul play uncovered. 

My sandwiches were super heroes!   </TEXT>
