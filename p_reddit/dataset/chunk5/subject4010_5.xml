	<TEXT> Was actually thinking that, if one country or city decided to become moneyless it would have to branch itself off of the rest of society. Then if it works the rest of the world could gradually do the same over time. I've been playing bioshock for the last couple of weeks now and the idea came from that, in the game Andrew Ryan built his own city to get away from the rest of the world and made his own rules of how HIS society would work. Not saying that making a underwater city full of drugusers is the way to go but the way to do it could perhaps work in the real world. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Love the gameplay trailer but I'm really disappointed that the game will most likely not look like this at all, every game shown at E3 the last years have had amazing gameplay trailers and when the game is released it's just a shitty downgraded version from what was promised... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aight, but casting ScarJo in the role isn't that bad of a situation tbh. There aren't alot of mainstream Asian actors anymore that could really fit I think AND appeal to the western world as well. But a live-action FMA with a full asian cast doesn't make sense whatsoever, but unfortunately this would most likely only appeal to the eastern world like the other anime to film they've made... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I would love a sequel/reboot of the series. I would actually want them to go the way they were going before the last of us, making the games grittier, more realistic, and more detailed. I thought it looked awesome and really hoped that they would continue doing that. I'm not saying I hate the last games, infact I love them to death. But would I rather have a new game/s that have updated game mechanics, engine and level design? **F*ck. Yes.**

Plus people like me(I'm 19) grew up with the games and the style and feel that they had fit the time and age we were in, since the generation that grew up with it (like me) are now basically adults, having to re-visit **the same characters and lore** in a much more adultier version than before? Yes. **Please.** Ratchet and Clank never really shifted their tone like Jak and Daxter did so I get why their new game is still more kid friendly but I hope that Naughty Dog **never** goes that route on Jak and Daxter. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Infinite would be a terrible adaptation of the game series, atleast for the first movie. And a straight adaptation wouldn't fit for a movie at all. If they ever made a movie they shouldn't use the characters from the game but rather make new ones that fit the lore, have them pop up in some way instead. Like in bioshock 2 when you hear about what happened in the first game and that character.

I would love to see them make a movie about someone finding rapture before the fall and being turned into a big daddy (like Delta in B2) or after the fall when Lamb was kidnapping girls all over the world, have a protagonist who is looking for his daughter and going through all of the shit in Rapture. Have some horror elements and show how terrifying rapture after the fall could be. Have the first movie end with the father being one of the alpha series big daddy and walking around with his actual daughter(which is a little sister). Have them flesh out the lore a bit and show bits and pieces on how rapture and columbia is connected, which would open up for sequels. They CAN'T use the main protagonists from the games in the movies,then it would just turn into a horrible adaptation like every other game-to-movie franchise. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well that's a hard one.. Only thing I can think of is the rare moment of co-operation between players in any multilayer game. Like say Portal 2, you can get a shitty person as a parter in the co-op missions but sometimes get someone who helps and knows the game enough to be efficient. Or when you play a sandbox game like Garry's Mod and somehow turn friends with someone else playing on the same server, maybe get in a "fight" with other players *with* that person which would create a short friendly bond. Or when you manage to convince a whole lobby of players in any game to do something different with the game play instead of the normal thing, like Cod or Battlefield where you just have some bs fun for a while with the enemy team.(Just thought of the Megalodon easter egg in BF4 where you would need an amount of players to even trigger the event, most likely people from the enemy team.) But I think that events like these is something that happens to everyone every once in a while, like a need to help someone out or to just get the feeling you get when you interact with another person on something entertaining. Btw I remember when this happened to me when I met a guy on Garry's Mod years ago on a random server, we started playing and turned into friends. Now I consider him one of my closest friends in real life and he lives countries away. So you can say that the need for co-operation or interaction with players in any game would be something that has always been there, even when online multiplayer didn't exist you could bring a group of friends home and play and get the same results, sorta.

Btw this might sound like it comes from a 40+ year old guy but I'm just 19, just to make sure that you don't need to be ancient to know how this works :p </TEXT>
