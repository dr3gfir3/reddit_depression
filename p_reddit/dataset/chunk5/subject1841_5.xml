	<TEXT> It is true its impossible to die in FUCK, but the problem is if you're caught there by someone else they can just ramp your percentage up so high, by the time you get back out at like 500% you're a sore thumb in the much more open area above. Thats what always happened to me anyway. I wouldn't neccesarily agree with the high ground thing in this case, its much easier to travel down this arena to where you wanna position rather than trying to jump upwards. Whole arenas like a damn funnel. On a lot of other games though hell yeah you dont wanna be airborne </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The weenie hut section is a tactical advantage, due to being the high ground and main area for items (they drop from the sky, so they mainly land here).

DEATH OR GLORY is cause theres no wall on either side of that platform, with very little footing space to boot. If two players are on that platform guaranteed one, if not boths gonna go sploosh.

The part no one wants to be at is really just that. Pretty much instant death unless you pull pure magic out your ass (or have a really decent plan). Jumping in smash bros is fairly limited,with a few exceptions such as Kirby who has a big advantage with x5 jump, but for most characters this is a trap many can't escape.

Hyrule fight club is my favorite part; tightly enclosed space with 2 surfaces and only the top and left free, this sections especially fun against real people. Consider that every character has a percentage that increases with each hit taken, and the higher the percentage, the harder you are hit, and propelled away. By the end of most games this area becomes the worlds fastest pinball machine, with players sometimes hilariously shooting out of the top to an early grave at lightspeed.

Freedom is your safest way out of fight club if you manage to stop bouncing at 10 million miles an hour. FUCK is the polar opposite.

Sorry this is so long but i fucking love this level haha </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I was one of the luckier ones. My dad was an english teacher and an old colleague of his (who specialised in children with learning difficulties) had started working at a school very near us, so my parents took advantage of the timing and sent me there. My mam especially got to know my teachers and formed a tight network, so there was always at least someone keeping an eye on me. I don't always show it but I'm very grateful ( I even see those teachers very occasionally).

I didn't find out about my diagnosis until I was 8, so i'd already gone through a chunk of school at this point. The fact that I had already spent some time there not really knowing my diagnosis was useful, cause I was definitely starting to get suspicious that I was different in some way, especially considering my brother went to a different school at the time (he later came to mine) I just couldn't give the difference a name. Knowing both perspectives reassured me a lot because honestly I was starting to get very confused before then.

The older i got, the better i got at handling it is the basis of my experience. In the earliest years i stood out a lot (meltdowns, tantrums sensory distress) and it was more obvious, but i was for the most part a sociable kid so I made it work. Mistake after mistake until i managed to blend in socially, people always say they can't tell these days. In college and university i actually made the choice to not take extra support (except different exam times) but I actually regret this in hindsight.

In academic terms, I had some struggles but overall I did well enough. The main problems I remember teachers voicing in secondary school included issues maintaining focus or attention span, not asking for help, and getting distracted a lot. Up until I was about 11 I was extremely sensitive to pretty much everything, even a teacher just talking loudly would've sent me in tears. 

Overall I think focus and executive impairment was definitely present through those years, I still have those challenges but I was well accommodated for and had a lot of people looking out for me, without them I'd be so much worse off, trust me. 

Sorry this is a whole wall of waffle, school was nearly 10 years ago for me so it's difficult to remember everything! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Tbh the whole roxas/ven/sora thing I don't have that much trouble rationalising; It's Namine I really dont get. 

The way I know the situation is that Sora at that point had Ven's and Kairi's heart aswell as his own; so when he released all those hearts his original body dissolved and reassembled into Roxas, whose body was inhabited by Ven's heart (meaning he was never actually a nobody) Soras heart got swallowed by darkness and became a heartless, and after she got her heart back Kairi managed to recreate his body with pure light (somehow, probably "cause princess of heart").

So where does Namine come in? Is she ALSO made from Soras body? That's an awful lot of Soras body going around. Kairis body doesn't fade without a heart; it stayed cause theirs no darkness in there to take it AFAIK. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Pretty sure vens heart went to Roxas when he was created, and back to Sora again in Kh2. Plus it might be that vens heart can't actually find his body due to to castle oblivion, but thats conjecture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. My mam looks after them for her job, and they are literally all of this, especially noisy. Need a lot of company, the ones I know like to all curl up into a huge ball together while they sleep.

Adorable, but definitely require a lot of prep and work for a pet. </TEXT>
