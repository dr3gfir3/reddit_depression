If it was accurate it would have said your kids have grown up and now they need to make their own jokes you're right dad (Gary). But the nature of unimaginative people especially on Reddit is to copy something popular and reuse it until it's pounded into the ground or disappears on its own.  
  
I could get all my Far Side books and make a giant imgur album which could expose a lot of people to far side and how great it is. But it goes against the creators wishes and it shows through your articles take down notices that he still or at least cared then about them.  
  
Far side and Calvin   Hobbes can easily cover almost anything you'll reference like xkcd in a lot of ways. But I think most people respect those authors wishes and don't put out their material.  </TEXT>

	<TITLE> So someone over on /. made a point, and I wanted to run it by here to see if people think Trump leaked info to Putin about FSB sources. </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-26 16:22:25 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> If you read the intelligence memo that accuses Trump of working with the FSB to win the election.
  
Ruslan Stoyanov fits SOURCE B, read the memo's:.
  
page 1: "Speaking to a trusted compatriot in June 2016, sources A and B, a senior Russian Foreign Ministry figure and former top level Russian Intelligence Officer".
  
Source B will be the Kaspersky man arrested, ex top level intelligence officer arrested shortly after Trump's inauguration, when Trump gets access to the names of spies that America has in Russia.
  
https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/3259984-Trump-Intelligence-Allegations.html
  
Page 2. "The Moscow Ritz Carlton episode involving TRUMP reported above was confirmed by Source E..."
Source E, is FSB man, known to CIA and MI6 and considered reliable, so he will be Sergei Mikhailov who was arrested.
  
Source F was a hotel staffer who confirmed it, Source D is an associate of Trump's, Source A, the Russian Foreign Office official.
  
If you remember Trump's comments to Richard Brandson: "Donald Trump told Richard Branson during their first encounter that he would spend the remainder of his life trying to destroy five people he had asked to no avail to aid him after his latest bankruptcy.". Trump is all about revenge and attack anyone who isn't 100% on Trump message.
  
Do you think Trump wouldn't immediately take steps to attack the spies who leaked details of his piss sex sessions to the CIA? Of course he would. He'll have obtained the names of these sources from the CIA (they are known reliable spies for the CIA), and he'll have passed those to Putin by his co-operation back-channel.
  
So it's no surprise to see an FSB agent and a former intelligence man arrested immediately after Trump takes office and gains access to intelligence names.

	<TITLE> [Assistance requested] iPhone 6s plus, 10.2, no previous issues, phone turns off before battery dead, website says unaffected phone </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-10 23:09:52 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I have an iphone 6s plus. It's on the latest commercial update (non-dev) and I have been experiencing the turn off at lower percentages issue I thought only plagued some phones. It started after the 10.2 update. It dies usually under 20% and after a fairly long wait I can power it back on and it will have a few percentage points less than when it went off.  
  
I really haven't found anything useful online since it isn't in any affected batches according to apple's website. Should I wait out until another update or contact apple care?  
  
I have the apple care plan from when I bought my phone in the summer time as well.  
  
Thanks for any help.  
  
Edit: So now I can turn it back on, and it will load, let me unlock it, then it dies again. Now it says 6% power. </TEXT>
