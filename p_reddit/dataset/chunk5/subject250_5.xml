	<TEXT> The ending reads exactly like a novel. "Sometimes I wonder if it was all a dream and my teacher was a ghost" is a lazy way to end a text, but it's done all the time in some fashion. 
This is all just a little too familiar as well. Loner kid, troubled home life, and his daddy's gun. Sounds like someone just watched a degrassi episode. 

But when I knew it was fake was when the author mysteriously found the gun which was supposed to never be seen again waiting for him at home.
Teachers at school would never let a child get away with brining a gun to school, therefore I call BS.
