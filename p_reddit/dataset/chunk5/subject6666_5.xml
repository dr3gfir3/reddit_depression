	<TEXT> I'm sure bullying goes into it, but considering 85% of millenials consider themselves liberal I seriously doubt that. Conservatives don't want to discriminate against LGBT. However your only increasing discrimination with these bogus laws and sayings. Treat each other like people, but when  you force someone to speak a certain way that only makes them dislike you more.

Depression is a mental disorder. Anxiety is a mental disorder. Transgenderism is a mental disorder, but that doesn't mean we want to discriminate against the people who hold those labels. </TEXT>

I'm not entirely sure what's happened, but each of these companies also hold stocks in each other, and it certainly isn't a free press. We need a real free press. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My main GPU is plugged into my 1070, and [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/5o32vs/psa_for_people_with_144hz_60hz_dual_monitor_with/) exists, so I plugged my secondary monitor into my Intel HD. It worked fine before, but I'm pretty sure it was a system restore that now whenever i turn off my second monitor it disconnects and all my rainmeter items move to the first monitor and i have to put them back manually every time i turn on my monitors. So I found out that I don't have intel graphics driver installed so I went to install that and found out that the setup crashes my system. What do??? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Its been doing this for a while, atleast 20 minutes. I flashed the new purenexus after clearing everything except for internal storage, then i flashed opengapps, then i flashed elemental x, and then root.

It starts up, and then after doing the small configuration im put at an android is starting thing. I can access quick settings and click on recents.

Its been doing this for twenty minutes. Is it because i didnt install google now launcher or pixel launcher from gapps, so it doesnt have a launcher? or is it supposed to take this long or do this AFTER setup? (ie:fingerprint, wifi, etc) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can I get some unbiased thoughts on him? It's either "he's a white supremacist" when he's stated in the past he's just a nationalist, not a white nationalist, just a nationalist, as in wants to help the people within the country, or he's a perfect human being who's done nothing wrong. Was there any leaks about him that are verifiable and significant? I don't care about rape charges, literally every politician seems to have one. </TEXT>

This is without my GPU fan, which is quiet af, I'm about to open up the pc and take some pictures and stuff. My motherboard is a Gigabyte Z170M D3H so it doesnt have any decent fan control. Any tips? Any tricks? What am I doing wrong? I got this fan a couple months ago, but I just cleaned it out with some compressed air and it didnt do anything.

I'll edit with photos/video of inside the case
