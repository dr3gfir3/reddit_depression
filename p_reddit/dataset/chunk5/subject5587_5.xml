	<TEXT> I'm sure such people would one day appreciate being able to at least somewhat publicly talk about how they have turned their life around and are trying to contribute back to society, despite past mistakes. I mean, I understand what you mean, privacy is important, but the whole point of punishment for "crimes" and such is meant to be rehabilitation. Once they have served their time, we need to welcome them back into society and not make them feel like second class citizens.

Put yourself in their shoes.

Oh, and no, I do not have a criminal record, but I do have a heart. ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  formal IT education

Yeah, the majority of post-sec teachings are out dated by the time you graduate. The best way to learn is to home-lab. Identify what areas you want to do, from a goal perspective (for example, I want to setup a way to have central account management, so I learn Active Directory), and then break down how exactly you get there. Then in your lab, where it's nice and safe if you break shit, you try to set such things up, and if you fail, you do it again, and again.

I have lost count of the number of students coming out of post-sec, hell even with a CS degree, that have no idea how to actually work with corporate/biz/org IT. It's not that they're stupid, or bad people, it's that the lessons aren't actually relevant to how IT works in the real world.

I totally get the money is hard to come by thing man, and you don't have to spend a lot to get a home lab. But let me tell you, best investment of my LIFE. If you want some specifics for what you could to do setup a home lab, let me know, and we can talk more about it. :) </TEXT>

I have several subdomains issued by StartSSL. Chrome and Firefox both report some of them "NET::ERR_CERT_AUTHORITY_INVALID", and other domains setup identically work just fine.

Then when I use tools like:

* https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze
* https://www.htbridge.com/ssl

They report the certs and chain to be 100% a-ok.

I don't get the errors in Chromium.

I reached out to StartSSL, but I suspect I won't hear from them till tomorrow. So, just a fore-warning, something weird might be going on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

Look, I know it's a pain point to talk about, but I want to share my thoughts here because I think they're important.

I use Linux for gaming, work and plenty of other things. I have switched away from Windows (over a year ago now) and I have no plans to go back. I play so many games already on Linux, and that number is increasing. There are games I can't play on Linux (HMMM I WONDER WHERE THIS IS GOING?), but more and more of those games are becoming playable on Linux (DOOM is a recent example), be it native or with WINE.

Now, there are a lot of reasons I have moved to Linux. If you really want to know, I can tell you more about it. Some of them are things I can't stand about Windows, some of them are things I love about Linux. I'm a sys admin, and I've been working with Windows since 3.11, and I've been working with Linux for over 15 years now, so I know both of them very intimately, as such this decision I have made I would argue is very informed.

Now, how is this related to /r/hoggit? Well, you see, I can't do DCS World in Linux. But I want to.

I know a lot of work would be involved, and I can't stress it enough that I am cognisant of this. However, please consider that there are a lot of people that are moving away from Windows to Linux, and that number is going to increase over time. The reasons are all over the place, but there are a lot of those reasons based around not being happy with Windows 10 and the direction Microsoft is headed.

I keep myself subbed to this subreddit because you guys are fucking awesome. I see all the hi-jinks you jackasses get up to, and I feel horribly left out. But despite being on Linux I can't pull myself to unsub from this subreddit because it's just so lovely to keep appraised of the adventures that happen.

I'm a paying customer, and I don't regret that. I would love some day to join you fabulous people, and I hope that might happen. I know ED is going to do whatever they want to do. But I think it sure would be swell if ED would seriously consider the possibility of having native Linux support. Maybe that's Vulkan API, maybe not. And even if ED were to consider it, I know that it would be years out, and I'm okay with that. A10-C is timeless, and so is the braatttt, so if it were to eventually happen, that would just make my day.

I want to join you folks, but I will not be returning to Windows. It's just not okay for me.

Oh, and if there's anything I can do to help facilitate this, please let me know.

That's it. I welcome the downvotes. Thanks for reading :) </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Seagate Barracudas vs WD REDs, ZFS </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-01-28 20:08:36 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Okay so the price for WD REDs hasn't actually budged in my area for about 2 years. It's about $50/TB and that scales up to even the 8TB drives.

I look at reviews for WD REDs and see Seagate Barracudas kicking their ass for read/write performance by 50MB/s or more ( http://techreport.com/review/25391/wd-red-4tb-hard-drive-reviewed/4 ).

Furthermore, Seagate Barracudas are drastically cheaper than WD REDs. So now I'm torn. WD REDs have TLER and dynamic spindle balancing, so these address some important issues at-scale in storage. TLER I might be able to give up. However I am also concerned about the difference in vibration dynamics between 16xWDREDs and 16xSeagateBarracudas in a SAS Expander/Enclosure. Also, I'm a bit wary after the Seagate 1.5TB issues, but they seem resolved.

What kind of tasty info have you folks been able to kick up in this area of storage?

Currently I am seriously considering Seagate Barracudas. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I use a feather DE, cheap one, and feather DE blades. I've found that feather is the best blade experience I've had thus far, and I've tried a few other brands.

One thing that I don't understand is why some of my DE blades need to be "broken in", and others don't.

To explain that further, when I feel a blade hasn't been "broken in", it's pretty much painful for me to use it. This isn't the kind of experience I would anticipate from DE, so I suspect I'm doing something wrong.

Any tips please? :) </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm trying to browse for a TV that doesn't have "smart" functionality. Namely, I don't want it to have any applications like netflix, or stuff like that. A TV that displays, has a bunch of inputs (HDMI of course), and quality is what I care about.

Why?

1. It is well documented the security AND PRIVACY concerns around Smart TVs. Just like consumer routers, they're a ticking timebomb.
2. I just want to shove a chromecast and send my media that way.

So, where exactly can I find good TVs that don't have "smart" shit/applications? I'm not having a good time just yet. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-11-21 22:10:00 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I checked the rules, and I _THINK_ this is within the rules. If it is not, please advise me and I'll make the necessary adjustments.

Now, I just wanted to share with you my experience with the /r/RenewableEnergy subreddit. Namely:

1. why I got banned
2. how they responded to me.

- **tl;dr :** http://imgur.com/a/fmFKa -


**I was banned for this comment alone, without warning** ( https://www.reddit.com/r/RenewableEnergy/comments/564x0o/nuclear_power_rapidly_losing_race_with_renewable/d8gkz2l/ )

 If we used Thorium (IIRC?) for nuclear, then we would be set. I'm all for renewable, but nuclear has it's safe place too.

**Post image :** http://imgur.com/wIE9Zwp

That's all I posted, then I was notified:

 You have been banned from participating in /r/RenewableEnergy. You can still view and subscribe to /r/RenewableEnergy, but you won't be able to post or comment.
Note from the moderators:
read the sidebar
If you have a question regarding your ban, you can contact the moderator team for /r/RenewableEnergy by replying to this message.
Reminder from the Reddit staff: If you use another account to circumvent this subreddit ban, that will be considered a violation of the Content Policy and can result in your account being suspended from the site as a whole.

**Full conversation image :** http://imgur.com/qgOEtqj


So, I got fed up, and forgot about it for... a while. Until... today, which I reached out to the moderation again to see what they had to say. Except it was more of the same:

* me:

 So, am I permanently banned for one comment about nuclear power? Seriously? Don't you think that's kind of heavy handed?

* DonManuel [M]:

 "Don't you think that's kind of heavy handed?"
As much as the ignorance of folks who don't mind to "take responsibility" to leave nuclear waste or the damage from fossils to hundreds of generations in the future.

**Full conversation image :** http://imgur.com/J6d6OA2

Now, why am I posting about this? Because I think it's important to bring to the attention how these moderators (seems like just one though) respond to those who even _talk_ about counter-points.

Yes, my actions were against a rule. I did not intend to break that rule, and I believe I've tried to reasonably approach the mods regarding unbanning and the topic. However, I feel their (his?) response is completely unreasonable.

Furthermore, I really honestly believe this kind of treatment sets back renewable energy development. If we can't even have any reasonable discourse without fear of being banned, then it's yet another form of censorship.

Do with this information as you will, but I felt like I needed to vent/share. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> It blows my mind that Windows 10 breaks so much with updates, as in the ones provided by Microsoft. I'm working with a client right now who's computer goes into hibernation regularly, and some Windows updates (still determining which ones) completely borked the OS, preventing it from booting. Complaining about the storage spaces .sys file.

But, part of the issue is that SecureBoot was enabled, and I was unable to use recovery tools to repair the environment, without turning it off.

I can't stand that Microsoft still has not figured this out. I get that they want the whole boot process to be secure. But it's a real problem when mainstream updates break desktops so easily, and then I have to breach the SecureBoot ecosystem just to get my client back up and running.

Is the issue SecureBoot? I'm not sure. One thing I am sure about though, Windows 10 updates are a gong show. It is unreal how many stories I've heard, and had to deal with, from the Windows 10 update/upgrade ecosystem.

Sorry for the typical rant/vent, but this is absurd. People are paying for this OS, and Microsoft still can't get their act together. Why do we put up with this?

I fully anticipate someone is going to criticize my method regarding SecureBoot. So be it. I need my client up and running, and being locked out of my tools to do that, is not okay. </TEXT>

* I can setup scheduled backups of my messages and keys (onto my phone, so I can sync it to my own server, like, ownCloud)
* The service never, ever, routes through external servers
* It is easy to use, and users do not need to re-accept my keys if I have to wipe my device or replace it for reasons ( device failure, theft, etc)
* For my phone

Signal is a pretty good contender, but they still don't have a way to automate backups, be it of messages OR KEYS.

Anyone have any ideas?

**edit:** clarification on the "not on servers" bit : https://www.reddit.com/r/privacy/comments/54g6aw/alternatives_to_whatsapp_with_automatic_backups/d81k619 </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is loosely relevant to sysadmin, but I'm sure we're all in a predicament here with the stupid WhatsApp Sept 25 cut-off.

If you're not familiar with this, WhatsApp will now share your info with Facebook as of today, in order for you to use WhatsApp. You can "opt-out" of this influencing your ads, but other info _will be shared with Facebook_.

As such, I am trying to find something to switch to, with the following criteria:

* Messaging is end-to-end encrypted, with my keys not stored on external servers.
* I can setup scheduled backups of my messages and keys (onto my phone, so I can sync it to my own server, like, ownCloud)

	<DATE> 2016-08-26 22:26:32 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi Folks,

I'm in the process of evaluating : http://opensourcebilling.org/

It looks pretty sweet, but boy was their installation documentation painfully inaccurate. It's supposedly written for Ubuntu 14.04, but I found the issues to be the same in 16.04 too. I was able to finally get it setup with 16.04, and I'm now evaluating it.

If you want to set it up, these are some adjustments that you should consider:

1. You'll probably need to install cmake, I needed it for a few gem install steps.
2. Use ruby 2.1.8, any lower version gave me problems at multiple steps.
3. You'll need to edit the Gemlist to set mysql2 to '0.3.20', otherwise later db actions will barf.
4. Follow the later steps for copying config.yml into place, and do this before the db steps. Some of the db steps didn't complete for me until I did this.
5. In the config/environments/ folder, there's a bunch of files with ".copy" as the final extension. Copy them into place so they're ".rb" (as in, remove the .copy extension on the new files). I am unsure if this is a required step, but it eliminated some complaints I was getting in some db steps.

This looks like the only outstanding steps thus far. I figured I would share what I found, since it took me about 1.5 days of rebuilding just to get these steps. Hopefully this helps someone save time.

Have fun! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Peeps,

I'm a lurking Systems Admin, because I like to see all your guys' work and opinions on stuff, seems like it makes me do a better job (oh man cabling!), and in-turn learn about what you guys hate that others do, so I can avoid making shitty work.

I was hoping you could help me with a particular element... ELECTRICAL TAPE! As such, I would like to hear all sorts of angles on this, not just "the best" kind of angle.

1. First, I personally have some electrical tape that is brand "MK" plus some asian characters. I doubt that's enough information to go on, sorry! How can I tell if it's good enough to actually use at all? Or just a liability waiting to happen? I'm thinking of using it to mask some exposed wire on the cable for my vacuum cleaner, for example.

2. Second, How can I know when electrical tape is shit, and to stay away from it? (as-in don't use it, I'm not talking about electrical tape already placed though)

3. Third, is all "cheap"/"affordable" electrical tape shit? Or is there worthwhile stuff to use?

4. Fourth, what is, the best shit, in your opinion/scientifically proven? (and why?) Budget is not a limiter here.

5. Fifth, any sort of in-between options?

Thanks for your helps peeps! I suspect others would appreciate this info too :) </TEXT>

1. Overwatch is the only game that Blizzard has released (except Warcraft 1   earlier) that is not playable in Linux (even with work). Every other title that Blizzard has put out is playable in Linux with not much effort:

 1. Warcraft 2 Bnet Edition : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=version iId=592)
 2. Warcraft 3 RoC/TFT : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/appview.php?appId=897)
 3. Diablo : [Silver/Gold rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=73)
 4. Diablo 2 : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=74)
 5. Diablo 3 : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=13484)
 6. Starcraft + Brood War : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=72)
 7. Starcraft 2 : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=11123)
 8. World of Warcraft : [Platinum rating for all versions](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=1922)
 9. Hearthstone : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=15454)
 10. Heroes of the Storm : [Platinum rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=15978)
 11. Overwatch : [**GARBAGE** rating](https://appdb.winehq.org/objectManager.php?sClass=application iId=17145)

2. Blizzard has a long-standing history of silently co-ordinating with various parts of the Linux community to fix bugs in their games. Some of the more notable examples include accidentally mis-banning massive waves of players in WoW who are playing in Linux legitimately (which they unbanned those players, I was one of them). This also includes staff in-house that run Linux to try and fix these bugs. They have been doing this for over a decade.
3. Overwatch is the only 3D game they've released to not have OpenGL rendering pipelines.
4. It is profitable to release games for Linux, and considering their games already run ~95% functionally or better in Linux, releasing native would be a drop in the bucket relative to their other project developments.
5. Individuals and Businesses can change their mind. Blizzard has recently, quietly, brought on-board the person who asked them at a Blizzcon panel about the vanilla servers being ran by Blizzard. They have demonstrated repeatedly throughout their history that they _can_ change their mind.

So considering all this, one should ask themselves, _why_ aren't they bringing these games to Linux natively? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Consider the following:

1. Overwatch is the only game that Blizzard has released (except Warcraft 1   earlier) that is not playable in Linux (even with work). Every other title that Blizzard has put out is playable in Linux with not much effort:
