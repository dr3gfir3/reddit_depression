	<TEXT> Looking to space out the wheels soon, 25mm front and 30mm rear. Looking at these from Perrin: http://perrinperformance.com/i-18479361-wheel-spacers25mm-30mmfor-5-100-bolt-pattern.html

Anyone have experience with these?  Would you recommend spacers over adapters, or vice-versa?  Don't know too much about this topic.  Thanks! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Just picked up a helpdesk analyst job... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-11-09 01:54:39 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, I just started a job as a helpdesk analysts working for one of "The Big Four".  I'm 22, and I am coming from a Desktop Support Technician job for a mall-retail chain.

The helpdesk job I picked up is a contracted position, strictly phone-based support and live chat.  Where I used to work, we did phone support for our field users and would go around the building assisting users with their respective needs.   I am coming from an environment working with hardware, networking aspects (i.e. TCP/IP, working on patch panels/switches/routers etc), and face-to-face contact with other individuals.  The new position I picked up is nothing like that- just 100% on the phone.  

I know this isn't the right attitude going into the job (especially being my first week here), but this honestly does not seem like the right job for me.  I really took the job to "get my foot in the door" with an amazing company, and to possibly getting to a desktop support role here.  Turns out, that takes a lot, and a lot of time (I asked around, up to 5 years from what I've gathered).

The work I'm going to be doing now seems very tedious, repetitive, and frankly, does not seem challenging.  For example, I was told that the only use for going into Active Directory is to unlock an account/change a password.  Where I'm coming from, we not only did this, but did user account creations, file/folder path mappings, group policy, managing computer groups, etc.  We also orientated users with their equipment, deployed computers, repaired hardware- all aspects of work I like to be doing.  That just won't be happening at this new job.

I just don't want my previous skills going to waste by not exercising them regularly like I used to at the last job.  In the meanwhile, I have already been applying to other jobs just to get out of this boat ASAP.  I know it's sounds crazy being I just started, but I know what I want in a job, and this is **most certainly** not it.

I know I'm only 22, but I have a lot of knowledge and skills, degrees and most recently certifications that I highly value.  I don't want to be putting them to shame by not being able to use them.

I guess I just wanted to go on a rant and vent about this to someone.  

Thoughts?




edit: Thanks for the replies!  I have 3 interviews elsewhere tomorrow! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In the notification center, certain apps have this situation.  If I have a missed call, or a text message.  Just tapping on the notification doesn't do anything; you actually have to force-press the notification to reply/call back, or to bring you to the application.  Just tapping the notification does nothing.

Looks like Apple is really forcing 3D touch on its users.  </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2016-10-22 19:56:03 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I'm starting a new help desk job that's strictly phone support.  I'm coming from a desktop support position, where I do phone support, but also support in-person.  I also have experience with working with computer hardware and networking, user training/orientation, computer deployments, etc.  However, this will not be the case at the new position, and I'm afraid this job isn't what I'm looking for.

The thing is, this help desk spot is at an incredible place to work for; one of "The Big Four".  If anything, it's something to put on my resume and a job in the meanwhile.

So, those of you who strictly work phone support at a help desk, how do you like your job?

	<TITLE> Was recently offered a helpdesk position at one of the "Big Four"... </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2016-10-15 02:27:26 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hi all, as the title says, I was offered a helpdesk position at one of The Big Four, working on a team of about 60 others.  Contract position at first, with intent to hire if things go well.  I'm currently working as a Desktop Support Technician, with a team of 3 people.

The helpdesk job that is being offered to me is 100% phone support, dealing with people all over the country.  Although I am used to this already, I am also used to working in an environment with people on an in-person basis, not just over the phone.  

I also like dealing with hardware and networking fundamentals, but this is not what I will be doing at this new job.  For example, at my current job, I was working on a patch panel in the building the other day.  In my new role, I would not be doing anything like that.  Just solely tech support over the phone.

I feel that I am going backward in my career if I take this job (granted, I'm only 22), because in order to be a Desktop Support tech there, you have to be *promoted* from the help desk, which could take months, even years, although there is room for advancement.

Ideally, I want another job in Desktop Support or hopefully networking within a few years.  

The helpdesk job is more than I'm making now.  It's with an amazing company to work for, as well as to put on a resume.  It doesn't sound too bad, but why am I just not sold on this?

They have to know if I accept the offer by Monday and I haven't got the slightest clue what I'm going to tell them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's 11:15 and about time I took my morning break.  I went to the gym we have in the office to ride on the bike for a bit.  There's a rule about the office gym, which is to leave it as you found it.  The lights were off and I didn't see anyone in there.  So, I left the lights off and got on the bike.  Once the workout was set up, I put on my music.  I hit 'Shuffle Play' on Spotify, and "Rape Me" by Nirvana came on.  
As I was getting into my workout, I started singing.  It got intense.  Rape me...  Rape me...  RAPE ME.

Turns out I wasn't the only one in the gym.  Also turns out that I have a date with HR tomorrow morning. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest, I'm not looking for a raise.  I'm hoping to leave before the year ends.  It's not just about the salary, it's about how I'm not advancing or learning anything new.  Like I said, I feel like I've plateaued.

	<TEXT> Hey all, I'm currently stuck at a job and I've been looking elsewhere for employment recently. I don't mind my job, but it's gotten very monotonous, I've plateaued and to be honest, I can't afford to pay my rent because the pay in this area is so poor for my line of work (IT).

I should mention that I'm not looking for a raise, as I'm not looking to stay at this company much longer at all; I've already interviewed with other places closer to home.  


Tomorrow, I have a meeting with my boss to go over my performance reviews. During this meeting, can/should I bring my concerns up to him? I'm not putting in my two weeks at the meeting, but I think he should know it's not going to work out for me much longer. The job I currently have requires a bit of knowledge of our system, so I feel it is the better, more moral thing to do than to just give only two weeks of notice. Thoughts? </TEXT>
