	<TEXT> I go to a very large state school in the Midwest. I still have no friends whatsoever despite tremendous effort. I was diagnosed with depression and social anxiety about a month ago.
Anyway, having no friends I naturally eat by myself. I was eating in the main dining hall today as I usually do, no person sitting within 20 feet of me. Suddenly, a guy starts walking towards me. I started freaking out in my mind. "Surely he isn't coming up to me, he's probably going to walk past me." But he didn't. He shook my hand and introduced himself. My pessimism still persisted: "he's probably going to try to sell me something or sign some dumb petition." But he didn't do that either. He started asking me about what year I was and what I was studying. I couldn't believe what was happening. He told me he was a grad student and somehow we got talking about sports, which is my favorite thing to talk about. We talked about hockey and basketball, and he seemed so interested in what I had to say. I was actually having a conversation about my interests with someone I actually liked. I hadn't had that in so, so, long. After we talked s but longer he had to go. He said he and his buddies play basketball a lot, and I should play with them sometime. So he gave me his number and bid farewell.
Right after lunch I went to my room. My roommate was there, but the moment he left I broke down in tears. This person made my month (school year, even) just sby simply initiating a conversation with me. I'm trying to keep myself together as I type this. This man gve me an indescribable amount of hope and happiness today. It reminds me that however depressed and even suicidal I am, somewhere out there there ARE people who want to get to know me. If people see someone eating alone, they feel the person maybe really odd or repulsive. But we just want to be talked to. Even if we are very introverted we still want company and friendship.
Thank you, random grad school stranger. Thank you so much.

UPDATE: I just got off the phone with him. I thanked him and We are going to play on Wednesday afternoon.
