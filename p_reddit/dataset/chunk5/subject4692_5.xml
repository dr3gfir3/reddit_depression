There are severity modifiers for Internet Gaming Disorder: mild, moderate, or severe. These modifiers are based on how much time is spent playing the games, and how much they impact a persons overall functioning. The diagnostic criteria for Internet Gaming Disorder include:

Repetitive use of Internet-based games, often with other players, that leads to significant issues with functioning. Five of the following criteria must be met within one year:

1. Preoccupation or obsession with Internet games.
2. Withdrawal symptoms when not playing Internet games.
3. A build-up of tolerancemore time needs to be spent playing the games.
4. The person has tried to stop or curb playing Internet games, but has failed to do so.
5. The person has had a loss of interest in other life activities, such as hobbies.
6. A person has had continued overuse of Internet games even with the knowledge of how much they impact a persons life.
7. The person lied to others about his or her Internet game usage.
8. The person uses Internet games to relieve anxiety or guiltits a way to escape.
9. The person has lost or put at risk an opportunity or relationship because of Internet games.

Again, while Internet Gaming Disorder is not an 'official' disorder in the DSM-5, the APA is encouraging further research on the disorder for possible inclusion in future editions of the DSM. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> A fair point, however in this case, the inclusion of only males is justified by the prevalence of IGD:

 The [DSM-5](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/here-there-and-everywhere/201407/internet-gaming-disorder-in-dsm-5) states that Internet Gaming Disorder is most common in male adolescents 12 to 20 years of age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello Dr. Caine - thank you for doing this AMA. Do you know if any work is being done examining the effects of parental suicide attempts on their adult children (or really any close adult relationship - I am familiar with some work on children). Further, do you know if there are any supports/resources available for these adults to help them cope with this particular type of traumatic and complex experience? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do you mean male *and* female? 

What's more, new technologies in DNA sequencing and cell biology are revealing that almost everyone is, to varying degrees, a patchwork of genetically distinct cells, some with a sex that might not match that of the rest of their body. Some studies even suggest that the sex of each cell drives its behaviour, through a complicated network of molecular interactions. I think there's much greater diversity within male or female, and there is certainly an area of overlap where some people can't easily define themselves within the binary structure, says John Achermann, who studies sex development and endocrinology at University College London's Institute of Child Health.

	<TEXT> It shouldn't matter since a balanced within-subject design (for donors) was used, and the raters "assessed all collected paired samples from the 184 donors (i. e., 10, 16 and 16 pairs of pads across the first, second and third study, respectively)" (p. 7). 

Also, the authors controlled for this in their [analyses](http://www.researchgate.net/publication/283639383_Consumption_of_garlic_positively_affects_hedonic_perception_of_axillary_body_odour):

As our design was within-subjects, the mean ratings were subsequently compared using repeated-measures ANOVA with the time of day as a between subject factor (entered as a binominal variable). The data were analysed using mean subjects (raters) ratings as the unit of analysis to test possible changes in the perception of axillary odour sampled under different conditions. Each study was then analysed separately. Note that although raters, rather than donors, were used as the unit of analysis, the ratings explicitly incorporated a comparison between pairs of odour samples from the same donors. **Our experimental design and
analytical approach therefore produces results that should be generalizable across donors, while controlling for individual variability of raters olfactory perception** (p. 7). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> From the [article](http://time.com/3939974/sugar-junk-food-depression/):

"The data came from roughly 70,000 women, none of whom suffered from depression at the studys start, who had baseline measurements taken between 1994 and 1998, and then again after a three-year follow-up."

From the [abstract](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/early/2015/06/24/ajcn.114.103846.abstract?papetoc#aff-1):

"The results from this study suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for depression in postmenopausal women. Randomized trials should be undertaken to examine the question of whether diets rich in low-GI foods could serve as treatments and primary preventive measures for depression in postmenopausal women." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I am not a schizophrenia expert, but as far as I know, yes, [onset](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22380467) for schizophrenia is later in life (i.e., ~25 years for men and ~27 years for women). It looks like schizophrenia presents as a result of a [combination of genetic and environmental factors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700006), so it is likely both. Neurological differences in schizophrenic brains (vs. non-clinical) have been [found](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19700006), but it isn't always clear whether certain differences (e.g., brain volume) preexist prior to onset of symptoms or develop suddenly. Also from the same source:

The diagnosis of schizophrenia is associated with demonstrable alterations in brain structure and changes in dopamine neurotransmission, the latter being directly related to hallucinations and delusions. 

And like you suggested, this results from [this](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/researchweek/ResearchWeek2015/All2015/291/) research provide evidence for a "double hit model of schizophrenia" (i.e., stress + genetic susceptibility):

In individuals with a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia it may be necessary for a precipitating event to occur, constituting a double hit, for symptoms of schizophrenia to appear. 
 
This is my somewhat limited understanding of a very complex condition... someone else might be able to chime in.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> "The [tongue](http://www.therabreath.com/articles/fresh-breath-happenings/why-cant-we-taste-anything-when-were-sick-34603/) has thousands of taste buds that identify the four primary tastes - salty, sweet, sour and bitter - while the olfactory receptor cells in the nasal cavity measure odors that provide the sumptuous flavors in our food. These cells, when stimulated, send signals to specific areas of the brain, which make us conscious of the perception of taste. In this way, the messages that process taste and smell converge, giving us a more rounded idea of what we consume. ... Meanwhile, odorants, or odor molecules, are identified by the specialized sensory neurons in a small patch of mucus membranes lining the roof of the nose. To get these flavors - whether savory or not so savory - the odorants get stimulated by smells or chemicals in food that initiate a pattern of activity sent to the olfactory bulb. After passing to the primary olfactory cortex at the part of the frontal lobe in the brain, the message is relayed to adjacent parts of the orbital cortex where the combination of odor and taste information helps create the perception of flavor. If mucus in your nasal passages turns too thick, molecules from the air and food can't reach your olfactory receptor cells. Therefore, your brain receives no signal identifying the odor, and everything you eat seems to taste the same. With that being said, you can still feel the texture and temperature of the food, since this information is processed on the tongue."

	<TEXT> From the [abstract](http://www.sciencemag.org/content/350/6263/970):

We investigated associations between intestinal helminths and fertility in women, using 9 years of longitudinal data from 986 Bolivian forager-horticulturalists, experiencing natural fertility and 70% helminth prevalence. **We found that different species of helminth are associated with contrasting effects on fecundity**. Infection with roundworm (Ascaris lumbricoides) is associated with earlier first births and shortened interbirth intervals, whereas infection with hookworm is associated with delayed first pregnancy and extended interbirth intervals. Thus, helminths may have important effects on human fertility that reflect physiological and immunological consequences of infection.

	<TEXT> Those are called hypnagogic and hypnopompic hallucinations and can be experienced by [healthy individuals](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11920-007-0020-z). Apparently, though, these hallucinations are experienced differently by clinical and non-clinical populations: 

In the psychiatric population, these tend to be frequent, intrusive, and distressing. In contrast, in the nonclinical population, these are often predominantly positive and nonthreatening.

Also, these hallucinations are also characteristic symptoms of [narcolepsy](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4138489/) and as noted [here](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1440-1819.2003.01204.x/full):

It has been pointed out that some patients with narcolepsy may be misdiagnosed as having schizophrenia due to their hallucinations and the similarity of the ages of onset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  A child is most likely to be abused by a lone mother. 

It is so much more complicated than that. As outlined [here](https://aifs.gov.au/cfca/publications/who-abuses-children), "evidence suggests that a considerable amount of abuse and neglect goes undisclosed, making it difficult to develop an accurate picture of who may abuse or neglect children." 

From the article:

**Physical abuse**

"Research suggests that both mothers and fathers may physically abuse children. Findings from the ABS Personal Safety Survey (2005) indicated that of participants who had experienced physical abuse before the age of 15, 55.6% experienced abuse from their father/stepfather and 25.9% experienced abuse from their mother/stepmother. A further 13.7% experienced abuse from another known person and the remainder were family friends, other relatives, or strangers (ABS, 2005)."

"A British retrospective prevalence study of 2,869 young adults aged 18-24 (May-Chahal   Cawson, 2005) found that mothers were more likely than fathers to be responsible for physical abuse (49% of incidents compared to 40%). However, part of the difference may be explained by the greater time children spend with their mothers than fathers."

**Neglect**

"Evidence also suggests that mothers are more likely than fathers to be held responsible for child neglect. In a large representative study that examined the characteristics of perpetrators in substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect in the United States, neglect was the main type of abuse in 66% of cases involving a female caregiver, compared to 36% of cases involving a male caregiver (US DHHS, 2005). *This finding is consistent with the fact that mothers tend to be the primary caregiver and are usually held accountable for ensuring the safety of children even in two-parent families. In light of societal views on gender roles, it has been argued that this may constitute unreasonable mother blaming* (Allan, 2004; Jackson   Mannix, 2004)."

**Sexual abuse**

"Research focusing on perpetrators of child sexual abuse is extensive compared to other forms of abuse. Evidence overwhelmingly indicates that the majority of child sexual abuse is perpetrated by males (ABS, 2005; McCloskey   Raphael, 2005; Peter, 2009). In a US study examining the characteristics of perpetrators in substantiated cases of child abuse and neglect (US DHHS, 2005), 26% of all cases involving male perpetrators were associated with sexual abuse compared to just 2% of cases involving female perpetrators. Contrary to other types of abuse, research suggests that a far greater number of child sexual abuse offences are perpetrated by adults who are not in a caregiver role (ABS, 2005; US DHHS, 2005). Findings from the ABS Personal Safety Survey (2005) indicated that for participants who had experienced sexual abuse before the age of 15, only 13.5% identified that the abuse came from their father/stepfather, 30.2% was perpetrated by other male relative, 16.9% by family friend, 15.6% by acquaintance/neighbour, and 15.3% by other known person (ABS, 2005)."

**Emotional abuse**

"From the limited research that is available, emotional child abuse mainly comes from parents/caregivers and can come from both mothers and fathers."

**Domestic violence**

"Witnessing domestic violence is now widely recognised as a form of child abuse and neglect in its own right ... Violence between intimate partners with children is overwhelmingly a gendered issue with the vast majority of incidents involving a female victim and male perpetrator (ABS, 2005; Holt et al., 2008; Mulroney, 2003)."

**Fatal child abuse**

"... in a study examining 126 profiles of perpetrators of fatal assault in United States, found that males were three times more likely to fatally assault their children. The study also found that non-biological parents were 17 times more likely to commit a fatal assault toward a child than biological parents (Yampolskaya et al., 2009)."

	<TEXT> Well, RCT stands for randomized control trials, and randomization and the inclusion of control group(s) are what make experimental methods experimental by definition. I dont agree with your suggestion that psychology researchers rely on observational data and care less about causality than economists, though (especially in the case of clinical, social, and cognitive programs of research). 

Many psychologists still use college students in their experiments through enrollment (sic) methods that aren't randomized at all."

Do you mean enrolment in university? This doesnt make sense. There are issues with generalizability that arise when using a heterogeneous sample (and psychology researchers will often be the first to acknowledge the limitations of using these samples of convenience), but this has nothing to do with the method - the participants are still randomly assigned. 

And Wikipedia is fine if youre linking to something quickly, like a definition, or a well-known topic. I cant link to a textbook, otherwise I would.

This is dead wrong. Quasi-experiments, aka natural experiments, occur completely outside of the researcher's control (they occur in "nature"). The data is non-experimental i.e. it is solely observational. The researcher has zero control.

I think this depends on your discipline. In psychology, some academics discuss differences between the two  as discussed [here]( http://markholah.com/what-is-the-difference-between-a-quasi-experiment-and-a-natural-experiment-1511.html).

Oh man, investopedia, you sure do know your disciplines.

No need to be snarky. Definitions are definitions, and I believe mine is more comprehensive.

"Those researchers are not psychologists nor are cognitive psychologists behavioral economists (economists care about markets, not individuals). Dan Ariely is not a behavioral economist no matter how much he claims to be one. He's a psychologist."

Wow, okay. Well, it seems like this is more of a personal opinion of yours, and I think I understand why we are butting heads a little bit more having read this last sentence. :P

	<TEXT> First, this was published in the journal [Addiction](http://www.addictionjournal.org/pages/aims-scope), which is a journal that focuses on substance abuse/ psychiatry. Second, [experimental methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_research#Experimental_methods) are commonly used in psychology research. Third, [behavioural economics](http://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/behavioraleconomics.asp) is "the study of psychology as it relates to the economic decision making processes of individuals and institutions" which is why you will see this terminology being used.

	<TEXT>   I haven't looked extensively into this particular one, but studies like this are notorious for not controlling for all variables and implying that correlation equals causation. What if people that eat grilled meat are more likely to smoke? We know that causes cancer, but in the context of this study it looks like the meat does. (I'm just using that as an example, I don't know if the study controlled for that)

Why are you commenting then? At least read the [abstract](http://cancerres.aacrjournals.org/content/75/15_Supplement/836.short):

"Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using tertiles of dietary PAH/HCA intake adjusting for total energy intake, fruit and vegetable intake, age, gender as well as known or suspected RCC risk factors."
