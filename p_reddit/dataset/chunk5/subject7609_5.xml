	<TEXT> I think they are different issues.

One, the rejection of Israel right to exist while being okey with other states.

And two, the rejection of all states.

And the UN chief is referring to the first one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Guterres told delegates at the World Jewish Congress that Israel needs to be treated like any other UN member state and that it had an undeniable right to exist and to live in peace and security with its neighbors.

I think he is referring to Israel's right to exist and saying that the rejection of Israel's right to exist is a form of anti-antisemitism.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, you did. 

Saying that the SG differed from the idea of Israel *not* being a theocracy, is saying that the SG said that Israel *is* a theocracy.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But you are missing the purpose of different kinds of states. 

The Vatican city only do religious things so it exist only as a religions entity. 

Israel on the other hand, doesn't act as a religious entity and instead acts a a protection for a group of people who has been kick out of many countries in the past, and that has faced numerous attempts of genocide and extermination.

Israel is not the only country like this. South Sudan, the newest country in the world, also was founded to protect a group of people.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  It's funny because the people paid by Israel to astroturf on sites like this one and others say that Israel is not a Jewish theocracy, but the secretary general begs to differ.

You are saying that the SG said that Israel is a theocracy. So I ask you, where did he said that? </TEXT>
