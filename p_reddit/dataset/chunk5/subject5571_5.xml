	<TEXT> I think it's down to the prison itself to pay, I could be wrong there. With the surge in alternative methods like netflix and apple TV it's going to have to change. They can't seriosusly be expecting people to pay for something they don't use. I don't mind paying taxes for education, health, roads etc even if I don't use them, essential services are essential. But when I actively avoid RTE media online, radio or otherwise it shouldn't be a set charge.

We're not getting charged because they think k.we use their media. We're being charged because they think we SHOULD be using their media. </TEXT>

I get the argument "pay a higher TV licence for better quality media" but the problem is the execs in RTE. No amount of money would change the fact that it's a small minded operation that isn't open to taking real risks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be honest what drew me in to each game was the environment. I knew there was a base story but I made my own character and, to a degree, had my own relationship with companions and everything else. Without trying to sound like a child, im not - im a teacher - I kind of made my own fun. Yes I do love lore. It's great to find out the back story of a character and how it fits with other NPCs. But you know what else I loved? How quickly the tide of combat could change and how smart you had to be no matter how overpowered you were. I can get past a bit of crappy dialogue if it's still a good representation of the Fallout universe. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My first encounter with the series was when I bought  Fallout 3 while I was sick. I had never played a game so immersive and well written. I later bought myself 1 2 and was not disappointed. Again, New Vegas came out and it was just another reason to respect the series. 

I haven't had the time to buy 4 yet and I don't know if I will now. It seems that every second comment online about the game is not just a critique, it's being ripped apart.

I'm aware of the issues with dialogue in the game and complaints of a lack of RPG elements. So should I bother? Am I wasting my time?

As a fan of several RPG series (especially Bethesda) I have learned to take the good with the bad, what a sequel will do wrong in its continuation of the series, it will also make up for in its improvements in other areas lacking thus far. 

So tell me. Is all of this just hype? Will I lose anything in the Canon by not playing this? Or is it a very flawed game that still needs to be played? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Absolutely it has issues. But I feel those issues are cosmetic, bugs, glitches, poor graphics, all a result of its time. The purposeful intended parts of the game ie. Rules, mechanics, plot, interface, are all things that should remain with skywind.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. To be honest Morrow is still the most fullfilling game I have ever played in my life. OK the graphics are horrible bit there are several texture packs you can download that at this stage are really easy to install. (Absolute nightmare when it first came out. I credit that process as being the sole reason I'm good with computers now.)

You can't fast travel in Morrowind bar a handfull of silt striders that take you too main cities. This makes it a lot more real. You need to traverse a very difficult landscape on foot for 90% of the game.

The most diverse set of skills and weapons and the only elder scrolls game where you can rely solely on magic and not have a horrible time.

Again get past the graphics. I'm sure you still play 8bit games from time to time. 

Also... dammit I'm going to reinstall it now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I always wonder why certain sites have a limited collection. Is it because they think someone will only want one volume or was it the artists choice? Buying physical copies is a lot harder here in Ireland because half the time Amazon/Ebay won't ship here. 

I mean just add the fucking postage to the cost and I will happily pay. Restrictive bullshit really. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Apple music? Is that like iTunes? I'm pretty sure your can get the physical copies a lot easier my friend has most of them, although it might be far costlier.

Tbh ide recommend Homme's own stuff over TDS. I appreciate what he did but it doesn't do it for me quite as much.

Also mad anger for lack of availability for the volumes. We can all share the album don't worry. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be fair the joke was intended to play on the relatively poor success and limited knowledge by thw wider population of the dessert sessions collection. I saw QOTSA when they came to Ireland too. It's not a dig at him, more of a witticism. Albeit a poor one.  </TEXT>
