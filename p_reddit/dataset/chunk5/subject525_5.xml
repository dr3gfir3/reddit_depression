	<TEXT> Coming from HS to Shadowverse, I love that they went out of their way to tell us all this. While I'm still a bit concerned about the binary matchups of some of the decks, they may be right about the expansion changing things. In any case, thank you Cygames for sharing the insights with us!   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Cool ideas! I'm surprised blizzard hasn't pushed the silver hand archetype further given how dragons, totems and even pirates have been getting the special treatment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Astaroth's Reckoning (or however you spell it) needs to be changed in some way. The counter play to Prince of Darkness is to start SMOrcing, but the possibility of that card being in their hand means you can't ignore any minions. </TEXT>
