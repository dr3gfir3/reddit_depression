	<TEXT> I really like /r/nosleep, but it's no place for my writing. My works are mainly horror/humor, and that's not nosleep's cup of tea. I realized that it ain't the best situation!

Anyway- does anyone know of any other places to showcase my writing? Would Library of Shadows work? Or not even on reddit- I'm looking for anywhere, besides my [Tumblr](http://ellenmeny.tumblr.com/). Thanks! </TEXT>

Now THAT is the lyric that is going to win a Grammy. That is a beautiful song. Contact Def Jam Records immediately. And I'm a fan of the palace idea- also let's make the hot tub an infinity hot tub with "Motherfather" in glowing neon, just so everyone knows how rich and insane we are </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I also asked about it several weeks ago, and got no reply. Although this is a free service, this is a promised service, and we need to keep questions like these alive if we want the promised service. Can't wait to see my February 2013 story in the ebook, eventually. </TEXT>
