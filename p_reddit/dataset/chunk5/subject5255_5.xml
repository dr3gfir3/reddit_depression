	<TEXT> Obviously (Logan a.k.a Wolverine) is Hugh Jackman's most iconic role.

Since Logan is the last time he's gonna play him, I hope he doesn't turn into a washed up actor after this.

This usually happens to actors like Mark Hamill, Michael Keaton, Brendan Fraser, Tobey Maguire, etc...

Even though, some of them got their comebacks in the end, but it took for them 20 or 30 years.

Because let's be realistic,

Even if you're a good, hardworking actor, it's gonna take a toll on you...

Either way I hope this doesn't happen to our man Hugh Jackman, I hope he continues to do what he is passionate about which is Broadway stuff and I hope it turns succesfull. </TEXT>

Call me shallow but I just can't stand that phrase.

The phrase "these women aren't real" because it just yells out feminism to me.


Don't get confuse with Photoshop and plastic surgery,
because there are plenty of women who look hot without all that shit, make up even.

"women don't look like that"

	<TEXT> Here's an interesting discussion.

You guys have any favorite, bad ass, cool looking movie posters you've seen recently from movies from the past year?

Movie posters that struck you for being unique and different or just plain cool to look at.

Mine is definitely [Green Room](http://cdn2-www.comingsoon.net/assets/uploads/gallery/green-room/gr_web.jpg)

It has like a good mix of the punk and horror vibe, just like the film. And also the slight similarity to London Calling is just freaking cool...

Let's make this discussion "Recently" so we won't get the same old Tarantino or Kubrick posters cause that's just too obvious. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Had a Dream about Candies and Killing people? (Yup, pretty interesting huh?) </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-14 11:42:10 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> So I just had a dream. Funny its very vivid, and it's very rare for my dreams...

It started off me, stuck in a house with a girl and my mom, and a fat serial killer with a gun outside pointing at us.

As my dream went on, for reason, I managed to get the gun and tried to shoot at him. I shot him. That felt really good, shooting him, for some reason, and I can't aim for his head because of the recoil and how I never hold a real gun before.

Inside the serial killer's car, parked outside the house had 3 hiding vampires in it. 3 vampire women.

I remember myself running as fast as possible, and as I'm running I saw Collin Ferrell for some reason. 

Then I got myself in a factory room filled with Candies. The factor/room was empty and looked abandoned. The candy machines were stopped. Different kinds of candies are everywhere, and I just took a plastic bag and just took every kind of candy into that bag. It was running and grabbing, laughing, it was literally a sugar rush!

Then I tasted the candy, and wtf it tasted real! I swear to god that candy tasted real, when I woke up, looking back at that dream I can still remember the taste of that candy. The candy was like a long gummy strip.

I can't be making this up. I don't have the creativity to shit like this up lol. 

Looking back at the serial killer, vampires seems okay, because I just watched "Fright Night" and some other action movies earlier, so I felt relief.

But I had no idea where the candies come from, I've read that it means something great has happened me, in fact its the complete opposite, it's Valentines day and I'm alone sleeping all day.

Anyway any dream experts to explain what the candies meant really? </TEXT>

we don't have to immediately root for him, just follow him for a while.

Then when he meets her, that's when he decided to change, his goal is change and become a better person, The typical "who doesn't want to see a bad guy turned good", everybody wants to root for that type of character.

I'm having a hard time coming up with a better conflict because
I don't wanna involve "parents" into the story because it would add the "cliche"ness to the plot.

Also yeah it is kinda sad that music girl didn't get rewarded in the end but I kinda did that on purpose to add the dark realism of your dream job vs your job to pay the bills type of story in a slight lighthearted way...

But I don't know, maybe it's a bad idea, I'd love to hear more feedback, criticism and advice really does helps </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-02-13 13:32:13 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> We're suppose to make a project, a movie about "Future Planning"

I got assign to write the script and I only got a few weeks and I'd appreciate some help.

Future Planning - This is what I got so far...

Jerome is an angst-y teenage punk, who sneakily steals liquor at a liquor store type-of-guy, gets away with it, no ambitions.

He meets a girl name Amy, has ambitions, wants to have a music career, passionate about it.

They get together,

Jerome wants to be better person

he starts choosing career path

Amy breaks up with him, wants to focus on her "career",

Jerome get depressed,

Years later

Jerome is now successful, a blue collar "at whatever he chooses career"

Amy is broke and struggling with her music career,

They meet again

They became friends and try to work out their problems, etc...

The End


THIS IS JUST MY FIRST/BASE IDEA

Right now, the overall plot is really cliche and cheesy, okay its pretty stupid, but I'm liking the foundation I put down here.

- Simple Story - I just want to write a simple story, not too deep or convoluted 

I'm trying to convey these points into the story

-The Value of Career Planning

-The reality of ambitions


Please give as much criticism and advice as possible, all is accepted.

How do you think the plot should end, start?


Any movies I should be watching to take inspiration? </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Can I ask a Movie Theater to film inside it? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-11 17:49:09 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Not sure If this is the right place to post this sort of topic, but it's film related and the most responsive so I'll post it here anyway..

Basically, we're making like a low budget short film, just us friends filming around the city.

We have a scene where a couple is going to see a movie, and we want to have a shot of them inside the theater. The shot could look something like [this](http://media.gettyimages.com/videos/young-couple-watching-movie-at-the-movie-theater-video-id106478127?s=640x640)

Can we ask a movie theater to do that? I know having cameras in there is illegal, but I can like explain this and that, "We won't even film the movie, just the people and the seats"

And I guess I could come up with more excuses, "We'll be sitting down, so the audience won't be interrupted" "We could pay extra""We'd promote your theater" stuff like that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're story fairly simple and straight forward, I like that,
run with it, make that your strength, make that the pitch!

Don't make the script too serious man, add a little more personality to it, like quirks or something like that.

That usually works for a straight-forward story, don't let it take itself too seriously..

But hey, if you wanted it to be all serious, you gotta find out a way to make it work, you're aiming really high for that, but it's takes some brilliant writing to make it work.

Right now I ain't feeling it, hey this is just a draft right?
Just do what you we're aiming for this script and just keep coming up with new ideas.
