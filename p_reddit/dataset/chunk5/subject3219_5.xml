	<TITLE> Just Got Back From "Hacksaw Ridge" Early Screening </TITLE>

	<TEXT> I just recently got back from an early screening of "Hacksaw Ridge" and holy shit this movie is amazing.  Its honestly one of the best war films ever made and is also one of the best films of the entire year.  It manages to be a love story, courtroom drama, horror film, and a thrilling war movie.  Ive never seen war depicted in such a horrific way since the opening of "Saving Private Ryan", and this film may have managed to even outdo that one in the gore department.  From the trailers I thought I would dislike Andrew Garfield's performance and accent, but i was proven wrong and i believe he really did a great job, along with Vince Vaughn and Sam Worthington.  I highly recommend this film to everyone especially if you're looking for a new classic war movie and aside from some pacing issues towards the end its a near perfect movie.  9.5/10 </TEXT>
