	<TEXT> The basis that small art galleries are the breeding ground for the art that you find in the larger art galleries. Most things that you find in large galleries have been displayed and critiqued in multiple small galleries before gaining enough traction to be showed in a large setting. Small galleries are the infrastructure for the large galleries and the entire culture of art to sit on. Without the small galleries the large galleries would never get any new pieces and would eventually fail. If we stop funding small galleries all were doing is setting up large galleries to fail no matter if they have funding or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Ok. You're digging too deep into small vs large galleries. What I'm saying is that the citizens usually support large galleries because that is what they are exposed to the most. These large galleries usually grab their art from smaller galleries which usually don't get as much attention. The Govt should be supporting art in general, large or small.

Let me ask you this, do you think government sometimes needs to act against the wishes of the citizens?

I think sometimes the wishes of the citizens should be taken with a grain of salt, but actively act against no. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What if we just did a public service announcement telling people to stop supporting the big galleries and instead start supporting the small galleries instead?

I've never seen a successful PSA. The most they do is create general awareness. They do not motivate.

You just said though that the citizens support the big galleries. That means that the government funding should be going to the big galleries.

I said the problem is that the citizens only support the big galleries... Govt funding should never discriminate. Govt funding should be allocated based on need.

Are you saying that everyone should be forced to pay $1 equally, even though they don't want to?

Yes unfortunately in this country and really every first world country you as a citizen end up paying into things that you might not have a personal interest in. But this is the basis of taxes. The Govt is a very expensive entity but the securities and essentials it provides are almost priceless. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  There is no denying he wanted people to think that some bad would be happening.

I think something bad would happen... Most of the Personal funding for the arts goes to the large Art museums such as the MOMA but smaller galleries rarely get personal funding. A lot of art rises through these galleries and gain attention. No art just shoots to the MOMA unless it's done by an artist who is already famous. Govt support is a big portion of what keeps those smaller galleries alive.

 Are you suggesting that the country is not the sum of it's citizens?

No i am saying the exact opposite. The country is a sum of it's citizens and should support what the citizens support. So if there is support by the citizens into the arts there should also be support by the Govt into the arts. The Govt should act like a large satellite propagating what the citizens of the art community are interested in. That's how culture is formed.

 Would the country be donating $10 to the arts at that point or more somehow?

The country would be donating $10. See but in your scenario you have 100% donations from citizens (much like a tax). Now if you alter your scenario to 2 people giving $5 it would no longer be the country donating. It would be 2 individuals donating.

	<TEXT> No support does not mean devoid of all art. It simply means the land (country) is not supporting (funding) the arts. 

I cant really talk about your roads argument because i dont know where thats coming from but in reality Govt support of infrastructure is important.

I'm saying that some Govt funds should be put toward the arts rather than relying on citizens to pay directly. There is a big difference between support by citizens and support by the country. Support by citizens is amazing but support by the Govt builds culture. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes education is the best approach but it doesn't work for everyone. I personally only run windows defender and occasionally run avg scans and i have yet to get a virus in the past 6+ years. On the other hand... I work in the IT field and if i could explain some of the viruses users get (and how often they get them) you would be dumbfounded.

The issue is that we desperately need a tool that could be semi perfect and handle all the issues that users throw at. McAfee and Norton describe themselves as such but they tend to slow your computer down more than some viruses would. They run constant scans in the background and eat up resources and rarely clear any cached data.

The solution to this would be a program that could theoretically run a constant scan but is smart enough to not need to. In reality 90% of the folders on your pc are rarely touched. Viruses as you stated are mostly downloaded and your downloads are probably something like 1% of the data on your pc. Instead of scanning your whole pc these programs can theoretically scan any opened folders and traveling data then quickly dump cache files after.

Thank You for your reply! It was very informative on the behavior of these products. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Biggest issues with McAfee and Norton are that these two programs are notorious for eating up cpu and memory even while being in a passive state. It's not even like the program needs all that space it just refuses to release unused resources. It's almost like they're written in java </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude you can so make it out of that. One of my friends just graduated with 240k+ of loans and a journalism degree.  That's something to worry about

But graphic design is a tricky sector. Most people are getting paid shit but the good designers are getting paid pretty generously and a couple successful projects can transfer you from getting paid shit to being very well off. Hang in there and fine tune your craft (simplicity and speed). You can make it out of 80k and obtain your dreams </TEXT>
