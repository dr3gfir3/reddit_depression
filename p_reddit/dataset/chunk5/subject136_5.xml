	<TEXT> oh yea i know the chemistryish stuff, but i don't know exactly why i'm like this. i have a lot of repressed memories, but my childhood wasn't bad. so it seems as though I've always been somewhat dissociated or something. genetics can screw you over :P. 

I see a therapist weekly, I'm on meds. Cutting is in my past, trying to keep it that way. Thanks for your non researched info :) </TEXT>
