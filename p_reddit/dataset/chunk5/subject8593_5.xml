	<TEXT> Thank you so much! If money weren't a necessity I would literally make these little guys and give them away, as the sheer joy I get from making them and seeing them make someone just as happy, is so much of a reward! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are such little sweethearts in all their innocence! I have three of my own and they keep me motivated to keep my head up and keep working hard every day. :) 

I also donate small amounts from my sales when I can to a local rabbit rescue sanctuary - I plush as a full time job so I have to live on the profits. I rescued a bunny from some horrendous living conditions a few months ago, fostered him for a few weeks until his health improved and then found him a forever home. He lives with my boyfriend now and is the most spoiled bunny in the universe! That little rabbit has been such a big inspiration! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank YOU for your kind words! Hehe, the best part of making the Sherlock bunny is putting his little scarf on at the end, it's so satisfying! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Aww, thank you so much! And thank you for sharing your own experiences with me too. I'm sorry you had to go through such a horrible time, but it certainly sounds as though you came out of the other side a much stronger person. 3 You keep being awesome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Certainly! There really isn't a better way to channel all those feelings of frustration and block the world out for a little while, plus you get a physical end product that you can actually pick up and touch which is just an amazing feeling.

Thank you for favouriting my shop! And for passing it along to your roommate too! :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're very welcome! Ohh, I've heard of Folksy, but never really considered giving it a go! I might have to take a look around there now, when I get a bit of downtime in my etsy shop (I'm booked solid for the next two months almost, now!). Thank you for the recommendation!

Please let me know if you ever do set up your shop, I'd love to see it! And if you ever need any help setting up, just let me know. :) I started off doing pictures myself - all of the slightly bad quality ones were taken on my phone. Then six months in I met my S.O - who's a professional photographer, so he supports me by offering to do all of my photography now. I did see quite a jump in sales in general when I started offering higher quality photos, but in terms of which items sell the most it's quite even. The listings with the professional photos sell just the same as the ones with pictures taken on my phone camera. And before he came along and offered his services I was still doing pretty well! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you for your kind words! And I wish all the luck in the world with getting better. It's such a long hard road, but it can be do-able.

Ahh, it's nice to meet another Alice fan! Alice in Wonderland was a massive inspiration for my bunnies! </TEXT>
