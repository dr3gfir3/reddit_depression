	<TEXT> The controversial policy has already drawn comparisons with the "black crime" section on the Breitbart News,

Does a black crime section exist on Breitbart News' website?

It doesn't seem like it.

There it is misleading. They are saying the policy is drawn comparisons with a section on Breitbart that seemingly does not exist.

Just seems more useful to be honest and say something like "has already drawn comparisons to the actions of Breitbart News who often publish articles highlight acts of crime committed by Black people while choosing not to highlight acts of crime committed by people of other skin colors." 

Just a thought, no need to mislead IMO to mk breitbart look shitty. The truth makes them more than shitty already </TEXT>

Surely we can deal in facts and not stoop to the level of Breitbart by relying on so-called alternative-facts.

He didn't. Nor does the article say that.

Seeing as you did not read the article:
 
 TRUMP: "Since my election, Ford, Fiat-Chrysler, General Motors, Sprint, Softbank, Lockheed, Intel, Walmart and many others have announced that they will invest billions of dollars in the United States and will create tens of thousands of new American jobs."
 
 THE FACTS: Many of the announcements reflect corporate decisions that predate Trump's presidential election, making it unlikely that his administration is the sole or even the primary reason for the expected hiring. </TEXT>

Not sure why this is news.


Really? Not even a guess?

A) it's new information on an on going story

B) it's a story about the American president and one of their biggest adversaries

C) it's gives some credence to the theory that the dossier is true. In that the source is creditable not necessarily that he was paid for the information I mean

Nobody should be unsure why this is news.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  In all seriousness, why does the opinion of these specific men matter?

1) For wanting "in all seriousness" you made a very lackadaisical and seriousness comment. So i will go sentence by sentence and explain this to you.

Because they are high-ranking military people in the Dept of Defense so they have 1st knowledge how money is best spent in the DOD.

They also have the experience to understand taking money from other important depts to fund their own is not the best way to get that money. 

"Oh, they've killed middle eastern civilians, so they know everything there is to know about war!"

Defense department budget is not war FYI.

I mean, you think Trump is sitting in his office with a notepad writing down the international agenda all on his own? Does he not have an entire team of highly experienced advisors that all come together, and decide what's best? 

And a group of highly experienced military person ell don't know what's best for...the military?

 But oh no! 120 random old fucks have all the answers!

No, it's 120 retired military generals.

 And they've signed a petition so they should be given executive authority!

No, they've signed **a letter** to congress advising them on what to do.

Why is this even news?

Because Trump has touted he has so much support from Generals.

Because Trump has also said he knows more than the Generals.

WHY DOES THEIR OPINION MATTER MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE?

Because they were high-ranking people in the military, which is in the Dept of Defense.

Personally, I think coconut oil should be 100% subsidized (I use it for masturbation), where's my CBS article?

Is the US Gov't or W.H. currently proposing a change in the subsidization of coconut oil or anything regarding that product?

No. So no news, no article. </TEXT>

1) It wasn't conducted by a catholic insitution.

2) It was sponsored by CRUX, meaning they paid for it. They didn't do the polling. They may have even worked with the polling company to come up with the questions and refine the.

2a) The Marist Institute for Public Opinion aka Marist Poll aka Marist College conducted the poll, sponsored by CRUX.


 no information on who was polled,


There is plenty of information on who was polled. This is a Marist poll, often posted during the primaries and election.

545 adults

Aged 18+

Residing in contiguous United states

Contacted on landline and mobile phones

English and Spanish

Live interviewer

Between 12/12/16 - 12/13/16

Source: https://www.docdroid.net/ArVWFKT/crux-marist-poll-national-nature-of-the-sample-and-tables-february-2017-1.pdf.html

then cites its own results as facts like "1 out of ten Americans" blah blah...

The Federalist doesn't state anything like a fact. They use the same kind of language nearly every other media outlet that reports on polling does. Same kind of phrasing and wording. Same goes for the CRUX article, nothing about this is shocking or new or out of the ordinary. Nor is it as negative and you make it out to be.

Not very scientific.

The above information begs to differ. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Many people won't vote for someone without what they see as relevant experience, such as a military background.

Which is equally as dumb.

Why is it a "dumb fucking issue" for me to want my representatives to have relevant experience in living like their average constituents?

Because single issue voters are dumb. 

Deciding on whether or not to vote for somebody because they have money says nothing of their policy, nothing of their experience. At least using military as an issue shows experience, at the very least it can show leadership experience or something.

What difference does it make if the Democratic Presidential candidate was wealthy as fuck but transformed the low income communities around him and tried to raise people up or if the Republican one was poor but did nothing or propose nothing good to help other poor people?

Would you vote for the poor guy with no ideas or experience or the rich person who has shown results?

	<TEXT> Oh please, let's be real. It's normal. What Trump did and has said is seemingly acceptable to a vast majority of people including members of Congress.

But drawing the line at the WHCA Dinner is laughable. Drawing the line here does absolutely nothing. You wanna say "Don't normalize it" every time Trump does something as President fine go ahead but from an observer the continued repetition is silly and stupid especially when it comes to this very instance.

It's normal now. This is the world we live in now. If you didn't want it to normalize you're about 1.5 years too late.

If you "dont want to normalize it" then you don't cancel the WHCA Dinner. You don't appease Trump because that's what he's doing. You know what the best thing for Trump is?

Not having an entire night devoted to pushing his buttons and bashing him and his administration in an intelligent and funny way.

You know what happens when you boycott it or cancel it? It's not that hard to imagine how it would be spin positively for Trump and negatively for the "fake news media."

Anybody who comes into a political party and demands full and unequivocal change and appeasement are obnoxious. They are whatever other negative ridiculous adjective you wish to ascribe to them.

Period. Doesn't matter what political party in America, if you are a member of it and outsiders come and make demands or threats, expect to meet with "Bitch, please." responses. 

You need to show the political party you want to change results. You want change, you start to make it, you get results. You do not go in, lose an election and essentially what is seen by members of the party as emotionally yelling or whining. You do not name call people, you do not insult.

You challenge, you challenge their beliefs and their politics with an alternative you feel is better.

So this is for everybody. Progressives, do not call Democrats "neoliberal" or anything else like that as if it's an insult. Do not insult the people in the party you are trying to change, you will fail.

Non-progressive Democrats. Do not call Progressive "Bernie bros" or "Sandernistas." Stop alienating and insulting people who can help. </TEXT>
