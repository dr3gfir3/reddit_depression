	<TEXT> I've been keen on starting a Vaal Ice Nova build for the new league untill the AoE nerve peed all over it. So my noobisch question is if it's still worth it if I don't want to have a uber endgame killer and do casual endgame stuff? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can understand you can't pinpoint prices when you don't know what you're looking for ;-)

	<TEXT> With all due respect. YOU could have more respect for your own time by reading more into the game and therefore following a build guide. It's not the game's fault that it's trying not to be like every other ARPG. 

Even after Act IV you don't have a good impression, the real impression starts after all three difficulties. You haven't even scratched the surface, you've just peeked around the corner.

If there ever comes a point that you make it beyond Act X (you probably won't try it again before that) you'll see what I mean... </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in The Netherlands and visited my local gamestore website. It says that TToN came out today! I was stunned I didn't hear anything about it and now understand why, the release is suppose to be next week?

Guess we're lucky then!
