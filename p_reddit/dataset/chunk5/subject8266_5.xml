	<TEXT> It's not socially acceptable to me to give me books because I have a very particular want list and your gift better be on that list. However, used is fine as long as it looks clean. I'd rather have a used HB gift rather than a new PB gift. Stores like HPB purchase a shitton of remainders too, so a lot of the books they have there are technically new anyway. You shoulda tried HPB...they probably had some rumi. </TEXT>

	<TITLE> In a book I'm disliking a sterling quote about a dusty used bookstore made me nostalgic for my favorite used bookstore, Nine Lives Books in San Antonio. What's your favorite dusty used bookstore? What's its story? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-03-01 02:55:59 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> [Nine Lives Books](https://www.google.com/search?q=nine+lives+books ie=UTF-8 oe=UTF-8 hl=en-us client=safari) used to have a cat rescue in the back called Tenth Live Cat Center (cuz they gave them one more chance...I think). There were always a bunch of cats walking around and there were tons of comfy chairs everywhere and books books books.  
  
The quote, from [**Michelle Tea's Black Wave**](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25330262-black-wave): "Then there was the used book and record store, an eyesore on the block...nothing but dust and wood and books, books everywhere, more than shelves could hold, books in tumbled piles, books invading the space reserved for records, heaped atop stacks of rare opera albums, books blocking the aisles and sliding off wooden carts...she regarded the grimy used bookstore. She belonged there. If it were an animal it would be her power animal, if it were a spirit it would be her guide."  
  
TL;DR: What's your favorite dusty used bookstore? What's its story? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> james patterson - they all *appear* to be fill-in-the-blank style thrillers where only names and maybe settings change. The incredibly short chapters and the frequency with which he publishes suggests to me that he has five to ten word documents open, writes one double-spaced page in a 14 point font then moves on to the next document. Does that over and over again until he has 10 novels and starts over. I'm not entirely convinced he doesn't copy and paste from doc to doc then changes names and cities. CMV. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Middlesex by Eugenides  
American Pastoral by Roth  
  
Both capture the essence of Americanness that few others can. Middlesex by showing, by generations, how a family became American, and became embroiled in some of its history; American Pastoral by juxtaposing two...I don't want to say opposing Americans...but ways of being American...a get-ahead dad who made his way up in the family business to create sanctuary and middle-class life for his family, and his daughter who, under the umbrella of that security, lashed out at injustices she saw in the world.

I may have made fun of him a bit because he clearly hadn't read the list (I mean the first book is a collection of poems written by a slave. The second book was about the necessity of slavery, the fourth book is about distinctions in skin tone--right off the bat not all of them "blame whitey"). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying to make my way through the [2017 Tournament of Books List](https://www.goodreads.com/list/show/107559.2017_Tournament_of_Books) before [the tournament starts in March](http://www.themorningnews.org/article/the-2017-tournament-of-books-shortlist-and-judges). I'm 11/18 books in, so a couple of this week's books are toward that tournament.  
  
[**Black Wave by Michelle Tea**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28818761-black-wave), book. So far its about lesbians in San Francisco...and it might be the end of the world? I've tried very hard not to read anything about it or the synopsis. There's hints here and there: all the trees are dead, animals are gone. I'm about 50 pages in yet but it's solid.  
  
[**Version Control by Dexter Palmer**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25733442-version-control), audiobook. Great book so far, intriguing, not sure where it's going either. It's an alternative now...self driving cars, personalized messages from the president at your dinner table at a restaurant...there may be a time machine? Great story.  
  
[**Waking Gods: Themis Files 2 by Sylvain Neuvel**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30134847-waking-gods), ebook. Got a connection with an ARC ebook account. I'm about 50 pages into this, only read it at night as I'm going to bed. Loved the first book and this one is just as good. </TEXT>
