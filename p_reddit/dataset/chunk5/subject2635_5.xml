	<TEXT> I was a little bit confused on that point. I thought the policy period was for a year, so I couldn't figure out why I was paying it over six months. I didn't realize that the coverage period was actually six months. 

So I guess I'll wait until the 14th-ish and cancel Geico, then activate my policy with progressive. It'll be nice to cut my premiums a bit! </TEXT>

	<TITLE> Newbie question about switching insurance </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-12-12 19:36:42 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've only been with two insurance companies since I've been driving, so only two companies in almost 20 years. I really don't know what I don't know. 

I'm with Geico now, and I really don't like my premiums. I can get better coverage through progressive for much, much cheaper. My next Geico bill is due on Jan 15, and it's their "double" bill for the start of the coverage period. If I switch to progressive on, say, the 14th, I won't have to pay a pro-rated amount for that, correct? I can't tell if the payments are in advance or arrears. 

Also, is it worth getting the snapshot thing? My wife doesn't drive much, but might start a new job soon. I was thinking about getting it for her car, since it's financed. 

Thank you! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was there in 2003-2004, specifically at Speicher. I remember one time we were going up to Camp Korean Village (to the west) and we took a route that would take us over the Tigris. 

This was shortly after the main (?) Bridge was blown, so the engineers had set up one of those pontoon bridges in it's place. But we were escorting fully-loaded HETs, which could only cross one at a time due to the weight. So we spent a lot of time sitting still. 

I was the gunner in one of the humvees, and this was before we were fully up armored. So I had the 50cal and a few plates bolted behind and to the side of me. The streets were busy and narrow. There were Iraqi police here and there wearing ski masks and carrying weapons. It was  surreal. And it's a very vulnerable feeling to have so many locals walking around and watching you so closely.

Suddenly, I saw movement behind me. Bad movement- the kind that sets off a red flag even if you don't understand why. The type that you learn to watch out for, because anything unusual could be bad. 

I whip around in the turret, letting the barrel of my 50cal lead the way. It feels like it takes forever to realign myself, but it couldn't have been more than a moment. And then I see it- a revolver pointed right at me. And then I see who's holding it. 

A child. A god damned child. 

He couldn't have been older than my son back home. His knuckles are white and the barrel is shaking. His eyes get wide. He looks down the barrel of my 50, just like I had looked down his. 

Instinct and training take over. I lower my profile and switch to my SAW (squad automatic weapon, or m249. Less penetration. Better for a dense environment). I do the math in my head. I remember what happened to someone else not long before. If I shoot, we lose the route and the village. If I miss and hit someone else, I just made more enemies. And fuck if I want to shoot a child. 

All this was in the span of a moment. He turned and ran into the crowd. No one stopped him. No one helped him. He just disappeared into the sea of people that didn't even see the tense moment that had just unfolded. 

I think about him sometimes. Did he ever try again? Was he successful? If so, am I to blame for their death? Where did he get the gun? 

I know what I was in his eyes: I was the monster that was in his village with guns. Maybe, to him, I was the person that killed someone he loved. 

Guess I'll never know.

	<TEXT> I wasn't really terribly familiar with the British space program, so I had to wiki it a bit. It was interesting reading about Project Juno in the early 90s, in which private funding was raised using a lottery system and corporate/private donations to send the first Briton into space. It really sounds like the British, in general, have a lot of interest in space (especially space tourism). I think that counts for a lot, and enough pressure by the citizens will hopefully spur the government into re-energizing your space program.

I know you already know the answer (being a rhetorical question and all), but politics. We're better. We've gone further. We're more innovative. Our Nazis are better than their Nazis (quoting The Right Stuff, for anyone who hasn't seen the movie, lol). 

I really hope that we can continue working together in an international arena because, as you said, we're really all striving for the same goal. Honestly, I'm glad that we're currently working with Russia and think it's been good for both programs. On the other hand, a public/private partnership is going to be great for NASA and the US program. Can't we have both? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Which is exactly why international cooperation is great for space exploration. When you look at the national [contributions to the international space station](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/component_view.pdf) (something that I get the feeling you're already familiar with), it really hits home how the different nations contributed to the endeavor. And obviously Russia saw a benefit to international cooperation, too. I don't know the politics of it, but that leads me to believe that the contributing nations all saw that the others had something important to offer. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that's the major disconnect in the conversation (overall in this thread, I mean). 

NASA **is physically able** to launch a manned flight now using technology from their own inventory.

They are **not permitted to do** so because of their own (and ULA) safety requirements and budgetary decisions. 

If the astronauts were in trouble on the ISS and Russia was closed for the weekend, NASA would get a manned flight up there in short order. It sounds like we're all in agreement on that point, but you're right that they've made different budgetary allocations based on their strategic goals.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You're very correct. NASA decided it wasn't worth the expense of gaining man-rating for that platform. And I agree, when there was a lesser-powered option sitting in Russia. It's more than capable of obtaining certification for manned flights, but it's so overpowered that it would be a waste of money.

edit: I'm not sure whatever came of the Atlas V HR certification efforts from 2012, but I don't think that was completed either. It's worth noting that the original ISS flights and space shuttle launches weren't human-rated either, because the requirements were put in place after those flights. It's my understanding that the human-rating requirements are established by NASA and by the ULA (a joint venture by Boeing and Lockheed Martin). If there was a compelling reason to launch in the very near future and Russia was unable to assist, the technology would support it if the regulations were removed or changed. </TEXT>

My personal belief is that the race to the moon was an attempt by both the US and Russia to seize the symbolic high ground during the height of the cold war. It wasn't necessarily a tactical or strategic victory, but rather a symbolic one. 

Maybe the goals weren't as altruistic as the politicians on both sides claimed, but it did wonders for our technological advances. </TEXT>

My only point was that the reasons why we rely on Russia has nothing to do with our technology. Rather it was a decision based on budgetary considerations. 

I will grant that they couldn't launch today, but I would argue that they could in short order using current technology in their inventory if properly resources.

We're both obviously quite passionate about space exploration, which is a good thing! We might disagree on how the program itself should be administered, but I think we're both eager to see what comes from it in our lifetime. But I think that we've discussed and fully explored the original concept.

	<TEXT> And you could see by my replies that I was taking issue with the word "can't." I believe that it most certainly can, although I do concede that it would take some time and money to get existing systems man-rated. But that's a policy issue, not a question of ability. That was my point. 

But our conversation evolved (as conversations sometimes do), and I felt that it was a good one. I also think that it's found a mutually respectful conclusion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, there were multiple factors, sure. But it still comes down to cost. With sufficient budget (which we both agree doesn't exist), they could have built a suitable replacement. But they chose to allocate their funds elsewhere (smart choice) and used a launch platform that already was in place (the Russian systems). It was a cost-effective solution made for budgetary reasons. It's still very possible to achieve man-rating for the DeltaIVH, but there's not a financial incentive to do so. It's like driving a semi truck to the store when you can just borrow your friend's sedan. Why buy your own car when you can just use  your friend's? Keeping with the metaphor NASA has been focusing on heavy loads precisely because they found a relatively inexpensive solution for 'short' trips. 

But I suppose we have different perspectives of the same situation. Frankly, I think that a public/private partnership is a great solution, whether it was originally the intent or not. I respect your opinion, I just disagree with your conclusion.

edit: I would also add that the NASA CAIB recommended moving the retirement date out to 2020 in their post-Columbia disaster report. This would call for a re-certification and service life extension program to extend the shuttle program past it's original date. NASA eventually chose to non-concur with the recommendation to free up precious funds for the other goals under the Bush Administration Vision for Space program of 2004.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's not accurate. The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS) is in [node 3 of the ISS](http://spaceflight.nasa.gov/station/assembly/component_view.pdf), which was built by the US. If the Russians removed their contributions, they would have a lot of trouble without the solar panels and habitation modules (both US). 

All of the contributing countries have provided their expertise and worked together to build this technological marvel. No country did 'better' or piggybacked on anyone. They just all did their part.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Only because there's not a need for it when there's a cheaper alternative. 

Remember that the space shuttle was used up until 2011, which didn't rely on Russian launch systems at all. They stopped using it because of the cost and because it was an aging technology that had a suitable, low-cost replacement. 

I think we're really saying the same thing. I'm saying that they technically/technologically can, but aren't. NASA isn't using US technology because they don't need to- there's something cheaper that's available and optimized for human flight. They could, with some effort, resume using US technology for manned flight if there was a good reason to do so. At the moment, there simply isn't. But deciding to use the American private sector instead of Russian space program is their way of balancing cost with capability.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Why wouldn't they? If it's cheaper to use existing rockets that are technologically sound, that's what NASA will do. It's not like we're at war with Russia, so why wouldn't they use their launch platforms? The Delta IV heavy is more than capable of launching a manned crew, but it's overpowered and expensive compared to the RD-180, which can only handle relatively light payloads like human crews. 

NASA has a limited budget. They're going with the least expensive option. Doesn't that make sense to do?

	<TEXT> They can; the rockets and engines exist and have been used successfully before. The Russian rockets are cheaper to launch and more thoroughly tested. We can develop compatible technology, but its far more expensive and time-consuming than waiting for the private sector to do it and outsourcing to them. </TEXT>

Yeah... no. 

They refused to process the return unless it was on their terms, and then we noticed three missed calls (from a MagicJack number in Florida) over the course of an hour. The last call was this voicemail message. 

I bleeped out her name for privacy. Apologies for the poor quality. 

I called Amazon and they confirmed that they didn't call. So I guess her account is safe. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> do the people buying the house tend to use certified cheques?

I've never bought a house with cash up front- I think most people tend to borrow the money in the form of a mortgage. When the loan is approved and funded, the financing company gives a check to the seller's mortgage company to pay off the home (if applicable) and the rest goes to the sellers themselves. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Have you ever purchased commercial insurance? If so, have you read the actual contract? Insurance covers damage. There was no damage, but there were cleanup costs. The cleanup costs had to be paid from someone, and I (and apparently the family in this news piece) think it's best when it's not the victims. Do you disagree with that point? You didn't quite answer that question.

Who made the decision

I don't know. No one knows, except for the family. Do you?

Don't even start sith the race card mate

What? Where did I mention race at all in any way that could be considered playing "the race card"?

I'm really trying to figure out your point. Are you upset that it happened? Are you upset because you don't feel the story is newsworthy? Are you upset because you feel that there are better causes, and don't agree with how this money was spent? With no disrespect, you kind of seem to be all over the map here. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Insurance would not cover this cleanup. Someone felt that the congregation should not have to pay for it either. Do you disagree with that, or do you just disagree with the cause that the child (or parents) chose to support?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It would be unfortunate if it wasn't, but that's definitely a possibility. 

Unfortunately, the Jihadists are hoping that people will isolate the moderate Muslims, who will then be prime targets for radicalization. And not the good kind of radicalization, with skateboards and pogs- the bad kind. There's a lot of that being discussed in government white papers and intel-type groups, and I get the strong feeling that you've taken the time to educate yourself on the terrorist motivations and tactics. So acts like this (genuine or not) can actually end up doing a lot of good. Or at least help avoid a little bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was actually speaking in more general terms. I apologize for being unclear on that point. 

In this case, there was still a cleanup cost. Sure, it was only $150 and the congregation could have afforded it, but that really wasn't the point. The point was that someone (whether the child or his parents) didn't feel that they (edit: they = the congregation) should lose out on any sum of money due to the actions of others. 

And it sounds like we're on the same page with the point I was meaning to make- that if there was significant damage done to the mosque (such as being burned to the ground) that people of all faiths helping rebuild would be a good thing. Do you agree with that? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I thought I was fairly clear in my original point. I'm not being coy. 

No, mosques are not subject to constant destruction and vandalism. I didn't say anything even close to that.

Sometimes, yes. When a church gets burned (which has happened recently, remember), is it a bad thing when the community bands together to help rebuild it? Many churches and mosques are paid for and supported by their local communities. I don't see a problem with people of any faith helping to restore what was damaged out of hatred. Do you? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Fiverr *used* to be about doing things for $5. Now it's just another avenue where freelancers try to get work by adding all the 'extras' you need for additional fees. 

For example, I saw a gig on fiverr advertising logo design for $5. But for additional fees, you could remove the watermark, get the large version (the $5 version was tiny), get the source files, etc. 

So you can get decent work there, but it's just another freelance site now </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Contrary to common belief, checks don't clear when you receive the funds. It can take a little while to settle between the banks. This scam takes advantage of that fact by having the victim deposit checks into their own account, then give the money back to the scammers (often thinking it's different people). Eventually, the checks bounce and the money is taken back out of the victim's account. 

So you'd end up missing a lot of money and they'd simply disappear. </TEXT>
