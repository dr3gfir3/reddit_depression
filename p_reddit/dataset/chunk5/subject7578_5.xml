**Common Myths and Misconceptions**

Q: Can small EQ's relieve stress to prevent large ones?

A: If you look at earthquake statistics in most regions of the world, including California, you will find that for every magnitude 5 earthquake, there are about 10 that have a magnitude of 4, and for each magnitude 4, there are 10 with magnitude 3. Unfortunately, this means there are not enough small earthquakes to relieve enough stress to prevent the large events. In fact, it would take 32 magnitude 5's, 1000 magnitude 4's, or 32,000 magnitude 3's to equal the energy produced in one magnitude 6 event.

	<TEXT> To help refine your theory allow me make a few corrections with regard to detail, for the sake of clarity:

(1) Venus' retrograde motion is thought to have originated from a giant impact, much like Earth and [Theia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theia_%28planet%29).

(2) The resurfacing of Venus some 500Ma is, as one theory suggests, due to the fact that Venus lacks plate tectonics ([no water](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm)), and so has a 'stagnant-lid.' Without an active lithosphere heat must accumulate, eventually leading to catastrophic overturning of the mantle and subsequently resurfacing of Venus ([wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geodynamics_of_Venus#Episodic_plate_tectonics)).  

(3) Convection within Venus doesn't seem to be an issue, however, Venus' rotation is thought to be too slow to support a self sustaining geodynamo like that of Earth.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Will it lose a significant amount of surface matter this way?

That depends on what's going on at the surface, and currently no one is certain. The following is an excerpt from an interview with Michael Brown, Cathy Olkin, and Richard Binzel.

*Zooming out from Pluto's surface to the atmosphere, New Horizons has revealed that Pluto is rapidly losing its atmosphere out to space because of its weak gravity. Yet Pluto has somehow maintained an atmosphere. How?*

Cathy Olkin: Pluto's atmosphere is really large and extended, and you would expect that it would be escaping. So it has to be regenerated somehow. Those ices on the surface that we were talking aboutthey'll sublimate and go from the solid form into a gaseous form, and then support the atmosphere. Of course over millions of years, you'll have to have some source for resupply. There was a recent paper by Kelsi Singer and Alan Stern about potential sources of replenishing the nitrogen ice, which is the main predominant gas in the atmosphere. That paper proposed maybe there were sources internal to Pluto that were upwelling and providing ices coming up from the subsurface to the surface. Then that would sublimate and support that atmosphere. So that's one theory for what's supporting the atmosphere.

Michael Brown: Can I mention a more mundane potential explanation, which is what we thought for most of the past decade? We wrote a paper a few years ago suggesting that if you just had all these ices there to begin with at the abundances that we know exists in say, comets, that the loss rates on Pluto are such that you would still have the atmosphere there. So, I'm not convinced yet that the atmosphere needs replenishment through some sort of active mechanism. And one of the ways that we sort of show ourselves that we understand this process is by looking at all of the other objects out there in that region of the Kuiper Belt. The largest ones, which had the biggest inventories to begin with, still have those ices on them. They have the methane. They probably have the nitrogen and carbon monoxide. We can't see those as well and as you get just a little bit smaller where they should have lost all of them to space, they don't have them. So, it's not clear to me that active rejuvenation is actually necessary.

Richard Binzel: I think what's going on there at Pluto is some of these seasonal effects. You have to realize Pluto's in this eccentric orbit and so it goes as close to the sun as 30 AU and as far as 50 AU. [An "AU," or astronomical unit, is the average distance between the Earth and the Sun.] So you could have times when it's unseasonably warm on Pluto and it gets up to 60 Kelvin [-352 Fahrenheit] or so. So you can expect that there are times when it's warmer and that some of the more volatile ices will go from the solid phase to the gas phase. And I think historically over time, just depending on what you think about loss rates, maybe Pluto's lost a few kilometers of its upper layers. So, it's not like all of Pluto evaporated. There are these other things going on, not only Pluto's eccentric orbit. Pluto is tipped over in its orbit too, so there are some times when one of the poles is pointing Sun-on. Then Pluto has these century-long arctic summers, and that can be driving a lot of volatiles from the solid phase to the gas phase. There's just a lot of complexity at Pluto that is just fantastic to try to unravel.

Michael Brown: I actually think that Rick's point is the key point that didn't get discussed very much during the flyby. Pluto is the most seasonally extreme world I think we've ever visited. So our instincts on what should and shouldn't be there are often not very good. We need to really think about the seasonswhat season it is right now, what season it's just been and think about how all these ices move around and how everything moves around because of these seasons.

	<TEXT> It had me interested until I heard him start mentioning some mumbo jumbo about 'coronal hole quakes.' That set off a few alarm bells... checking the mentioned site 'quakewatch do net' my fears were confirmed... trying to link solar activity to earthquakes. While interesting to investigate, there is no good evidence for solar activity triggering the onset of earthquakes:

...the hypothesis that solar-terrestrial interaction can trigger earthquakes must be regarded with significant skepticism

	<TEXT> I'll answer two questions posed to help clarify the issue for you. One in summary the other in ... some detail. 

With regard to if we're sure the inner-core is iron (formed during [the iron-catastrophe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_catastrophe)), it's bulk composition is iron-nickel with other elements scattered throughout though they are certainly not a major component relative to nickel and iron. We understand this through modelling, laboratory experimentation, and probing by means of geophysical or seismic surveys.

With regard to your question about heavier elements, radioactive elements, etc. it's not *just* about the mass of an element, and actually relates to geochemistry, and how said properties distribute elements throughout the Earth's core, mantle, and crust. In order to understand this we need to understand some factors that dictate the process of crystallization (because the process of cooling is, for all intents and purposes, crystallizing).

When material crystallizes it forms bonds, determined by the properties of the elements that compose it, such that it will form what is called a crystal lattice (think of it as a frame work... [NaCl](http://earthsci.org/mineral/rockmin/chart/nacl.gif) for example). When a material cools slowly it has time to reject anything that doesn't fit into the crystal lattice (impurities). This is determined by the ionic radius of the element, and the valence. Potassium for example, is [quite large](http://270c81.medialib.glogster.com/media/46/463184ef720cd5004f107ff944302c4da2cebcf042b133df2134671f35e2eb47/p-table-atomic-rad.jpg), and thus as magma cools and begins to crystallize, it remains in the melt. We note that the hot, K rich melt is less dense than the colder, denser, minerals that just formed and so potassium will rise towards the crust as the melt is positively buoyant. And, in fact we can note that the crust is the most radioactive region of the Earth (K-40 is radioactive) because of how [incompatible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible_element) these LILE, or large-ion lithophile elements are and the inability to incorporate themselves into common crystal structures (minerals). So while an elements mass is important to some degree, the major player in controlling the distribution of elements throughout the Earth is dominated by the geochemical nature (as is demonstrated in [The Earth Scientist's Periodic Table of the Elements and Their Ions](http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/2012/06251711-geochemists-periodic-table.html)).

Gold, by the way (and a few others), should be concentrated deep within the Earth; however, they're not as it has been suggested that they were delivered later [during the Late Heavy Bombardment](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v477/n7363/full/nature10399.html). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wish I could tell you more, but in all honesty, I have no idea with regards to this specific outcrop. The photo was taken on one of North Arrow Minerals properties (their [Mel Project](http://www.northarrowminerals.com/_resources/projects/mel_map.jpg)), which is located with the Rae Craton, and not by me. From other properties in the area I was able to find a 43-101 that states the regional geology as follows:

The Melville Peninsula lies within the northern part of the Churchill 
Structural Province of the Precambrian Canadian Shield.  It forms a horst between the Foxe Basin and Committee Bay.  The Melville Peninsula is underlain by Archean tonalite-granodiorite 
gneiss, Archean Prince Albert Group metasedimentary and metavolcanic rocks, Archean granites of the Hall Lake Plutonic Complex, Aphebian Penrhyn Group metasedimentary rocks, Helikian sandstones and conglomerates of the Folster Lake Formation and Fury and Hecla Supergroup, Archean to Proterozoic metadiabase and diabase dykes, and early Paleozoic carbonate rocks. Large areas of the peninsula are covered by Quaternary glacia
l drift (Schau, 1993; Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

The oldest rocks on the Melville Peninsula are partially retrogressed tonalite-granodiorite gneisses, which in some areas are cross-cut by leucogranite dykes and metamorphosed mafic sills and  dykes (Schau, 1993).  Supracrustal rocks of the Prince Albert Group unconformably overlie the gneisses.  The term Prince Albert Group was introduced by Heywood (1967) to "refer to a sequence of Aphebian (early Proterozoic) or Archean metamorphosed sedimentary and volcanic rocks", which exist mainly in two belts on the Melville Peninsula and one belt southwest of Committee Bay.  Subsequent geological and isotopic analyses by Frisch and Goulet (1975) and Schau (1975) determined that the Prince Albert Group is, in fact, Archean in age.  Schau (1993) described the Prince Albert Group as "a volcanogenic sequence containing meta-ultramafic rocks, metabasalt, acid volcanic
 rocks, quartzite, banded iron formations, as well as more common pelitic and other clastic metasedimentary rocks".  Small (100 to 400 m diameter) showings of serpentinized ultramafic rock within foliated porphyritic to 
megacrystic granite have been mapped in portions of the Melville Peninsula (Besserer and Olson, 1995).  The Prince Albert Group is exposed in numerous belts and in a few isolated rafts on the Melville Peninsula.  The largest belt is up to 20 km wide and extends from the west-central Melville Peninsula, northeastwards to Roche Bay, th
en strikes northwards past Hall Lake, for a total distance of nearly 200km.  The other belts and rafts of the Prince 
Albert Group rocks are up to 55 km long and 10 km wide (Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

The tonalite-granodiorite gneiss and Prince Albert Group were intruded by Late Archean metagabbroic stocks, then deformed by a complex series of folds and faults, and finally were metamorphosed and intruded by granites 
of the Hall Lake Plutonic Complex. Metamorphism in the Late Archean reached upper amphibolite grade throughout most of Melville Peninsula, but ranged from greenschist grade in a few regions on the east 
coast, through granulite grade in the northwest part of the Peninsula (Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

Metasedimentary rocks of the Penrhyn Group were deposited during the Aphebian (early Proterozoic), mainly in the southern Melville Peninsula.  The Penrhyn Group and underlying basement were subsequently deform
ed in at least two separate episodes associated with the late Aphebian Hudsonian Orogeny, and metamorphosed to amphibolite grade.  Northeast-trending high-strain zones associated with this deformation are present along the contacts between the Penrhyn Group and basement rocks, and at several locations in the north
western Melville Peninsula (Besserer and Olson, 1995). 

The Melville Peninsula was uplifted during the Helikian (middle Proterozoic), and cross-cut by numerous east-southeast trending 'latitudinal faults' (Schau, 1993).  These latitudinal faults occur throughout the Melville Peninsula, but are more common in the north half of the Peninsula.  A few granitic stocks are emplaced 
along these latitudinal  fault zones.  Sandstone and conglomerate clastic sequences were deposited later in the 
Helikian, first in the Folster Lake Formation on the west coast, then in the Fury and Hecla Supergroup on the north coast of Melville Peninsula.  Diabase dykes, of the Mackenzie Series and of the Franklin Series, were intruded into all of the above rock units during the Late Helikian and Hadrynian (Upper Proterozoic).  Ordovician 
carbonate rocks were deposited both on the east coast and adjacent to the west coast of Melville Peninsula, and are the youngest rock units preserved.  Renewed uplift of the Melville Peninsula to near its present erosional surface occurred during the Devonian and Cretaceous.  In the Quaternary, thick glacial sediments were locally deposited along the west coast (Besserer and Olson, 1995).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, the details are contested quite frequently (was it just a giant impact, was it just volcanism, was it both, did the impact trigger volcanism, etc) with similar authors publishing their findings as they develop their theories (note the authors of [this study](http://gsabulletin.gsapubs.org/content/early/2015/04/30/B31167.1.full.pdf+html)). To be honest I'm still not convinced of either side (though I lean predominantly in favour of volcanism as the leading culprit). The Deccan Traps came in [three phases](http://www.princeton.edu/main/images/news/2011/11/keller_Fig2deccanpulses_400.jpg) with the largest phase, phase 2 approximately correlating in time with the K-T impact event. 

Perhaps they address the following question in their paper, but one might would expect to see global volcanism increase... did it, if so by how much, and are the same signatures detected in the chemistry globally or can it be attributed to mantle dynamics or something else? Furthermore, if not and they argue that it may have where seismic energy would have been focused we can look at the antipodes and see if in fact they line up (hint: [they don't](http://planetsave.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/trompglobes_hires.jpg)).

My point being that given the current evidence there is yet to be a conclusive answer, as the authors themselves note:

Our data don't conclusively prove that the impact caused these changes, but the connection looks increasingly clear. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hello, a few questions here,

- What is the most favoured, or... currently most probable [source for the water](http://www.scientificamerican.com/sciam/assets/Image/Mars_Water_full.jpg)?

- Prospective signs of life, one could argue, should be associated with areas in which these briny flows occur. Have any previous studies looked for anomalous CH4 values over time within these areas, and if not will this be an area of future research?

- What are the characteristics of the flows... in other words, do they pool at all - evaporate at different rates along the flow path, and if such is there a detectable gradient in the concentration of perchlorates that could be noted, on larger scales, from orbiters for future target generation?

Thanks for your time </TEXT>

The Mars discovery came out of an independent project he [Lujendra Ojha, an undergraduate at the time] was doing with professor Alfred McEwen, lead author of the new study published in Science. Their collaborator, University of Arizona researcher Colin Dundas, was interested in gullies on Mars, which may be remnants of past water activity. The researchers were looking for seasonal changes in those gullies.

Using a computer algorithm to examine images taken in the same crater as the gullies Dundas had examined, Ojha removed visual distortions, such as shadows, from images of a crater taken at different points in time. With that technique, he compared the images to identify the changes over time.

That's how Ojha noticed irregular features in the crater that weren't related to the gullies. </TEXT>

**Relax the restrictions**

We argue that planetary protection policies can be significantly eased for future Mars missions (Box 1). If Earth microorganisms can thrive on Mars, they almost certainly already do; and if they cannot, the transer of Earth life to Mars should be of no concern, as it would simply not survive. We cannot see how our current program of Mars exploration might pose any real threat to a possible martian biosphere. If we search in situ for extant life on Mars, a cleaning protocol of the spacecraft should be pursued to some extent  but only because we could potentially have problems distinguishing between indigenous Martian organisms (which might be related to Earth life) and microorganisms carried by the spacecraft, and not because of forward contamination concerns. For all other missions, the sterilization requirements as currently delineated by planetary protection protocols can be scaled down.
___
*Box 1 | Assessment of current and future missions to Mars*
___
Currently, all missions to Mars must comply with strict planetary protection policies that are expensive to implement. We make the following specific recommendations for the elimination or reduction of these protocols.

*Orbiters*

MAVEN. NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution mission, scheduled to launch in late 2013, is dedicated to understanding the atmosphere and climate of Mars. No planetary protection measures are required.

ExoMars. Launching in 2016 and led by the European and Russian space agencies, an orbiter will study the atmosphere of Mars and search for gases of possible biological importance, such as methane. No planetary protection measures are required.

*Landers and Rovers*

Mars Exploration Rover. On the martian surface since 2004, NASA's Opportunity rover is still examining clues to past water activity on Mars. With its geologic objectives, no planetary protection measures would have been required.

Mars Science Laboratory. NASA's Curiosity rover touched down in late 2012 and seeks to answer questions regarding the planet's habitability past and present. Curiosity is not, however, directly searching for life and planetary protection measures would not have been required.

InSight. Slated to arrive on the surface of Mars in late 2016, this NASA lander will conduct a geophysical study of the planet's deep interior. No planetary protection measures are required.

ExoMars. Launching with the 2016 orbiter, EDM (Entry, Descent and Landing Demonstrator Module) will test landing technologies. It is expected to survive on the surface of Mars for a short time, performing limited surface science. Another rover, along with a surface platform, is planned for a 2018 launch and will search for signs of in situ life. No planetary protection measures are required for EDM, and only limited measures for the rover and the platform to the extent to avoid false positives.

NASA's 2020 rover mission. Planetary protection requirements of this currently unnamed mission will depend on the payload and the final objectives.
___

As planetary exploration faces drastic budget cuts globally, it is critical to avoid unnecessary expenses and reroute the limited taxpayers' money to missions that can have the greatest impact on planetary exploration. We argue that sterilization protocols should be waived for orbiters  despite the risk of a crash or atmospheric re-entry  and surface missions with geological focus, and should be re-evaluated on a case-by-case basis for lander and rover missions that seek to detect past or present life in situ. </TEXT>

**Interplanetary transfer of life**

Significant progress has been made to quantify the survival chances of terrestrial microorganisms during the different stages of a panspermia event in which life is transferred from one planetary body to another. The organisms must survive ejection from the planetary surface following an impact event, the microenvironment inside a rock during the interplanetary trip, and the final descent through an atmosphere to land on another planetary surface. The general consensus is that the process of interplanetary transfer of life is not only possible, but even likely. Terrestrial microorganisms would be able to survive the process of being hurled from their mother body, enduring harsh interplanetary conditions, and finally crashing on to another planet. The argument is particularly viable for the transfer of life from Earth to Mars, because the survival rate is enhanced for re-entry into a thinner atmosphere  such as that of Mars.

In view of these findings, we propose that Earth life has most likely already been transferred to Mars. Life has been present on Earth for at least 3.8 billion years, so there has been plenty of time for the transfer process to occur naturally through impact events. Also, the frequency of impacts was substantially higher in the past than it is today. Even after considering the difficult dynamics of transport from Earth to Mars against the Sun's gravity sink, we can easily conclude that Earth materials have probably been transferred to Mars. The random nature of meteorite impacts across the surface of Mars suggests that any samples containing life from Earth are unlikely to have spared the astrobiologically interesting regions, both recently and in the distant past. We should also not forget that a number of missions after Viking, the first spacecraft to successfully land on Mars, were not sterilized at all, because it was thought that Mars was not inhabited. And sterilization procedures, if any, on Mars probes launched by the Soviet space programme, some of which landed or crashed on the martian surface, are undisclosed.

We envision two different scenarios that are relevant to redefining planetary protection priorities. Starting from the premise that Earth life must have been transferred naturally to Mars before, it may have survived on Mars during earlier, wetter times. But terrestrial microorganisms that were transferred billions of years ago to a more hospitable martian surface would have had to either evolve to adapt to the changing environment, or perish. If Earth life (either ancient or more recent) is not able to survive on present-day Mars, any strains of ancient life would be long gone and any newcomers delivered by meteorites would be killed on arrival or soon after  and the same would hold for artificial transfer by spacecraft. We conclude that, if Earth life cannot thrive on Mars today, our concerns about forward contamination of Mars with Earth organisms are unwarranted. Our money and efforts can be better directed at alternative endeavours.

If, on the other hand, Earth microorganisms can in fact live on present-day Mars, we can safely presume that they could have survived even more easily in the past on a wetter early Mars. With a period of about 4 billion years for possible transport to a potentially habitable martian surface, combined with a higher rate of asteroidal impacts in ancient times, a large range of Earth microorganisms could have been transported to Mars and widely distributed. In this case, we can safely conclude that Earth life is already present on Mars. Therefore, it is too late to protect Mars from terrestrial life, and we can safely relax the planetary protection policies.

In the second scenario, if life on Mars originated independently and has not yet died out, life indigenous to Mars and life imported from Earth by interplanetary transport are already coexisting and have coexisted for eons. Possible microorganisms onboard our spacecraft would not interact with the indigenous Mars life in a different way than previous Earth life transported to Mars. Any competition between Mars life and Earth life would have played out long before the arrival of human spacecraft. Future missions would simply find the survivors of this natural selection process, and these survivors would be expected to be better adapted to martian conditions than new arrivals from Earth. Regardless of the degree of similarity between any life on Mars and Earth, microorganisms delivered from Earth by spacecraft would not be detrimental for any currently existing organisms on Mars, which would have already encountered Earth life. </TEXT>

**The overprotection of Mars**
___

**Planetary protection policies aim to guard Solar System bodies from biological contamination from spacecraft. Costly efforts to sterilize Mars spacecraft need to be re-evaluated, as they are unnecessarily inhibiting a more ambitious agenda to search for extant life on Mars.**

The mission of NASA's Office of Planetary Protection is to protect Solar System bodies  including planets, moons, comets and asteroids  from contamination by Earth life, and to protect Earth from possible life forms that may be returned from other Solar System bodies. To accomplish these objectives, the programme absorbs a meagre amount of the NASA budget when viewed in its entirety. But the budget for a specific mission to Mars can substantially increase if its landing site is designated by the Office of Planetary Protection as a region of potential astrobiological interest  the so-called 'special regions'  in which, theoretically, Mars life could exist and/or Earth life could survive. Indeed, other space agencies have also developed similar costly strategies to avoid the contamination of Mars with terrestrial microorganisms onboard spacecraft.

From an astrobiological view-point, the most interesting missions are obviously those devoted to the search for possible life beyond Earth. Thus, astrobiological missions to Mars should be targeting precisely these special regions. However, such missions must undergo the scrutiny of NASA planetary protection protocols and are required to comply with detailed and expensive sterilization requirements ([Fig. 1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v6/n7/fig_tab/ngeo1866_F1.html)) to prevent the interplanetary transport of microorganisms that, in practice, make them unviable. Consequently, we have not had any mission devoted to the in situ search for extant life on Mars in decades. Here we argue that the protocols and policies of planetary protection are unnecessarily restricting Mars exploration and need to be revised.

	<TEXT> A self sustaining geodynamo is not required for a planetary body to remain geologically active due to cooling rates, and density contrasts (see Venus, Io). There is evidence in support of active Martian geology (see my other comment [here](https://www.np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/3mdvtn/nasa_will_announce_a_major_mars_discovery_on/cvefmso)) For example, it is suggested that our moon may have a bout of volcanism in the future, for example:

"Today, the Moon is still cooling down, as are the melts in its interior. So in the distant future, the cooler and therefore solidifying melt will change in composition, likely making it less dense than its surroundings. 
This lighter magma could make its way again up to the surface forming an active volcano on the Moon." -[source](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2103696/Volcanoes-Moon-Research-shows-lunar-surface-day-lava-flows.html)

Furthermore, our moon may still be geologically active: [Shrinking   growing Moon](http://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov//vis/a010000/a010900/a010948/10915_MOON_GRABEN-540-MASTER_high.webmhd.webm). </TEXT>

- Evidence for active plate tectonics on Mars: [University of California, Los Angeles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ahLnxD3GIo feature=relmfu)

And multiple others. Without further research there simply isn't enough data to conclude that Mars is currently either geologically dead or active.

	<TEXT> I'm not certain about the conditions, or how well constrained our knowledge is with regards to certain specifics surrounding Saturn and Enceladus, but I'm willing to speculate that it wouldn't be a very favourable location for potential space colonies. 

Resources: Unlike the terrestrial planets, asteroids, or even our own moon there's no available mineral resources to be found in abundance. Perhaps the issue could be skirted somehow, but why not just look for a more hospitable location to begin with?

Stability: Many surface features, and cryoactivty on Saturn's moon Enceladus bear resemblance to those observed on Jupiter's moon Europa, and its icy shell. Recently, it is suggested that Europa may be host to a similar type (though not identical) of [plate tectonics](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v7/n10/full/ngeo2245.html) as Earth. Enceladus is riddled with features denoting [a good degree of activity](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/v3/n2/full/ngeo763.html) - thus it might not be a satisfactory location if you're looking for a location with a good degree of stability.

Ever the menace: Saturn like Jupiter emits radiation, though how much, and more specifically, how much reacts with Enceladus and to what degree I remain uncertain. However, this certainly seems like an area of potential concern for any long term colonization.

I'm sure there are a plethora of other concerns, but those are just a few that immediately spring to mind. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course it has something to do with pre-exisitng faults. Hydraulic fracturing, as well as fluid injection of waste water into disposal wells has been demonstrated on multiple accounts to generate EQs through reactivation of ancient faults (pre-existing planes of weakness within the rock). Motion along a fault isn't triggered by the fault itself, it's a release of accumulated stress (sigma one) - in this instance it was determined that stress was induced by hydraulic fracturing which increased lithostatic strain beyond the failure envelope. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of particular interest was with regards to Earth processes as analogs on Mars. As there is thought to be no plate tectonics present on Mars, the question remains then as to how the layers of sedimentary rocks seen on Mars formed to begin with. Typically, on Earth sediments are deposited into a basin where they accumulate with the addition of sediments overlying the initial deposits. Increases in pressure and temperature begin to cook the sediments, compacting them into rocks. They would remain buried at depth if it were not for some process in which to exhume them - on Earth, plate tectonics provides just such a mechanism; however, this doesn't appear to be the process at work on Mars. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The evidence, for me, is what I have to go by - and while it appears as though there are a number of questions that yet remain to be answered I find that the theory that *currently* best answers the most questions, at least satisfactorily remains in the domain of climate change. As far as I can tell the best evidence (in North America) for the overkill hypothesis is by means of statistical analysis - which has issues of it's own. Comparatively, the evidence for climate change is based on numerous lines of hard evidence (not just stats, and assumptions), from DNA analysis, fossil analysis, paleo ecological reconstructions, etc. 

The overkill hypothesis is not without it's problems. For example, there are numerous sites which show evidence (though some are debated) of pre-Clovis era colonization in North America (further noting the Monte Verde site in Chile, South America). If this is the case, it becomes difficult to fathom that humans co-existed with megafauna, and then suddenly wiped them out. Furthermore, in regards to Clovis era sites, there are only a few that are accepted as kill sites that date to the appropriate time period. There are approx. 28 sites, out of 180 known sites that have been date to the corresponding time period. Of those 28 sites, a mere 14 are widely accepted as kill sites showing Mammoth / Mastadon and spear points. Now recall that 35 genera became extinct (ie. thousands upon thousands of species) - 14 sites is a tiny number, and that's a major problem for the overkill hypothesis (note:[Timing of extinction of the North American Pleistocene megafauna](http://imgur.com/a/znion) from [*Late Pleistocene Megafaunal Extinctions*, Elias and Schreve, '07](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/files/1398773/Article_318_Late_Pleistocene_megafaunal_extinctions.pdf))
The other major problem with the overkill hypothesis is that the evidence, aside from statistical analysis of arrival times, is extremely scant while noting that the statistical analysis is also potentially heavily laden with incorrect assumptions, unaccounted for variables, and an inherent mathematical attribute similar to non-uniqueness found in models.

In my opinion, a good portion of the counter arguments to climatic and ecological dominant forcings with regard to the Late Pleistocene extinctions in North America seem over simplified upon examination. Climate change is not uniform, and therefore it should not be expected to be similar from pole-to-pole (noting the Polar see-saw for example). The local ecology will vary from region to region, and thus ecological responses will differ alongside differences in population density, and distribution over time. Perhaps, a threshold was reached due to previous oscillations (stadial - interstadial conditions), while also noting that no two climate oscillations were/are the same (The Younger Dryas, for example, is the youngest, longest, and coldest of three stadials that resulted from typically abrupt climatic changes that took place over the last 16,000 calendar years), and thus may provide an answer as to why one specific event may have been more detrimental than others. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I see you never looked at the plethora of evidence against their bogus claims. I highly suggest you do so before requesting I get some 'recent sources.' Their arguments remain the same, rehashed and flawed. No one has been able to replicate their findings. As I mentioned earlier, there is plenty of good evidence with regards to the Younger Dryas stadial and the draining of Lake Agassiz, for which glacial dynamics are the only prerequisite for a cause, and of which have been satisfactorily investigated. On the other hand, there has yet to be a single shred of evidence that points conclusively to an impact event. I suggest you refrain from your preschool antics of shouting and screaming, and actually research the topic further. A good start is with the numerous links and papers I have provided previously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Basic Scientific Fact: Bitumen is not heavy crude, and nor is it extra heavy crude, it's bitumen - the deposits are a mixture of quartz/clay particles, water, and bitumen.

Definitions of heavy oil and bitumen are shown graphically in [figure 11](http://i.imgur.com/IjBeOek.png). The value of 10API, which is equivalent to that of water, provides a clear border between (unconventional) extraheavy oil and conventional heavy oil. However, it is more accurate to define heavy oil in terms of viscosity, rather than API gravity. Crude below 10API with viscosity of 1,00010,000 cP is considered as extraheavy oil, and that with viscosity above 10,000 cP is considered as bitumen.

EDIT: I should also like to note that what ever your stance on the term 'tar sands' it's still used in the scientific literature as can be seen in [Unconventional Petroleum Geology](http://store.elsevier.com/Unconventional-Petroleum-Geology/Caineng-Zou/isbn-9780123977861/) as I've highlighted [here](http://i.imgur.com/dEubc9J.png), and can be read in the description in the hyperlink.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not possible. Io has ~~no water~~ a negligible amount of water, [a prerequisite](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm) for the style of plate tectonics that occurs on Earth. The mountains of Io and what they mean for *patera* (volcanic lakes that are frequently within the near vicinity of Ionian mountains) are likely genetically related.
___
**Mountains on Io:**

A quick review of Ios mountain structures reveals mesas, plateaus, peaks, ridges, and massifs with some common morphological features between them such as rising abruptly out of the volcanic plains with virtually no headlands or foothills and often surrounded by basal scarps, tens to a few hundred meters high (Schenk et al 2001). Many of these mountains resemble flatiron mountains on Earth and are therefore interpreted as tilted crustal blocks. Plate tectonics however, is not the suspected mechanism. Rather it is hypothesized that most mountains are thrust blocks formed as a result of compressive stressed built up in the lower crust due to the global subsidence of volcanic layers as they are buried over time (Schenk and Bulmer 1998). In other words, the mountains are primarily driven upwards to compensate for  the compression caused as materials at the surface of Io are pushed down, which is augmented by expansion caused by heating of the rocks as they approach the base of the lithosphere (Keszthelyi et al 2004). This is supported by the presence of patarae within the immediate vicinity of Ionian mountains; however, it is not certain which occurred first. The observed similarities in mass-wasting events seen between Ios mountains may suggest a similar mode of formation, and are observed in differing states of degradation. As Jaeger et al. (2003) point out, a large number (38 out of 92) of tectonic massifs are in contact with paterae which is approximately 60% more than is expected from a random distribution, which they estimate has a probability of 0.14% chance of occurring. Therefore, concluding that there must be a genetic relationship between Ionian mountains and paterae such that faults associated with mountain formation serve as conduits for magma ascent, and thus facilitate the formation of paterae around mountains.

- [Figure 1a](http://i.imgur.com/JJRhkOr.png): (a) One current post-Galileo model of volcanic processes and the interior of Io. 

- [Figure 1b](http://i.imgur.com/gvfIPTk.png): (b) Cartoon of a leading patera formation model. Silicate magma (red) ascends through solid silicate rock (black) but lacks the buoyancy to rise through a volatile-rich zone (dark blue) near the surface. The heat from the intrusion melts surrounding sulfur (yellow) and SO2 (light blue), which migrate into the permeable surroundings. Where SO2 is vaporized, it erupts on the surface, sometimes entraining sulfur. As this process continues, a caldera-like depression forms over the intrusion. If the silicate magma flux is sustained, it may become locally or completely unroofed, forming a dark lava lake. Diagrams after Keszthelyi et al (2004).

- [Figure 2](http://imgur.com/Jx5YVzt): The image on the left shows Monan Patera (top) and another patera (bottom) at either end of a crescent shaped mountain (15.4_N, 104.0_W). Monan Patera is a green-floored depression with red diffuse deposits along its margin. The patera to the south has a variegated floor with red, green, orange, and yellow patches. In the schematic diagram on the right, the solid black line is the bow that defines the curvature of the mountain, the dashed line connecting its ends is the bowstring, and the red arrow strung on the bow indicates the movement direction of the hanging wall during thrust faulting. The dashed lines and red arrows in the paterae indicate the senses of offset on and approximate positions of the shear zones that bound the thrust sheet (Jaeger, 2003).

	<TEXT> Nope, they're more alkaline / basic. This is the Nahanni Dehe Tufa Mound in the North West Territories. There are a lot of close geological terms to tufa, such as tephra (unconsolidated ash, bombs, and other fragments) , tuff (lithified ash deposits), and travertine. While tephra and tuff are deposits of volcanic origin, travertine and tufa are sedimentary deposits of CaCO3 (calcium carbonate) precipitated out of solution and subsequently mineralized to form these deposits. Travertine is sourced from hot, hydrothermal sources (hot springs) while tufa is sourced from more ambient temperature, spring waters. 

As the spring water rises from depth the alkaline waters, supersaturated in CaCO3, undergo a reduction in pressure. This reduction in pressure promotes the degassing of volatiles such as CO2 which increases the pH of the system. Carbonate, CO3, solubility [decreases as you increase the pH](http://www.chem1.com/acad/webtext/solut/solut-images/geocarbsystem_aq.png) of the system and thus precipitates out of solution. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> One is not bad while the other is good, they both have their benefits. Your chest acts to pull your arms, while your triceps act to extend your forearm (chest = pull, triceps = push). If you want to place more focus on the triceps, perhaps you have a sticking or weak point in the movement, then keeping your elbows closer to your body will place more emphasis on the triceps simply due to the mechanics. The close or narrow grip bench press is considered the go-to exercise for improving tricep strength, much like the squat for legs. Having your elbows out places more emphasis on your chest (pectorals) as you are no longer acting to extend your forearms as much (ie. pushing motion, increasing the angle between your bicep and forearms) but rather acting to pull your elbows inwards, towards the centre of the chest as your arms move forward. Just keep in mind that there are many different styles of push up / presses that each have their own benefit, and in some cases, their cons as well. For example, he states early on in the video to essentially roll your shoulders forward at the top of the push up - while this may be okay for some, for others it may not be due to shoulder impingement, and I certainly would stay away from transferring that motion from your pushup to your bench press as the chances for injury will be higher with more added weight. 

My recommendation is to try what feels best for you, because that's likely what works best with your bodies mechanics. Note that this doesn't necessarily mean it's easier. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The Loch Ness monster is, geologically speaking, impossible. 

[How The Earth Was Made S01E04 Loch Ness](http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x1l5ei5_how-the-earth-was-made-s01e04-loch-ness_tv)

TL;DW: The present day Loch Ness is about 10,000 years old and dates from the end of the last Ice Age (which lasted more than 20,000 years). During that age, the Great Glen was occupied by a huge glacier. This glacier easily eroded the Great Glen fault which accounts for the great depth of Loch Ness to 182m (600ft) below sea-level. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Although I can only speculate, I would lean in favour of an analogy that can be seen on [Earth, and Mars](http://epod.typepad.com/.a/6a0105371bb32c970b0120a5044cfa970b-550wi) in periglacial environments (*geomorphic processes that result from seasonal thawing of snow in areas of permafrost, the runoff from which refreezes in ice wedges and other structures*) called patterned ground. [Here](http://image.slidesharecdn.com/13-landforms-100606143512-phpapp01/95/13-landforms-4-728.jpg?cb=1275834981) is a simple diagram that depicts how one such pattern may develop. On Pluto, I would assume that there is some sort of shallow convection driving and generating these patterns. The dark regions may simply be regions of a less uniform surface, or perhaps, being older it has been irradiated by solar radiation for a longer duration (or perhaps both).

	<TEXT> I responded to a similar question in another thread ([here](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/3bjs87/superearths_are_not_a_good_place_for_plate/csn3kid?context=10000)), so I'll just copy   paste my comment here for you in hopes that it will provide you with further insight:

It's somewhat two fold. Firstly, [you need water for plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm), and water also acts as a medium in which to transport elements. Plate tectonics themselves are not necessary for life to develop; for example, life on Earth began prior to [3.5 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean_life_in_the_Barberton_Greenstone_Belt) while the onset of plate tectonics occurred roughly [3 billion years ago](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html). However, while plate tectonics is not *necessary* for life, it certainly assists in the evolution of life. A contributing factor to the rising and falling (transgression / regression) sea levels relates to mid ocean spreading ridges. During times of relatively faster sea floor spreading rates, sea levels rise (and fall during times of slower sea floor spreading rates), and the oceans become dominated by a clacite chemistry ([calcite - aragonite seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CalciteSeasTable.jpg)). You can start to see how rising and falling sea levels, along with changing ocean chemistry would act to generate adaptive pressures for lifeforms to evolve under on long timescales. While we're at it, let's not forget that it promotes diversification as the plates move, continents accrete forming supercontinents (Pangea, for example), and pulling landmasses apart generating more shallow seas which in turn creates more room for life (carbonate reefs, etc).
More importantly; however, plate tectonics allows you to replenish the supply of elements to a number of systems on much faster timescales, and on global scale - as opposed to slower rates, and localized events that would be typical of a body in which there was tectonism, but no plate tectonics (all bodies have tectonics, including our [moon](watch?v=zDmEnjwAYIY), but only Earth is known to have plate tectonics). Plate tectonics also acts as a global thermostat (think CO2 draw down and the carbon cycle - silicate weathering, etc.). 

**TL;DR**: Plate tectonics is not necessary for life, but helps promote it through diversification, providing adaptive pressure (changes in ocean chemistry, etc.), acting as a global thermostat, and rejuvenating the supply of elements required by life.

EDIT: Though debated, there are theories that support plate tectonics on Mars not only early on in its geological past^[1](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/ngeo2474.html), ^[2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1250232/), but currently as well^[3](http://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ucla-scientist-discovers-plate-237303) .

Regarding the Kuiper Belt:

1) A region of space covering approx. 20AU

2) Relatively small remnant bodies (small mass)

3) Orbital periodicity / speed and inclination w.r.t. the ecliptic plane (10km/s which plays a large part with regards to timing)

With these three factors we can note that activity within the Kuiper Belt region must be relatively low.
___
Regarding the Inner Solar System:

1) A region of space covering approx. 3.2AU

2) Relatively small remnant bodies (asteroids, short term comets, dwarf planets) and the terrestrial planets

3) Orbital periodocity / speed and inclination w.r.t the ecliptic plane (20km/s, upwards of 50km/s)

4) [Perturbations from Jupiter](http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/villain-in-disguise-jupiters-role-in-impacts-on-earth/) (something the Kuiper Belt lacks)
___

While the Inner Solar System had a large degree of material accreted early on during the formation of the solar system, it still has a lot of activity, primarily because of (1), (3), and (4). The region is immensely tiny in comparison to the Kuiper Belt (3.2AU vs. 20AU), with much faster orbital speeds and small orbits. This means the probability of experiencing an impact event *must* be greater than those experienced in the Kuiper Belt. Lastly, and it's a big one, Jupiter sends innumerable bodies into the Inner Solar System by perturbing the Asteroid Belt. A simple reflection on how many asteroids impact the Earth and other terrestrial bodies should bode well to persuade anyone that activity within the Inner Solar System should be greater than that which occurs within the Kuiper Belt. Note that the low speeds, orbital inclinations, small size / low mass, and extremely large distances between objects are all unfavorable if you are trying to maintain a higher degree of activity in comparison to the Inner Solar System.

	<TEXT> Other way around.

Your statement contradicts itself. As the inner solar system has larger bodies, with more gravitational pull, they will be impacted more frequently (ie. have more craters) compared to the [Kuiper Belt](http://www.lunarplanner.com/Images/asteroid-orbits/dwarf-Kuiper-Oort.png) which is composed of smaller bodies (therefore having less gravitational pull towards one another) over a much larger distance than the inner solar system, with much larger orbital periods. The distance from the Sun to the Asteroid Belt is ~3.2AU while the Kuiper Belt spans a total distance of ~20AU with a mass of less than a tenth to less than a hundredth that of Earth. In other words, /u/hungry-ghost is correct. You would expect more impacts towards the inner solar system relative to the Kuiper Belt, especially as [Jupiter constantly perturbs the asteroid belt](http://www.astrobio.net/news-exclusive/villain-in-disguise-jupiters-role-in-impacts-on-earth/) sending material inward. 

Early on during the formation of the solar system, the inner solar system was chaotic - as the gas giants [migrated inwards, and then back out](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v475/n7355/fig_tab/nature10201_F2.html) (leading to the Late Heavy Bombardment), whereas the Kuiper Belt region should have been far less active. </TEXT>

EDIT: I should also state that while detection of multiple organic compounds have been made, I'm currently unaware as to whether or not comet 67P's CH4 isotopic signature has been determined (or if there are any capable instruments on board Philae or Rosetta in order to conduct such an analysis). Taking such measurements *might* be able to help discern as to whether or not the CH4 (and other organics) are biogenic or abiogenic in origin.

	<TEXT> Are there any papers you can direct me to that supports this? I'm skeptical with regards to the loss of habitat - sure there certainly was a good portion of inland sea area lost, but there was still a fair amount left along the continental shelves, and other regions around the globe. I'm also skeptical as to why their feeding location in the upper oceans would have been attributed to their extinction. The vast majority of motile marine life, throughout the Earth's history, is typically found within the photic zone. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Towards the late cretaceous seas were cooling down and shrinking, destroying the habitat of most of the last huge marine reptiles.

Can you expand on that? What were the Plesiosauria, and Mosasauridae habitats? By shrinking seas, I assume you mean [shallow and inland seaways](http://imgur.com/a/9mpQx)? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's certainly one of the reasons it's important for life, but not necessary for life as I discussed in my other comment. Lets say life uses 'x'. If life uses x until there is no more x left, where will it find more x? It can't, unless the source is replenished, which is achieved via plate tectonics. 

Plate tectonics helps to create massive mountain belts, pushing mountains upwards via thrusting and folding. Weathering breaks down the minerals and erosion carries them down streams towards basins, or the wind picks them up and transports them elsewhere (Loess). Typical elements include Mg, Fe, Al, Ca, Na, K, F, SiO2 with other sources coming from ore deposits (Cu, S, Zn, P, etc.). It should be noted that plate tectonics and ore deposits are very strongly linked, and even studied under the term '[metallogeny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metallogeny).' Certain [deposit types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ore#Classification) are only associated with certain processes, many of which could not occur without plate tectonics (or at least would be very, very unlikely) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's somewhat two fold. Firstly, [you need water for plate tectonics](http://records.viu.ca/~earles/subduction-water-oct01.htm), and water also acts as a medium in which to transport elements. Plate tectonics themselves are not necessary for life to develop; for example, life on Earth began prior to [3.5 billion years ago](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archean_life_in_the_Barberton_Greenstone_Belt) while the onset of plate tectonics occurred roughly [3 billion years ago](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html). However, while plate tectonics is not *necessary* for life, it certainly assists in the evolution of life. A contributing factor to the rising and falling (transgression / regression) sea levels relates to mid ocean spreading ridges. During times of relatively faster sea floor spreading rates, sea levels rise (and fall during times of slower sea floor spreading rates), and the oceans become dominated by a clacite chemistry ([calcite - aragonite seas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CalciteSeasTable.jpg)). You can start to see how rising and falling sea levels, along with changing ocean chemistry would act to generate adaptive pressures for lifeforms to evolve under on long timescales. While we're at it, let's not forget that it promotes diversification as the plates move, continents accrete forming supercontinents (Pangea, for example), and pulling landmasses apart generating more shallow seas which in turn creates more room for life (carbonate reefs, etc).
More importantly; however, plate tectonics allows you to replenish the supply of elements to a number of systems on much faster timescales, and on global scale - as opposed to slower rates, and localized events that would be typical of a body in which there was tectonism, but no plate tectonics (all bodies have tectonics, including our [moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDmEnjwAYIY), but only Earth is known to have plate tectonics). Plate tectonics also acts as a global thermostat (think CO2 draw down and the carbon cycle - silicate weathering, etc.). 

**TL;DR**: Plate tectonics is not necessary for life, but helps promote it through diversification, providing adaptive pressure (changes in ocean chemistry, etc.), acting as a global thermostat, and rejuvenating the supply of elements required by life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm not sure you understand the paper or what is meant by modern continental crust. Perhaps you do though, and I'm simply misinterpreting your point. Modern continental crust (not the position or shapes of modern continents) is vastly different in composition to older, more mafic (baslatic / komatiitic compositions) lavas. The significance is not in regards to the absolute age of any crust, however, but rather that a distinction between crustal types can be used to infer the onset of plate tectonics as is shown in [Fig.4](http://www.nature.com/ngeo/journal/vaop/ncurrent/fig_tab/ngeo2466_F4.html). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was hoping they would show focal mechanisms. Geophysicists plot the arrival of seismic waves, and can determine what type of motion occurred along a fault plane. If you ever visit the USGS earthquake page and click on '[moment tensor](http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/eventpage/us20002ejl#scientific_tensor)' under the scientific heading you will see a diagram (often termed as a beach ball diagram) that can be used to interpret and discern the type of motion along the fault plane. For example, as can be seen [in this diagram](http://all-geo.org/highlyallochthonous/wp-content/uploads/2010/07/focalmechs.png) each earthquake generates a unique solution. The shaded quadrants represent areas of compression while the white, or non shaded quadrants, represent areas of dilation or extension. Using the two hyperlinks provided you should be able to discern what type of motion occurred during the M7.3 EQ provided above.

One of the classic ways to distinguish seismic waves emanating from earthquake vs. seismic waves original from blasts, including underground nuclear tests, is that the energy from explosions is all directed radially outwards, while the initial pulse of energy from earthquakes is compressional in some quadrants, but dilatational in others. This means that for an explosive blast all quadrants would be shaded, or in other words, an explosion will appear to be fully compressed because an explosion pushes on every direction.

	<TEXT> This may seem somewhat counter-intuitive, but the larger the body the less pronounced the topographical features tend to be. That is to say, that the smaller the body is, the larger the relief can be. This is due to gravity, and it's why planets are spherical in shape while smaller bodies, such as asteroids, are less spherical. Gravity essentially limits the height of mountains by pulling everything towards the centre of the body.

On Mars, gravity is roughly 2.7 times weaker than on Earth. Thats the same factor by which Olympus Mons is higher than Everestabout 2.7 times. Less gravity equals less pressure on the base. So if you really want high mountains, go to the planet with the weakest gravity.

	<TEXT> Ceres appears to be differentiated into a rocky core and icy mantle, and may harbor a remnant internal ocean of liquid water under the layer of ice. The surface is probably a mixture of water ice and various hydrated minerals such as carbonates and clay. -[wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ceres_%28dwarf_planet%29)

Keep in mind that I'm not saying that magmatic activity couldn't result in this feature, but I do believe that it's highly unlikely given that the majority of evidence, thus far, points us away from such an origin. There's certainly a lot to learn.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That may be a rather problematic explanation in relation to traditional volcanism (ie. magma). It might be related to cryovolcanism or perhaps even a Pingo like formation. Perhaps, it is even just a structural feature (though this seems difficult to explain as well)...   </TEXT>
