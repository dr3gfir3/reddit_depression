	<TEXT> without left, right doesn't know how to fully define itself.  Polarity of opposites, its everywhere you look.  My belief is that at the point of death, the 'want' you feel will fall away, as it is an attachment of the ego, and the ego is physical.  Souls are only individual while we are alive; at the point of death, that little piece of soul rejoins a collective unconscious. What you now fret over will no longer be of concern.  

Memories are kind of a form of data, and data cannot be destroyed.  It can and will change forms.  Long after we are dead, 2 + 2 will still equal 4.  The next monkeys to start keeping track of their bananas will count 2 + 2 =4, no matter how they say it.  The data/information is still there.  The memories, they will still be somewhere, just maybe not in a way you've conceptualized.  

Conversations With God by Neale Donald Walsh is one helluva read.  It will blow your mind.  I highly recommend it.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> absolutely. sometimes, when you're trying to do something silly and get answers, like what is my crush thinking?  and the cards are vague, you'll throw 5 mock readings. they'll tell you nothing.  BUT....sometimes, you'll see a pattern in those 5 readings, that maybe doesn't make sense to you as to how to apply it to your life.  

Seven of Swords kept showing up, in all readings for myself and for two other people in 24 hours....I was explaining that the cards were ignoring everything else, and talking about this 'snitch theme'....sure enough, cops were actually knocking on her door as I was saying this to her.  Someone had snitched on her (she was a dealer).  So yeah, absolutely, that may be when messages get through the loudest.

And over time, you'll want to take notes as to the cards that enhance each other when falling next to each other....any 4 card next to The Chariot, especially reversed, can refer to being stalked.  Its loose, but worth noting when you come across them.

And when shuffling, and stray cards come flying out, leave them out. Consider them for what they are worth. </TEXT>

Having said that, omg there are thousands upon thousands to choose from.  My personal favorites are The Hermetic Deck and The Karmic Music Deck, although the cards are too big for my hands.  Its still my oldest most used deck of all time, and I have owned a lot of decks over thirty years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> First, you could cleanse it in a bowl of salt, or hematite. Still in its plastic, it should ground out any scattered energies you feel it may have collected.  English, Russian, Swahili....it doesn't matter.  Traditional cards' meanings will always translate.  
To learn the deck, even if you know the cards, I have been throwing down mock readings for nearly thirty years.  It helps you to learn the cards and to see patterns as they emerge. Take notes.  Collect definitions.  Every day.
Whichever spread you feel the most natural with, I recommend starting out with the Celtic Cross spread.  
Every day. Mock readings for imaginary friends, or for real ones.  Seriously. </TEXT>

They divided the group into two or three sub groups and put us in the cells, and hit the lights.  During that time we were told about how the light did NOT come on during the guys punishment, I can't be certain but they kept them in that dark cell for a long ass time.....and there was no bed, no toilet.....just a hole in the floor like a drain.  The only light they saw was when food trays were slid through the 'mail' slot.  They told us that. They showed us that.   

we spent 45 seconds in the dark....it was an eternity.  I couldn't see my hand in front of my face at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The girl I know that was an early onset schizophrenic is my grandsons' mother, I've known her for a while now.  She has spoken to me on occasion about her childhood, and as well my son has told me of things.  She's incredibly intelligent and talented artist, she also has epilepsy. Her belief systems I would say venture into spiritual realms.  Demons, to be exact.  She was brought up in an extremely religious environment, one of which she does not subscribe to.  Whether or not it has influenced her belief systems, I don't think it did, she found this on her own at a young age.  Full blown hallucinations as a child that described her grandmother crawling along a wall, defying gravity, with eyes that glowed red.  She knew it wasn't her grandmother, she told me, because grandma's eyes did not glow red like that.....by exclusion
this must mean grandma defies gravity and crawls along walls. (She just might, lol, woman scares the bejabbers out of me)

It probably doesn't help much, thought I'd toss that in tho.

	<TEXT> I may have come across as a skeptic, I didn't mean to.  Its just that I have experience with one person who was, indeed, suffering from pediatric schizophrenia.  It started out much as described.   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thank you, someone else just suggested that.  I don't think it was long exposure, but I can't be certain.  First time I've heard of that, as I'm not a studied photographer at all. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think it was someone obsessed, who had found an isolated location by which to express themselves...whether its Amie, proper name, or 'amie', French word for friend. And yes, got a lot excited with some spray paint.  I'm glad I'm not Amie.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are there other 'symptoms' present, like rocking back and forth? This could be, albeit rare, pediatric schizophrenia.  Especially if the sightings persist and escalate.

Probably not, but this does happen in children that young.  Behavior becomes more erratic as time goes on.  

Children are more open to these paranormal experiences, I believe, as they are not bound by cultural taboos and social norms. It is probably not early onset schizophrenia, but it is something to keep in mind so as to elimination.   </TEXT>
