	<TEXT> Nah, they surely are way less rude and try to not focus around the "wymeen are bad" side like RPers do, but that's probably because they try to prove they're "unicorns"... like on the text I mentioned there. lol

EDIT: in a way, they remind me of a traditionalist aunt of mine: can be a sweetie with you, but has some views that can be a huge bother considering how they think you should follow them, too :P </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's amazing how they think it's their right to feel angry at their wives for no reason at all (or, more bluntly, for *being women*), but if his wife gets upset at an almost surely offensive joke she has no right to and has to shut the hell up and take it silently.

Such equality. Much respect. Wow.

	<TEXT> Here we have the option to do an ultrasound and simply ignore that. Lots of women here have asked to "not know" the gender of their children beforehand in fear of the father being pissed off.

In fact, some of the people who do that and are told to "hide" the kid's gender will often lie to the father about "not being able to see the gender of the baby" if they ask on such occasions. My mother's side of the family had a bunch of women doing that; my grand-uncle, as an example, always viewed girls in a not-so-great light, as well as people with physical disabilities... and his second child was a girl with a defficiency on her legs and hips. She can barely walk alone without feeling pain on her spine. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You know, if she's already aware of his views on women, she could damn well have lied about forgetting the test in fear of it being a girl. 'Cause you know, one thing I myself saw a lot on women who went to completely submissive states is wishing a different destiny to their female children... which unfortunately didn't happen very often because of her submissiveness to these kids' father who teached them "how to 'behave'". </TEXT>

Except if the guy's one of those troo speshal snooflaeks. Then he probably does in only ten.

Now, for the real question you made: he's a Terp. Do I need to say anything else? Especially considering that they advocate for "doing your thing and not caring if she cums or not" which, much probably, means that they cum way before their own partners? </TEXT>

And I honestly think you should do the same. Don't waste your time fumbling around here if you're going to be expecting us to argue so you'll try to "amused mastery" your way out.

	<TEXT> I have the feeling he's hiding a lot of stuff on this story...

Also, if there's one thing I learned by having stairs at home, that'd be that if you'd need to go up and there's someone large going down, you *won't* be able to pass on the small space. Rather, you'll have to push yourself against the wall the most you can to wait 'til the person passes so you can finish the set of stairs, so...

Anyway, since when asking for slippers you forgot on the room is a shit test? Bloody hell, man, that's something me and my brother would do to each other constantly *simply because we forgot something upstairs*. Nothing wrong about that. I'd go get his stuff on his room if I was going upstairs and he wasn't and he would get mine if he also was going upstairs and I wasn't. It's such a simple task. </TEXT>
