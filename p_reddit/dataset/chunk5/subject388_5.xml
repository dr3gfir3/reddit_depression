	<TEXT> That could be totally true. I just don't make important decisions when I'm mad. I used to have anger issues and that was one thing I learned that helped me a lot. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Honestly? I hope that baby dies. I know that's not something you're supposed to want, I know that makes me horrible, but I hope she drowns that little fucker in chardonnay and it dies.

Edit: I totally understand that this is a fucked up thought to think. I don't like the fact that I want this. I'm not proud of the fact that I hate that kid. I don't think its a morally defensible feeling but its the only one I have right now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying not to decide if I want to divorce her yet. Right now it feels like I do, but I'm also angry. Couples work through this kind of thing sometimes?

If I don't divorce her I'm going to tell her she has to get an abortion or I'm leaving. I would resent that little fucker so bad. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm trying not to decide on divorce until I'm calmed down. A lot of couples work through this kind of stuff, right?

If I don't divorce her I am going to tell her if she wants me to stay she has to have an abortion. There's no way I could not hate that baby. </TEXT>
