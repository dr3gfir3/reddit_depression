	<TEXT> I met him at a tradeshow in Las Vegas, he was at the Mangria booth.

I came over to say Hi to him, he asked if i wanted a picture and i said no because I knew he was busy and didnt wanna take his time. He insisted and had August take it while he put his arm on me. I apologized for not having the camera app open and he laughed (this was around the time he was complaining how everyone had a different app and it took forever to take pictures

Was pretty cool 9/10. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think its nice when companies offer it. I dont think it makes sense to make it a law. In my opinion, when you provide labor for a company they are supposed to compensate you with a pay check. Why does a business owner have to pay a salary and give up the business to his employees? What is in it for people to do that?

In regards to communism, this is exactly what communism is! And have you ever considered *why* it is that communism never works out? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Let me ask you a question: how much money should a person pay in taxes when they make a billion dollars? 500 million? 900? When is it going to be enough taxes? The sad truth is no matter how much the government takes from rich people, it wont help you or I one bit. All it will do is cause capital flight. Even in communist countries where everyone pays 100% tax and gets welfare, *everyone* is poor </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are probably suggesting that owners and investors are the same, i would obviously have to agree. 

I guess I see investors as a bank or angel who funded the bagel shop on the corner with $50k, the owner is the guy who also put in $50k but is sweating behind the counter and feels responsible for his 4 employees that need to get paid on friday. Thats the average business in America, is it not? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> R/personalfinance is great, these deals function much like REITs do, that sub will set you well on your way. 

One thing tho, alot of what I know and do is a direct result of what my father did. While he didnt give me money, he did give me the opportunity to grow wealth in a manner not usually available to the average person. You usually need a high net worth to invest in these projects. So in some ways, liberals are correct when they say that it matters who your parents are. On the other hand, when my dad got to to America he was sweeping floors in an electronics store in NYC, so take everything with a grain of salt.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can only speak to my experience and my dads. I am not privy to anyone elses financial info. 

We *most definitely* take advantage with deductions but you need to understand these are legitimate and for anyone to use. 

For example, I gave almost $15k to charity in 2016, my dad gave way more, why shouldnt we itemize for that deduction? If the average person is too poor to give as big of a percentage to taxes as I did, would you prefer to penalize me so I wont donate?

In regards to investments, we own shares in multifamily as well commercial developments in the US. We typically receive a K1 every year showing we had a loss on the property. This allows us to write off profits we did receive from other deals. The final year of the investment is when we sell the property and we have a huge profit on record. What most people get confused by is they think this erases the tax burden on profits when it actually is *deferred*, the government understands you may have had a loss this year but they will definitely take whats coming to them as soon as you have a profit. 

Feel free to keep asking questions, i will amswer as best i can </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While I agree with the basic principles, I believe you are mistaken on a couple of points. Islam didnt regress in the 12th century because of takers. Their cities and kingdoms were absolutely obliterated by yhe Mongol Invasions. Imagine a territory from the Chinese coast of the Pacific stretching all the way to Aleppo in Syria. The Mongols killed and raped everything in between. Many historians believe that Baghdads population didnt recover to pre-Mongol levels until the *early 1900s*. Population centers in Afghanistan are still being dug up. Turkey and Iran were rekt as well. There is no question that European dominance in the last couple hundred years is related to the damage the Mongols did to China and the Islamic world. 

In regards to Givers, Takers and Destroyers you are absolutely correct. The Givers in the ME were all killed by mongol Destroyers in the 1200s. The Roman Empire was destroyed by letting in all the Takers who used to be Destroyers (Germanic barbarians like the Goth and Vandals) </TEXT>
