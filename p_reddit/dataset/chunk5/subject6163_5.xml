Here\s what went down, I sucked off my cousin. I was 12 at the time, he was well..young. 

I got caught when he asked em to do it again in front of my sister, who then told everyone. I then sucked him off again, and got caught by his mum. 

I hate family gatherings now, and am sure everyone talks about me since this incident.  </TEXT>

It started out fine, we hung out at the mall, then went out for a walk through town. I ended up meeting her parents and her dog (who bit me.) Went shopping and got chips and some pop, then went to a local park and had a picnic, everything was perfect and we started making out. 

Then time was getting late, and I had to leave, so I got a ride back to my place. Little did I know it would be the last date I was on with her. She dumped me a few days later.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I'm sure many have been told "don't do it" or "it gets better". Well that's not exactly what a suicidal person wants to hear, in their mind they are already gone.

Instead take them out for coffee, and listen to them. Find out why they are suicidal, did a parent or friend die, did they fail a test? What's making them want to end it?

If you feel like they aren't listening to you, or wanting to be alone, dont let them be as thats when they will most likely try.

**Note** I am not a doctor, I am just giving advice on what has helped me personally. </TEXT>

They had blocked off the street and didn't allow anyone on the street.
After a few hours they arrested a family of drug dealers and then left.

Seems everyone is just shouting at everyone, and rumors are spreading daily.

How about we all just sit down and wait for a jailbreak, none of these threads do anything, except bring out the worst in the community. </TEXT>
