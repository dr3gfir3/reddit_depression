	<TEXT> I actually bought the NRC Fender Eliminator Kit as soon as I bought my Thruxton. It's been about 6 months and they work fine. It makes taking the seat off a little bit more difficult but they look great and they're very bright. Plus if you google discount codes for NRC you can snag a pretty sweet promo code. Right before I bought mine I got like 30 percent of the total order. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I live in south Florida so the majority of roads around me are all grids. A few hours up north is nice though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Super jealous. I'm from Delaware originally but since I've had my Thruxton I've been in Florida. I miss the winding roads like those. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Am I the only person who that it was really bad? I love PTA and Joaquin Phoenix but the movie just seemed to drag on. Even the book IMO wasn't that great. </TEXT>
