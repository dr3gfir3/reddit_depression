	<TEXT> Not sure how the rest of the world deals with it, but if you think about how many dead people there are (and how many are still to come) it's impossible to give every single one their own gravesite.

When you stop paying for the plot they dig up the remains, store them with all the other exhumed remains and then re-bury them in a designated mass-grave or cremate them. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Just a little update to those of you that talk of respect and letting the dead rest:

I'm not sure if you are aware of this, but when someone is buried, after the coffin is lowered and people have left, they use an excavator to crush the coffin before filling in the grave to prevent it from collapsing later.

Here you also only own a grave for 20/25 years (unless someone keeps paying for you plot. If not, you'll be exhumed and the remains cremated. Exhumation also occurs if a relative is laid to rest in the same plot as a familiy member that passed before them.

I do not feel photographing dead bodies is disrespectful. They were not disturbed in any way, just immortalized. I know this is a touchy subject, but if you guys knew what goes on in morgues/graveyards, you wouldn't call what I do disrespectful...

Thanks. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sure. This is under a church in southern Norway. Wealthy people were buried in a small crypt directly below the altar. The little girl is simply known as the Little Princess. The crypt has been sealed since 1973, but if I'm allowed access I'll post more photos. For those interested, the church is called Oddernes Kirke. </TEXT>
