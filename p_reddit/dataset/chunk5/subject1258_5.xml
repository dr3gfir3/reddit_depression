	<TEXT> Hi guys,
My friend does read, but not often. She is a very mature put together type of person and loves romance. Doesn't really read YA but I feel like she would enjoy some of the more mature ones. I'm deciding between three books right now:
1) Darkfever -Karen Marie  Moning
2) Dragonfly - Julie Golding
3) The Graceling - Kristin Cashore 

Votes? Any other opinions?

Another one that just popped to mind is Anna and The French Kiss </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This literally JUST happened to me.

My boyfriend of almost 2 years just broke up with me overnight saying he was so stressed out with work and trying to find a job that he couldn't do this relationship anymore. It was just adding on  to the stress. I feel like my heart has been torn out. He was my best friend and made me laugh and smile like no one else could.
I've just been sitting her all morning eating chocolate. 

I just called up a bunch of  my friends and told them "hey, here's what's going on. Can we meet up. I don't want to be alone." They all readily agreed. The first week is always the worst, or so I've been told.

If you ever need someone to talk to, let me know. Maybe we can help each other out. Lots of love and support.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> lip blams in general are good moisturizers if used around 3 times a day or less.However, if used too much, they dry out your lips and your lips become dependent on them for moisture. Also, your lip skin cells have trouble regenerating. The progress becomes slow.  Right now I usually can't go more than half an hour without lip balm without my lips cracking, peeling etc. That is why i'm trying to get out of the addiction.   </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> At first it started well. Everyone told me to use coconut oil and my lips felt so nice. Starting on day 5 they just started peeling and hurting like crazy. My lips feel so tight it's hard to smile. I want to give up and use chapstick. Will they ever be soft again!? Will they ever stop peeling? How much exfoliation till all this dead skin is gone! I know this all takes time, but it's driving me crazy. Ahh. End Rant. 

Edit: With a lot of the information you guys have given me, I guess my status has changed more to, how do I get my lips healthy enough to only be using lip balms only 3-5 times a day. I'm still going to try for this goal and stick with shea butters and oils. It just seems that this is so impossible with the way my lips are  now. I'm so afraid they'll bleed and crack forever! </TEXT>

Sperm have to swim quite a ways to even get to the egg after being inserted into the vagina. In addition, they are pretty weak in terms of temperature variation and die very quickly if outside the body. Hope that helps relieve your worries!  </TEXT>

my equation is:  (x) (.015 + x)/ (2.00-x)(2.00-x) = 10

Now I know I need to get this into quadratic equation form...but when I factor it out i get  .015x + x^2/ x^2 - 4x + 4

...so that being the case, I'm getting stuck on how to get it into the ax^2 + bx + c form with two x^2s that should (in my mind cancel out.) once ik what to do, then I can solve on my own! </TEXT>

At the same time I feel a little bad for the mother. Yes, the kid is a brat. But what if SHE was having a bad day, and just wanted her kid to shut up. You can't force your  kids to behave. You can try your damned hardest to discipline them and hope they learn, but sometimes there are just some honest to god annoying kids. Now she has to listen to this stupid kid wine his head of forever.

Despite me feeling a little bad for the mother, I'm still really happy the kid didn't get the pie. Fuck him. 

PS- i was a terrible kid and made my mother suffer humiliation and embarassment wherever she took me. I feel bad for her. </TEXT>

Though it was selfish of husband to only bring home dinner for 2- you admitted to your mistake and and he went and cooked it for them the next day.  Everyone makes mistakes. Just remember, even if they are your parents, manners still count!!

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> Hey guys, gotta rant.
So, my parents usually pay my university fees. Ofc, I  offered to pay them here at school but they said no I wasn't responsible enough to pay  (all the while bitching about the credit card fee they have to pay b/c i "refuse" to pay at school.)

Times comes where I'm taking summer classes at a different university and I'm asked to pay the fees. I email the department and ask when they are due. They tell me the day classes start is the first day of fees.

So, I go to pay- and yet again my parents tell me I'm not allowed and they'll pay from home. So then they see a late fee of 2 months and start yelling at me about why i didn't know it was due at the beginning when I registered just like my primary university. I calmly explain that I wouldn't know since they deemed me to irresponsible to be worthy of that knowledge and they never let me pay. So, how would I know??

But no - i'm too irresponsible too pay and i'm also more irresponsible because I didn't know. 
Now they are checking my credit card statements EVERY DAY. And asked my why I had to buy a can of coke today when I had a late fee of 90 dollars. Don't I feel guilty? 

Edit: sorry, I spelt "you're" wrong in the title.  
And i'm not working for the next two months b/c my schedule can't fit it and the place is closed for renovations till fall.

tl;dr: I just want to learn to control my financial account; but I'm too irresponsible for that, and I'm even more irresponsible when I try for the first time because I don't know how. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2014-07-07 00:23:05 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have two questions here that i'm just NOT getting the right answer to.

Edit: My work shown:
 
1. what is th emole ratio of benzene (C6H6) to n-octane in the vapor above a solution of 10% benzene and 90% n-octane by mass of 25 degrees C. Vapor pressure of n-octane and benzene at 25 degrees C. are 11 torr and 95 torr respectively.  The answer is supposed to be: 1.4

work: converted 10 g  -- mol:  10g x 1mol/78.11 = .128 mol C6H6
same thing for n-octane: 90 g x 1mol/114.23 = .7878

Then took .128/(.128 + .7878) = .1395
 and: .7878/(.128 +.7878) = .8602

.1395(11torr) + .8602(95 torr) = 22.739 torr.  ---- I thought that was the answer



2.  If the  boiling point of a sample of formation of H2O is 2.3 degrees C. above the boiling point of pure water, what is the molality of dissolved particles in the sample.
Answer is supposed to be 4.4 m.

Work:   2.3 degrees Celcius/m  x .52 m = 1.196 m.    -- what i thought the answer was

Thanks so much! </TEXT>
