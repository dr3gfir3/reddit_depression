	<TEXT> I wanted to read the mistborn series, just to find out that it is not translated and *of course* the english versions can't be found in library. Then I saw people recommending the Stormlight Archives in here and nope, can't find that either. 

Well today I had nice suprise to see that *The Wheel of Time* series is fully translated and all 25 (apparently the translations were bigger books so most of the english books have been split into 2 or 3 parts) are found in my local library! 

Anyone else have to deal with this problem? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Are you a troll or do you really think *Zenimax Online Studios* makes the main series?

If you're not a troll: ZoS is the studio that makes ESO and Bethesda is the studio that makes the main series. Both companies are under the Zenimax umbarella. Just like Arkade studios for example that made Dishonored 

EDIT: *Also* I know its a matter of opinion, but I think ESO is a fantastic game. Been playing it for 2 years and its the only mmo I have played and most likely ever will play </TEXT>

I don't see whats so funny about this *Oh look at these people making racist slurs and me reacting to it hahaha* humour. It's too obvious and unfunny imo. Same way that South Park is.

not specifically attempting to get attention. Seeing as how he's already the most popular YouTube personality

True, but I see these types of attemps at humour and shocking things his way to trying to stay that way and relevant. Just like youtube channels that use clickbait titles and "youtube drama" channels. All his videos now need is GONE WRONG and GONE SEXUAL in the titles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is a textbook battlemage. Defencive and healing magic. Nature magic exists, can't remember the name but there was book in morrowind that mentioned some kind of bosmer druid-type healer. Cryomancers/frostmages have been in every game since Morrowind and summoners too. 

I don't see how this would break the lore. I don't think "Warden" is very good name for this class (doesn't really fit the description of the class) but from lore perspective this isn't any different from templar. Blood magic didn't exist before ESO either yet nighblades have it.

This game is expanding the lore just like Morrowind, Oblivion and Skyrim did. In Oblivion your magica restored over time. It didn't work like that in Morrowind and there are several books in the games that say that magica doesn't restore over time, was that lore breaking for you? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I've been playing NB tank (argonian) for around 6 months now and I really like it. I got 350cp and recently I've been having problems tanking. I couldn't even tank vCoS today. My stats are around 20k magicka, 27k health and 18k stamina (buffed) and for some reason I'm having trouble with tanking. 

I'm using 4x alkosh (trying to get a ring so I'll have 5), 2x bloodspawn and 5x ebon (Tava's favor for basic dungeons). I don't really know what my problem is, I get one shotted by bosses, run out of stamina (this doesn't happen too often, siphoning strikes is bomb).

Anyone else play NB tank? I have used alot of gold on this build, on gear and respeccing and I really like playing tank so it is very frustrating that it doesn't work. </TEXT>

Haven't tried this one but [here's Venom by Alcast](http://alcasthq.com/venom/) if you want to play stamina dps. All are PvE builds. Mag DK is very different from sorcerer so it might get bit getting used to. But it is very fun and powerfull magicka character for PvE </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Returning to this game (played last time around 2 years ago) and for some reason on my lvl 29 shadow I can't have 2 different skill bars. I created my first skill bar for my dual wield weapons, then swapped to my bow bar and equipped some bow skills etc I want on that bar and when I swap back to my DW bar its exactly the same. Whats the point of weapon swap if I can't have 2 different ability bars?

	<TEXT> I once woke up and I was *really* mad at my brother. He was staying with me for few days when he had some work in the town I lived in and he was sleeping on my couch. Well he left for work before I woke up and whole day I was super mad at him no idea why. I probably would have kicked him out if he had been there in the morning when I woke up.

Well in the evening when he came from work he told me that I had been sleepwalking the previous night and when he had told me to go back to bed I gad yelled "**FINE**" and gone back to bed. That was apparently the reason I was mad at him. So fucking weird. It's hard to tell the difference between real and dream sometimes </TEXT>

	<TITLE> My favorite description of Gandalf </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2017-02-08 19:17:55 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> *Gandalf was shorter in stature than the other two; but his long white hair, his sweeping silver beard and his broad shoulders, made him look like some wise king of ancient legend. In his aged face under great snowy brows his dark eyes were set like coals that could leap suddenly into fire*

For some reason I always liked this description. It gives very different picture of gandalf that we've heard so far in the book. Kinda gives the idea that even thought Gandalf is seen as a lonely grey wanderer, by most there is hidden power in him. Especially since it shows even next to Glorfindel and Elrond. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh man that sucks. On pc we usually disable pets to get the most out of raids and I usually turn down my settings from high/ultra to medium to get most fps but tbh there isn't much problems. And I don't even have super beefy pc.

But crashes are very common in trials on pc too. Last saturday on Veteran Maw of Lorkhaj during our 6 hour raid I crashed twice and I think we had around 6-7 crashes/losing connection overall for people in the raid </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay this isn't exactly the same but I can give some insight. I worked few summers planting trees and summers were hot 20+ celcius but we still wore pretty heavy clothing. It was basicly for 3 reasons

1. Mornings were cold as hell. Before the sun rose high it was pretty cold so it was important to wear long sleeves and even layers

2. Sun is a real bitch. You really need to cover yourself up and I'd imagine in wild west it would have been even worse

3. Mosquitos and other bugs. This depends alot on area and tbh I have never been to american west so don't know how big problem bugs are there but they sure are real problem. One day wearing a t-shirt and your arms and upper body would be pretty much covered in bites </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I have never played this type of more "traditional" rpg's. Mostly action rpg's like Elder Scrolls, Witcher and Dragon Age series. I want to play more story driven rpg where decicions really make difference to the games world. I love fantasy books which is why I'd love to play more story driven games. </TEXT>
