	<TEXT> Have you tried changing your environment? I felt the exact same until I moved to Washington, then it was like a new surge of want! Seeing the same thing/ people your whole life I feel like can contribute to that mindset. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Flat out being 17 sucks! I remember I had never felt more stress in my life then 17-18. I didn't get it, they teach you so much random stuff in school but never teach you how to manage yourself. I'd say do something you can invest time into. Maybe something you and your mom can do together. I'm not sure how I got over my mind at that age I just know I didn't feel "calm" for about a year. Try your best not to overthink too, I know it's hard but that was my worst enemy going through stress/ confusion. </TEXT>
