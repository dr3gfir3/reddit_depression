	<TEXT> That's okay! No worries, haha. I'm gonna scope things out more before I make a move. More likely than not I won't do anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, I meant I walk 5 miles during a shift. I'm in retail in a shoe department, and we're not allowed to sit during our shift unless we're on break. We have to go to the back to get shoes for customers and our stockroom has two floors. It's more walking than you'd think. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> More items are tagged at Nordstrom Rack - even shoes, which we don't do at my store. From my own experience, Nordstrom Rack employees don't earn commission so they are less eager to approach a customer. I've never seen an employee on the floor in the Nordstrom Rack I go to. Nordstrom Rack is smaller and has almost no shelves which makes it hard to conceal anything. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I moved out of my parents' home 4 months ago because I was being abused severely, both physically and emotionally. When I left, I was homeless and crashed on several couches until I could finally afford an apartment (I moved in two days ago.) I shoplift groceries and necessities, and sometimes more expensive things to sell for money. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No problem! I'm glad she's enjoying these too. Lol. Sometimes they'll just be RFID tags you can just peel off but now they also have these weird tags that beep in low light or in response to any motion. Watch out for those. They're easy to spot though. </TEXT>
