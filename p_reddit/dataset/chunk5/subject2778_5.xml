	<TEXT> I used to do a similar thing. I would take the apple, make the first bite, then proceed to scrape the flesh into a pulp. I would do this all the way around the apple, without breaking the skin, until I had eaten all the 'apple sauce', leaving the core standing like a stalactite pillar in the centre, with a cave of apple skin on the outside. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. Farming dungeons (esp in BC) is really quick levelling. You can get past most of Outland just by doing a few dungeons, with 1-5 filler quests in between.
2. As above, but with the addition that if you do a full run of Hyjal, it can get you close to 83 (with 1 or 2 dungeons possibly thrown in). I ran it on a fresh, no heirlooms character about 3 weeks ago, and Cata flashed past in no time at all.
3. Pandaria doesn't take that long any more. I hit 87 just as the Jade Serpent storyline hit Sha territory, then Kun-Lai, and finished in Dread Wastes. Supplemented with a few dungeons, it really doesn't take long at all.  
Personally I find WoTLK levelling most annoying, but that wasn't so bad this time around for me. Seemed to be fairly quick. I guess (unfortunately) you might just have to grin and bear some of the most annoying levelling zones. The only other tip I can offer is make sure you're in a lvl 25 guild, so you get the 10% increased EXP. </TEXT>

One thing I must ask - what was your main reason behind picking the case? HAF cases are (at least to my knowledge) built for airflow, and you're water cooling your processor. (Not saying this is a bad thing, mind you, because they're huge) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's got much to do with piracy if I'm honest. I think console games prices are high because the publishers and developers have to compete with 3rd party resales of their games. Publishers expect to have recurring revenue for about 3-6 months of their game. If 20 people buy a game, but 30 or 40 people are playing it because of resale, that's 10 or 20 copies the company has lost out on. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is more like what I was looking for in a response, so thank you!  

Could you explain how the used games make new games more expensive? It doesn't seem to make sense to me. Surely the publishers and developers are meeting more sales targets, rather than games retailers taking this money? If a game changes hands in a store 2-3 times as a pre-owned game, the publisher sees none of that money.  
Also, with regards to the PS4, I don't see it as much better. They've just taken the opportunity of Microsoft being hated on to sweep some of their downsides under the rug. I am trying to remain as non-biased as possible, and am avoiding next-gen consoles at the moment. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Of course, you shouldn't bank on something like that. But I guess the question I'm asking here is why are PC games cheaper than consoles? The license fee can't be so astronomical that people have to pay 10-20 more per game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I never said that Microsoft said they'd make games cheaper. Neither did I say that they would run a platform like Steam. I was offering the suggestion that, in time, due to the restrictions on trading games, more people would be buying the game first hand, and therefore the publishers may drop the price. I only used Steam as an example. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi there,
I recently upgraded my CPU and motherboard to squeeze out better gaming performance for my nVidia GTX660ti. Now, the 660ti's fine on temperature, it's often at around 60C under heavy load, which isn't a problem. What I'm concerned about is the high CPU temps I'm getting. I haven't checked it out on many other games, but I have a setting on CoreTemp to tab me out when it gets high, and it's been doing this on Deus Ex, BF3, and a few other games. Should I be looking for an aftermarket cooler?  
Thanks for your help </TEXT>
