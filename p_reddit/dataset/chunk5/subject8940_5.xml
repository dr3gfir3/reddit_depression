	<TEXT> My personal favorite?  Hercule Poirot series by Agatha Christie.  I'm also a fan of Martha Grimes and Anne Perry.  

Perhaps a little closer to Baldacci - Jeffery Deaver, Lee Child, Vince Flynn.

Another great book that isn't a detective story exactly but is a great mystery if The Thirteenth Tale by Diane Setterfield. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Because of loving Anne, I'd suggest LM Montgomery's Emily of New Moon series if you haven't gotten there.

You might also want to look at T. H. White's The Once and Future King

Any of Jane Austen's novels

Louisa May Alcott

To Kill a Mockingbird - Harper Lee

If you are willing to move away from classics...  take a look Maeve Binchy - they're sort of Anne-esque but intended for adults and set in modern day and I don't know how you feel about going in that direction. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is not a problem.  I have a program called ReaderWare that's more or less the same thing except you can use a barcode scanner, it will auto-populate from the websites of your choice (Amazon, etc).  It even has a lending library type option if you happen to allow people to borrow books from you.   </TEXT>
