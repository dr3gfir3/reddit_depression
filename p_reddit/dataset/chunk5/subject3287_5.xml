	<TEXT> Cull is the biggest giveaway noob trap right now. Deathcap is still one for mages, especially in a resistance stacking heavy meta. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I actually recall reading something in a visual design class about how the spacing in comic sans was also specifically designed to be easily digestable by kids, or even older people, with dyslexia so there's that too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I wasn't trying to imply he was the worst member of the team, just the least remarked upon. Keane did perform worse but people talked about him more because his anti-carry cheese schtick made him unique. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> His storyline is a fucking awesome underdog narrative, could be a movie plot, if you read it from start til now. He was bouncing around challenger for a couple of seasons before Curse Academy picked him up at the *last second* for the expansion tournament (a one-off qualifier mind you) to replace Cris after they failed to defeat CLG (by one game) in the relegation tournament. Rule changes then meant that CA had to be sold to an organization with minimal infrastructure, and while Gravity did decently all things given Hauntzer was generally regarded as the [worst top laner NA](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CJwsYB_UMAAWyLL.jpg:large) after his first split. In summer his team did better (only to come to a crashing fall) but he was overshadowed by teammates and generally only remarked upon for whiffing some clutch ults. But one person did notice the diamond in the rough, none other than someone he admired a lot - NA's most stalwart, but fading veteran Dyrus who just so happened to need a replacement and that's how Hauntzer found himself on NA's most iconic and arguably most successful team, a move that was met with a lot of negativity especially given aside from him TSM had assembled an all-star lineup. And now we've got this, the guy is possibly the best member of the team so far this season. Honestly you can't ask for a better script. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> While both can work it feels like the team (SKT) approach is better in the long run. Look what's happened to C9 and to a lesser extent FNC when the designated shotcaller has been taken out of the mix. </TEXT>
