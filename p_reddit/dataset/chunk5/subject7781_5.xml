	<TEXT> A few points about the FBI's decision (thus far) not to take Flynn's offer:

1. They may already have sufficient evidence of what he would tell them. Perhaps they believe they can get him to talk via a plea for a reduced sentence without total immunity.

2. They may still be negotiating or assessing what he knows and whether it's a worthwhile deal. He's one of the biggest fisha former three star general and national security advisorso they may not want to let him off the hook easily.

3. They may not think he has something worthwhile to tell them. This seems less likely.

Wrinkle:

Assuming they wanted to charge treason, they'd need two witnesses to each overt act constituting the offense. So some overlap in sources could still be useful.

	<TEXT> Federal courts have broad equity jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution and could use it to annul the election in the appropriate circumstances (foreign subversion with culpable participation by the current President)especially with Congressional participation in the process (such as authorizing a special election by amending the Presidential Succession Act).

From a prior post:


Suppose a Congressional investigation finds strong evidence of collusion with and possibly even direct funding by the Kremlin (which is currently [being investigated](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-dossier-claims-cia-2017-1)). ... This would fundamentally taint the election and would be the basis for begining impeachment proceedings.  But another track that could be pursued in parallel, or in the alternative, would be a lawsuit contesting the validity of the election itself.

First, you'd need to find someone with standing to sue. An obvious person would be any of the other candidates who took part in the electionespecially Clinton. There would be other persons with standing as well. But the key point is that this is the sort of "[case or controversy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/controversy)" that federal courts have jurisdiction to resolve.

[Article III, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2) specifies, in the relevant part that:

The **judicial power shall extend to** ***all cases***, **in law and** ***equity***, arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States...

[Federalist 83 (Hamilton)](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa83.htm) sheds further light on this broad and somewhat vague grant of jurisdiction:

"The **great and primary use of** a court of **equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules.**"

Here, fully resolving the specific controversyan election tainted by foreign interferenceand fashioning an equitable remedy might well require complete annulment of the original election.

Either the suit contesting the election works its way up to SCOTUS through the regular appellate process or it makes it there in some expedited fashionsuch as through an [extraordinary writ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1651) application. In any event, the Congressional findings could be introduced and judicially-noticed (including any supporting classified evidence under seal). Trump would have full due process and opportunity to oppose via an adversarial legal proceeding. Ultimately though, let's assume the courts were to decide against him.

In theory, that would vacate both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency and void any acts involving the President since the inauguration. It would also trigger the Presidential Succession Act (PSA), which provides directlyby statutefor who will "act as President" when there's no President and no Vice President.

...

There's [some precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_States\)) for passing legislation and involving the Supreme Court to resolve disputes about a Presidential election through extraordinary remedies. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes "won" the election against Samuel Tilden by 1 EV under a [negotiated compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877). **Hayes did not have a majority of the electoral vote until this compromise.** Tilden won an outright majority of the popular vote, not just a plurality. The margin was 3%the largest popular vote margin for an EC loser. This was possibly the most divisive election in American history. So it's not totally inconceivable that a bipartisan solution could happen here too if it's seen as being in both parties' interests.

The allegations and circumstantial evidence set forth a colorable case of treason against members of the Trump Regime. We've also been told that there's more than circumstantial evidence of collusion, but it hasn't yey been made public. 

"Potential", in this context, means simply that we don't know everything we would need to know to establish treason, and treason hasn't been charged and proved in a criminal proceeding. For all we know, there can be exculpatory evidence or insufficient evidence to prove any required elements of the crime.

There's nothing wrong with admitting this, and using the words "potential" or "alleged" to indicate it (unlike Trump supporters who branded Clinton a criminal without a trial). But, likewise, we don't have to refrain from discussing it until and if there a conviction.    </TEXT>

But it can't overturn a constitutional ruling. It can, at most, pass a deliberately unconstitutional law in the hope that it will lead SCOTUS to overturn its earlier interpretation of the Constitution.

	<TEXT> War isn't necessarily required. And I think there's a colorable case of treason to be made on this fact pattern without it.

The Constitution sets the outer limit of what can be considered treason at [Article III, Section 3](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section3), which provides:

----------

Treason against the United States, shall consist ***only*** [1] in levying war against them, *or* [2] in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort. **No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.**

**The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason**, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture ***except*** during the life of the person attainted.

----------

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, [1] levies war against them *or* [2] **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and **shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States**. (Emphasis and numeration added.)

---

Here, no one levied war against the U.S. (though some have called it an act of war), so we're left "adherence to the enemy, giving them aid and comfort"--a separate basis for treason.

Note that the key phrase "aid and comfort"which appears in both definitionshas a narrow, restrictive meaning. But it doesn't appear to require that Russia be a wartime enemy. In [*Cramer v. United States*, 325 US 1 (1945)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=2809896451252158562 q="18+u.s.c.+2381" hl=en as_sdt=2006), the U.S. Supreme Court explained that:

---

 Treason of adherence to an enemy was old in the law. It consisted of breaking allegiance to one's own king by forming an attachment to his enemy. Its scope was comprehensive, its requirements indeterminate. It might be predicated on intellectual or emotional sympathy with the foe, or merely lack of zeal in the cause of one's own country. That was not the kind of disloyalty the framers thought should constitute treason. They promptly accepted the proposal to restrict it to cases where also there was conduct which was "giving them aid and comfort."

**"Aid and comfort" was defined** by Lord Reading in the Casement trial comprehensively, as it should be, and yet probably with as much precision as the nature of the matter will permit: **[a]". . . an act which strengthens or tends to strengthen the enemies of the King in the conduct of a war against the King, that is in law the giving of aid and comfort"** *and* **[b] "an act which weakens or tends to weaken the power of the King and of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of the King and the country . . . is . . . giving of aid and comfort."** Lord Reading explained it, as we think one must, in terms of an "act." It is not easy, if indeed possible, to think of a way in which "aid and comfort" can be "given" to an enemy except by some kind of action. Its very nature partakes of a deed or physical activity as opposed to a mental operation.

**Thus the crime of treason consists of two elements: [1] adherence to the enemy; and [2] rendering him aid and comfort.** A citizen intellectually or emotionally may favor the enemy and harbor sympathies or convictions disloyal to this country's policy or interest, but so long as he commits no act of aid and comfort to the enemy, there is no treason. On the other hand, a citizen may take actions which do aid and comfort the enemy  making a speech critical of the government or opposing its measures, profiteering, striking in defense plants or essential work, and the hundred other things which impair our cohesion and diminish our strength  but if there is no adherence to the enemy in this, if there is no intent to betray, there is no treason. (*Numeration and emphasis added*.)

---

From this definition, it doesn't seem like a state of war is necessarily required, because aid and comfort also encompasses overt acts which "weake[n] or ten[d] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack the enemies of ... the country." 

The key term that would be litigated, I think, is "enemy," which isn't defined. Generally, that means you'd use the ordinary meaning. 

Merriam-Webster [defines enemy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enemy) as:

1:  one that is antagonistic to another; especially :  one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent

2:  something harmful or deadly alcohol was his greatest enemy

3

a :  a military adversary

b :  a hostile unit or force



Alternatively, you have the definition of enemy at [50 U.S. Code  2204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/2204), which states:

As used in this chapter [*i.e.*, [Chapter 39 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-39)]

...

(2) the term enemy means any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States;

(3) the term person means

(A) any natural person;

(B) any corporation, partnership, or other legal entity; and

(C) any organization, association, or group

By its own terms, this definition does not control uses of the term "enemy" in Title 18--only Chapter 39 of Title 50. But assuming this definition *did* control, the meaning of "enemy" depends on the meaning of the word "hostilities," which is not defined in the statute. 

So we'd again go to the plain meaning. 

Merriam-Webster [defines hostilities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostilities) as:

a :  deep-seated usually mutual ill will 

b

(1) :  hostile action

(2) hostilities plural :  overt acts of warfare :  war

2:  conflict, opposition, or resistance in thought or principle

Under either meaning of the term "enemy," but especially the first (non-statutory), it's not clear that Russia would be held *as a matter of law* NOT to be an enemy for purposes of treason. I haven't done a comprehensive overview of the caselaw on this issue, but I don't see anything in *Cramer* suggesting otherwise. If Russia isn't precluded as a matter of law from being an enemy, I think that there's a good argument to be made that emnity can be inferred from a factually intensive inquiry into the nature of the act itself--especially if we go with the first plain meaning of enemy as "one seeking to **injure**, **overthrow**, or confound an opponent." 

This understanding of enemy is consistent with the definition of aid and comfort as "weake[ning] or ten[ding] to weaken the power of the ... of the country to resist or to attack." And subverting an election for the highest federal office arguably meets this test--provided there was an explicit *quid pro quo* to secure illicit Russian campaign assistance (and possibly funding) in exchange for U.S. foreign policies desired by Putinincluding a weakening of NATO, the U.S.'s principal military alliance, and consequent impairment of the U.S.' ability to "resist or to attack [its] enemies."

The agreement to subvert our election would likely satisfy the "**adherence to the enemy**" element of treason (which could be further inferred from the delivery of pro-Putin policies detrimental to U.S. national security and use of the hacked information knowing that it was unlawfully obtained and disclosed under this illicit deal). Enacting pro-Putin policies and speaking favorably of Putin would likely satisfy the overt act of "**aid and comfort**" element. Russia has long been an adversarial power, and the hostile act of subverting our democratic election to promote its objectives and weaken our principal defensive military alliance would likely be sufficient to establish **emnity**. So if you had **two witnesses**, you might even be able to convict for treason in the strict [18 U.S.C.  2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) sense. 

Of course, as you noted, there are easier charges to bring.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> With Clinton, the Trumpistas took mere allegations as **conclusive proof** of her criminality, and ignored the *mens rea* requirement for the alleged criminal mishandling of classified information.

They don't get that the venue for providing proof is a criminal trial, and jumped straight to "lock her up!" Of course, Clinton was **never even indicted**, let alone convicted, of a crime. Rather, Comey declined to *refer* his investigation to the DoJ for prosecution (improperly editorializing in the process) after concluding that no criminal violations had occurred. 

They apply completely different criteria to their Orange God-Emperor. You need conclusive proof in order to *even discuss* his alleged misconduct. And if you afford the Orange One the presumption of innocence, by using words like "alleged," you're spreading fake news.

You'd think that *everyone* would see the hypocrisy behind this double standard. But unfortunately, that doesn't seem to be the case.

	<TEXT> I agree it may be easier, but I think it would be better for the country to effect the removal through an underlying substantive charge (*e.g.*, alleged treasonous subversion of the election) rather than charges related to the cover-up. If that can be done, it would put the removal beyond reproach. It's important that it beand be seen asa non-partisan action in defense of the Constitution.

Also, if removal is done via the underlying charge, there's a better chance that extraordinary remedieslike [annulment of the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/60yh2f/us_officials_info_suggests_trump_associates_may/dfahwbv)can also be sought. If there's anything that would warrant annulment, I think it would be procurement of the highest public office by fraud on the electorate in furtherance of a treasonous *quid pro quo* with a foreign adversary, as has been alleged.

All of this, of course, assumes Republican cooperation with the removal, which may not be forthcoming. 

This is where a treason indictment raises some interesting possibilities, because conviction bars the traitor from holding any federal office. Congress'  imposition of this baras a punishmentis constitutionally authorized, and thus would be distinguishable from the line of cases that says no additional qualifications can be imposed on federal offices defined in the Constitution.  

Therefore, at least in theory, a criminal conviction for treason could potentially remove someone from office *without* impeachment. We know Presidents do not have immunity from civil suits for acts outside the scope of their official duties. So, *a fortiori*, he arguably shouldn't have immunity from a criminal indictment relating to actions taken *before* he was even elected and which speak to the very legitimacy of that election. This matters because an indictment for treason wouldn't necessarily require Congressional cooperation or involvement (though committee findings of direct collusion would of course be very helpful).

Thinking out loud. Lots to consider and discuss.

	<TEXT> The President is under investigation for colluding with a foreign power. He is being investigated by an oversight committee, the head of which, Republican representative Devin Nunes, has functioned less as a watchdog than a lapdog, providing information about the investigation of Trump to Trump in a breach of protocol. And this was not Nunes only misdeed: he was also present at a January meeting  between Turkish officials and Trumps former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, who in February resigned in disgrace after being revealed to be working secretly for the Turkish and Russian governments for millions of dollars.

In short, the US has employed a president suspected of treason, an oversight committee head who refuses to do oversight, and a national security advisor who undermined US national security. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah, some biting and insightful comments:

I worked for Kushner for 18 months as he tried to infuse a much smaller institution than the U.S. government with cost-cutting impulses from the commercial real estate world. And my experience doesnt bode well for the Office of American Innovation. Not everything that works in the private sector is transferrable to the public sector  and even if it were, Kushner isnt the best person to transfer it.

...

He viewed investments in terms of opportunity costs. Why should I put more money into the Observer when I could invest in a software company? he would say. This is a legitimate question for any returns-driven investor. **But news media doesnt scale like software. You need people to produce content, at least until artificial intelligence becomes more sophisticated and sensitive sources are willing to trust a bot.**

**Why would you buy a newspaper if you expect it to scale the way software does?** Why assume that media and software have the same risk profile and dynamics? **Kushner would frequently point to a media company with a 60-person editorial staff and ask why our two-person desk wasnt producing as many stories or as much traffic.** Or hed argue, bizarrely and incorrectly, that because Gawker started with one person, that meant you didnt need head count to scale a media company. The Internet makes media more scalable, of course  distribution is unlimited and gained at little marginal cost. **But that doesnt mean a media company is just like Uber.**

**Cost-cutting is important in situations where there is excess, but it is not what catalyzes evolution; if the point here is to make government more effective, not just more efficient, cuts alone wont do it.** The Silicon Valley entrepreneurs Kushner has roped into helping him with the new office  such as Apples Tim Cook, Salesforce boss Marc Benioff and Tesla founder Elon Musk  would be the first to tell him that scale is important, and that growth is often a function of prioritizing R D investments. You prototype cheaply to get to a minimum viable product, but if you stop there, youre in trouble. You have to reinvest, constantly.

Lessons from Silicon Valley are even likelier to be misapplied in government than in media. Outside experts always groan that government institutions are running outdated systems that still rely on floppy disks, and that this is a function of some combination of government waste, idiocy and ubiquitous Luddite-ism. **But a more logical explanation is that systems upgrades require appropriations, many of which have been gleefully slashed by Congress. Theres also the problem of government pay, and the fact that the private sector has financial resources that the government does not.** Is it reasonable to expect speedy, high-quality upgrades when engineers are making $90,000 a year and implementations are often contracted out to the lowest bidder?

...

**I worry that this new office will be more of the same: a vanity project**, one that exists primarily to put Kushner in the same room with people he admires whom he wouldnt have had access to before, glossing government agencies in the process with a **thin veneer of what appears to be capitalism but is really just nihilistic cost-cutting designed to project the optics of efficiency**. If the outside experts have good advice, it will be heeded only where it reinforces what the administration would do anyway. **And anyone who volunteers to carry out the administrations agenda may be handed wholesale control of an area of government where their domain expertise isnt just low, but nonexistent.**

	<TEXT> The great thing is that the NYT  *literally* established the precedent that created the "**public figure**" **doctrine**the legal rule Trump likely wants to weaken. *See* [*New York Times v. Sullivan*, 376 U.S. 254 (1964)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10183527771703896207 q=376+U.S.+254 hl=en as_sdt=2006) (unanimous 9-0 ruling). *Sullivan* is a constitutional ruling interpreting the First Amendment, so it can't be overturned by Congress passing a law.  Any law that purported to do so would be unconstitutional. But Trump's SCOTUS appointments could errode and eventually overturn it.

Basically, the [**TL:DR**] is that you can libel a public figure if the defamatory statement is (1) **false** *and* (2) **made with actual malice** (at minimum, reckless disregard for the truth). 

Trump's birther and wiretapping lies probably meet this test, if Obama wanted to sue. The statements about the NYT and other attacks Trump has made on various companies might satisfy it as well. 

By contrast, what has been reported about Trump himself would almost certainly not be deemed libelous. This is why he made a lot of noise but backed down from his threats to sue the NYT during the campaign.

---------------

Here are some highly relevant cases following and refining *Sullivan*:

**An individual who decides to seek governmental office must accept certain necessary consequences of that involvement in public affairs.** He runs the risk of closer public scrutiny than might otherwise be the case. And society's interest in the officers of government is not strictly limited to the formal discharge of official duties. As the Court pointed out in Garrison v. Louisiana, 379 U.S., at 77 ... **the public's interest extends to anything  which might touch on an official's fitness for office.** . . . Few personal attributes are more germane to fitness for office than dishonesty, malfeasance, or improper motivation, even though these characteristics may also affect the official's private character.

Those classed as public figures stand in a similar position. Hypothetically, it may be possible for someone to become a public figure through no purposeful action of his own, but **the instances of truly involuntary public figures must be exceedingly rare. For the most part those who attain this status have assumed roles of especial prominence in the affairs of society. Some occupy positions of such persuasive power and influence that they are deemed public figures for all purposes.** More commonly, those classed as public figures have thrust themselves to the forefront of particular public controversies in order to influence the resolution of the issues involved. In either event, **they invite attention and comment.** 

Even if the foregoing generalities do not obtain in every instance, **the communications media are entitled to act on the assumption that public officials and public figures have voluntarily exposed themselves to increased risk of injury from defamatory falsehood concerning them.** No such assumption is justified with respect to a private individual. He has not accepted public office or assumed an influential role in ordering society. Curtis Publishing Co. v. Butts, 388 U.S., at 164 ... at 1996 (Warren, C.J., concurring in result). He has relinquished no part of his interest in the protection of his own good name, and consequently he has a more compelling call on the courts for redress of injury inflicted by defamatory falsehood. Thus, private individuals are not only more vulnerable to injury than public officials and public figures; they are also more deserving of recovery.

[*Gertz v. Robert Welch, Inc.*, 418 U.S. 323, 34445 (1974)](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=7102507483896624202 q=418+U.S.+323 hl=en as_sdt=2006).

-------


**Freedoms of expression require breathing space. ** .... This breathing space is provided by a constitutional rule that **allows public figures to recover for libel** or defamation **only when they can prove both that the statement was false and that the statement was made with the requisite level of culpability.**

[*Hustler Magazine, Inc. v. Falwell*, 485 U.S. 46, 52 (1988).](https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=5069891851949874011 q=485+U.S.+46 hl=en as_sdt=2006)

One other thing:

Right now, opposition to Trump seems mostly focused on the threshold question of his legitimacy. This is important. But we also need to put in the day-to-day work of beating him politically on basic policy battles. There have been so many unforced errors (*e.g.*, the unconstitutional Muslim ban, the rushed and ill-conceived AHCA, the eviceration of internet privacy, the war on climate and other science) that we haven't had as much chance (or need) to do this. But we should get the opportunity with tax reform. Hopefully it will inspire the same kind of grassroots activism as healthcare did.

This is the second front in the resistance. It lacks the potential to quickly decapitate the Regime's leadership like the battle raging on first front does. Rather, its a war of attrition that can continuously expose the Orange One's lack of mandate and incompetence, and, over time, errode the support that remains for the Regime.     </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Great analysis.

My favorite bits:

[Trump's] great challenge [is] the mismatch between the electoral coalition that (narrowly) carried him to victory and the collection of parties that he needs in order to pass laws.

...

**Rule One of coalition politics is that no faction gets everything it wantssuccess requires understanding the trade-offs that lie at the heart of every hard dispute, and trying to give each faction a win.** Todays Congress, under unified Republican control, sees politics differently. The lesson of the health bill debacle is that **too many members of Congress and of the Republican Party are still playing winner-takes-all politics.** Mr Ryan blames the failure of the House bill to repeal and replace Obamacare on the growing pains of the first unified Republican government in ten years, and in particular the hard-right House Freedom Caucus of about 30 members who remained in opposition-party mode. **True, the Freedom Caucus are absolutists, but Mr Ryan is downplaying the scale of the crisis that his party faces.**


...

Democrats and moderate Republicans from swing districts called [the AHCA]shockingly ungenerous, while hardline conservatives denounced it as another government handout. Rather than broaden its appeal, Mr Trump and Republican leaders made the bill more extreme to woo hardliners, stripping away rules stating that policies must cover such basic needs as hospitalisation or preventive care, including vaccines and cancer screening. When factions remained dug in, Mr Ryan and Mr Trump pulled the bill.

Trump supporters cannot gloat. **When called on to honour his health-care promises, the president lacked the patience to study his own plan and negotiate.** Instead, reports have him asking aides: Is this really a good bill? even as he demanded a take-it-or-leave it vote in the House. When that failed, Mr Trump blamed the far right, while predicting that soon Obamacare will explode, forcing Democrats to help craft a replacement

...

**With a better man in the White House and a lot of luck this could be a remarkable moment, in which new coalitions are formed and political logjams broken. That moment is being squandered.**

	<TEXT> We can assume certain things about the inadequacy of the process based on what we know. 

My criticism of Comey's actions does not assume that he necessarily didn't ask certain basic questions; rather, it says that he acted improperly regardless of the answerseven if he did ask them. Even granting that precautions were taken in the background, the process described in and evidenced by the *letters themselves* (updating Congress with an extremely vague letter he'd foreseen would leak) is highly irresponsible. 

Recall that Comey harshly criticized Clinton back in July 2016 when he announced his decision not to refer the private email server investigation for prosecution. That itself was totally improper and cuts against the rogue faction idea. In the first instance, Comey shouldn't have editorialized about the investigation and made the initial or supplemental Congressional testimony necessary. He's an investigator, not a prosecutor. But if he did feel that a letter was necessary because of his editorializing and earlier testimony, notwithstanding DoJ policies, he should have at minimum conducted a preliminary review and worded the letter less vaguely in order to quash speculation.

Let's actually look at [his first letter](http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/full-text-fbi-letter-announcing-new-clinton-review-230463). He knew it would leak, yet it's incredibly vague and permits wild speculation:

Dear Messrs Chairmen:

In previous congressional testimony, l referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.

**In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.** I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and **I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails** to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to **assess their importance to our investigation.**

**Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant**, and **I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work**, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Comey

Compare with [Comey's Internal letter](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/28/read-the-letter-comey-sent-to-fbi-employees-explaining-his-controversial-decision-on-the-clinton-email-investigation/?utm_term=.941a1b885fe1):

To all:

This morning I sent a letter to Congress in connection with the Secretary Clinton email investigation.  **Yesterday, the investigative team briefed me on their recommendation with respect to seeking access to emails that have** ***recently been found*** **in an unrelated case.**  **Because those emails** ***appear to be pertinent to our investigation***, I agreed that we should take appropriate steps to obtain and review them.

Of course, **we dont ordinarily tell Congress about ongoing investigations**, ***but here I feel an obligation to do so given that I testified repeatedly in recent months that our investigation was completed***. I **also think it would be misleading to the American people were we not to supplement the record**.  ***At the same time, however, given that we dont know the significance of this newly discovered collection of emails, I dont want to create a misleading impression.***  In trying to strike that balance, **in a brief letter and in the middle of an election season**, ***there is significant risk of being misunderstood***, but I wanted you to hear directly from me about it.

Jim Comey

Second letter:


Dear Messrs. Chairmen:

I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton's use of a personal email server. **Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.** During that process, **we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.**

**Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.**

I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.

Sincerely yours,

James B. Comey

---- 

As should be clear, Comey was fully aware of the dangers of "a brief letter...in the middle of an election season" and the  "significant risk of being misunderstood" that it entailed. He needed to conduct a preliminary review to mitigate this risk.

If Comey was lied to about the timing of when the emails were discovered, or if he found out that rogue elements within the FBI had been sitting on the info to maximize political damage to Clinton, then the people involved should have been publicly fired and censured. If they tried to leak the existence of the emails and alleged some sort of cover-up, Comey would already be conducting the preliminary review, which he could make public upon completion. And the full review, as we know, would ultimately have vindicated his precaution. With the news of the rogue faction being public, voters would be able to factor the attempt to create more damaging timing for the anti-Clinton October surprise into their decisions. 

Context matters. 

The complete lack of context is what made Comey's letters so damaging and ultimately, decisive.

First, you have the unlawful quid pro quo with the foreign adversary and everything that was done to implement it (which would have violated bribery, campaign finance, and other laws, and may possibly be actual treason). And secondly, then you have the high likelihood that the influence campaign succeeded. 

If the influence campaign changed the outcome, then nothing about the election should be permitted to stand. Reckoning with that will be a serious problem even if there's an eventual bipartisan consensus that there was collusion. Impeachment isn't enough.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *This* is the question to ask. 

Think about what the worst case scenario  looks like (assuming many of the key allegations of the Trump-Russia scandal are proven). 

You'd have:

(1) a candidate for President of the U.S. agreeing with a foreign adversary 

(2) that the foreign adversary would unlawfully obtain information about his opponent and then wage a disinformation and propaganda campaign through selective disclosure of the opponent's dirty laundry, coupled with fake news stories to weaponize the disinformation, and bots to promote it on social media, as well as covert funding of the campaign and possibly side payments, bribes, and sweetheart business deals not at fair market value (this is the ***quid***)

(3) *in exchange for* (***pro***) U.S. government policies favorable to the foreign adversary, and detrimental to U.S. national security interests (*e.g.*, weakening NATO, lifting sanctions for the annexation of Crimea) (this is the ***quo***)

(4) *while* lying to the electorate about the existence of this unlawful agreement and the foreign adversary's interference in the election--even when the opponent explicitly brings up the issue

(5) *while* shamelessly and knowingly mischaracterizing, exaggerating, and otherwise playing up the significance of illegally-obtained information about the opponent

(6) *while* the opponent continues to abide by campaign finance, anti-bribery and other legal restrictions that the candidate is circumventing himself through the unlawful agreement.

------------

Now, keep in mind that this candidate won: 

1. Michigan by 10,704 votes (0.22%);

2. Wisconsin by 22,748 votes (0.76%); and

3. Pennsylvania by 44,292 (0.72%).

The combined margin in these decisive states was, 77,744, or 0.0569% of the 136,628,459 votes cast. 

Put differently, a swing of 5,353 MI, 11,375 WI, and 22,147 PA undecided voters from Trump to Clinton--**less than three hundredths of a percentage point nationally**--would have changed the outcome. 

Even if you assume, for the sake of argument, that all of the unlawfully-obtained information about Clinton was 100% accurate, the fact that the information was selectively leaked is material and was concealed from voters.

Likewise, the fact that it was Russia doing it to help Trump, and harm Clinton, is material.

Further, if Trump knew that Russia leaking the info (through intelligence briefings he received as the Republican nominee), that's also material, since he denied it even as [he lied about and exaggerated the content of the leaks](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/).  

And, of course, if the leaks took place in direct coordination with the Trump campaign, as part of the *quid pro quo* above, that's certainly material. 

Concealment of these material facts--which deprived people of the opportunity to put the selectively-leaked and illegally-obtained information in context--almost certainly affected the outcome and should be grounds for annulling the election.

Comey editorialized at length when he decided not to refer his investigation to the DoJ in July of last year. That was totally improper, not least of all because Comey is an *investigator*, not a *prosecutor*.

He needs to explain why he didn't sign on to October 7 statement from the DHS and ODNI, and why doing so was too close to the election even though the October 28 letter to Chaffetz apparently wasn't. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The emails found on Wiener's laptop were only found in October. There wasn't a chance it was intentionally placed there to effect the election. He didn't delay his letter to maximize the effect.

[The emails were discovered in ***early*** October, three weeks before Comey was reportedly briefed](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-emails-20161030-story.html). During that time, no effort appears to have been made by the FBI to seek a warrant or conduct a preliminary review of them. We also know that it took 9 days between the initial Comey letter, on October 28 and the second letter notifying Congress that the investigation's conclusions had not changed (including delays to obtain the warrant so the review could even begin). There was plenty of time to do a full review if withholding the new emails was not intended to maximize the effect of the almost-November surprise.

When Comey received the initial briefing on the emails, one of the first questions out of his mouth should have been "when and where did you find these emails?" Upon discovering that no action had been taken during the preceding 3 weeks, he should have demanded a convincing explanation given the obvious potential to increase the effectiveness of an October surprise (which should not be the objective of an FBI criminal investigation). The letter and the way in which this was handled, in violation of standing DoJ policy, evidence a [lack of adequate precautions on Comey's part to minimize the political fallout](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb/). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Don't lionize him quite yet. 

Comey specifically refused to sign the FBI onto the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)/Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) [statement on October 7, 2016 that publicly attributed the attacks to Russia](https://www.dni.gov/index.php/newsroom/press-releases/215-press-releases-2016/1423-joint-dhs-odni-election-security-statement)--even though he agreed that Russia was behind the hacks--[supposedly because this statement was being issued too close to the election](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/629qt4/fbi_director_james_comey_tried_to_reveal_russian/dfkwpj6/). 

This DHS/ODNI statement even [came up at the third debate](http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-blames-russia-putin-wikileaks-rele/) and Trump questioned it in front of millions of people.

3 weeks later to the day from the initial release of the statement, on October 28, Comey sent the [improper letter](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5ayble/the_fbi_is_trumpland_anticlinton_atmosphere/d9kctvb/) to Chaffetz that [tipped the election to Trump](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5nmxob/hillary_clinton_and_her_team_tried_to_warn_us/dcctqr2/?utm_content=permalink utm_medium=front utm_source=reddit utm_name=politics). Apparently 11 days wasn't too close to the election, but 31 days was. 

Hmm. 

Keep in mind, as well, that the [FBI knew about emails that were the subject of the letter to Chaffetz for three weeks before the letter](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-james-comey-hillary-clinton-emails-20161030-story.html), and they only took 9 days to review in their entirety, because the vast majority were excluded as duplicates.

Double hmm.

And let's not forget about the *other* ongoing [investigation, by the Inspector General into Comey's actions](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2017/01/12/justice-department-inspector-general-to-investigate-pre-election-actions-by-department-and-fbi/?utm_term=.87cba041caa9), which hasn't been getting much attention with all the correct focus on Trump-Russia.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That rationale doesn't make sense given that he was willing to send the improper letter to Chaffetz on October 28, 2016--three weeks later--concerning the laptop emails. 

The October 7 report was the government's official report. If the FBI agreed with it, Comey should have signed on. Trump even made hay of the fact that he hadn't signed on. 

This strikes me as trying to make Comey look better after the fact, because he's concerned about how history will remember his intervention (given what may still be coming on Russia).

At the very least, this is an unexplained conflict with the earlier reporting that bears some further digging and explanation in light of this new report. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This sounds like revisionism.

It was previously reported that Comey refused to publicly sign the FBI onto the DHS and ODNI's [attribution of the hacks to Russia on October 7, 2016](https://www.dhs.gov/news/2016/10/07/joint-statement-department-homeland-security-and-office-director-national), because he thought that it would be too political given the proximity to the election--even though he privately agreed with the assessment that Russia was responsible. 

Will look for those reports and post.

Here:

#####CNBC, October 31, 2016:

[***FBI's Comey opposed naming Russians, citing election timing: Source***](http://www.cnbc.com/2016/10/31/fbis-comey-opposed-naming-russians-citing-election-timing-source.html):


**FBI Director James Comey argued privately that it was too close to Election Day for the United States government to name Russia as meddling in the U.S. election and ultimately ensured that the FBI's name was not on the document that the U.S. government put out, a former bureau official tells CNBC**.

The official said some government insiders are perplexed as to why Comey would have election timing concerns with the Russian disclosure but not with the Huma Abedin email discovery disclosure he made Friday.

In the end, the Department of Homeland Security and The Office of the Director of National Intelligence issued the statement on Oct. 7, saying: "The U.S. intelligence community is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. ... These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the U.S. election process."

...

According to the former official, Comey agreed with the conclusion the intelligence community came to: "A foreign power was trying to undermine the election. He believed it to be true, but was against putting it out before the election." Comey's position, this official said, was "if it is said, it shouldn't come from the FBI, which as you'll recall it did not."

Comey took a different approach toward releasing information about the discovery of emails on a laptop that was used by former congressman Anthony Weiner and his estranged wife Huma Abedin, the official said. 

**The Hill**:

[Comey did not want FBI to name Russia as meddler before Election Day: report](http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/303652-comey-did-not-want-fbi-to-name-russia-as-meddler-before)


**Huffington Post**:

[FBIs James Comey Opposed Naming Russia As An Election Meddler, Source Confirms](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/james-comey-clinton-emails_us_5817b25de4b064e1b4b456f4)

----------

Edit 2:

Here's the Washington Post's reporting on the DHS/ODNI Report that Comey refused to endorse publicly:

[U.S. government officially accuses Russia of hacking campaign to interfere with elections](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/us-government-officially-accuses-russia-of-hacking-campaign-to-influence-elections/2016/10/07/4e0b9654-8cbf-11e6-875e-2c1bfe943b66_story.html?utm_term=.13de1ac75271).

Frankly, it makes no sense that the Obama Administration would prohibit attribution to Russia by the FBI at the same time that it was making that very same attribution via DHS and the ODNI.

	<TEXT> To essentially guarantee taking control of the House in 2018, despite partisan gerrymandering, Democrats need just 5% of the electorate to change sides. This would create a +10% D swing. 5% of the electorate represents about 11% of the people who voted for Trump (and mostly straight-Republican tickets). 

So that's what who we should be focused on.

 Can we convince about 1 in 10 Trump voters (who aren't necessarily all die-hard Republicans) that this was a mistake? I think that's a highly achievable goal.      

Trump started with 45% approval and 45% disapproval in the Gallup poll. Now he's at 35% approval and 59% disapproval. That's a 10% decline in approval and a 14% increase in disapproval, for a 24% decrease in net approval. Surely we can find the required 5% of the electorate in that swing. </TEXT>

They're not going to help him with disastrous policies that aren't favored by Democrats or a majority of the American People. That's not their job. They're the *opposition* party.  If Trump can't even sell his agenda to Republicans, *why* should Democrats bail him out?

To top it off, Trump *hasn't even tried* to reach out with a more conciliatory tone or any sort of compromise. He's toxically unpopular, has no mandate, and is a pathological liar who can't be trusted with basically anything. He's doing all he can to trivialize and stonewall the investigation thatif he were totally innocentwould dispell the dark Russian cloud hanging over his Presidency.

	<TEXT> There's a large gulf between Democrats and Republicans on the economic intervention dimension. 

These 2D models based on the DW-nominate score show it really well:

[House](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846092122763735042)

[Senate](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846092374996652033)

[House w/ Freedom Caucus highlighted](https://twitter.com/bindersab/status/846095467779969024)

The opportunity lies not so much in a new ideological consensus, but in the GOP's practical need to govern.

Republicans have a House majority of 237-193, with 5 vacancies, but without the 31 members of the FC, the GOP can't pass legislation if Democrats oppose it as well.  But to keep the legislation palatable to moderate Republicans, the learship can't make the concessions necessary to get the HFC to go along (HFC members are ideological maximalists who won't compromise and take something at the policy midpoint of the overall Republican causus). 

This sets up future scenarios like the epic fail of the AHCA. But if this Republican Congress gets nothing done despite unified control of DC, Republicans are fucked in 2018.

This gives the Democrats leverage if they maintain party loyalty. They can counter-propose something acceptable to their caucus and hold open an offer to negotiate in good faith from that starting position. If Trump or the Congressional GOP ask for too much, Democrats can credibly threaten to withdraw and leave them with their original conundrum. 

Republicans will then have to choose whether they want to be the do nothing Congress that couldn't govern with a majority (Dems will have a laundry list of policies that the GOP rejected to run on) or they can be a bipartisan achievement Congress. 

Democrats likely gain less in 2018 under the latter scenario. But, in return, they can actually get some policies they favorlike fixing and depoliticizing the ACAand making them part of the bipartisan consensus (like Social Security).

	<TEXT> After wooing conservative Republicans on health care blew up in his face, President Trump is considering doing a total 180 and reaching out to congressional Democrats to get the rest of his agenda done.

...

Except, that's easier said than done. To have Democrats' ear, Trump will need to change pretty much everything about him  his tone, his substance, his policy  since he became president, say those very same Democrats in Congress.

"If he changes," Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on ABC's "This Week," "he could have a different presidency."


...

[S]ince Trump got inaugurated, he's dropped his populist streak and taken a hard tact to the right: He endorsed a health-care plan Democrats despised for its tax breaks on the wealthy and loosening mandated coverage for the poor. After his White House put out a travel ban 2.0 when the first one was stopped by the courts, Trump said at a campaign rally he wished the first could have stayed in place.

"He moved so far to the hard right that it's virtually impossible for us to work with him," Schumer said on ABC.

Then there's his cross-aisle negotiating style: Democrats say it's nonexistent.

To date, the White House has had substantial conversations with Democrats exactly zero times, top Democratic aides say. A classic example: Democrats found out about the White House's intention to work with them by watching Trump aides on TV Sunday, not by a phone call from the West Wing.

If Trump does call them up, Democrats feel like they have leverage to draw some red lines. Since controlling the House of Representatives, Republicans have not passed not one major piece of legislation without help from Democrats. Which means if Trump does decide that working with Democrats is his best path for an elusive legislative accomplishment, it could cost him dearly.

	<TEXT> I'd have fewer problems with Gorsuch if Garland had been confirmed and an open seat came up during a Republican President's term. We expect a more conservative judge. That's how the system works and maintains a semblance of balance over time. If a previously Republican seat comes up during a Democratic Presidency, oh well. The reverse happened several times under Reagan and yielded a considerably more conservative SCOTUS. But when Republicans refuse to even consider a qualified centrist judge during a Democratic President's term in order to transfer the vacancy so that a later Republican President so they can make the appointment, that balance breaks down. There was no reason not to consider Garland other than pure partisanship. Republicans should expect a proportional response.

Moreover, if they do have the votes, what would stop them from nuking it on the next nomination, assuming Democrats find it unacceptable? In all likelihood, the next nomination would allow conservatives to realize long-dreamed-of goals, like overturning *Roe*. The filibuster is basically already braindead in a deep coma. It's just waiting for someone to deliver the *coup de grace* by pulling the plug. It's an illusory procedural protection unless actually invoked and respected by the other side. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Putting aside the open question of Trump's legitimacy to even make this appointment, Gorsuch is to the right of Scalia and Alito and will be part of the same radical right-wing project to expand corporate power, curtail the regulatory functions of the federal government, break organized labor, weaken consumer legal protections, and undermine women's reproductive choices. He has exceptional qualifications and an affable demeanor, but that doesn't outweigh the former.

Beyond the merits of Gorsuch himself, there has to be a [proportional retaliatory response](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4) to the theft of Garland's seat.  Garland was a centrist consensus choice suggested by Republicans themselves. (Here, there was no consultation with Democrats.) And he was relatively old by the standard of recent nominations, meaning hed be on the court for less time.  It didnt matter. Republicans refused to consider him for 310 days, which is almost three times as long as the previous longest time between nomination and final action since we instituted a 9-justice SCOTUS in 1869 (127 days for Justice Harlan). 

If you consider SCOTUS nominations after 1869, the average is 34.80 days and the median is 19 days from nomination to final action.

If you look at just look at nominations after 1900, you get 37.67 on average, with a median of 23 days.

If you start with Eisenhower, you get 60.82 days on average, with 65 days median.

Since Reagan, it's been 65.93 average, 71 median.

Excluding Harriet Miers, who was withdrawn largely due to Republican pressure on President Bush, here are the nominations sorted by the number of days waiting before final action during that last period:


----

1. Sandra Day O'Connor	33

2. Ruth Bader Ginsburg	50

3. John Roberts, Jr. (C.J.)	62

4. Anthony Kennedy	65

5. Sonia Sotomayor	66

6. David Souter	69

7. Stephen Breyer	73

8. Samuel Alito, Jr.	82

9. Antonin Scalia	85

10. Elena Kagan	87

11. William Rehnquist (C.J.)	89

12. Clarence Thomas	99

13.  (*Not confirmed*) Robert Bork	108

14. (***NOT EVEN CONSIDERED***) **Merrick Garland	310**

----

Bork is instructive. Republicans bitch about him incessantly. But Bork was denied confirmation by a bipartisan 58-42 vote. 

[6 Republican Senators voted against him](http://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/24/us/senate-s-roll-call-on-the-bork-vote.html) --

John Chafee (R-RI)

Bob Packwood (R-OR)

Arlen Specter (R-PA)

Robert Stafford (R-VT)

John Warner (R-VA)

Lowell P. Weicker, Jr. (R-CT)

This isn't the same as filibustering Bork, let alone *refusing to even consider* his nomination for 10 monthswhich is what actually occurred with Garland. *And remember*: Bork was the guy who fired Archibald Cox, the special Watergate prosecutor, in Nixons Saturday Night Massacre. That alone warranted rejecting him.

So this isn't petty squabbling. It's strategic deterrence. If Democrats ignore each Republican defection from the standing norms and continue to be nice as they're trampled on, they reward and encourage further gamesmanship. So you get a ratcheting effect where Republicans take more and more advantage and are never held to account. By retaliating and creating the expectation that every action has consequences, Republicans may think twice in the future.

	<TEXT> Good news:

Senate Democrats on Tuesday left Judge Neil Gorsuch with two roads to the Supreme Court: winning over all of the partys remaining swing votes, or relying on the so-called nuclear option.

**The five Democratic senators up for reelection next year in states where President Donald Trump won by single digits have all endorsed a filibuster of Gorsuch**, while the five facing voters next year in states Trump won by double digits all remain undecided. **Gorsuch would have to carry all five of those fence-sitters to overcome a Democratic filibuster  plus his home-state Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Maine independent Sen. Angus King, and another more surprising senator.**

But after liberals raised the pressure on Democrats to oppose Gorsuch and the National Rifle Association targeted four red-state Democrats with $1 million in pro-Gorsuch ads, Trumps nominee ended the day with his chances at beating a filibuster lower than ever.

The issue is whether Gorsuch has earned 60 votes, which according to our Republican friends, has always been the standard for a significant decision by the Senate  and at present, I dont think theyre even close, liberal Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) told Politico. So I dont see this as being a make-or-break determination for any of those red-state Democrats.

...

If Gorsuch ultimately wins over Donnelly, McCaskill, Heitkamp, Tester and Manchin, as well as Bennet or King, his 60th vote would have to come from a blue-state institutionalist such as Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.)  who faced ire from the left for suggesting over the weekend that he might oppose a filibuster  or California Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committees top Democrat.

I'm going to work on Feinstein. Others should do the same in their states.

	<TEXT> You're shifting the goalposts bit. 

My criticism of your statement was that it was "over-broad and cynical."

Let's break it down:

[1] **No one** in [a] ***Congress*** or the [b] ***White House*** or [c] ***SCOTUS*** has [2] **worked for the American people** in a [3] **long time**. (emphasis and numeration added)

As evidence you offer this:


 [Obama] **[s]old out** the **entire VFX industry** by refusing to lodge complaints regarding our "allies" violating our trade agreements and kicking back money to the movie and game industry to ship jobs to Canada, England, and India. (emphasis added)

I'm not even sure that VFX products are fully subject to WTO rules that apply primarily to tangible goods. But let's  assume they are and stipulate that your claim is true, for the sake of argument. (I assume you're referring to [something related to this story, BTW.]
(http://variety.com/2013/biz/news/wto-cvd-duties-visual-effects-1200568359/)) 

You said that Congress, the President and SCOTUS hasn't worked for the American People for a long time. 
But surely you recognize that the VFX industry is not the *entirety* of the American People. There are always comparative winners and losers to government policies. If you name me any President who you contend worked for the American People as a whole, I'm willing to bet I can find find a sub-group that wasn't particularly well-served. 

Yet, if you look at macroeconomic indicators, like unemployment, job growth, etc., it's clear that Obama "worked for the American people" broadly speaking and compares favorably with many of his predecessors:

Don't get me wrong. I'm not trivializing the impact some policy of the Obama Administration may have had on what I presume is your industry. All I'm saying is that it's a mistake to generalize to all industries and people.

"April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question."

Clinton was referring to an exchange between White House press secretary Sean Spicer and the veteran journalist on Tuesday in which Spicer told Ryan to "stop shaking your head" as she asked a question.

...

Clinton also referenced Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's comment about Rep. Maxine Waters's (D-Calif.) hair, which he called a James Brown wig."

"One of our own California congressmen Maxine Waters was taunted with a racist joke about her hair," Clinton said. "Too many women, especially women of color, have had a lifetime of practice taking precisely these kinds of indignities in stride."

"But why should we have to? And any woman who thinks this couldnt be directed at her is living in a dream world."

	<TEXT> No, using the term "allegedly" indicates a respect for due process and the presumption of innocence. 

Likewise, "reportedly" indicates that a claim is or is contained in someone else's account (which should be cited) rather than being a firsthand account. 

Using these terms shows careful reporting. 

And finally, there are perfectly legitimate reasons for using anonymous sourcing. Look at how eager the Trump Regime is to find the leakers. Do you think they'd not have fired and prosecuted them if their identities were known publicly? When evaluating an anonymous source, you've gotta look at the context and whether you trust the reporter and publication's track record to help you decide whether the anonymity is justified. Ideally, every claim should have at least two sources.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> There's a difference between a terrorist attack or natural disaster that prevents people from voting vs. people voting based on information that was either false or illegally obtained.

Right. I want to figure out where you draw the line so that we can discuss whether that's the place to draw it. It seems clear that it's not the specialness of a particular day, and that you agree that some situations may warrant re-running an election.

I'm not clear on how you think a new vote would be somehow less tainted than the last one. The result of Russia's involvement is that a shitload of (allegedly true) info about Hillary got dumped onto Wikileaks. That can't be undone.

No the disclosure can't be undone, but the fact that the information was selectively leaked is material, and would now be know. 

Likewise, the fact that it was Russia doing it to help Trump is material. 

If Trump knew that Russia leaking the info, that's also material, since he denied it even as [he lied about and exaggerated the content of the leaks](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/).  

And, of course, if the leaks took place in direct coordination with the Trump campaign, as part of a quid pro quo, that's certainly material. 

Having a vote after disclosure of these material facts would go a long way to removing the taint because it would permit people put the illegally-obtained information in context. 

It doesn't matter if Clinton wins, or if she even runs. But even if she did run, I think it's highly plausible that disclosure of these facts could change the outcome, as would time and distance from the improper Comey letter. Remember, the election was decided by a swing of about 38.8K votes. </TEXT>

In the 1788 Constitution, Blacks could be consigned to the status of chattel and counted as 3/5ths of a person. Women couldn't vote. People who could be sent to war also couldn't vote to have a say in it. And States could deny federal constitutional rights to their citizens with impunity. 

We've fixed those deficiencies--some at very great cost.

We can continue to improve our Union, and the Constitution--being a product of reason and the enlightenment--invites us to.

	<TEXT> Sure I would. And that didn't happen here. 

I didn't say it did. I'm trying to isolate, by analogy, what your problem with a re-vote.

You can't recall someone just for being an asshole.

Agreed.

If it turns out he broke the law, impeach him, but then Pence would take over.

If you got your wish and the vote was recast, then what exactly would be different? The information Wikileaks shared on Hillary would still be out there. You couldn't ask the voters to just "pretend it didn't happen".

Trump won the election in part because of several million pissed off voters, finding out he colluded with Russia is not going to magically make them less pissed off.

Impeachment would be fine if Trump were removed for something he did while in office, or for something that he did before the election that did not affect the election outcome directly. Pence would have an indisputable constitutional claim to the Presidency in such a situation if he was not a culpable participant.

But if Trump is removed for collusion with the Kremlin to subvert the election itself, then Pence would be a product of the same tainted election and thus illegitimate even if he didn't know about the collusion (though he likely would have known). 

Think about what the worst case scenario looks like (assuming many of the current allegations are proven). 

You'd have:

(1) a candidate for President of the U.S. agreeing with a foreign adversary 

(2) to unlawfully obtain information about his opponent and then wage a disinformation and propaganda campaign through selective disclosure of the opponent's dirty laundry, coupled with fake news stories to weaponize the disinformation and bots to promote it on social media, as well as covert funding of the campaign and possibly side payments and bribes (this is the ***quid***)

(3) in exchange for (***pro***) U.S. government policies favorable to the foreign adversary, and detrimental to U.S. national security interests (e.g., weakening NATO) (this is the ***quo***)

(4) *while* lying to the electorate about the existence of this agreement, which is itself unlawful, and falsely denying the foreign adversary's involvement in the election--even when the opponent explicitly brings up the issue

(5) *while* shamelessly and knowingly mischaracterizing, exaggerating, and otherwise playing up the significance of illegally-obtained information about the opponent

(6) *while* the opponent continues to abide by campaign finance, anti-bribery and other legal restrictions that the candidate is circumventing through the unlawful agreement.

Now, keep in mind that the candidate won: 

1. Michigan by 10,704 votes (0.22%);

2. Wisconsin by 22,748 votes (0.76%); and

3. Pennsylvania by 44,292 (0.72%).

Trump's combined margin in these decisive states was, 77,744, or 0.0569% of the 136,628,459 votes cast. 

So a swing of 5,353 MI, 11,375 WI, and 22,147 PA undecided voters from Trump to Clinton--**less than three hundredths of a percentage point nationally**--would have changed the outcome. 



The point isn't to give the election to Clinton. It's to hold an untainted election. 

It's possible that Trump could win again. If that's the People's will--at least as filtered by the EC--then fine. That would at least restore legitimacy. But it's highly plausible that the outcome could be different. And if it were, that would also be the People's will.

	<TEXT> That's an interesting theory. 

I haven't done anywhere near a comprehensive review of the caselaw on executive privilege.

Fron what I know, though, there would likely be no executive privilege covering communications between an agent of the President and agents of a foreign government. The purpose of such communications isn't to advise the President and facilitate his decision-making. It's to negotiate or relay information between governments, for example, who may have interests adverse to the U.S. So disclosures outside the executive would ordinarily waive executive privilege. 

There still may be confidentiality or classification protecting such information from public disclosure based on national security concerns, or a limited privacy interest to the extent any of the communications did not involve official government actions. But Congress should presumably be able to access those communications as part of its oversight and investigatory roles, even if the statements are not made public.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I agree that we'd probably be better off having a parliamentary system rather than a Presidential-Congrsssional system. Last week's healthcare debacle would have been a no-confidence vote in Trump's minority governmentpossibly triggering new elections. But the prospects of this kind of dramatic change in the short term are dim.

Here's [a post I made a while back suggesting comprehensive set of fundamental process reforms](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/52kzbg/comment/d7lgrsc).

Realistically, I think you'd do these kinds of reforms incrementally and see what you get from each reform.

First, go to a national popular vote for President and do something drastic to limit partisan gerrymandering in the House. That's essential.

Next, change from Plurality-SMD to mixed-member proportional representation (MMP) for the House.

Then abolish legislative filibusters and return to the constitutional 50%+1 rule in the Senate.

Those three reforms would make a huge difference, I think. We might gain a functioning government from it. 

But if you needed to go further, you could make the Senate more representative and/or implement asymmetric bicameralism (under which the Senate would mostly only be able to delay or raise the threshold for passing legislation). 

Then, if you still needed to go further, you could separate President's head of state role from the head of government role, and make the Speaker of the House the head of government and the cabinet. 

The main takeaway is that we should tinker with and improve our democratic processes. We've learned a lot since 1788.

	<TEXT> So the Kremlin claims it was a meeting with Kushner the businessman, whereas the White House claims it was as a member of the Trump Regime's transition team.

I'm inclined to think itmay have been *both*, since each side would tend to want to conceal the purpose of the meeting that the other side claimed. Kushner and the White House would not want to exacerbate the conflicts of interest concerns that Kushner facing over not having divested from his family's business empire. The Kremlin, for its part, likely wouldn't want to call even more attention to undisclosed meetings between its agents and the Trump regime. Yet, the White House will likely want to portray those meetings as routine (even though they were undisclosed) and hope that the substance of what was actually discussed is unknown.

#####Kremlin:

Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told reporters on Tuesday that Kushner's meeting with Vnesheconombank (VEB) CEO Sergey Gorkov in late December "was ordinary business," echoing the bank's previous claim that it had met with Kushner in his capacity as "the head of Kushner companies."

...

"During the talks, the existing practices of foreign development banks and promising trends were discussed. ... The meetings took place with a number of representatives of the largest banks and business establishments of the United States, including Jared Kushner, the head of Kushner Companies."


----

#####White House:

That appears to conflict with the White House's version of events, which purports that Kushner met with Gorkov as a representative of the Trump transition team.

"Jared attended the meeting in his capacity as a transition official," a senior White House official told Business Insider on Tuesday. "Nothing of substance was discussed. There was no follow up."

The official added that the White House statement from Monday, that Kushner took the meetings as part of his role as "the official primary point of contact with foreign governments and officials," still stands.

...

The seemingly conflicting characterizations of the meeting, which was not disclosed publicly until Monday, raise more questions about what kind of contact Trump's associates had with Russian officials through the latter half of 2016, as Russia was attempting to sway the outcome of the election in Trump's favor.

Kushner also met with Russia's ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak, in December at Trump Tower with Gen. Michael Flynn. Kislyak set up the meeting between Kushner and Gorkov, according to The New York Times.

The circumstances surrounding Kushner's meetings with Gorkov are murky not only because its purpose remains unclear, but also because Vnesheconombank was sanctioned by the US in 2014, after Russia annexed Crimea.

"It's an unusual/more significant meeting given that Vnesheconombank was on the sanctions list," Ian Bremmer, president of the political risk firm Eurasia Group, said in an email. "The obvious reason would be that they hoped for better treatment under the Trump administration." </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This couldn't look worse for the WH. 

Read the letters back and forth about Yates' testimony. They establish that the WH's denials of this story are false. Then you have Nunes cancelling the House Intelligence Committee hearing *after* Yates' lawyer took the position that the WH's privilege assertions had no meritbasically stonewalling and siding with the people he's ostensibly investigating when their own attempt to stonewall failed. And now we learn from Schiff that Yates was going to be testifying about Flynn (and a potential cover up). 

To top all of this off, you have Nunes secretly getting classified intelligence from WH staffers only to then turn around and brief the WH publicly concerning that very same intelligence*while* withholding it from his Committee. Once again, defending and running interference for the very people he's supposed to be investigating (and in the process breaching all norms of acceptable behavior as the chair of a congressional oversight committee). 

We're quickly getting into obstruction of justice territory if we're not already there.

Republicans now have a choice: show some independence and carry out a legitimate investigationas overwhelming majorities of the public have indicated they wantor be branded the complicity-in-treason party. 

Democrats have mounted a pretty decent opposition so far. But it's time to kick it up a notch. Use every tool at your disposalincluding withholding unanimous consent in the Senateto force the GOP to investigate. Hold unofficial hearings and town halls. File lawsuits. Call for protests and direct action. Use state-level law enforcement tools. Kick and scream*literally* if necessary. Shut this thing down, because it can't go on like this.

	<TEXT> Wow. The optics of this are terrible for the WH:

The Trump administration sought to block former acting attorney general Sally Yates from testifying to Congress in the House investigation of links between Russian officials and Donald Trumps presidential campaign, The Washington Post has learned, a position that is likely to further anger Democrats who have accused Republicans of trying to damage the inquiry.

According to letters The Post reviewed, the Justice Department notified Yates earlier this month that the administration considers a great deal of her possible testimony to be barred from discussion in a congressional hearing because the topics are covered by the presidential communication privilege.


...

In a March 23 letter to Acting Assistant Attorney General Samuel Ramer, Yatess attorney David ONeil described the governments position. **ONeil, who declined to comment, noted in the letter that Yates is willing to testify, and that she will avoid discussing classified information and details that could compromise investigations.** The correspondence was later shared with the Intelligence Committee.

**The Department of Justice has advised that it believes there are further constraints on the testimony Ms. Yates may provide at the [Intelligence Committee] hearing.** Generally, we understand that the department takes the position that all information Ms. Yates received or actions she took in her capacity as Deputy Attorney General and acting Attorney General are client confidences that she may not disclose absent written consent of the department, the lawyer wrote.

**We believe that the departments position in this regard is overbroad, incorrect, and inconsistent with the departments historical approach to the congressional testimony of current and former officials,** the letter continues. **In particular, we believe that Ms. Yates should not be obligated to refuse to provide non-classified facts about the departments notification to the White House of concerns about the conduct of a senior official.** Requiring Ms. Yates to refuse to provide such information is **particularly untenable given that multiple senior administration officials have publicly described the same events.**

Scott Schools, another Justice Department official, replied in a letter the following day, saying the conversations with the White House are likely covered by the presidential communications privilege and possibly the deliberative process privilege. The president owns those privileges. Therefore, to the extent Ms. Yates needs consent to disclose the details of those communications to [the intelligence panel], she needs to consult with the White House. She need not obtain separate consent from the department.

**Yatess attorney then sent a letter Friday to McGahn, the White House lawyer, saying that any claim of privilege has been waived as a result of the multiple public comments of current senior White House officials** describing the January 2017 communications. Nevertheless, I am advising the White House of Ms. Yates intention to provide information.

**That same day, Nunes, the panels chairman, said he would not go forward with the public hearing** that was to feature Yatess testimony. </TEXT>

Remember that, with perjury, the lie that you're held accountable for is the oath to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothkng but the truth. That's why people review transcripts and supplement their testimony to make sure it's accurate.

	<TEXT> I've seen various versions of this comment but I don't quite get it. 

Assume we're in the scenario where Trump's collusion with Putin has been proved in court, and the SCOTUS as a result declares the election null and void. Trump is removed from office and Paul Ryan becomes acting President until the special election can be held. Trump isn't personally convicted of treason so he's still eligible to run in the election. Even though the GOP denies him the nomination at a brokered convention, Trump decides to run again as an independent (or as a representative of the new Make America Great Party). The Democrats re-nominate Clinton, and the Republicans someone else (Ted Cruz, Mitt Romney, Mike Pence, etc.).

Suppose new votes are cast and someone other than Trump wins.

At what point in the absove scenario do you contend there would be be mass violence? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Can't compose as full a reply as I'd like at the moment, but I'll say this in response to your points. 

(1) The very first sentence of my linked post was:

It's not that complicated actuallyjust **politically difficult.**

The original post I was responding to was about the purported need to amend the Constitution. Amending the Constitution is, in fact, not necessary.

In my reply, I was commenting on the legal viability of the proposed remedy to this legitimacy crisis (holding a new Presidential election), not the politics of its implementationwhich are also really interesting.

I will note that procedurally, overriding a veto would take 19 GOP Senators, the same as for a conviction on impeachment. The main difference is you'd *also* need 2/3ds of the House as well for a PSA amendment. 

If there had already been findings of collusion by Congressional committees such that impeachment was actually viable, this wouldn't necessarily be preemptive action or against medium-to-long-term GOP interests. 

---

(a) The order matters only because it would prevent Pence from ascending to the Presidency. If the impeachments are done in quick succession, it could also potentially prevent a Vice-Presidential nomination from being made and delivered, which would be cleaner. 

----

(b) The federal courts have broad equity jurisdiction under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution and could use it to annul the election in the appropriate circumstances (foreign subversion with culpable participation by the current President)especially with Congressional participation in the process.

From a prior post:


Suppose a Congressional investigation finds strong evidence of collusion with and possibly even direct funding by the Kremlin (which is currently [being investigated](http://www.businessinsider.com/trump-russia-dossier-claims-cia-2017-1)). ... This would fundamentally taint the election and would be the basis for begining impeachment proceedings.  But another track that could be pursued in parallel, or in the alternative, would be a lawsuit contesting the validity of the election itself.

First, you'd need to find someone with standing to sue. An obvious person would be any of the other candidates who took part in the electionespecially Clinton. There would be other persons with standing as well. But the key point is that this is the sort of "[case or controversy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/controversy)" that federal courts have jurisdiction to resolve.

[Article III, Section 2](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleiii#section2) specifies, in the relevant part that:

The **judicial power shall extend to** ***all cases***, **in law and** ***equity***, arising under this Constitution [or] the laws of the United States...

[Federalist 83 (Hamilton)](http://www.constitution.org/fed/federa83.htm) sheds further light on this broad and somewhat vague grant of jurisdiction:

"The **great and primary use of** a court of **equity is to give relief in extraordinary cases, which are exceptions to general rules.**"

Here, fully resolving the specific controversyan election tainted by foreign interferenceand fashioning an equitable remedy might well require complete annulment of the original election.

Either the suit contesting the election works its way up to SCOTUS through the regular appellate process or it makes it there in some expedited fashionsuch as through an [extraordinary writ](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1651) application. In any event, the Congressional findings could be introduced and judicially-noticed (including any supporting classified evidence under seal). Trump would have full due process and opportunity to oppose via an adversarial legal proceeding. Ultimately though, let's assume the courts were to decide against him.

In theory, that would vacate both the Presidency and Vice-Presidency and void any acts involving the President since the inauguration. It would also trigger the Presidential Succession Act (PSA), which provides directlyby statutefor who will "act as President" when there's no President and no Vice President.

...

There's [some precedent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electoral_Commission_(United_States\)) for passing legislation and involving the Supreme Court to resolve disputes about a Presidential election through extraordinary remedies. In 1876, Rutherford B. Hayes "won" the election against Samuel Tilden by 1 EV under a [negotiated compromise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compromise_of_1877). **Hayes did not have a majority of the electoral vote until this compromise.** Tilden won an outright majority of the popular vote, not just a plurality. The margin was 3%the largest popular vote margin for an EC loser. This was possibly the most divisive election in American history. So it's not totally inconceivable that a bipartisan solution could happen here too if it's seen as being in both parties' interests.

	<TEXT> If you nullified, that's only half of the equation. It would mean that the Office of President and Vice President would be vacant. That would automatically trigger the Presidential Succession Act (PSA). Under the current PSA, Ryan would be acting President until a President is elected.

The idea is you pre-amend the PSA to authorize a special election to fill double vacancies. So Ryan would act as a caretaker until that occurs.

But the same judicial order that nullified the election could simply require a new election. That would be more like a re-vote.

	<TEXT> A murder suspect accused of coming to New York to kill as many black men as he could will face trial on charges of terrorism, according to New York County District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr.

On Monday, James Harris Jackson, 28, of Baltimore was indicted Monday on one count each of first- and second-degree murder as an act of terrorism for the March 20 stabbing of Timothy Caughman, 66.

I'm searching for the indictment. This notable both because I'd expect a federal terrorism charge, whereas this is brought by a state prosecutor, and because [Sean Spicer refused to condemn the act as such](http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/spicer-won-acknowledge-timothy-caughman-murder-hate-crime-article-1.3010710).

	<TEXT> I think that's a pretty messed up view of popular sovereignty. 

An election isn't a game. It's mechanism to gauge the will of the People, and by their consent, invest the winner with powers that belong permanently to the People. 

A re-vote simply measures the will of the People again when there's a significant problem with the original measurement (such as the People's consent being procured by fraud and in willful violation of election lawsincluding the [prohibition on foreign campaign donations](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/52/30121)).

So what if the People make a different choice under this extraordinary situation? The point is to obtain their consent, not freeze a particular slice of their opinion in time. There's nothing magical about a specific election day. It's more important that the election be free and fair, whenever it's held.

Would you be OK with holding a re-vote if there were a major natural disaster or a coordinated terrorist attack on election day affecting turnout in several key battlegeound states? 

If so, then why should deliberate interference by a foreign adversary targetting the election itselfwith possible collusion by one of the candidatesbe any different?         </TEXT>

This complaint is newsworthy, but it can't force action on this.

Normally, the [U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia](https://www.justice.gov/usao-dc) would have prosecutorial jurisdiction over lying to Congress. He would empanel a grand jury and present evidence of Sessions having perjured himself. The grand jury would presumably indict Sessions, and then there would be a criminal trial. 

*Complicating factor*: U.S. Attorneys are subordinates of Sessions, as Attorney General and head of the Department of Justice. It would be difficult for a U.S. Attorney to press charges against his own boss. A U.S. Attorney can be fired basically at will by the A.G. or the President, [as we've seen](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2017/03/10/us/politics/us-attorney-justice-department-trump.html). Of course, doing so can be scandalous under some circumstances, just [ask George W. Bush and Alberto Gonzales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dismissal_of_U.S._attorneys_controversy). (We [may not even have to go that far back](https://www.propublica.org/article/preet-bharara-fired-investigating-tom-price-hhs-stock-trading).) It would be even more scandalous here since Sessions would be firing someone investigating his own wrongdoing, ala Nixon's [Saturday Night Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturday_Night_Massacre). As we've seen though, Trump doesn't respect norms.

So, it'd basically be an "[if you come at the king, you'd best not miss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WP-lrftLQaQ)" situation.

Assuming these issues could be resolved, two crimes Sessions could theoretically be charged with are:

---

[18 U.S. Code  1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) (False statements)

*Or*

[18 U.S. Code  1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621) (Perjury) 

---

If I were prosecuting him, the way I'd go about it is by juxtaposing Sessions' in-person and written testimony against (1) the timeline (he failed to correct his testimony for weeks, even after Flynn resigned for lying while not under oath), (2) his [initial press statements](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/837136512915501056), (3) the [trial balloon excuses that have subsequently unraveled](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5y3kfs/al_franken_i_think_jeff_sessions_committed_perjury/den0ga6/), (4) the [doubling down](http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/Sessions,%2003-06-17,%20letter,%20testimony.pdf) after being scolded by Trump, and (5) the [subsequent revelation that he met with Kislyak a third time](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58c05639e4b0d1078ca37225/), which boxes him in.

I'd look for further inconsistencies in what he said at his recusal press conference versus at the hearing and supplemental letter. And I'd also play the [extended cut of his body language](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOh3kfulSoU feature=youtu.be) (1:35). 

In addition, I'd bring in Sessions' past statements about perjury (such as during Clinton's impeachment trial) and apply them to the situation as evidence of the standard of forthrightness that he expected of others and would presumably try to comply with. 

Here's the relevant statutory provision, [18 U.S. Code  1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621):

-----

Whoever

(1) **having taken an oath** before a competent tribunal, officer, or person, in any case in which a law of the United States authorizes an oath to be administered, **that he will testify, declare, depose, or certify truly, or that any written testimony, declaration, deposition, or certificate by him subscribed, is true**, **willfully and contrary to such oath states or subscribes any material matter which he does not believe to be true**; or

(2) in any declaration, certificate, verification, or statement under penalty of perjury as permitted under section 1746 of title 28, United States Code, willfully subscribes as true any material matter which he does not believe to be true;

is guilty of perjury and shall, except as otherwise expressly provided by law, be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than five years, or both. This section is applicable whether the statement or subscription is made within or without the United States.

----

The point is to convince a jury of his **reckless, knowing, or purposeful** *subscription* to his false statements of material fact.

Put differently, Sessions swore an oath that the testimony he gave was the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Perjury liability attaches to that affirmation, not to the underlying lie. The lie just shows that the affirmation was false. He had a chance to correct or clarify it but instead doubled down.     

----

Edit: Thanks for the gold, stranger! It's very generous. I'm glad you found this comment informative.

	<TEXT> Hostilities is part of the [statutory definition of enemy](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/2204), which could be be relevant if the word enemy gets litigated in a hypothetical treason trial. 

Act of war would do it under the ["**levies war**" prong, but they could also be charged under the alternative "**adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort**" prong](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381).   </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Impeachment.

Another possibility would be to annul the election judicially, which could void every action Trump took as President. But if Gorsuch were on the SCOTUS, he'd likely vote against annulment. 

People have talked about adding more Justices to SCOTUS, which could be done by ordinary statute. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't know if it's an act of war, but it's certainly a *hostile act*  which, if there was direct collusion with Trump campaign to subvert the election, would possibly be enough to deem Russia an enemy for purposes of establishing treason on the part of any U.S. participants in the collusion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's not "squabbling children" or "both sides do it." That superficial analysis lets the Republicans off far too easily for their partisan gamesmanship with Garland. 

Democrats' response here is just [basic tit-for-tat reciprocity](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5mygn5/mcconnell_not_following_confirmation_process_he/dc7sth4), which is the foundation of mutually-beneficial cooperation over time.

If Democrats ignore each Republican defection from the standing norms and continue to be nice as they're trampled on, they reward and encourage further gamesmanship. So you get a ratcheting effect where Republicans take more and more advantage and are never held to account. By retaliating and creating the expectation that every action has consequences, Republicans may think twice before defecting.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This. If Democrats lie down here, they're signaling that they're doormats. Republicans had the option of confirming Garland, a moderate consensus choice with impeccable qualifications. They chose not to even consider him, despite having almost a year to so so. Now, if Republicans want Gorsuch, Democrats must force them to nuke the filibuster and own that decisionalong with all of its consequences down the road.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Putting aside the open question of Trump's legitimacy to even make the appointment, Gorsuch is to the right of Scalia and Alito and will be part of the same radical right-wing project to expand corporate power, curtail the regulatory functions of the federal government, break organized labor, weaken consumer legal protections, and undermine women's reproductive choices. He has exceptional qualifications and an affable demeanor, but that doesn't outweigh the former.     

And beyond Gorsuch himself, there has to be a proportional retaliatory response to the theft of Garland's seat, or Democrats will only encourage further gamesmanship.      </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Agreed. This thing of saving the filibuster for the *next* nominee who might be really bad (ignoring that Gorsuch is really bad *right now*)at which point people will then argue to save it for the *next* next really bad nomineemakes the filibuster illusory.

If there was ever a time to use it, it's now after the theft of Garland's seat. If the GOP nukes it, so be it.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said that he doubts that Gorsuch will be able to get the 60 votes needed to end a filibuster threatened by some Democrats.

Republicans almost certainly will respond by using their majority status to change Senate procedure and allow Supreme Court picks to be confirmed with a simple majority vote, Coons told MSNBCs Morning Joe.

...

Coonss prediction came after recent consultations with senators in both parties about brokering an agreement that would lead to Gorsuchs confirmation and also preserve current Senate traditions, according to multiple senators and aides familiar with his negotiations.

The hope was to find a bipartisan group of rank-and-file senators who could negotiate a deal that would once again steer the Senate away from partisan brinkmanship on federal court vacancies. A group of 14 senators from both parties warded off a similar impasse in 2005  but just three members of that Gang of 14 remain in office. And Coons signaled Monday that hes found little appetite for a new agreement. </TEXT>
