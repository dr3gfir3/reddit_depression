	<TEXT> If you have some time to travel, I always hear people talk about Triberg when they mention cuckoo clocks. It's about 2 hrs drive from Stuttgart. I've never been myself so do your research. 

Edit - you would probably have luck if you went to the Schlossplatz and checked out some stores but I don't know any specifically. The Christmas markets are open now as well (Marktplatz, Schillerplatz, Schlossplatz, Hirschstrae and Kirchstrae) </TEXT>
