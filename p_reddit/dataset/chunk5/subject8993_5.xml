	<TEXT> Yeah. I'm worried. Thanks to a vacation, unlucky scheduled day off schedule and ridiculous quota in February I only worked 14 days and despite pacing if you multiplied by 1.5 (assuming 21 days working) for quota ended at 78%. 


Then last month we had a total lol quota of 60(!) new and 70(!) despite being a B store (the A store 5-10 min away had a quota of 33) and I hit 78% again... And had a fios referral that got messed up and my discrepancy hadn't been approved so that would have pushed me over 80% but didn't. 


So now I'm on counseling despite getting 84 new lines in my last 35 working days, despite a pull through % of 34, 71%tmp, $119 ARD, and the most hums in my store 3 months in a row. 

And it's the first two months I've missed quota since working for the company. Fun times.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> When you buy full retail you don't get any credit for the sale. Ironically, ime the people who pay full price are also the ones who don't buy accessories yet then also feel entitled since they "spent $800 in your store" to attempt to occupy all your time getting the phone set up. 

If you wanna buy phones at full price for no real reason then the apple store or best buy or online is the place to go. Otherwise, you're not only hurting a sales rep by taking his time but it's actually counting against him when you don't buy accessories or anything. 


I'll sell a phone full retail from my store but then you have to take it and go I'm not gonna also waste my time helping you set it up, especially when you won't listen to common sense and finance the phone with 0 interest.  </TEXT>
