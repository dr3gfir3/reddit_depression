	<TEXT> British yup, we call it strong white flour but you can also find bread flour which is the same thing I'm sure.

Also I realise now that it sounded like I did the second proofing in the oven. I proofed the dough after rolling in to shape OUTSIDE of the oven - which I was heating up to 230 degrees Celsius and put a tray of water at the bottom (hence steaming it).

I didn't use a pooling, could that make the holes bigger? It was still crunchy of the out and fluffy on the inside so I'm happy with it taste wise, just want it more aesthetically accurate so thanks for your help! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I used a strong white flour and an instant yeast sachet. I mixed until it pulled away from the bowl then let it proof till doubled in size.

Then folded, placed in the tray and let it proof for an hour whilst steaming the oven. Baked at 230c for about 25 minutes.

I'd love to have larger holes in the bread at the end. The dough was very sticky when I was working with it. Thanks for your help! </TEXT>
