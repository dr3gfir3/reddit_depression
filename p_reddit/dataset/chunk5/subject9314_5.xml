	<TEXT> I think it would be by majority, though not necessarily a simple majority. I guess what would be needed would be some real-world data. Look at a couple of hundred cases in which the verdict is clear to an expert. Ask the jurors what they privately think. Find the sweet spot and use that.

In general I don't think juries are likely to be reliable in their current form. A friend of mine served and kept encountering other jurors who decided based on the defendants' appearance. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes I could see that in an ideal situation, but the assumption there is that the leader(s) of the opinion of the jury have to be acting reasonably. If they aren't, then they could erode the reasonableness of the others.

I can't actually see any reason why a small number of charismatic or pushy jurors are more likely to be reasonable than more introverted people. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No feature of any living thing has any purpose.

There are only features beneficial for reproduction, and features detrimental for reproduction.

This one is beneficial for the mother's life, but detrimental for her genes reproduction. That might explain why the phenomenon is rare. 

Edit: I'll just qualify this. Living things which have been selectively bred or engineered by people do have purposes to their features. My cat has been bred for especially fluffy fur because it looks good and is nice to stroke. However, natural selection has no direction or purpose in its effects.    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Chemtrail-believers are talking about the water-vapour contrails that jet aircraft cause. Those are mostly not emitted from the planes, but are caused by the release of moisture in the air as a plane wing passes through it.

I doubt there are many pointing at real 'chemtrails' and when they are, the chemtrails are not secret. So there is no conspiracy. </TEXT>

	<DATE> 2017-01-14 22:09:30 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I have some ideas:

1) Government should buy land, or use its existing land to build high quality, low cost homes. It should concentrate on brownfield site in towns and cities, especially around London. It should sell 80% of them and use the remaining ones for fixed-term, renewable council tenancies, of 3-5 years, with right to buy.

2) There should be a lot of them. make it easy to apply for and get one. Limit them to individuals.

3) Prices should be radically low, say 100,000 maximum for a 1-bed flat.

4) There is nothing wrong with high-rise as long as the build, design and maintenance is of sufficient quality.

5) To keep costs low it might be an option to build flats in high-density, with small but innovative designs. I could imagine units the size of static caravans, though of more permanent, insulated and sound-proofed materials.

6) Another cost-saving measure might be to offer units for sale with minimal fittings. Just a bare concrete box which is easily fitted-out by the buyer, as and when they choose. Supply a locking front door, good windows, and the cheapest possible kitchen and bathroom fixtures, to be replaced later.

7) There seems to be lots of space to the East of London (around the Excel centre and further out). Build some mega-estates.

8) There needs to be a robust way of dealing with tenants/buyers who persist in anti-social behaviour, and proper maintenance. Don't allow the estates to become slummy.

9) Include public transport integration. Put in new bus routes at the least.

Any thoughts? What are the downsides?

	<TEXT> [Here's the call.](https://youtu.be/jo92MAwtkAM)

I am a little bothered by Matt and Tracie's stance on this one. A few times during the call Matt makes some dismissive remarks about the caller being out of his depth. I was a little bothered by Matt's refusal to acknowledge that matter can become conscious without intelligent intervention. He maintains that he doesn't know whether intelligence is required or not. However, that seems to entail that he does believe matter ~~can~~ might become conscious without intervention.

Any thoughts? Tracie's Skittles analogy doesn't quite hit the spot for me. She should explicitly accept that there could be more green skittles in the jar.
