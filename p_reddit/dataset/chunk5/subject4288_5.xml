r/politics isn't really "biased," though. It doesn't have biased moderation or submission policy, it's just a cross-section of the politically active Reddit users, which happens to lean pretty liberal, since Reddit users are mainly 18-30 year old white men. 

It's a neutral sub with a liberal userbase.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  When they looked back toward the valley and the distant Gardner place at the bottom they saw a fearsome sight. All the farm was shining with the hideous unknown blend of colour; trees, buildings, and even such grass and herbage as had not been wholly changed to lethal grey brittleness. The boughs were all straining skyward, tipped with tongues of foul flame, and lambent tricklings of the same monstrous fire were creeping about the ridgepoles of the house, barn, and sheds. It was a scene from a vision of Fuseli, and over all the rest reigned that riot of luminous amorphousness, that alien and undimensioned rainbow of cryptic poison from the wellseething, feeling, lapping, reaching, scintillating, straining, and malignly bubbling in its cosmic and unrecognisable chromaticism.

....

  The aperture was black with a darkness almost material. That tenebrousness was indeed a positive quality; for it obscured such parts of the inner walls as ought to have been revealed, and actually burst forth like smoke from its aeon-long imprisonment, visibly darkening the sun as it slunk away into the shrunken and gibbous sky on flapping membraneous wings. The odour arising from the newly opened depths was intolerable, and at length the quick-eared Hawkins thought he heard a nasty, slopping sound down there. Everyone listened, and everyone was listening still when It lumbered slobberingly into sight and gropingly squeezed Its gelatinous green immensity through the black doorway into the tainted outside air of that poison city of madness. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  I feel like it's not really that complete of argument because the high tuition will deter the middle and lower classes just as much, if not more so, in our current setting. The unfortunate part of our world is that your socioeconomic class means a lot in how your life works out.

That's because this is only part of the argument. Even if college is tuition-free, most college students will be privileged. Even if they don't have to pay tuition, spending time in college requires money and a safety net, and is likely to increase your income in the future. Thus, free college shifts costs from these privileged people to the general taxpayer.  </TEXT>

However, a German victory over the UK would have eliminated the Western and African fronts and isolated the USSR, eliminating UK and US lend-lease, which accounted for [an enormous amount of the USSR's fuel, ammunition, and vehicles, most critically fighters and heavy tanks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Front_(World_War_II)#Forces), as well as [critical training.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No._151_Wing_RAF)

The invasion of Russia could only have succeeded if Britain was defeated first.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  They have been able to salvage Cena in the last few years by giving him legitimate threats and getting more of the fans behind him. Cena loses now, not regularly, but it allows us to cheer for him and builds great matches. He took a pin when they could have easily gave it to Harper the other night. Reigns "over coming the odds" has hurt him immensely as well as much of the roster.

This is part of it, but Cena is *actually a good face.* He looks like a face, he acts like a face, and "Hustle, Loyalty,   Respect" is a face attitude to a T. When he's not being booked stupid, he's super over.

Reigns looks like a heel, acts like a heel, and "Believe that!" is tweener to heel. 

It's a lot easier to cheer for Hogan 2.0 than for a guy who beat you up in middle school and went on to play pro football.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  He got to face HHH for the title leading into WM. 

Granted

 He had WWE legends hype him in his match against their golden boy, Brock Lesnar.

Yeah, and Lesnar buried him.

 He won MITB and the WWE title the same night, and retained against the two other pushed members of the shield. He held the companies main title through the brand split, and was Smackdown's first pick (ahead of Cena, AJ, and Randy). He had a multi-month war with AJ over the title, and pinned Cena clean at one point.

Granted.

 Just because he's being pushed down the card a little now to allow for the Bray/Randy story to take over doesnt mean he hasnt been pushed. Id say what he received from Roadblock through Summerslam accounts for a pretty monster push. **Misguided choices about his match at WM dont erase that.**

This is what we are talking about though. It's almost CM Punk all over again - Ambrose wrestles the most matches, gets a solid push, and then gets booted out of the way for Reigns last year and gets squashed by Lesnar at Wrestlemania. This year, he gets a big push, makes way for Cena vs AJ at Rumble (fair,) and then looks like he's treading water towards a pre-show match at Mania.

And AJ looks to be getting a garbage match vs Shane (no offense to Shane.) It's frustrating.

	<TEXT>  That's not confined to liberalism. Socialists also uphold these values.

I haven't found [this attitude](http://moufawad-paul.blogspot.ca/2012/02/whos-speech-and-for-whom.html) to be uncommon among socialists.

Liberalism is the philosophy that liberty and equality are of paramount importance. 

Socialism is an economic philosophy of social ownership of the means of production, typically motivated by a desire for equality of outcomes, not opportunities, and which typically places less importance on individual freedoms. 

Edit: The link is to a massive wall of text, but the attitude is "I don't care about reactionaries' freedom of speech."  </TEXT>
