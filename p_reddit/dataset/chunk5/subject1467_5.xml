	<TEXT> When I was 14 I used to hang out at a gun shop near my school in the afternoons. Loved it, learned a lot and still remember the guys there fondly.

One day a woman about fifty who looked kind of at the end of her rope came in and talked to the guys about how she was putting on a play and wanted to borrow a "six shooter". She was gently turned down and when she left I was told she would have killed herself with that gun. </TEXT>

I saw some hand sized ones back in the seventies from a pier and at that size they are pretty fast and can scoot right along.

 The wife harasses her husband into coming over and harassing me about the trees on my land, wanting to trim or remove them and I have tried to be accommodating but it has just trained them to think they will get what they want from me so now I have to put on my angry redneck face when dealing with them so they will learn to stay on their own fucking side. </TEXT>

If you pull the trigger and the cylinder rotates and the hammer rises and falls it is operational. I think British law might let you keep it if it is for an obsolete cartridge but you would want to research that fully rather than take my word for it. It really seems a shame to turn it in if it has been in the family that long but jail sucks. </TEXT>

Hwat the hell did you just freaking say about me, you little bobby? I'll have you know I graduated at the top of my class in the sales of propane and propane acessories, and I've been involved in numerous secret propane raids on Thatherton Fuels, and I have over 300 confirmed sales. I am trained in grilla warfare and I'm the top salesman in the entire Strickland Propane company. I will wipe you the hell out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in arlen, mark my god danged words. You think you can get away with saying that crap to me over the phone? Think again, boy. As we speak I am contacting my group of redneck friends across the street and your number is being traced right now so you better prepare for hell, hippie. The hell that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your charcoal grill. You're freaking dead, boy. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can sell to you in over 700 different ways. and thats just with my grill catalog. Not only am I extensively trained in the sales of propane and propane acessories, but I have access to the entire propane and grill stock of Strickland Propane and I will use it to its full extent to sell you a grill thats off the face of the great USA, you little democrat. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" charcoal grill was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your freaking money. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price you god danged idiot. I will spill propane all over you and you will drown in it. You're freaking buying, customer.

	<TEXT> I was in my sleeping bag trying to sleep and heard the sound of heavy footsteps coming toward me so I turned on my flashlight and saw nothing. 

I settled back down and the footsteps started up again and when they were about twenty feet away I turned on the flashlight, and saw nothing.

So I got my revolver out of my pack and waited, they started up again, the crunching sound in the leaves coming straight for me, crunch, crunch, and when it was about five feet away I turned my light on again and found myself facing down with a .38 a tiny little toad that was trying to reach the stream I was camping near. The sound was it hopping through the leaves. </TEXT>
