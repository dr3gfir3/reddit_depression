	<TEXT> Oh hmm. Might be from overmixing the batter and in terms of overbeating the egg whites, I always see that on troubleshooting pages, but I'm not 100% what that means. I feel like it's probably pretty hard to go past stiff peaks. I will say, however, that I suffer from hollows more than I'd like to with this recipe. I can only 100% or close to 100% avoid them when I use the Italian method. I prefer this one though for its ease, quickness, and ability to use smaller amounts of ingredients. I'm still trying to find a sweet spot, but I've found that the hollow issue can be significantly remedied by baking for longer times. The issue is that the insides aren't baking fast enough. So like, immediately out of the oven the cookie will be full, but once it cools, it collapses on itself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So a large number of macarons you get at pastry shops have a flavorless shell (unless it's a flavor that can incorporate dry ingredients, like cocoa or matcha). Instead, the flavor comes from the filling. I am a very big proponent on curds as fillings. They absorb super well into the shell and make the macarons taste phenomenal :). And for curds, you can use any fruit. Ones that have acidity are better, since the can cut through butter taste. But even ones that aren't super, they still taste great. Just concentrate your puree to maximize flavor. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So this is also one of my big pet peeves, but apparently some words in French that have one 'o' have two in English, like 'typhon' in French is 'typhoon' in English, as explained by a friend who speaks French fluently. So maybe purple think they need this extra 'o'. BUT, still a pet peeve and doesn't explain why they pronounce macaron as written, with two o's. Hmph </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Add your batter to a piping bag. The batter is stiff enough, then when you pipe out a circle, it'll stay put. The reason macarons have little ruffled feet is because you let the skin dry out before you bake what your just piped out. This forces the air that you have trapped (from the meringue) to go downward as opposed to up) to form those feet. But yes, you just pipe them into those circles. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Do it! I had loved eating fattening desserts for the longest time. I finally started running 2 years ago, so I figured I now had the room in my diet to start baking haha. Macarons were the second thing I baked and have been trying to get food at them every since. If anything, you gain some good appreciation to why they're so expensive at pastry shops :p  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> /u/no_pants_everday is right. Scales are more accurate than using measuring cups (since whatever you're measuring may be differently compacted). So I basically convert every recipe I see in the English system to metric. Haha. This also goes back to me thinking baking is simply an experimental protocol lol. #scienceftw </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh interesting. There are a few things I can think of off the top of my head. What temperature were they? And did you have a bowl that was completely free of any oil/ fat? Also, aging the egg whites is said to help. For me, I make sure my egg whites are at room temp. (Sometimes I just put them in a bowl and then put that bowl into a larger one with hot water so they can heat up quickly.)   
Also, if there is any fat/oil in your bowl, the meringue will be doomed to fail from the get go.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh, I think recipes that call for number of folds are ridiculous haha. Also which method did you use? Italian or French? (Did you use a simple syrup or did you make them with just sugar and egg whites/ cream of tartar?). If the batter never reaches a lava drip that can mean your almond flour/ powdered sugar amounts are off. Too much dry ingredients can cause this. (It has happened to me when I've added too much matcha powder.)  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That very much sounds like you overmixed your batter. Make sure you have stiff peaks for your meringue as well. In terms of lumpiness, make sure your almond flour is sifted out. To make it extra smooth you can put it in a food processor with powdered sugar. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And the recipe (the same one I use for all my macaron pics I upload here:  
Recipes were modified and adapted from Macarons by Natalie and Macaronguy for the curd. This is the French method.  
 nbsp;  
Macaron Shells  
For about 10 1.5 inch macarons:  
46 g almond flour (sift, no big almond pieces)  
41.5 g powdered sugar (give or take, since kitchen scales don't have this precision)  
35 g egg whites (room temp)  
35 g granulated sugar  
 nbsp;  
1. Oven to 300F (or 325F, see below). Measure out and sift your powdered sugar and almond flour. Whisk together and set aside.  
2. Make your meringue. Beat/ whisk your egg whites until frothy and start to incorporate the granulated sugar a bit a time. Beat until stiff peaks. I added some orange and yellow food coloring shortly before it reached stiff peaks.     
3. Okay. You should look up macaronage (folding of ingredients) on Youtube if you dont know how already.  
 nbsp;  
In summary: add in dry ingredients to the meringue, a third at a time until mixed. And folding by basically scraping along the edge of the bowl and then pressing down along the center in sort of a J shape. Do this until you have a lava like consistency, where you can pick up your spatula and the batter will drop down in a ribbon. My test is to bang the bowl on the table and see if the ribbon that just fell incorporates back into the main blobif it does, its ready. Otherwise, I do a few more folds. Put into a piping bag.   
 nbsp;  
4. Pipe out your macarons. I use a silpat (would highly recommend). Rap the baking sheet against the table a few times.  Pop any air bubbles with a toothpick and swirl the toothpick around a bit to have that hole close up.  
5. I hate waiting for the shells to dry, so I cheat and actually put the oven temp at 325. Then I open the oven and hold the tray in the oven, rotating it every 10 seconds or so for about a minute. Then again for another 30 seconds. This quickly dries out the shells and makes a skin :p.  
You want to be able to touch the shell and have it not be sticky. Then I drop down the oven temp back to 300 (its about this low anyways since the door has been open.).  
6. Bake for 15-20 minutes.  
 nbsp;  
Mango Curd  
1/2 ripe mango         
16 g corn starch  
50 g granulated sugar  
1 egg yolk  
10ish g lemon juice  
28.5 g butter (you can add less depending on how far you take your puree/ cornstarch/ yolk mixture)    
 nbsp;  
1. Puree mango and strain. Heat up until simmering.  
2. Lightly beat the egg yolk and add sugar, sifted corn starch, and lemon juice. Mix/ whisk well.  
3. While whisking, slowly add the heated up mango puree onto the egg/sugar/cornstarch/lemon. You're tempering the egg to prevent it from scrambling. Once it's fully incorporated, add the mixture back into the saucepan and stir constantly on medium. Eventually, it'll start to thicken. I usually thicken until it's a nice paste. [I just got a hand blender, so I now turn that on and blend the mixture while it's heating up to make it super smooth. Not required though.]   
4. Take off the heat and stir in the butter, a little a time. (Or blend it in with your awesome hand blender!)    
5. I transfer to a piping bag and chill it in the fridge or freezer for a short while to firm up before piping onto my macaron shells.  
6. Add gel food coloring to small containers with a few drops of vodka (will dilute out the stickiness of the food coloring and will evaporate quickly.)  
7. I initially tried painting on the red/ green gradient with little success. Then I just tried smudging it on and it worked much better! haha.  
8. Let the shells dry for about 5 minutes before piping in the filling.  
9. Let the macarons rest in an airtight container in the fridge overnight for optimal chewiness!    
Gluck! </TEXT>
