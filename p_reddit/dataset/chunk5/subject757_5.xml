	<TEXT> The only question is how long this clock gets to tick. They get snow days for the cabinet delays, more snow days due to the 'Russian Agenda', which I think we might be about halfway through, snow days for fixing health care, tax reform and killing ISIS, which no one can argue aren't critical milestones that must be reached to maintain the momentum...

However, at some point, they need to take some very specific actions and if they do not, some number of the most rapid supporters will become the most rabid detractors.  </TEXT>

I'm anti-illegal immigrant but I really only have an opinion due to the large number of legal immigrants that I know that have beat it into me. I personally know Indians, Brits, El Salvadorians, Chinese, Brazilians and Argentinians that feel very strongly about this.

That being said, if there is an anomaly that looks like a functioning city that figured out how to get their shit together like good Americans, I could get behind a surprise 2-day amnesty rally for the locals. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks like they beat him; he was outnumbered, and they won. From another article, with some familiar names in the pedo defense brigade.

"Acosta acknowledged to the media in 2011 that he came under extreme pressure from Epstein's high-powered defense team, which included legal heavyweights such as Harvard law professor Alan Dershowitz, former Whitewater independent counsel Kenneth Starr and Florida criminal defense attorney Roy Black.

"Acosta said Epstein's defense mounted "a yearlong assault on the prosecution and the prosecutors."

"I use the word assault intentionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive than any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had previously encountered," the former U.S. attorney wrote. He said his office stuck to its opening position in the case, but he also acknowledged that the ultimate punishment in the case may have been more lenient than Epstein deserved."

Just like Comey; sometimes you lose, but years later, you might have a chance to make things right.

	<TEXT> Let's look deeper. We'll start with the author, Natasha Bertrand. Fortunately she's a prolific [twatterer](https://twitter.com/NatashaBertrand)  so no lack of information. She's shows herself to be a hard core anti-Trumper and mentions every bit of negative Trump information, true or not, that comes her way. Seems obsessed with the Russia angle. 

At least we know where we're starting from. Let's continue.

The source her article is another article written by "Adrian Chen" for the NYT in June 2015. Who is [Adrian Chen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adrian_Chen)?

Oh, yeah, this guy: 

"In October 2012, Chen exposed the real name and details of Violentacrez (a moderator of several Reddit Jailbait communities), a Texas Internet developer, who was subsequently fired from his job. This led to all links to Gawker being temporarily banned from Reddit. In September 2012, Chen acquiesced to demands from Anonymous and posted images of himself dressed in a tutu with a shoe perched on his head. The images had been demanded in exchange for interviews regarding an alleged leak of Apple iPhone and iPad user data from an FBI laptop."

[Shocker, another anti-Trumper obsessed with Russia](https://twitter.com/AdrianChen).

Let's read the [source article](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/07/magazine/the-agency.html)...

Actually, don't. I read it it and I'll save you the time. Chen tells a story about chasing around twatter trolls in 2014 and fills in the blanks with Russian conjecture. It's a horrible LARP that can't be independently verified.

How about the [second source](https://longform.org/posts/longform-podcast-171-adrian-chen). It's a podcast where he drops the single line the entire article is based on "I don't know what's going on, but they're all tweeting about Donald Trump and stuff".

Now we know we are are dealing with. Let's refer back to the first "article". Mentions a few more "articles" as sources, Russia, Russia Russia. Tries to create a narrative by stringing together unsubstantiated and unrelated claims and look, now Putin's on a horse.

Sometimes I wonder if there is actually a memo somewhere that says "the strategy is to just keep associating Trump with Russia to continue our resistance against the administration".  </TEXT>

Probably not the response you're expecting, but...

I have written scripts to create news feeds for myself that are curated by particular topics. I use scoring and weighting to arrange topics and turn it into a visualization. This let's me efficiently consume a great deal of information and shows data that is statistically unique or outlying from the other data. Some of the things considered are source, author, number of hits on google, number of hits on reddit, and a few other sites, etc...

Anyway, this topic looks like it hit multiple entry points at about the same time and shares some other characteristics with other topics I would consider coordinated. </TEXT>

I've never been able to connect to the walking contradiction that is Milo. He mentions some ideas that I might agree with and provides entertainment value triggering snowflakes but I don't feel compelled to defend him or that he speaks for me.

It's fucked up if he was abused as a child and it's fucked up that he said that shit. This looks like a coordinated hit job which makes me wonder about the source. I'll need to do some research.

The pact is real and the time is limited. He has ~90 days more in my opinion, variable upon how much counter insurgence delay has to be factored in, to take real, indisputable action against some people and we'll have this conversation again then. 

Gotta give him some time, especially in the face of this bullshit opposition to letting him try out the ideas he was voted in to fucking do. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You seem to really get worked up about this for a Russian guy. 

Currently his actions don't fit that narrative and you're going to have a hard time selling it until they do. In fact, I'll put forward that he could be a Russian puppet that's enriching himself on the side but so long as it's being spread around America, many would be just fine with that. 

People have a problem when the elites get greedy and even more so when they invite all their shitty friends over from other countries to the party, pass all kinds of rules that don't apply to them and start being shitty to the people paying for the party.

After that happens, people want the opposite of that for awhile. 

I've been asking for days for someone to paint me a narrative of the dark days under Trump. I would love to know what folks think this is going to look like in 2 or 4 years. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Interesting prospect. There's good tidings to be received from every side you support so it's realistic at least to say that he's building good karma with Israel for generations to come. 

It's an interesting problem to have when every action you take directly and indirectly changes the fortunes of others as there will always be reactions from both sides regardless of the initial intent.

That being said, I consider him aligned with Israel on most every point and I expect him to help them kick off the 10th Crusade. </TEXT>

I had an old 'friend' bait me recently. She smelled blood in the water over Flynn and asked if I had "buyer's remorse". 

I responded blandly and didn't address anything directly. That was all it took for the paragraph of adjectives about Trump. The dam had broken and the water was coming my way whether I engaged the conversation or not. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I can't get a past a couple of flaws in my mind. I think you're making a big assumption about a very large diverse group of people and I think that if you believe there is value in what CNN and some of the other MSM outfits put out then you aren't researching your data critically. 

There are many people that used be much more liberal until they started following the "sources" back for the media. After seeing the patterns in messaging, understanding who was ultimately funding that messaging and their motives, some people reject the MSM and continue to examine their information input carefully regardless of source. This in contrast to the "echo chambers" we heard about recently. </TEXT>
