	<TEXT> The main idea is still the same, right. But I get the feeling that in the original script for Episode 5, it wasn't. When I say "changed direction", I'm referring to dropping the threads that you listed in the original post. I get the feeling that with all the things that they were building up to, Max's personal journey, which is the core of the game, would've gotten swept aside. They wouldn't have been able to give us the (relative) quiet time to stop and think. The whole episode would've been plot, plot, plot, and no reflection. The change of direction that I see is, more accurately, Dontnod recognizing that they *had* changed direction and were losing sight of what their story was originally about. I don't have any evidence for this, it's just what I gathered after months on this sub and then playing the finale and what I feel in my gut. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think we're saying more or less the same thing. Where we differ is why they changed direction. You think they had to change direction, I think they wanted to change direction. But ultimately you're right, it does all come down to the money. 

This has been a nice discussion. Hats off to you for your theorizing, and thank you for being respectful. I hope I haven't been bugging you with this. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT>   In a year where thats seen Metal Gear Solid V, Destiny: The Taken king, Transformers Devastation and the sublime Rocket League, Life is Strange more than holds its own. I dont often gush wildly over something, but the way LiS made me feel was unlike anything else I played this year.

It's fine if you don't like Life is Strange; I get that it's not a game for everyone. But what you can't deny is the game's originality. It's different, and it's beautiful for it.  </TEXT>

There's so much real emotion in their eyes, and they were hand animated. Hats off to Dontnod. The eyes never lie, and as far as I'm concerned Chloe Price is a real person. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Since you're the smart one (*jesus christ those screenshots*) I'm not going to completely disagree with you, but I just get the feeling that they completely wrote themselves into a corner and that's why so many of those threads were abandoned. And yeah, the writers aren't making the executive decisions, but I doubt the game directors and producers (maybe not Square) would've rather forced them to put out a game they weren't proud of. The writing team does have some influence.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for writing this, and thanks for doing all this research. You're one dedicated motherfucker alright. :) I have a different idea as to what happened with Episode 5. Bear with me? 

So I think you are 100% right in regards to all the plot points and elements you listed above being removed. I think there's no denying that there was initially WAY more to Episode 5's story than what we got in the finished product. Sean Prescott, Nathan, Samuel, and all the supernatural business going in on Arcadia Bay, *especially* in regards to the nature of Max's powers and the storm. I believe the original script was going to delve deep into these areas. 

Here's where you and I differ. I don't think Dontnod and Square decided not to put money and effort into completing the original vision. Surely, if it was what they had planned out from the beginning, they would've been able to fund it with the original budget? ***I think what happened is the writers had a complete change of heart.*** Think for a second, what has Life is Strange *always* been about? Max and Chloe. The relationship between those two characters always took precedence over the mysteries of Arcadia Bay. But then all these other elements began to be introduced. The supernatural, the Prescott conspiracy, etc. I can't help but remember the period of theorizing that followed Episode 4 and how worried I was that the finale would be a convoluted mess. Even looking at these loose threads now, after much though, I have absolutely no fucking idea how they could have been integrated into the story in a natural manner. And that's the thing, I think the writers realized that they had bit off more than they could chew. There was no way they could answer so many questions, reveal every secret, conclude the conspiracy AND maintain the emotional center that was Max and Chloe's bond in a way that worked. I think the original script for Episode 5 was almost completely abandoned late in development. That's where I think the money went: I think they may have been maybe half way through Episode 5 before realizing that what they had wasn't working. I think the reason Episode 5 felt rushed and kind of cheaply made was because they literally rushed through it's script and had about 50-60% of the budget for the episode left. I genuinely don't think they hung us out to dry; I think they wrote themselves into a fucking corner. They got swept away in the amazing world they had dreamed up and forgot what their focus was. How could they have balanced the emotional roller coaster with the winding plot (in just one episode)? I think ultimately the writers chose to abandon the story of Arcadia Bay in order to focus entirely on giving us a worthy conclusion to Max Caulfield and Chloe Price's journey (or at least their best attempt at a worthy conclusion). I think they chose between a rushed, shaky ending that stayed true to the core of the game, and a fleshed out and polished episode that tied off all loose ends but lost sight of the original themes. 

As for the Hospital Ending, the third ending? I think they had just completely run out of resources after pulling a complete 180 midway through development and had to sacrifice one of the endings. Max wasn't the only one who had to make a hard choice and sacrifice something important.  

**TL;DR** I think Dontnod wrote themselves into a corner with the mysteries of Arcadia Bay and were forced to pull a complete 180 mid-development in order to focus on the game's main themes and characters. As a result, they didn't have enough $$ left to flesh everything out fully. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think I know exactly what you mean. After spending the better part of a year in Arcadia Bay I started to feel like Chloe (not as much Max, I kinda *was* Max) was a real person, and a friend. Having them be gone just like that...was kinda jarring. As much as I love my friends and have always loved my friends, I used to think I was a lone wolf. Or at least that I could be a lone wolf. But now I see things differently. I don't want to be alone anymore. I think it's something that I've always known, but something that I never really admitted. My friends are my everything. 

Returning to what you were saying (I may have went off for a second), I'm right there with you in wanting a "soulmate" (I prefer partner in crime and time, but whatever). It could be in a romantic sense or in a best friend sense, or both. I love my friends, but sometimes I feel like there's gaps between us. Like I can't really talk to them. Or, more accurately, like they can't talk to me. Even in the case of my two best friends, I feel like there's just this distance between us (in one case a mental/emotional/personality distance, in the other a literal distance called the Atlantic). It's something I've been thinking about a lot lately, just like you I suppose. 

This is the aftermath of the feels trip called Life is Strange I guess. Thanks for putting this out there. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Speaking for myself...yeah. You hit the nail on the head. I'm a guy, and I wish I could have a friendship like that. I'm already pretty bromancy (for lack of a better term) with my best friends, buuuuuut I wish it could be a little more. I'm not concerned about coming off as "gay" or anything, that doesn't really make a difference to me and I'm not insecure about my sexuality or anything like that, I just get that most other guys including my friends aren't comfortable past a certain point. But I don't know, I'm pretty weird. 

I do feel like that line is slowly dissolving though. The bromance (what's another word for it?) levels today (at least in my experience) are a lot higher than they would've been ten years ago. We're learning to leave behind the arbitrary gender role stuff.

Having Max and Chloe as female protagonists is great because they can have that open relationship without having to hold up these dumb macho masculinity masks that so many of us guys wear. They can actually talk and be open with each other and bond and be adorable and shit. If they were guys, they might have been a bit more awkward and tentative.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hold up:

 Almost all fan art has some sexual overtone.

I don't think you can deny the sexual tension between Max and Chloe. Just watch the pool scene. Now does that mean there has to be romance between them? Not necessarily. Doesn't change the sexual tension. 

But yeah, Pricefield is generally the most attractive and accessible ship, which is why so much of the fanbase is cuckoo for ChloexMax. Myself included. It's not denying that other ships are valid, it's just a popular preference I guess.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think it's necessarily the Bae ending, it's just some people not respecting others' totally valid opinions. But what do you expect, after we've been "Polarized"? I can recognize the reasoning behind choosing to sacrifice Chloe, but I'll never really understand it. That's why I chose to sacrifice the town. But like I said, I can still recognize that there are valid reasons for picking the Bay ending. End of discussion, everybody's happy?

Probably not, but fuck it. If people be hatin on you, tune it out. There are more nice people here than douches.  </TEXT>

Well, not during the time gap. But then I also wouldn't remember experiencing LiS for the second first time anyways, so that wouldn't change anything. Fuck. I give up. I have no use for that power.

	<TEXT> Sure. "Love at first sight" is kinda bogus-ey, but there is truth to it. Some people just click. Not to be all cliche sappy and shit, but when I met one of my best friends for the first time I *felt* that we were going to be really good friends. And friendship is just another name for/form of love. That's all I'm saying.

Well, actually all I was saying was that Max is less weirded out by Warren and more just scared by her own insecurities. Just as with Chloe in the nightmare (in her underwear, taunting her, making out with everyone but her), that wasn't Max's subconscious perception of Warren (or Chloe). That was her fears and insecurities in regards to him. And fears and insecurities are often irrational (in the case of her fear of Chloe not being interested in her, that turned out to be *completely* irrational).  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's made me value the people around me a lot more. I used to believe that I was on my own path, that I didn't need anyone else (though of course I enjoyed my friends' company), that I could take on the world alone. Life is Strange made me realize that we all need friends. Everyone needs a Chloe to be able to confide in, to talk to, to experience both the good and the bad with. You can't walk this walk alone, and neither can they. My relationships with my two best friends (one is a Warren, one is a Chloe) have improved, become more open and more comfortable. Life is Strange taught me a thing or two about love...and that's a pretty powerful thing.

But more importantly, I've started saying "hella" a lot. I've also developed an affinity for beans, and I've become very attached to said beans. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think an important thing to point out is that *Max is not afraid of or disgusted by Warren*. She says in the "Go Ape" entry that he's like a brother to her, and we see over and over again that she genuinely appreciates him and confides in him. She's either **a)** just not sexually attracted to him, or **b)** she's just intimidated by the idea of a relationship like that (I think we can assume that Max has never really dated anyone or done anything, so it's completely understandable that the concept would be scary), and that's why Warren's presence in her nightmare is what it is. Max isn't weirded out by him, she's weirded out by their relationship being something different. *That's completely normal*. If you're already friends with someone, it can be hard to have that friendship change into something else. We can even see a bit of that in Max's journal in regards to Chloe: on the final page of her journal Max actually questions the nature of their relationship, whether it's friendship or something more. 

Point is, Max still loves Warren. He is her dear friend after all. I personally don't see what you might call a "romance" between them (Team Chloe, sorrynotsorry), but Max certainly does care about Warren and appreciate his company.  </TEXT>
