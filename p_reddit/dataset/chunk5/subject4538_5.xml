	<TEXT> For the past couple years, I've become very interested in scarification and branding. I like the idea of being able to put a mark on myself - basically a self-made scar or reminder, something no one else can do, and much cheaper than getting a tattoo. Therefore, I've concluded that using a bovie cauterizing pen would be my best bet. It's safe, sterile, and used by doctors to seal wounds. I'd sincerely appreciate it if someone could buy me one. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I was a girl scout from 2004 to 2008 in Dallas, Texas. It was kinda shitty. The troop leaders, two church ladies, would bring up a couple of ideas - spa day, ride horses on a ranch, make doggy care bags, for example - and we'd vote on which one we'd plan to do. We never went to a museum or learned any survival skills. Once I left, I realized that it was actually the boy scouts that got to do all the cool stuff - archery, fishing, camping for weeks on end in the summer. I wish I could've been in the boy scouts.


Oh yeah. The cookie money? I remember the one year we all made an effort for it, we spent 50 bucks on getting a kid in africa a goat or something, and the remaining 350 dollars we had we spent on an overnight stay at great wolf lodge.


I don't buy girl scout cookies anymore. I'm honestly kinda ashamed of having been a part of that, and the cookies were never that good to me anyway. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, of course. Why should people have to keep suffering just because others want them to live? My grandma's got terrible dementia, bowel problems, and is becoming less and less like herself every day. A few weeks ago, in a brief moment of clarity, she asked my mom's brother to help her die. That's what she wants more than anything right now. Her husband and children have to see her suffer every day, but no one's allowed to help her die because they'd be arrested. It's horrible. I just want her to die peacefully, with as little pain as possible, and that way is assisted suicide. </TEXT>

When I don't feel like working hard or studying something (I'm a senior btw, this happens too often), I sit myself down with the work I gotta do, put my laptop and phone out of reach, and make a checklist of every worksheet or essay I gotta do by the end of the day. Then, organize the first thing on that list in front of you and work on it until it's done. Then move on to the next one. It's probably the only way I can get my ass in gear and tell myself "Okay. Do you wanna be a hobo when you grow up? Do you wanna work at a gas station? No? Then work your ass off and graduate so you can do whatever after high school." </TEXT>
