	<TEXT> If you yell fire in a theater and people are injured because of the ensuing panic, then you would be legally liable for any damage/injuries that happen.

If you yell fire and no panic ensues, then you will more than likley just be asked to leave the theater by the theater staff.

The act of yelling fire is not actually a crime and comparing it to this story is quite silly.
