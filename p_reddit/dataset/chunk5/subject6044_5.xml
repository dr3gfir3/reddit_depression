And yet for religion it would change almost everything. And atheists use that often in their arguments. 

While still for you it is 'nothing'

It's a good racket this atheism thing. The ultimate way of winning everything by never playing. It's almost Zen. 

But not quite.

I left that one out. Not all atheists need to resort to that - it's kind of dodging the issue in a very lame way, has no academic back-up and is not even necessary. Basically very lazy.

I didn't reference it because, no matter my opinions of atheists in general, they're way better than that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I get you, however, MU would clearly show that God is a human invention though. It would not bolster any religious arguments - it would weaken them all.

It might not. It would probably take out a few of the more inflexible religions and dogmas but it would really only shift the paradigm from 'Creator of the Universe' to 'Creator of Universes' surely? </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes... true. But the issue is a twofold one. As I understand it atheists generally argue against two things in this context:

1) the divinity of Jesus

2) the possibility of miracles and supernatural happenings

It seems to me that the argument #2 is often used against #1 and in a more general sense.

In this case #2 is taken out of the equation - it would have to be admitted that miracles occur and that religion just misread the cause.

Which is my position more or less anyway but I'm pretty sure it's not an atheist perspective. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If you already concede that Jesus might not exist in the other universes then it clearly shows that he is a human invention 

No.. it doesn't show he's an invention. That's irrational. How could he be an invention if he existed here but not there? That could apply to any of us in the model surely? Are we all inventions? Maybe we are...

It more likely shows he's just human and not divine though. Especially if he is just an ordinary guy in one of them.

By the way, you're also conflating the belief in a religion with the truth of the religion itself.

No, I am only talking about belief as a consequence of experience. I don't think the MU would impact on the existence of God one way or another so is not about that.

It would not matter if Dawkins was a televangelist (which hardly a good example of a believer anyway) that still does not make religion any more or less plausible.

True, agree there. </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> The idea of multiple universes is often cited as being - if proved - a massive problem for religion, but might it not be the opposite case? Ie an argument in favour of religion and a problem for atheists?

For an example: Jesus's miracles could just be one example of something that happens in one in a million universes. It just happens to be ours.

Also if we are products of our beliefs and experiences then maybe one person's atheism (or faith) would not be present in other universes. Maybe somewhere Dawkins is a televangelist? Or the Pope is instead an evolutionary biologist?

Surely acceptance of the MU model raises more tricky theological and philosophical issues than it resolves?

	<TEXT> There's a pretty in-depth assessment at the link below.

It comes down to maths.

If you take the hadith and work out A'isha's age in relation to known facts then she could not have been 6. 

In short:

 Aishah (r.a.) was 67 when she passed away in 50 AH, seventeen at the time of the Hijrah, sixteen at the time of her betrothal to the Prophet (s.a.w.), and nineteen when she moved in with him.  This cannot be contested unless we bend the rules of arithmetic.

And further the ONLY hadith that argue for the 6/9 age (not all do by any means) *ALSO* mathematically prove the 16 age - they are therefore contradictory:

the only reports that Aishah (r.a.) was six, or nine, come from someone who also reports that she had to be sixteen when betrothed, and nineteen when she moved in with the Prophet (s.a.w.).

	<TEXT> geneshackman - it's saying the latter. 'Allah' is the name of God in Islam not a specific name of an Islamic deity.. so the Jews and Christians cited there would say 'Allah' for their God too. Still do.

This translation I copied and pasted from is maybe a little archaic.. there are others that make the point better and it says it in other places in Qur'an too. 

Islam holds that these previous religions are also sent from God and that the Prophets of those religions were actually also sent from God: Jesus, Moses etc... so it follows that those following them (if the religion at that point was uncorrupted) would be following the same religion in a sense... or at least worshipping the same God.

Btw, this cuts the other way too: Islam also teaches that not all Muslims will go to heaven and in fact maybe very few will. It says specifically that in the end-times the Muslims there will be the furthest from Islam. 

The end-time prophecies are pretty much exactly what we are seeing now btw and even describe an ISIS-like group, the rise of building and riches in Saudi and certain forms of modern technology. 

I might start a thread on it but am a bit scared of the Karma-cost.

	<TEXT> Hi, thanks for this... it seems like a good way to start off. Especially as we have no following as of now. The field for sure is one of quite wide interest with numerous communities - I don't think there'd be difficulty getting a following because there is a lot of 'blogable' issues around the product and it's a very active area in terms of research/discussion and even podcasts.

My main concern would be though that if we're all set up and running with a store then what would the KS be  framed for? We basically need some cash for running-costs, salaries, website and some demo product.

We have some cash to invest obviously but we were going to KS the site and use our investment for running costs. In this scenario we'd have to cover the website costs and the running costs for a year somehow so that negates the need for a KS right?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good question - Maybe I should have been clearer. I guess I am asking about the level of transparency required and whether the allocation of any donated funds is a factor in the success.

In the main we need funding for:

1) The website

2) some of the demo machines

3) costs of (say) 5 pop-up demos during the first year

4) one years' salary for one person - scaled back to as low as poss. We are a team of 3, the others will not take salary for the first year. 

I guess I'm asking that if we itemised all that would we be judged on the allocation of these funds or do people donate on the basis of whether they like the project regardless of that. 

Also, I suppose we're newbies and a bit skeptical that it could work because we don't have a pool of supporters in place. Not sure how to reach them or whether during the life of the campaign it would be possible to reach enough - so I'm asking that too. 

Also to what degree would it depend on the 'perks'? </TEXT>

	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> I am starting an online business and am considering making a Kickstarter for it but not sure if it is the right way to go. 

I can't say much about the business in detail but in brief it is an online store selling items related to Spiritual applications of technology. For example devices to induce meditative states or lucid dreams, personal float tanks, binaural beats and books, material related to these applications. 

The business will be online but we will promote it through occasional pop-up events and demos at appropriate venues and conferences. 

We don't envisage carrying much stock - we're pretty much mainly looking at despatch on order from the manufacturers in some cases but we do need some demo machines and some part of the running costs. We've got about a third of the funding from our own pocket but probably would need about 50k more. 

My questions really are two:

1) Would this business and this amount be a good project to attempt to Crowdfund? Any resources anyone can point to for us to gen up on this?

2) I've heard that it all depends on your Social Media reach to a large extent. Is this true? If so then there might be a problem because we don't have one or any pool of likely donators. 

Any recs, tips or help gratefully received! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If I was one of the people who witnessed one of the supposedly supernatural miracles of Jesus, what would probably happen is the following:

With the greatest respect I don't believe that and in fact it's impossible that you could have reacted that way. Here's why:

Me: But that's impossible, how did you do that?
Jesus: I'm the son of God, and you can join my father's kingdom in heaven by accepting me

Jesus never claimed to be the Son of God. *Modern Christians* claim he did but no responsible academic authority (who is objective and not Christian) accords with this view. Many Christian academics are honest enough to admit it to. 

So this is #1. Jesus would not have said this. He **might** have said that you could do the miracles too - that was his teaching. For example when he walsk on the water he also tells Peter he can do the same if he has faith. And he does. Sort of. 

Me: Sounds good. From now on, I am a Christian. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm just gonna go back to fishing day and night and being heavily taxed and abused by the Romans for the next decade or so

This would not have happened either. At this point there was no such thing as 'Christianity' but Jesus had 12 disciples who he was teaching individually. It is by no means a given that you or anyone else would be permitted to join this group and there is no record of Jesus seeking to add to it anywhere in the Gospels. He preached to many people a certain message but he did not recruit. 

Also there is a large amount of evidence that Jesus was in fact leading some sort of armed insurrection against the Romans (he positioned himself as the Messiah who had exactly this warrior-role, he told his disciples to arm, his punishment was by the Romans not the Jews as it would be for blasphemy, the punishment is for crimes against the state etc) so it seems from your comment re this that you MIGHT be interested in joining such a militia if possible. 

Jesus: Good, good, that's the spirit, my faithful adherent! Now, I must go, there are more people to convert

See above - Jesus at no point tried to convert anyone to a faith. Possibly this developed after this death with the actions of the apostles. 

Me: holds up finger. Wait a minute. On second thought, your dad's crib sounds pretty sweet, much better than what I have right now. Why don't I just... takes rope, kicks chair

Not sure about this as it doesn't make sense. We can pass on it I think. 

Surprised none of the witnesses did.

I have the answers why they didn't above. No need to thank me.

	<TEXT> But, I think that the differences are more important in order to understand the religions.

Sure... but that is not the point of the translation is it? It's addressing different concerns and countering the more divisive views.

Btw - regarding your point there is no key point in Islam that was not believed by one or another early Christian grouping.. some of them quite major groups.

It has long been an argument in academia that Islam could be viewed as a Christian sect and  - while I don't agree on theological grounds - it is impossible to argue against academically.

1) Jesus did not die on cross... Gnostic belief

2) Jesus was not divine - early Christian belief of some groups. See Aryans and Nestorians

3) No resurrection - concomittant of #1

4) Virgin birth - both accept

5) Second coming - both accept

6) No Trinity - many early Christian groups did accept.

	<TEXT> In short: keep the rational criticism of Islam coming. It's interesting and there isn't enough of it.

Absolutely agree. 

The problem though is a little worse than you state it. What we need in the West is a coherent overview of what Islam is and what Muslims believe. We don't have that. 

Because we don't have that we are in the position of a) people arguing against some aspect which does not exist or is wrongly interpreted and b) muslims having to explain what the religion actually is and then getting bogged down in arguments about why they are wrong. 

It is quite legitimate to criticise Islam but the debate should be surrounding established actualities. Right now it isn't - we need to get more understanding of what Islam actually teaches and what it doesn't.

After that people can have at it but right now we're not working from the same playbook.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In terms of literature, the Quran be no where near the top of literary masterpieces, 

How is your academic grasp of world literature? What was your Phd in again?

unless you ask of course, a muslim.

So very wrong. Most would be pretty averse to my claims. Only an academic in the field and/or academic who happens to be muslim would hold this view. 

If you constrain the criteria to "Arabic poetic forms", than perhaps your argument carries some weight...

Not really. You clearly know nothing of the Middle Eastern masterpieces which actually DO exist. Probably you think there are none, that would not surprise me, but there is quite a list. And the Qur'an is on it.

We are all subject to bias, but I am not so biased as to not recognize a great piece of literature when I see it, 

And yet what are your criteria? Are you capable of separating content from style as an academic has to? I somehow think not. I happen to know several academics in the field who are atheists who do recognise the Qur'an as a literary masterpiece but then they do speak Arabic and they are capable of that detachment.

Neither are most western authors and academics.

Oh dear. In the field of Middle Eastern Literature - surely the only criteria that matters in terms of academia - you are almost 100% wrong. 

I don't speak arabic 

Oh

(Why was the beauty of God's eternal message confined to just one language?)

It wasn't and isn't. Islam teaches that Revelations are sent to different peoples at different times. 

"To every people was sent an apostle" and "We sent not an apostle except to teach in the language of his own people, in order to make things clear to them."

Please do not try to tell me I have to learn arabic to appreciate the Quran. In case you don't know, fine poetry and literature can be translated and still keep it's meaning/beauty.

Yes. By a poet. Do you know of a poetic translation?

What other languages do you speak? Choose one and we can discuss how Shakespeare renders in it. I'm guessing you might want to argue that Shakespeare is equally Shakespeare in - say - Farsi. I hope you do.... it will be fun. 

I would love to see some general consensus amongst (non-muslim) intellectuals/writers throughout history praising the Quran as a fine work of literature.

You won't find it throughout history for the same reason you won't find any Japanese, Korean, African, Persian, Malay or other non-Western works in the Canon. 

Now if you want to take the totality of non-Western countries, take all their literature - you can even leave out all religious texts if you like - and argue that there are NO masterpieces in that grouping which deserve to be lauded I would love to have that discussion. The fact is the Western tradition is focussed on.... well, the Western tradition. There are reasons for it. None of them good. 

In terms of academia the situation is different. Not hard to research. Choose any top University with relevant departments: Princeton, Oxford, Edinburgh and look at their curriculums and lecturers then research their publications. 

Than what purpose did telling me "many people said Muhammad was illiterate" serve. I don't give a fuck about anecdotes.

Yes. I got that. You're not really the most rigorous academic seeker of truth. I did catch that. 

Is that outside the realm of possibilities? The Quran was compiled after his death, is it impossible that these scribes may have wanted to embellish their holy prophet's message?

It's not impossible but hard to argue. 

What about the ones who had a firm religious belief that it should remain unaltered? Would they stand by and let it happen? Were the scribes all poets? Unlikely. 

The odd thing here is something I always find hilarious. I'll share it with you and why it is so amusing. Atheists are always trying to discredit Islam but they remind me of the 'Vulture Squadron' of Dick Dastardly and Muttley. They never quite 'Catch the Pigeon' despite all their crazy schemes.

The funny thing is that most muslims know many areas where the atheists could really score some points but -a nd this is the hilarious part - atheists hammer away at things that score them no points at all and - despite claiming to be rational and knowing far more, being serious researchers etc - *they never ever even realise these weak points exist*.

Even more hilarious - and this is what has happened in this discussion - you can almost spell it out for them and hint at if from all different angles but they'll still **never get it**. 

It's like a bad thriller where the murderer is playing with a blood-stained knife in front of the 'Top Detective' who is just constantly giving a speech saying "that's the problem with you killers - I can see you're guilty by the fact you're wearing a hat but you're too stupid... you should have taken it off!!!"

In this case, if you had really researched the academic area and knew about the debates around this issue you would know that many academics have faced this problem and argued that the poetic forms of the Qur'an stem from Aramaic Christian panegyric hymns. 

Of course I don't agree with them but you should really know the argument. It's one of the mainstays of academic alternatives which atheist academics in the field argue to counter the Revelation argument. They don't - as you do - resort to "Qur'an is boring and not poetry". 

If you're going to fight in this arena you should really do it properly and come fully armed. Or at least be a master of your weapon if it happens to be a small and inappropriate one.

	<TEXT> I'm having trouble understanding your comment. Can you simplify it for me?

Sure. As we know the Qur'an does in fact exist there are 4 possibilities:

1) God revealed it

2) Muhammad wrote it himself

3) someone else wrote it

4) Muhammad 'channelled it' in some way

Muslims believe #1 (and #4 if you think he channelled it from God).

Atheists can't believe #1 or really #4 so they go for #2 but this is a problem if they don't also argue he was a great poet. For which there is no evidence and which they would be very loathe to do anyway because, you know, 'Islam sucks' lol

	<TEXT> This is your (biased)opinion. 

No, it's the opinion of academics and experts in Arabic poetic forms. Is your opinion unbiased would you say?

I for one think it is incoherent, repetitive, boring, and unremarkable. 

How is your Arabic? It should really be more than remarkable itself for you to be an objective judge on that particular issue

This high literary esteem given to the Quran seems to stem almost exclusively from Muslims, coincidence?

Can't really be a coincidence because it's not actually the case. Can provide numerous academic references if required.

And this is some sort of proof that he was illiterate? 

Nope. It's you hung up on proof not me. As I always say, I don't give a fuck about proof. It's not like I'm an atheist. 

how are we to know that his scribes were not well versed in poetry?

I suppose such a view would entail a belief that a) Muhammad said one thing and b) the poetic scribes went to work on it altering it poetically and c) no-one noticed or mentioned it.

Stranger things have been believed I suppose. It's as rational as any other atheist take on the matter I guess.

	<TEXT> Otherwise stated: your argument is a completely seperate one and doesn't handle this argument directly. It skirts the issue entirely by trying to change the focus of the argument.
The problem with this 'master poet' argument is that you cannot objectively prove to me that the Quran is beautiful poetry. I have no idea what that is even supposed to mean.
So, arguing he's either receiving a message from God or is a master poet is a false duality for me: we're ignoring the third option where he's a middling poet who elevated himself by falsing claiming to commune with a deity.
All you've done is attempt to spin the argument into something so subjective and relatively obscure so no one can make an argument against it. We weren't asking about beautiful poetry, we were asking why Muhammad tends to receive messages about dinner etiquette from God.

Ok. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> But what you're trying to prove is that the Qur'an (which was spoken by Muhammad) is divine. That's what I'm disagreeing with.

Yeah I hear you. My point is that the poetry of the Qur'an is - in the East and not just among Muslims but among academics - of an extremely high standard. Which is taken by Muslims to be a proof of divine origin... especially as Muhammad was no poet and had a low opinion of them. 

Despite the lack of understanding on this issue elsewhere on this thread I'd argue it's directly relevant and of interest to both atheists and the discussion in general. 

Far from me wanting to 'prove' the divinity of the Qur'an (I am attempting no such thing) I am merely framing the debate. It would be a far more fruitful approach to argue someone other than Muhammad wrote the Qur'an if you want to go that route. That's the line I would take if I was an atheist.

You could build a nice case - but I won't do your work for you! Look into it. It's far more likely than that he wrote it. If one is to stick with the 'he wrote it' angle then it's going to go into 'channelled works' (of which there are many in history and maybe it is even one.. who knows?) but the options are few:

1) God revealed it

2) Muhammad wrote it

3) someone else wrote it

4) Muhammad 'channelled it'

That's it. 

I see though that I have made a mistake here. It's in assuming that these debates are looking for some degree of resolution or closure. I do not - and have never on this sub or on Reddit - argue for the Islamic position. I just argue for facts. You can take or leave them... or if there are no facts (as in this case) the facts are the options above 1-4. Again take or leave.

My mistake though is doing that... because many here already have 'the Truth' and don't like to look at options.

OP Says:

it seem obvious that the Quran was written by Mohammed for his own interests, as Aisha commented. 

I address this EXACTLY by saying that the Qur'an is poetry of a hight standard and IF Muhammad wrote it he would be a great poet... which he is not recognised as.

It would be up there with the canon of world literature in world cultural terms. For sure would be one of the greatest poetic masterpieces of the Middle East - and there are very, very many, some ranking alongside the greats of the West. 

So Muhammad would be one of the greatest living poets of world history. But he would have written only one thing. When all around documenting his life (many people) attest that he did not write or create and was illiterate.

It requires a conspiracy to HIDE the fact that he was one of the greatest ever poets on behalf not only of himself but very many other people with no-one ever going off-script.

Britain has an identity as a tolerant inclusive society. Attitudes that deviate from that ideal by a large degree can be seen as 'extreme'. 

I would also bet that the same people who object to this label - you may even fall into this category, I don't know - don't have any problem labelling, say, Islamists as 'extremists'.

	<TEXT> Well as muslims we have to be. Everyone should be honest anyway, otherwise what's the point?

Re the Night Journey as a vision again - check this hadith from Muhammad's wife who relates he did not leave the room that night:

One of Abu Bakr's family told me that Aisha, the Prophet's wife, used to say: "The apostle's body remained where it was but God removed his spirit by night". (Ibn Ishaq, Sirat Rasulullah, p. 183).

Which clearly shows it could not have been literal. Whether muslims believe this or not is irrelevant. 

If you can prove that the majority of muslims DO believe it is literal then you would also be forced to concede that the majority of muslims do not necessarily have a deep understanding of the sources and draw their beliefs from tradition rather than Scripture. Which opens up other problems (incidentally I would agree with this view - most muslim belief is cultural at this point).

	<TEXT> Well I'm a normal version and I don't. And when asked - as you did - I can cite the Qur'an to show how it was clearly a vision and point to the hundreds of historical examples of mystics (which Muhammad was, being a Prophet) who've had similar visions. 

A question for you: in all the examples of flying horses we know of from cultural tradition, do you claim that ALL of the people relating these stories believed they had a literal existence?

The poet Robert Graves for example is famous for writing "The Greek Myths" which is a modern retelling. Do you claim he believed that Pegasus literally existed?

If not why not? What makes you not do it in that case but do it in Islam's case? Is it just Mehdi Hussain? Don't know who 'Hassad' is but I think you mean him if you are talking about the guy Dawkins makes this claim of.

If you don't want us to ask questions like this, address the muslims who say it. Don't whine at us when we ask very reasonable questions about the beliefs muslims TELL us they adhere to.

I don't mind you asking questions like this? Why would I? It gives me a chance to write on a topic I love and maybe you will learn something. Maybe not - it doesn't matter. Someone may do who reads it. 

I also do discuss these issues with Muslims constantly and have done for decades. Maybe it's YOU who needs to do more of that? None of them have the view you claim they do and those that do - Hussain could be one for all I know - don't believe it in the way you claim. 

Let's try some bullet point logic:

1) I personally believe in the case under discussion it was a vision

2) Hussain MAY believe this also or may not in this specific case

3) It is irrelevant because he is talking about something else: whether he believes God is capable of manifesting a winged horse. 

4) If you believe that Allah created the universe including all designs of animals and wingless horses AND you believe He could do this again at any time AND you believe He does miracles then it would follow that He would have no problem with a winged horse. 

Why do you therefore choose 'winged horse' as your target? It's obvious a God who created everything could create a Winged Horse. Why don't you instead point to the Universe? Is far more ridiculous (in your view) to believe God created that - why not say 'Muslims believe God created the whole entire Universe - that's crazy! hahahah' ? Why just pick a winged horse?

I think there are two reasons:

1) Atheists are fixated on winning and being right. This is why they always ask for proof of things that require faith - when no proof is forthcoming 'they win the internets!'. So a Winged Horse does not exist - you win!

2) It is good to get peer approval about how rational you are and it's a useful tool to mock and portray the target as stupid. 

All a bit silly really.

	<TEXT> This is a huge problem with atheist 'thought' - it is essentially literalism. Pretty much the only muslims who believe this is literal are well, literalists. We call some of them Daesh. 

Another problem is the arrogance which precludes any research. I always thought the lack of research was mainly due to 'not wanting to handle toxic substances' sort of thing. They hate religion so much they can't bear to look at it. 

If they did.. in this case, they would note two things:

1) The Qur'an explicitly states that parts of the book are metaphors and allegories and not to be taken literally. 

2) the Night Journey (that's the part where the Winged Horse appears) was a vision. 

Then I realised that it could not just be ignorance and lack of research because there are other non-Islamic things that play into this. 

The motif of the Winged Horse is a common Shamanistic motif throughout the region and throughout traditional societies historically. 

So we have: a mystic who has visons. A Shamanistic Motif. A text which states it uses metaphorical motifs. A motif known to be seen in visions.

And yet atheists and Fundie muslims still assume it is meant literally. How can that be?

It gets worse. Western scholars such as Eliade and Campbell have widely documented exactly this motif in Western contexts - Pegasus would be one example - and shown how this is a common factor in Shamanistic visionary experience. 

They don't talk about Islam or address Muhammad. They talk about any other examples.

So it seems that even the research of leading Western thinkers is not known.

That flies with some ignorant backwater muslim fundie.... but if you want to claim some higher 'cancer-free' rational superiority it's kind of embarrassing you don't know this stuff and ask silly questions no?

	<TEXT> Nothing explicitly but pretty much all Islamic philosophy builds on Qur'an and there are many models in the traditions.

This is maybe one explanation in the link below. Interestingly - not saying I agree or disagree with this - this model sees 5 universes with God only being 'God' in our universe #4. It's an interesting take.

Basically pedophile priests were running rampant molesting kids in their care and covering it up over decades. When it came out the Vatican recalled some of the priests and disappeared them (ie hid them from the authorities).

In another case here in the last few years was widespread and systematic theft of babies by nuns. I'm not making it up. 

This is just one example, there are literally dozens going back decades.

	<TEXT> So is it more or less likely that this universe is unique? Why or why not? Why does it alter or affect your belief it isn't mentioned (directly) that there were several created?

In Islam it is pretty much accepted that there are numerous universes. Allah is referred to as "Lord of all the Worlds" and there are multi-universe theories by muslim thinkers going back to the 11th century. Most famous is probably al-Raziw who argued for multiple universes against Aristotle.

Lastly, have you considered that the human being is only a sub-type of a being category? 

Again, stated in Qur'an that this is the case and other beings - such as Djinn - exist.

	<TEXT> Are the beliefs of Islam true beliefs about the real world?

It depends what you mean I suppose. I guess they don't conflict otherwise you would not have the advances of Islamic science that laid the foundation for the Renaissance: algebra, algorithms, chemistry etc...

All of those advancements stemmed from Islamic belief in a way that would have been impossible in Christian traditions for theological reasons. 

These are 'Islamic beliefs' to me as there is no conflict between science and Islam - muslims even advanced a theory of evolution hundreds of years before Darwin. That would be an 'Islamic belief' too.

If you mean the statements of the Qur'an then there's a lot of leeway. Qur'an itself claims that parts of it are not literal and are metaphorical. It says only some parts are literal but does not say which... so there's a choice there. You're allowed any opinion on it (unless you're a Wahabi lol).

Also this hadith from Muhammad:

"The Quran possesses an external appearance and a hidden depth, an exoteric meaning and an esoteric meaning. This esoteric meaning in turn conceals an esoteric meaning so it goes on for seven esoteric meanings (seven depths of hidden depth)."

Which is taken to mean that some people can perceive things on very different levels that might even contradict. 

Another one from a famous Imam:

"The book of God comprises four things: the statement set down, the allusions, the hidden meanings relating to the supra-sensible world, and the exalted spiritual doctrines. The literal statement is for the ordinary believers. The allusions are the concern of the elite. The hidden meanings pertain to the friends of God. The exalted spiritual doctrines are the province of the prophets."

I'm not posting the above to prove anything or to claim it is true but more to show that there is room for all sorts of approaches in an Islamic context.

	<TEXT> But as I understand it one can't hold this view and be Muslim.

In general that's true. But it's more tricky. Most ordinary muslims aren't interested in theology or philosophy but the history of Islamic philosophy has delved pretty far into this and if were to take a philosophical rather than 'everyday' view then the issue becomes much more complex. 

For a start there can be no evil in Islam. God is wholly good and the only existent reality. There is no Satan in opposition (Satan's role is very different) and thus no Fall, no rebellion, no original sin and thus no independent evil. 

Following on from that, whatever happens is from God. Must be. Very wide Islamic belief... every muslim believes this. Everything that happens is the Will of God. It can't be ascribed to Satan or whatever as in Christianity. So it's God. All of it.

Of course no muslim is going to call it 'evil' (and nor would I) but if you ask a muslim "is X that happened God's Will" and cite something that YOU think is evil then of course we would say it's God's will. 

It's deeper than that but it's kind of an overview because I don't want to bore people or rabbit on about Islamic philosophy and I'm sure no-one else wants me to either.

	<TEXT> Please tell us how we should know that Muslim beliefs are correct.

I don't understand the question. 

I'll try to address it though. I suppose in life that some people go looking for answers to questions. Some don't. No worries. No-one has to. But if you feel drawn to it then according to one's life's experience one conducts a search which becomes your personal narrative... it may lead one person to atheism and another to Buddhism or whatever. 

I really don't see what 'correct' has to do with it. I have never even considered using it as a benchmark. I am quite happy to say Islam is right for me and atheism right for you. For you - providing you are sincere - atheism is your truth. Why would I need to prove 'my truth' to you when you have one of your own.

	<TEXT> The standard view in Islam is that people who do not hold the correct views and follow the correct practices are destined for eternal hellfire.

Strange. As a Muslim I know of no such doctrine. My understanding after decades of studying Islam is that Hell is not eternal in any way but commensurate to whatever bad deeds one has done. 

Also 'correct views' have nothing to do with it... unless you mean in a wider sense.  Qur'an states Christians and Jews will go to heaven so I guess the definition of 'correct views' is quite wide. 

And that probably the majority of human beings - certainly billions of them - are destined for this fate.

Not by the above scale if you include the groups listed in Qur'an: Christians, Jews, Muslims, Sabians and others. Probably covers vast majority of religious thought. And even then, as I say, Hell is temporary. 

And you think that God might be laughing at this?

This is a good example of what I was talking about earlier. I referenced something completely different with that comment. I think you know that, I give you that credit. 

English is not my first language but I like to think I express myself quite well. The God laughing comment was - as you know but are not admitting - directed at the concept of how God could view the existence of Good/Evil. 

But it was a 'thought exercise' and works even if we accept your premises. The discussion is about the existence of **GOD** and not the existence of the **ISLAMIC** or **CHRISTIAN** GOD. 

There is a possibility that God could exist and actually BE Evil. Why not? Why limit yourself to denying the Abrahamic God? Why not deny ALL possible iterations?

You don't want to leave any gaps right?

I think most believers who claim proof are not being honest as there can't be any. If I felt it was necessary I'd reject it all. I'm quite happy to admit belief is irrational in a scientific sense... the question (to me) is not so much is there proof but 'does everything HAVE to be rational?'

Personally for me they don't. Not everything. Irrationality is very under-rated. Even atheists go there sometimes ;) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Right... and that is related to proof to you? I guess I'd not have that take on it. 

My reading is that He's a unique God to the Children of Israel. He does not deny other Gods exist, He just says they in particular should have Him alone. He doesn't really care about anyone else believing or not... He's just in a relationship with Israel. 

And even then He does not prove Himself to them - to the Prophets perhaps but the people themselves are constantly not believing. Obviously this precludes any 'proof'.

When Moses is up the Mountain he - in the context of the Biblical narrative - has 'proof' as He is talking with God. But when he gets back down he finds that (in the absence of proof - they are denied to go there or into the Tabernacle) they have started worshipping idols.

Yeah, it's a fair enough position but I meant in terms of debate it means that there isn't so much an exchange of ideas but rather one side setting up their ideas and the other demolishing it without bringing anything to the table.

It's ok sometimes but sometimes get frustrating.... and of course that's why most debates can't really go anywhere. Only one side has anything at stake too... which makes the atmosphere more loaded. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It's as good a possibility as any, why not?

I think we can both agree that the Abrahamic deity's behaviour is human, all too human - and as such, mostly likely IS human. 

Probably we can also agree that any existent God would - most likely - be very alien to us. We don't expect extraterrestrial life to resemble humanity so why God? 

His reasons and motivations would be unknown to us. Conversely when we see motivations ascribed to God that are wholly understandable and work in a human context then we should perhaps be suspicious that this is perhaps less divine than earthly in origin. 

Hopefully we can agree on that, but to me, just because some people misunderstand what God is and use their nearest human equivalents doesn't mean there is nothing there any more than if you showed a camera to some primitive tribe and they thought it captured their spirits and argued that when you disproved this belief you also disproved the existence of the camera.

	<TEXT> Yeah, ok. I hear you. Cuts both ways though. I rarely debate atheists because of the rudeness and snark. You just don't get that in inter-faith debates.

I'm not being rude but I think you might be blind to how rude and aggressive a lot of atheists come across as and in this specific thread. I admit I might tend to generalise in such debates (and that's not good) but that's due to two things:

1) In a non-atheist debate context I've pretty much had to grow a thick skin due to some hardcore Muslim hate. Not saying it's happening here but it happens elsewhere and sometimes I carry my defence mechanisms over into other areas. My fault no doubt.

2) A lot of atheist debate is characterised by some pretty aggressive attitudes - they seem to have a very 'male swagger' to them but maybe that's just me - and also a marked 'desire to win' as opposed to an examination of ideas for it's own sake. 

Personally I love 'playing with ideas' and can even do it in any religious context. I could do it with atheists too but they seem to not be able to go there - it becomes about 'winning the debate' and 'proof' and all sorts of other BS rather than the fun of ideas in themselves. Also I think they don't really have any ideas as such but predicate themselves in opposition to other ideas they don't accept. 

So that makes for a pretty antagonistic environment. No excuse. I should be more acquiescent and chilled no doubt. But on the plus side I have dialled it down several notches from what I'm tempted to be like. So that's good right?

99% of the time the real rabid fanatics are expat Brits for some reason. One time I was in the queue at Verdi cinema saying to a friend that I was not in favour of Independence (perfectly legitimate view btw and one that 50% of Catalans share and all my Catalan friends do)  when I was very rudely interrupted by a girl foaming at the mouth telling me to 'Go Home if I don't like it'.

This exact phrase was shouted at me on another occasion by a well known British literary figure who'd been cosying up to me in a rather nauseating manner before they found out my stance on this issue. I have other examples too. 

I've thought about why this might be - you can discuss with the actual Catalans reasonably but the fanatics are generally non-Catalan - and the only thing I've come up with is the old Arab proverb:

	<TEXT> Thank you. Great points. Agreed.

On a tangential issue, I sometimes think we get confused in these debates. We clarify God as Abrahamic etc but we also should make a distinction between 'God as defined by various religions' and 'God as a possible existent being'. Sometimes we get cross-wired.

Clearly the Abrahamic God would be dependent on being susceptible to proof as you say, that is one of His characteristics in an implied sense, but 'God' in the wider sense could be anything. He might not even know we exist let alone be thinking of proof.  </TEXT>

I am not saying anything. Just giving one possibility out of the many possibilities which would not require proof. 

Clearly people here think that if God exists He *MUST* want to prove His own existence but there seems to be no coherent or rational argument behind this. 

Perhaps the animus under which some are operating is precluding a complete overview of all possibilities. Or else they assume I believe this and are - again - asking for 'proof' which would be kind of irrational but funny also in a Pomo kind of way. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No, that's not it. It's more: good and evil don't exist. Why we think they do or why it appears they do... that's the part we can't know. 

Or maybe we can? Nietzsche had a stab at it and other philosophers have addressed it but for the majority of humanity the good/evil thing seems hardwired and we don't know why.

Btw, it is easy to prove that good/evil does not have an absolute existence. It's purely a conditioned morality and many indigenous cultures - head-hunter societies for example - feel equal remorse and guilt when failing to do something we view as 'evil'.

	<TEXT> I agree. In Christianity the problem of evil is a real spoke in the wheel of the schemata and they have never really resolved it. It can't be done. If evil exists independent of God and He is on the side of good then Good and Evil are things separate to Him and he is subordinate to one or the other.

Islam sidesteps this trap by having no Good/Evil as independent existences. There are good and bad actions that humans can do - and God advises to do one over the other but if something appears to be 'evil' then it is also part of God's plan (how can it not be?) and only *seems* evil from our perspective. We can't know the bigger picture.

	<TEXT> No, I don't take it personally. I am a bit tired of having to defend Islam from haters though - not that you are in that category - so I don't bother in the main. It's not really important... unless someone is going to get their head kicked in by a racist or a fundie extremist. Other than that I'm good with things.

For me, people are fucked up. Religion tries to address that - all religion, that's what it is - but often people don't want to change. The same people blowing people up for Daesh would be doing it for someone else in other circumstances.

They aren't heading to God that's for sure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well obviously I don't see it that way and there have been billions of Muslims historically who don't either but there's no reason why you need to see it different I guess. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yeah I think in the Christian sense they need to argue it because there is an opposing force to God (Satan or evil in general) so God MUST be defined as good. 

In Islam it's slightly different because there is no opposing force to God. Theologically there can't be... there's only God. So the issue is not really a problem that needs to be argued. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Good points - I'll post re the first ones in a bit but want to address this:

I would ask though, is the baggage of the Islamic doctrine acceptable? If it's possible to carry on the tradition of magick without the baggage of Islam, I think it's better to do so, at least if there is an opportunity for it. If you live in a diehard Muslim area, like say in Saudi, you better claim that you're a Muslim no matter what if you want to keep your head, and then if you're a magick practitioner, you have little choice if you want to keep your head, but to cast what you are doing in Islamic terms. This isn't something to be proud of. It's a concession to the local brutality, and nothing more.

It depends on what you think the 'baggage' is. If you think Saudi is a typical example then obviously the answer would be no. But Saudi are essentially a local cult from the 18th century who the British bolstered in the first instance and then they got lucky with the discovery of oil. Were it not for these two factors no-one would ever think this is Islam. 

Certainly their sect is very small. Only 60% or so of Saudis themselves identify with the ruling ideology and in wider world terms it represents a small percentage of Muslim belief. 

Oth, magic is quite well integrated into North African Muslim societies and certainly used to be in Iraq and Syria. Of course you need to 'keep your head' but that is because magicians actually are very visible in these contexts. And it's only since the rise of Wahabism and also Daesh in the wake of the US wars that this needs to be a concern. Before that there was no problem.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As a hypothetical case - would it not be possible to conceive that the issue is not one of belief vs unbelief with the latter group joining the former after being 'convinced' but, rather the issue could be one group who have not had a certain experience vs a group that has. 

Of course many of the people who claim to have had the experience in various religions very likely haven't - so that's a problem. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> No... is from "The Kasidah" by Sir Richard Burton

Another bit I like is:

All Faith is false, all Faith is true:
Truth is the shattered mirror strown
In myriad bits; while each believes
His little bit the whole to own.
