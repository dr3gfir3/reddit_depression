	<TEXT> We have just finished running a Solarize program in our community, but it was only for homes, with suitable orientation and sites of course. But the other tricky problem here is that many homes are multi-family or condos. We got some folks to get everyone in ownership to agree to panels. But plenty of folks could not.

We also have a lot of renters who want to support solar, but simply don't own a roof. We would have had a lot of takers for a community solar component if we had one with the program. We may do one in the future.

I think they can co-exist. Some people don't want to own or can't own panels.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's a very amusing way to cherry-pick the data. I laughed out loud at this part:
Among the worst places to switch are North Dakota and Minnesota, where air quality is very good to begin with and additional exhaust from gas-powered cars dissipates quickly.

I can't believe they think that dissipation is a feature. It all affects the climate issues for the entire planet. 

Wow. It is an audacious attempt to distract people, though, I give them credit for that.

	<TEXT> Ok, I just watched the moral reframing one. I knew about the handbook from way back.

I think the moral reframing is abject bullshit. I have been trying to work *within* the left on the issues I care about. I am as left as you can be--I collected signatures for Ted Kennedy's last Senate race. I was a delegate to our convention that got Elizabeth Warren her seat. I feel like it should be easier to work in my own tribe.

I know the left's buttons. I have the left's buttons. But either the lefties I know are lying about their actual values, or they are in fact conservatives underneath. 

You try to meet them on their values, and they instantly move the goalposts. So you go to the next goalpost. Whoosh! 

Sure, they cling to climate science, and the consensus on that. Show them the same thing on GMOs? It's a conspiracy. 

Hey, wouldn't it be great to reduce chemical pesticides? NO. 

Where do you go with "NO"? 

It seems to me that we have essentially a stalemate. There is no connecting with "values" because they only hold them situationally. They won't come to the meetings about the GMO mosquitoes that could reduce pesticide spraying because they said NO. 

I wish this guy could show me how--in a real life situation, like the Key Haven mosquitoes--how to work the magic. I'd watch, really. I want to see something work. But it all looks like handwavey bullshit to me. 

\end rant

I know it's not your fault. And I understand that you are trying to help. But I've been playing this roulette for a long time time now, and all I keep hearing is "ur doin' it rong" and nobody can demonstrate what doin' it rite looks like.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Having been watching this on science issues for years, I would say that I haven't seen anything. There are sometimes studies on what the characteristics of these folks are, or about the topics, but not how to effectively counter them.

And even within the science community, there's dispute. Some people say we have to share our fee-fees with CTers and find common ground, then we'll all be singing "kumbayah". I have disputed this because that doesn't work in my experience. And they can't really show me how effective that is.

I have wanted to work very hard on discrediting the major sources. But some people find this distasteful. And they'd rather just ignore the major nutcases, because otherwise they get oxygen from the attention. I see this point to some extent. But I think public shaming is worth a try. But when I try to do this, I get "tone trolled" by the other scientists who dislike the conflict.

But they also can't show me what works. I'd be willing to try whatever they can show me works. But they just continue to tell me I'm doin' it rong.

	<TEXT> That was a more interesting piece than some of the others. I had no idea that the Martha Coakley Senate race had been hit with fake news--and I was paying attention to that race since I live here.

But tying it with Ebola misinformation was an interesting choice.

I just wish that news media finding fake news nonsense clogging the system wasn't something they just discovered. Skeptics have been trying to battle this stuff for a long, long time. It's nice they are aware of it now, but we've been putting out fires that they've contributed to for a while now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The point of science is that you go where the evidence leads. 

Da fuq? How do you think you get to evidence? 

Your failure to grasp this issue is remarkable. And you keep flogging the domain expertise--which we said was not the issue. And nobody claims it is besides you and this author. We call that a strawman in the skeptic community. 

The scientists who designed the brain training experiments used basic foundational knowledge of critical thinking to design appropriate studies, collect the data, and use statistical analyses to evaluate the outcomes. THESE ARE TRANSFERABLE SKILLS THAT SHOULD BE TAUGHT TO EVERYONE. This is not rocket science, as they say. Because it's not rocket science!

You are a very shallow thinker with a clear bias.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes, I did. 

And that's not how science works.

We are trained to use a process in science that is very generalizable across domains. What the researchers did was use those skill in a domain. So they needed the foundational training in critical thinking to create the process, which they applied within a topic. We take a series of courses in college that build up the foundations. Then we specialize in domains. Science is a good system. You should consider it.

I assure you they are better at assessing situations outside of psychology than folks not trained in science.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Nobody says that domain expertise isn't also important. But having a foundation in the concepts of evaluating information, locating quality sources, examining counter arguments, and assessing the consequences of decisions and directions matters in every endeavor. 

Does he understand why we know that brain training isn't transferrable? Because people looked at it critically and evaluated the outcomes. In this case it was appropriate researchers for that field, but the same skills matter in evaluating cars, climate data, financial products, or anything else. 

That was a very odd piece.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> To be clear: I was a volunteer at the shelter last night. 

The Red Cross was the lead agency (I was with a secondary one). By 8pm when I got there they had set up and were already taking care of people. There was a ton of food on hand. 

By 10pm we had set up 60 cots and blankets, all brought in by the Red Cross. There was medical staff, which was needed, because people left their homes without their medications. 

By midnight everyone who had come to this location had been process by the Red Cross and either had hotel accomodations or connected with friends to help them. 

That kind of infrastructure isn't free and it isn't something you want to start from scratch in every community. I was glad to see it happen for our neighbors. 

Everybody smelled like smoke. It was chilling. But I'm glad it wasn't much, much worse as it could have been.  </TEXT>

It sounds like you might be responsible for the roof issues, but you should check that legally before you do the math on the rest of the system.

You don't seem to have a good grasp of this. Some GMOs have nothing to do with buying pesticides, and actually reduce the need. Other items--like Roundup--are off patent and anyone can sell it.  </TEXT>

Also, the current incentives from the federal and state make it wise to act now. Because of the popularity of solar, those options are actually declining in many states.

Yes, the MassCEC folks roll these out to new communities, so they support it directly for a limited time. However, they are aware that even after these programs solar adoption continues to be high.

	<TEXT> They didn't cover the paper session, it seems, but there were a couple of really interesting ones. My favorite was a woman (Kathleen Dyer) who taught college students about assessing evidence in different ways. There was a class in scientific methodology, and a different one on specific pseudoscience claims by topic (angels, homeopathy, bigfoot, etc). 

Students did better with reducing their attachment to nonsense if they took the topics class. 

Her abstract: http://lanyrd.com/2016/csicon/sfmzpx/ Evaluating Education for Critical Thinking: Can College Classes Reduce Belief in Nonsense?
Copying in case it goes away after the conference
Epistemically unwarranted beliefs are prevalent among college students as well as the general public. Classes in critical thinking are mandatory at many colleges, including in the California State University system. We documented the prevalence of several such beliefs and then used a pre- and post-test design to determine whether critical thinking classes work to reduce the prevalence of such beliefs. Results suggest that education that directly addresses pseudoscience does, in fact, reduce epistemically unwarranted beliefs but that education about research methods without the specific focus on pseudoscience does not.

I'm looking for a paper on it, but haven't found it yet. Not sure where that would get published.  </TEXT>

We pull our total production off our SolarEdge dashboard. We get the daily stats to reconcile (mostly) with the meter reading day. And we enter all the stuff we get from both bills, ultimately. Helpfully, we're both data nerds and enjoy spreadsheets. 

But not everyone will share bills as we do. I can easily imagine a 3 unit condo situation with one uncooperative tenant. But it would still be helpful to have a total production and unit-level breakdown that's not quite as wonky as our 4 page excel doc.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really isn't terribly sophisticated software I think--but it needs to be a bit flexible. 

We were in a 2 'regular' meter situation. State law only requires installers to put in 1 meter per parcel--so the utility didn't have to put net meters on both our units and we were not allowed to have separate arrays. 

So my unit got the net meter. Housemate's unit keeps existing meter. Now we have the 1 net and the 1 regular. 

Now, because of the way this works, I pull the production off into my unit when I need it, right? Overproduction past what I need we can assign to other accounts. 

So, for example, this month we produced about 700kWh so far. I pull off maybe 250 for my use. But that's not shown on my electric bill. My bill appears to be 0 to the utility. However, in our household, that's not sufficient. 

We need to know that I used 250. Then we allocate 99% of the rest to the other unit, I keep 1% to pay for my monthly fees. This comes out as a dollar value. 

So we want to ensure that we are splitting the production and the costs evenly (in our case, in some condos a smaller unit might get only 30% of production, or something).

We also want to track SRECs and make sure those are cut evenly when we get them. I don't mind doing a little data entry for these things, I don't expect it all to be automated. 

But we want to track production, use, credits, SRECs, equitably--or per whatever legal agreement your multi-unit setting requires.

It's essentially an accounting program I'm looking for (I think).

	<TEXT> Is anyone aware of software that can track production and usage in a multi-unit setting? I live in a 2-family house. We were only allowed to install 1 net meter. So the meter is on my unit. We use virtual net metering to assign the production to another unit (of equal size).

We happen to be good friends and co-own the house and the array. But there are other cases in high-density housing where that relationship is not so trusting and accessing all the bill data will not make sense. We keep a big and wonky excel spreadsheet of the data to see what the production and use is between us.

This is also coming up in 3-unit condos near me. People need to make sure the usage and allocations are correct. There may be net metering on the common meter, and assignment of different sizes to the individual units.

Has anyone faced this or heard of options for software tracking? Or does anyone want to develop it with me? I'm not a coder but I'm a great software tester.  </TEXT>

1. Segment on the new high school. The mayor gave the backstory, why the costs are so high, and what the difference is between a Prop2 1/2 override (which would stay in place forever) vs the exemption asked for here (which only applies to a specific project). Also addressed the tax increases, borrowing issues on bonds, etc. Encouraged everyone to explore the facts here: http://www.somervillema.gov/highschool/

2. Covered the new speed limit change option. Used to be that cities couldn't reduce speeds because it was a state thing. But Denise Provost and Christine Barber worked hard to get us a way to do that in the cities now. So in some areas we can reduce speeds which is better for pedestrians safety.

3. The regular police log segment. Kind of the normal crime issues, a few break ins, car stuff. Opiod issues and treatment connections. And the police goodwill campaign reaching out to kids in schools and neighborhoods.

4. The Solarize Somerville story (which I've posted before, here: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/solarize.html ) and also the option for energy efficiency audits with the SEEN program: http://www.somervillema.gov/sustainaville/residential-programs.html

The turkey was relocated--from the 93 ramp to...underneath 93. So they essentially got it off the ramp, but he's still around and ok (as far as we all know).

Interesting side note: the police are not allowed to interfere with wildlife unless there's some kind of imminent danger to either the bird or to some humans. So your average turkey sighting calls, they can't do anything.

But a woman at the meeting said she had seen a kid beating it with a stick. If she had called that in, the animal control could have acted on the turkey for the turkey's safety.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I attended a community solar conference in Boston this year. http://www.iscvt.org/ncsp-ne/ It was packed with municipal sustainability folks, some vendors, and a number of community activists. There was much interest.

As the solar coach for a dense urban community, I think there is definitely demand for it among my neighbors. We have a high density city (really--we're the most dense Northeast community outside NYC). This means that our roof area for residents is smaller and may not fit their usage fully. 

It also means that many people within our housing stock either don't have roof rights (condos/multifamilies) or don't have enough for everyone. In addition, we have a huge number of folks who rent. They have been left out of our program.

I think it could be done well. I think there was demand. But I would encourage people to roll it out like our Solarize (for residences). Do it by partnering with communities and activists--in cities especially--as an educational/outreach thing. The cities wanted to reach out to people with less means, though, which is not what companies probably want to target. That, and the mobile nature of renters, will remain a problem. People in these situations don't want 20 year contracts. 

If it's true that seniors (with money) are moving to urban areas and away from their homes in suburbia, they could be a good source of interest in community solar. Around here (the Boston metro) we hear more and more stories of this. 

So I can't speak to the actual numbers--it's just a vibe I get from our city's situation. But I think there are opportunities in the space.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> All of these articles fail to really address the dynamics of the GMO haters. 

They intend to use labels as a target to get to the companies with threats and bad PR. It has nothing to do with how consumers will react, because it won't be up to consumers--activists plan to take their choices away. The salmon is the perfect example of that. It's not because of the label--it's because activists shouted at the grocers not to carry it. That's hardly consumer choice. 

And every time I point out to Ropeik and all of the Label-Chamberlains that's exactly what happened in Europe, they tell me, "oh, no, that was different." 

And just today I was reading about labels backfiring on another issue. http://undark.org/article/in-the-fight-against-obesity-the-real-enemy-is-oversimplification/
From 1989 to 1995, the percentage of new food products with a low-fat or no-fat claim on the label nearly tripled, from 9.2 to over 25 percent.

Part of the problem, Nestle says, is that the lower-fat versions had about the same number of calories as the full-fat versions, but the low-fat label imbued them with an air of healthfulness, and people thought they could eat them with impunity. Any label like that on a food product makes people think it doesnt have calories. Organic labels make people think it has fewer calories.

How many examples do we need? Bad labels deliver bad consequences.  </TEXT>

I never fail to laugh at the glypho-hate. Not a single one of these numpties understands that there are other herbicides.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I doubt it's because they want to. I imagine it's required by their funding. If they kept taking money and then had no publications to show for it--after stating that they'd do the projects in the grant proposals--they'd stop getting funding.

But if you read the papers, they handwave over how they can do the work better in the future to make their case. 

*At least we aren't frauds, we just have demonstrated that our ideas are terrible* is hardly sound science.

It is better that they aren't frauds like the Italians, sure. http://retractionwatch.com/2016/10/12/retraction-notice-for-gmo-paper-updated-to-include-fraud/ I'll grant you that.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> They are actually kind of like Keystone Cops. They keep trying to prove their fears, and they suck so much at it. 

For years, I laughed at this article: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17961488 No matter how hard they tried, they couldn't get DNA into gut bacteria.

So yesterday I was looking for their more recent work. Here they tried to show the Bt protein was allergenic: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27141950 Nope.

And I linked over to this other one that came up as a related paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25564738 Nope. 

It's actually kind of bizarre. They can't prove their own claims, but it's kind of handy to have the evidence that they keep failing.  </TEXT>
