	<TEXT> If the only way she knows how to show affection is through sex, and if she thinks that's all men want from her after bad experiences, then you can bet it's impacted her negatively. Sex IS affection, but it's not always the appropriate way of showing it. Patience and baby steps. I hope you can both find what works best for the both of you. Best wishes.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Yes this, absolutely this. When it comes to wondering about potential worrying behaviour, it can be beneficial to examine how the person behaves otherwise. Also - since you have open phone/password policy, it seems unlikely she would allow that to continue if she were doing something negative. Folks who cheat tend to cover their tracks.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> See that to me SCREAMS that she's had a tough time in the past. Talking about things openly can be indicative of two things, genuine sexual honesty which is totally okay, OR at some point she's been mistreated sexually/emotionally and has developed inappropriate sexual boundaries as a result. It's hard to realise what is and isn't okay to talk about when you're confused about sexual experiences that weren't positive. Listen to her words. If she saying you're the nicest guy - ask yourself WHY is she saying that? a.) yes you seem like a nice bloke, but b.) does that also mean that men haven't been so nice to her in the past? If you're the nicest guy she's encountered, how have the others treated her? Is she hypersexualised because men have taught her it's her only worth to them? This stuff tends to be a can of worms. If anything I think what she needs right now, is someone to let her be honest with. You might get upset hearing about past stuff, but you're not her partner so really as her friend, letting her talk about that stuff might actually be the best thing you can do for her, AS a friend. Just remember to tell her that if she wants to confide in you, it's got to be platonic for now. 

A lot of women feel their only worth to men is sexual. Whilst you're telling her you want more, if she's only ever known sex without a healthy relationship, it's hard to get used to. The fact that folks are referring to her as a skank etc, is evidence that she's only being seen as a fuckable object by folks outside the equation.  </TEXT>

It's okay to tell her you're pulling away, because even if she wants to carry on as you are, it's clearly not going to be good for you emotionally. Don't let her sway that decision for you, she can't expect you to continue with things as they are when you want more, and she doesn't want to go down that route. She might not like it, but you have to protect yourself.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Okay first up - folks who are saying this girl is a skank or using you should shut the entire fuck up. Oddly enough, people are allowed to sleep with whom they please if they're not up for commitment with someone. If a man had slept with the same number of people she has, he'd be hailed as a stud. It's a shitty double standard. 

She doesn't want commitment, and as much as you want her to, it won't happen if that's not how she's wired. You can either tell her FWBs is okay with you without commitment, or you can move on. She might still want you around, but just as you need to accept she can't give you an exclusive relationship, she needs to accept that you're looking for different things. Regardless of her wanting you around for intimacy, you need to pull away from her in that way because your commitment Lego isn't compatible.
 
Also, she might want to share your company as friends, it's totally okay to want to get to know someone that way too, as apparently bizarre as that might be for some folks to grasp. You need to draw some lines in the sand. She might be trying to see if she can trust you long term. How much do you know about her past outside of the incident where she was cheated on? Has she been open with you? Does she clam up in any respect when you talk? 

If she's been cheated on, her reluctant behaviour is a natural reaction. She could be scared.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Dude - google it. It's not my job to educate you. I don't agree with circumcision either, it's barbaric. People crop ears for two reasons - a misguided notion that floppy ears cause infections, and aesthetics. Some dogs are predisposed to ear infections such as spaniels because of their genetics. However, the breeds that tend to undergo cropping, are breeds that aren't genetically predisposed to ear infections. It's only done to make animals look more fierce. So pits, dobies, danes, mastiffs etc, aren't predisposed to ear issues. 

Dogs emote with their ears and their tails, and so cropping them takes part of their ability to do that away. Sure his ears are still partially there, you haven't cropped them right down, but some folks leave them with tiny pointed stubs that heal badly and end up sore and infected.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Bollocks. If you crop a dogs ears - any breed, you're taking away their body's natural defence to protect the inner ear and such. They have floppy ears for a reason, and you and many other idiots who crop dogs ears, leave dogs exposed to increased likelihood of ear problems. Their floppy ears act as a protective barrier. Unless their ears have been damaged or torn because of an accident, they should be left alone. You're clearly more concerned with aesthetics. 

We don't crop ears or tails here at all, because it's bullshit. Unnecessary cosmetic stuff just to satisfy your idea of what a dog should look like? Crop your own ears.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It got really messy. I had him removed from our home twice, within the space of a week. First time three policemen turned up. Second time they sent six, because he'd kicked off within that week so they made sure to send reinforcements because he was like a raging bull. He was trying to make amends for weeks but I rebuffed him. He tried many tactics, guilt trips, pretending to go out on dates to make me jealous (it didn't work because I was at my limit) and eventually I had to block him and warn him away from me otherwise I'd have the police involved again. Eventually he stopped trying to reach me, but it took a while.

I discovered the details of who he really was soon after, and uncovered the lies he'd been telling for years. He'd abandoned his son twice, had a massive hard drugs problem and was incredibly unfaithful in all his relationships. He was horribly abusive and manipulative, and I'd just had enough. 

I found out about six months after I threw him out, that he had met someone and MARRIED them in that short time. It didn't last because now they're separated because I'm guessing she also had enough of his shit. I'm entirely over him, but it took me a long time to process and deal with the anger he left me with.  </TEXT>

You're going to feel broken for a while. It's hard to remember to breathe when your life was just torn down. You have to take everything in small bites. Recovery for me took a couple of years and therapy to deal with the blinding rage I finally felt after I'd done feeling hollow and cleft. The thing about that rage is that it helps keep your afloat long enough to get you to being human again.

	<TEXT> I find it odd that he's trying to steer your decision towards a certain kind of apartment, but isn't willing to be part of the deal on paper. It seems like you're feeling a little insecure worried about him leaving, has anything ever happened to make you think he'd do that? I think it's actually very sensible that he's not trying to insist he be part of the deal on paper, many folks would kind of strongarm into that. May I ask which country you're in, or would you rather not divulge that?  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It really looks like you should stay as far away from one another as possible. Sometimes you don't get the closure you need. It's unpleasant but it seems like you're the equivalent of dynamite and an open flame to the other.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Some people are not socially perfect. For some it's incredibly difficult even saying hello, or knowing when it's appropriate to say it. She also might not feel like saying it, that's okay too. People aren't obligated to perform for everyone else. I don't mean that in a snappy way, it's just not everyone wants to play along.  </TEXT>
