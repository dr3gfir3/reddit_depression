	<TEXT> This is what they've voted for. They constantly shouted about free trade and never looked that automation is what has taken low skill labor away.

 They never sought training to be a part of the changes to the economy. Instead they've turned to conspiracy theories and shouted that the factories will come back. The harsh truth that they need to seek retraining and potentially move to an urbanized area is something they never wanted to listen to.

So how is it not their fault? </TEXT>

Specifically this line

My childhood was different from Kevins, but I grew up in Kentucky, live in a rural county in Tennessee, and have seen the challenges of the white working-class first-hand. Simply put, Americans are killing themselves and destroying their families at an alarming rate. No one is making them do it. The economy isnt putting a bottle in their hand. Immigrants arent making them cheat on their wives or snort OxyContin. Obama isnt walking them into the lawyers office to force them to file a bogus disability claim. </TEXT>
