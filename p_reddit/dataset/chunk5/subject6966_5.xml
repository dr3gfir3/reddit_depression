	<TEXT>  What i mean with they are fsa, is that they are the one making the advances when people say "fsa".

Almost nobody with a minimun of knowledge on Syria talks of "FSA" when Nusra and Ahrar are involved, just the label of "rebels" or JaF is used. So no, you can't suddenly start to describe this groups as FSA.

 Fsa used to be a thing, but now they are just an excuse to cover up nusra, zinki and ahrar.

Neither of those groups have ever called himself FSA. </TEXT>

  Why should US attack Jaish al-Fateh officiers now, they are fighting on their side for US goals, along militants they arm, train and finance for the same goal?

They have been targeting AQ command structure through all the war. Why would they stop now? </TEXT>

No, that is just my personal impression. </TEXT>

The best for SAA standards, mediocre for proffesional military standards. And doesn't change the fact that those groups are not militarily capable, and neither is most of the SAA for holding some barriers to them.
 I'm well aware of his record and of his achievements though it is fairly hard to take him seriously when he says things like (...)

So you call him "twitter analyst" because you dislike his policy recomendations, which is irrelevant to his quality as an academic. I dislike Joshua Landis and his twitter account, but that doesn't make him a "twitter analyst".

 I am thankful no one has taken him seriously yet and has acted on his or analysis.

Unfortunately the policy recommendations of outsiders analysts are almost never listened for government officials in any agency in any country though. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  Capable to me means that they can carry out and defend against an offensive. 

That its not his meaning to me nor to a real or imaginary russian official. Just resisting an offensive by rebel groups, which are not themselves "military capable", doesnt make you a "combat-ready unit". When a "russian official" is talking about a combat capable unit, his treshold of quality is a lot higher than just holding your ground against rebel assault that, at most, just resemble an improvised german *Kampfgruppen* of 1944-45.

About Charles Lister: he is an academic from the Middle East Institute, the Brookings Doha Center ("muh Qatari shill") and IHS Janes Terrorism and Insurgency Centre. Its okay if you don't like his conclusions, but to go and dismiss him as "twitter analyst" its just silly.

	<TEXT> You know than that is a really uncharitable read. "Combat capable" doesn't mean "soldiers that can dig barriers and shot an AK with two magazines", because all factions have of those; it means properly paid, properly NCO staffed, properly equiped with heavy harware, and properly commanded units. It means units that have combat readiness and that can carry an offensive. To assume that the SAA is short on this type of units after 5 years of war is perfectly reasonable. Similar claims were made about the Iraqi Army in 2014   2015.There is no need to go all smug and snarky on Charles Lister. </TEXT>

	<TEXT>  The rebel factions murdered each other too.

Skirmishes is one thing, open war is another. They are at open war with Dawla. They oppose Daesh. 

 They are similar enough. Similar enough that an IS fighter could leave the sinking ship without giving up on Jihad, especially if they're Syrian.

We know that many locals syrians unite ISIS no for ideological conviction but simply beacuse Daesh offers an employment and a position. But that doesnt fly with Firqat Sultan Murad, as they are (as I already told you) arresting former ISIS fighters. If your definition of "ideological closeness" is that they are closer between them that the SDF is to ISIS, then sure. But if you are suggesting that they are practically identical, or close enough that they are now massively defecting to FSA, then your claim is ridiculous, or will be until you show me proof those massive scores of defecting fighters outside the imagination of desperate SDF fighters.

 with Ottoman undertones.

That has some meaning or is just the partisan charged language used against Erdogan's foreign policy? Are they using yanizaries or want a Sultanate in Istanbul? </TEXT>

There is no such "ideological closeness" between both, and just yesterday Sultan Murad was claiming to have arrested some ISIS fighters trying to join the FSA, but between some failed attempts at joining the FSA and FSA alligned groups and claiming that "*more IS fighters who joined the Turkish offensive than what have actually been killed by them*" there is a massive leap. </TEXT>
