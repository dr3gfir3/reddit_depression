	<TEXT> Well, I think it's going to take a bit of time to independently validate the results of this study. Yet, if they hold up, then samples for the test could theoretically be obtained either in doctors office (blood draw) or through a direct to consumer kit (think 23andMe).    </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I wouldn't classify it as retrospective. the authors are drawing upon known information about potential metabolic biomarkers and applying novel computational algorithms to determine if they can be used as a potential diagnostic tool. I grant you that 83 subjects is not a very large cohort, but it's a nice size to provide proof of concept. Proper controls were utilize for this analysis..but a large, double blind study will tell the real tale. I'm sure that is where they are looking to tsake this next.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I don't think that the authors would advocate using this analysis as the sole source of diagnosis, in its current state. Given that there haven't been any reliable metabolic biomarkers to date, this a positive first step, but still has a way to go to be used on a regular basis within the clinic. </TEXT>
