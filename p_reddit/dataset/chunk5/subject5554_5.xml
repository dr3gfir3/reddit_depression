	<TEXT> I trained for six months and never reached the point of having my first match. The hardest aspect by far is cardio. You don't have to be big. You don't have to be very strong, but you do have to be in excellent condition to not get blown up in seconds. 

But even beyond the physical component, there's a mental component that nobody seems to talk about. Wrestling is its own language, and I just could never pick it up. I knew a bunch of words, but I couldn't put a sentence or paragraph together, much less a whole story. 

When working out a match a seasoned wrestler can say to another something like "throw me to the corner, up and over, duck the line, dropkick, I'll climb the buckle, you hit the ropes, nut shot, throw me, big splash, kickout, false finish..." and the other guy will get it and remember it right away. A lot of our drills were like that. It's one thing to see that sequence typed out, it's another thing to hear it dictated to you in 7 seconds and not be like "wait what?" 

And lastly, it's very time consuming. Even though training was only six to nine hours a week, the rest of the week you have to be working on your cardio, studying matches, working on your promo abilities, etc. It's something you have to commit to full time. </TEXT>

Not that that really matters, as the barrier of entry for the HoF is pretty low.

	<TEXT> For that to work, you would've had to book Braun in a less flattering light. That win over Big Show was *clean* and *awesome*. If anything that match made Braun a bigger babyface. The crowd was happy for him for winning that one. 

Then Roman shows up to ruin the party. He clearly came off as the heel there.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Wait so Thea is a wrestler but also a good enough actress to actually play AJ Lee. But Paige can't act well enough to play herself, nor can she film the in ring segments so Tessa is playing her. But Tessa can't act either so she's just the stunt double and that other girl is actually playing Paige. 

This is weird as fuck.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The MSM has pointed out on almost every occasion "President Trump's administration claims 2-3 million votes were cast illegally *despite providing any evidence to support that claim*." They say it every single time. If the evidence exists for such a salacious accusation, they need to cough it up. 

It sounds like you're saying 2-3 million voted illegally, the left is saying "Prove it." And you're saying "No. You prove that they didn't." That's bananas.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> People in the arts are almost always left-leaning. "Celebrities" for the most part means actors, musicians, performers. It's not easy to find conservative people in those fields, so naturally Hollywood leans left. 

Secondary to that, political activism is a major component of being an artist of any sort. So when people say "Why doesn't So and So just shut up about their views and play their music?" the answer is because that's not what artists are here to do. </TEXT>
