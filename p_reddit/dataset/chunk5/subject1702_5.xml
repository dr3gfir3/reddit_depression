	<TEXT> "In what is likely to be a very brief victory for Senate Democrats, senators opposed to Judge Neil Gorsuchs nomination to the Supreme Court successfully prevented Gorsuchs confirmation under the Senates current rules. Senate Republicans need 60 votes to confirm President Trumps nominee under those rules, and they do not have enough votes."

"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) is expected to invoke the so-called nuclear option on Thursday though, which will change the Senates rules and allow Gorsuch to be confirmed by a simple majority vote." </TEXT>

"This acknowledgement should have come as a relief to many, particularly as the team of people with whom I work at the National Center for Lesbian Rights helped bring this case to the Supreme Court. However, it is cold comfort because after a slew of carefully worded answers, **Gorsuch refused to affirm the legal reasoning underlying the courts interpretation of constitutional protections for the LGBTQ community. Gorsuch has also endorsed the view that religious beliefs can justify discrimination, even when others are harmed.** A vote to confirm Gorsuch would jeopardize the LGBTQ communitys hard-won achievement of basic freedom and constitutional rights." </TEXT>

The NSC is lead by Mike Flynn appointee Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who unlike the previous 9 postings who had 12 years of military and intelligence experience, Cohen-Watnick just graduated college in 2008.


After the introduction, in the next video, Rachel dives further into Trump's politicized NSC team with "Michael Leiter, former DNI deputy chief of staff, talks about some of the dysfunction within Donald Trump's National Security Council and the potential consequences of that dysfunction [Michael Leiter: Trump politics diverts national security team

/u/Dr_Ghamorra:
This alone should be grounds for impeachment. He's basically engineering security and intelligence groups to go after his opponents. This is why I think these groups should be managed entirely by a non-partisan body. A vindictive president in control these powerful groups is worrying.


Reply subject1702:
The best part of these Maddow reports on Russia are that they don't need conjecture or exaggeration to point to Russian-Trump coordination; it may not be collusion yet, but the baseline for evidence and further investigation is already here

	<TEXT> Actually you are continuing to obfuscate "your arguement" into several arguments. I've given you my arguements why the tax hype is not a big deal. I conceded that it was boring and overhyped; and given you the reason why she still has all credibility: because she never lied or misled. It wasn't perfect but the backlash is a conservative subversion, help your liberal friends understand the bigger picture, explain how Fox News would present two pages of new boring Hillary Taxes they just got. All you have said is "tax report bad because hype lost all credibility" but it's hard to believe there was anyone who had built up trust of Maddow that no longer trusts her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are correct on one point: only conservatives are still complaining about Maddow's 2005 tax report and if you can't easily defend Rachel against this attack, you are no liberal. Say it was boring or say it was overhyped, but to imply she lied or even mislead from the truth is to simply tarnish a great reporter. 

Conservative's complaint about Maddow is like Conservatives telling Democrats to wait until next time for the filibuster; it is a subversive arguement intended to impede the progressive cause as it does nothing to help the Conservative cause only slow liberals down. Conservatives aren't supposed to like Maddow and they never have, duh! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Rachel Maddow looks at how Trump is using his National Security Team to guide the pro-Trump narrative that when it comes to Russia, the issue is Obama administration surveying the Trump campaign; Rachel reports on new evidence that the NSC is being used as a political tool to bolster a counter-narrative to the Trump Russia scandal. The NSC is lead by Mike Flynn appointee Ezra Cohen-Watnick, who unlike the previous 9 postings who had 12 years of military and intelligence experience, Cohen-Watnick just graduated college in 2008.

After the introduction, in the next video, Rachel dives further into Trump's politicized NSC team with "Michael Leiter, former DNI deputy chief of staff, talks about some of the dysfunction within Donald Trump's National Security Council and the potential consequences of that dysfunction:

	<TEXT> When you treat Reddit comments as news, I guess these things can happen. But, just like you might suddenly realize another user who seems to agree with you is actually placating and planting their own angle, there's only so much Russian news you can spread before you realize the news is also helping Russia or fits into the arguments of the Russia subreddit. So if they didn't know at first, they knew before they stopped. The aides would have figured it out eventually and then Trump would have figured it out eventually; before they stopped spreading Russian propaganda they must have known it was helping Trump and Putin simultaneously. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> *Rachel Maddow reviews a list of less reported but no less outrageous current Trump administration scandals and notes that beyond the big Trump Russia scandal, Americans have to retain their ability to be shocked by corruption if the U.S is to remain* an ethical Democracy, as the Russia scandal may not be the scandal to end this presidency.


**Rachel begins:** "You know, there's basically a menu of scandal to choose from, not like a Waffle House menu, where it's picture based, and there's not all that many choices, so you just point at the things you want, and how many you want on your plate. It's not that kind of menu. The scandal menu right now is one of those binders, tons of pages, too many choices, and you can't narrow it down."

"Start anywhere!"

**Summary of Rachel's scandal menu:**

1. Karl Icahn-Recommended to kill a regulation that rewarded his own company 209 million dollars and Trump kept a regulation(while deleting others) that protected a company of which Icahn has 82% ownership 

2. Scott Pruit- Having his law license reviewed by the state of Oklahoma because he lied at Senate Hearing that he did not do business on his government email; he did do.

3. Alabama Gov Bently to be impeached next week

4. Arkansas killing 8 men in 10 days, 4 double header executions back to back using drugs they have never used before 

5. Botched Trump admin Yemen raid investigation: Risky at Start, Costly at End

6. U.S. Military also investigating Trump admin Mosul bombing where reportedly U.S. dropped leaflets telling people to stay in their home, than U.S. may have dropped bombs on homes reportedly killing 200 civilians

7+ All the self-dealing 

8+ and conflicts of interest

9+ The President appointing his children to high ranking sensitive govt. positions 

10+ Whether Trump is profiting from the presidency

11+ If Trump businesses receiving payments from foreign governments 

And Russia Russia Russia..

(+indicates a scandal item that includes more than one scandal, dessert)

**Rachel on** ***if Russia isn't the scandal that brings down Trump:***


"Before now, any one of these scandals would be nationally riveting, would be a source of seething outrage, if not bipartisan outrage, than at least partisan outrage. But in this new American era, what we're doing instead is sorta cataloging that stuff in the background, assuming we'll get to it at some point."

"But in the meantime, what we've been doing everyday is watching the unfolding of the one Trump scandal that seems existential.  The one Trump scandal that it seems like, might undue this Presidency by revealing this presidency as basically the product of a crime, at least the product of a foreign actor acting with American confederates."


"But I just want to plant the flag here: There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are innocent."


"There remains the possibility that the president and his campaign are not innocent but that this scandal does not prove to an existential presidency ending conflagration, even if they are found to have committed very bad acts..."


"There remains the possibility at the end of all of it, he's still President."


**"And then, for the sake of our Democracy, we have to figure out how we are going to regain our intolerance for corruption and scandal, and throwing our American ethical and political norms out the window.  One of the consequences already of the Russian attack and its aftermath, is what would otherwise be presidency ending scandals in any other administration are like page 15, man, if you get there."**

***There has to be consequences for*** **the scandal menu!**  </TEXT>
