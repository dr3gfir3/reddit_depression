	<TEXT> Thanks. I took Edirne and then started another war with Serbia/Bosnia once the Ottomans foolishly warned me after losing the first war. Hungary fell into a PU with Austria, giving me a Balkans-hungry super ally to help. 

During my war with the Ottomans/Serbia/Bosnia, and declared on Byzantium, took Constantinople, and made them my vassal. Adding to that, a chunk of Serbian/Bosnian and Ottoman lands. The only thing to fear now is the encroaching annihilation from thousands of different rebels! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> So I've all but won my first war against the Ottomans as Albania, meaning that I've occupied all their land west of Constantinople. They targeted me first, so Byzantium is still alive and well. 

I'm thinking of taking Edirne, to prevent the easy crossing from Anatolia, and whatever else warscore will allow. Is there something I should be plotting now to prepare for another conflict later? I assume the Ottomans will strike again once the treaty is up, and Skanderbeg might not be around during the next go of it. I guess the question is how to effectively neuter the Ottomans here while setting myself up for a successful Albania run. (I might try to do Albania or Iberia since I wouldn't really know what else to do if I became a strong Albania.) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You get it. I was going to use Civ-BE as an example of how the series needs its historical grounding or else the result is just lackluster, flavorless, tripe. But of course, this is merely one humble opinion.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> As far as Economy goes, make sure to check the trade map and see all the centers of trade. Conquering those provinces which have higher trade value (specifically trade centers like Venice or Genoa, for example) will generate a lot money for you. Likewise, taking all the provinces within that trade node adds to the total income you get when placing a merchant there. However, controlling all the provinces in that trade node doesn't necessarily equate to boatloads of money, since a trade node like the White Sea in Russia isn't really all that valuable. You can check the value of each node in the trade menus. That's a down and dirty summary of trade. It's something to keep in the back of your mind when decided which provinces to take in wars. Taking a province in a trade node that you don't really have a lot of trade power in already, or don't have a merchant to really capitalize on there, it might not be financially beneficial for you to take. That's something I wish I knew a little earlier on, but I also started by playing mid-sized nations like Bohemia and Florence, so it's not so detrimental of a folly if you're playing the likes of Russia or France. 

Manpower and army management I've always struggled with, too. Recently I've become more aware of minimizing my losses in wars by manipulating my allies to fight as many battles for me so I don't have to lose out. Letting your allies take the brunt of the casualties takes patience, but it allows you to keep your manpower higher. Also what people have been saying about infantry mercenaries being super useful and cost efficient is true. 

Province improvements--and I may be wrong here--seem like just a way for the rich to get richer. It's hard to justify building churches in my provinces across Bohemia if I can only generate the 200 ducats needed to build one every 5 years. It's definitely better to build improvements early on to reap more, but if you don't have the money to spend, don't spend it. Only build a market in provinces that are centers of trade in a trade node you collect from, for example. Otherwise you're just bankrupting yourself for a profit you won't even see for 50 years. 

Alliances seem to be best made with nations that are not close to you. Using Bohemia again as an example, allying France is great if your intention is to take out much of the HRE nations, and even better if you're looking to expand east. For France, ally Castile/Spain if you don't care about the Iberian peninsula and want to mess up mainland Europe. In my experience, usually you shouldn't be too worried about your alliances restricting your expansion. You can always break alliances if they become a hindrance. Although, I have come across instances where playing as a newly formed Italy, France, The Ottomans, and Super Sweden become the wonder friends and completely block any expansion whatsoever. In those situations, it was usually a deference on my part throughout the course of the game in trying to limit any one of these three great powers. You have to try and predict who might be an issue later in the game (typically, France's military bonuses always set them up to be a powerful foe by the end, whereas the PLC/Russia/Ottomans start to fall behind on military effectiveness), and then plan around that. Understand the nation you're playing and know how strong surrounding nations are liable to become. Danish ideas are trash for military-focused runs, whereas Prussia is one of the most obvious, strong military nations. Therefore, if playing as Denmark, wipe out Brandenburg's potential to harm you later in the early game and ally yourself with France and hope you remain good friends!

These are just a few things I've grappled with, so hopefully some of it helps. There's simply way too much to try and explain, and I certainly don't have the mastery of this game to be the one to hit the more complex strategies that some of the ablest EU4 players employ. Definitely check out streamers or youtube channels of famous players like Arrumba or DDRJake or whoever else was mentioned. Good luck in your future campaigns! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Going off on a bit of a tangent, here, but your comment about how one can easily replace Civ's leaders with fantasy cultures is exactly what the game Endless Legend sets out to do. It's like this hidden gem of the 4X, turn-based strategy genre that does everything Civ does but better. Plug over. 

Civilization leans on history so much with familiar faces and cultural constructs--those "recognizable symbols of history" as mentioned in the article. It's a novel idea (Whoa ho! Ghandi is building the Pyramids, and amassing a giant army to wipe out the Aztecs!) that is just kind of stretched thin. It's disappointing that Civilization has this media monopoly on 4X games, and other more compelling and innovative games often go unheard of. 

However, while EU4 is certainly vastly different, comparing them doesn't seem so sacrilegious to me. The author of the article is aware that they are different genres, and is simply comparing them on how each approach historical content. In a way, he's actually contrasting the two games, even if he thinks he's striking a comparison (he says they each "highlight two starkly different approaches to historical source material"), since the bulk of the article is exposing the differences between the games. 

I mean, honestly, the outcome of this article only serves to bolster more exposure of EU4, simply because it is being "compared" to such a big name in video games. If his intention is to be biased toward EU4, he chose the right demographic to appeal to. What other high-profile PC game audience would even be minutely interested in a grand strategy game like EU4? Overwatch/League fans? Counterstrike or CoD players? The people that are going to read this article are mainly those curious as to why their much-loved game--Civilization--is being lumped together with something called EU4. 

So mainly, exposing EU4 to the Civ community will pay more dividends then most other loyal fanbases of other genres, and the author's intent to "compare" these two games in the same genre (despite the article solely contrasting two different approaches) could just be his way of facetiously bridging together like-minded demographics. In any case, I say the more Civ -- EU4 converts the better! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> And as a related question, is the only mechanic for embracing institutions to purchase them once you reaching that 10% spread? Other than wait for it to spread through all provinces, of course. 

Because for nations like England, getting the Renaissance early in London is fairly quick and painless, but then you have all the land north of you is struggling to catch up. I don't want to wait for the spread, because that puts me behind, but dropping hundreds of ducats seems like a steep price, too. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Oh my god, I never thought how much I wanted the ability to depose popes and create antipopes until now. I've been reading the Name of the Rose, and that all about the feud between the Pope at Avignon and Louis IV, where the latter set up his own antipope in Rome after conquering through Italy. 

I think currently the Curia is pretty lame, and controlling it doesn't give much substantial bonus. Calling for crusades are cool I guess, and excommunicating helps me take lands from rulers around me, but I feel like there could be more depth in this field. Hopefully they make an expansion in the future around this area of the game. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> 1. I'd say yes, but with two caveats: 1) You need to be the war leader to ensure you get what you want from the Teutonic Order, and 2) expect to backstab/break the alliance soon after robbing the Poles of their provinces. 

2. If you can, go for it. You can also see if allying Austria is feasible and coast along on the Emperor's good graces. It probably also depends on what you're planning on doing with Brandenburg, but I wouldn't put a ton of resources into weaseling your way into becoming the emperor until you get a solid foundation. Brandenburg does not have much power at the start, so strengthening your position should be your first goal. 

3. A lot of the time, Lubeck or Hamburg allies Riga, so I'd look to declare on them to take those free cities. You might be able to coax Poland into a war against the Livonian Order, set Riga as a co-belligerent, and steal Lubeck/Hamburg that way. In short, declare on their allies, or directly on them when the emperor is busy. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think Bohemia is pretty fun, and since they are landlocked, you don't necessarily have to worry about trading or colonizing if you don't want to. (Although I rushed to the Pomeranian coastline in one game ((HRE AE BE DAMNED)) and was able to start up Bohemian Colombia and control the Panama canal. Great fun). 

It is a pretty good alternative introduction to HRE mechanics, too, as you're a fairly strong nation that's not the typical powerhouses Austria or Brandenburg, and it has flexibility in the route you wish to take. In other words, because Bohemia doesn't really have an obvious track to take like Austria's diplomacy game or Brandenburg becoming Space Marines, the world is your oyster. The only downside to that is that aren't really any Bohemian specific events apart from the Hussite stuff in the beginning of the game to add flavor to the run. 

For flavor, the other post about Poland is a great idea, too. You don't have to worry about colonizing and trade too much with them either, but they become a lot to control if you're not used to managing PUs with large countries, and then immediately half x2 troops after incorporating them and becoming an empire. My first successful Commonwealth game was a little jarring when I went from casually declaring wars and letting Lithuanian AI do everything for me to actually have to manage all the giant stacks of military myself. Maybe I'm just a lazy war leader. 

Forming Italy is pretty fun, too, and you really only have to worry about placing merchants in Genoa or Venice in regard to trade. Florence-Tuscany-Italy was easy enough and rewarding back when I did it. 

TLDR; Bohemia for an alternative introduction to HRE play, Poland for more flavor and more overt power, or an Italian minor like Florence and form Italy and never worry about money again. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Looks possible to me, depending on your allies situation and how well you can balance AE. I can't see how your tech situation is coming along, but if you're on par or leading in military tech, you can definitely take the coast along the Levant all the way up Africa to the Spanish in a short amount of time. If you don't got anything better to do, go for it and let us know how it turns out! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Like everyone has been saying, I agree with the Ottoman alliance recommendation. Denmark usually is never able to hold Sweden on its own, and has pretty bad military ideas. You say you don't mind helping them contain the Swedes, but I think it's a significant drain on your forces if you commit to that. In addition, a lot of the time the Scandinavians end up with missions to take Osel, or other Baltic states, or simply set them to high priority, so they wouldn't ally with you for long. I'd just let them go at each others throats for a while and clean up the region for yourself between Russian conquests. As Poland, grabbing as much of the Baltic Sea node is important. 

The Ottomans typically end up bordering Russia once both nations expand into the Caucasus, and will certainly be an able and willing ally for your wars. Plus, you should be able to backstab them and outpower their military eventually with your godlike cavalry bonuses. You know, cuz, remove Kebab and all that. </TEXT>
