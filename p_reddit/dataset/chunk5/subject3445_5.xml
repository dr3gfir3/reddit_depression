I also partially wish my dad was around to teach me something productive. When I got to know him better as an adult, one of the few things he *tried* to teach me was how to cheat people by using a pencil when you draft an agreement for them. Then all you have to do is erase the old agreement, write a new one on the same paper, and lie to the person. **It was terrible advice that I would never tell my children or any one else to follow.**

That said, and in light of other things I have witnessed from him, it's probably better I didn't grow up with him. 

It is never too late to seek positive enlightenment and encouragement from people who know how to be successful at anything you want to do, my friend. Take care! And do anything you want with your life. All the best!

	<TEXT> I wish the same thing, friend, as I'm a fatherless son. But we could still learn anything we want and become what we wanted to be. We may not have all the advantages that we had as children, but we could carve out small amount of times and work towards our objectives regardless, I think. Thanks for taking a look. All the best to you. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He actually hits the rim on most of his attempts behind the free-throw line which amounted to 52 in total. Once I see he can hit the rim regularly from a particular distance, I am very confident that he is be able to make the basket, under an hour, with a little more power when he shoots; that's why I pushed him until he made it. When he was throwing too many air balls from that final distance, I would have him stand closer to the basket. Half a year ago he was shooting air from only a couple of feet from the basket. 

I also watched some coaching videos on shooting with proper form. Teaching him how to shoot the ball from the padding on his fingers, keeping his elbows pointed at the basket, while extending his arm fully (like reaching for a cooking jar) helped him propel the ball a lot farther. I only played basketball on the street; so I am learning it formally to make him as good as he wants to be. 

Thanks for sharing your experience. I actually have my six-year old practicing his shooting with a smaller ball. He can't hit the rim yet shooting with good form, but we're working.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My six-year old was surprised that after a break, my nine-year old made the basket after complaining that it was taking long to make the shot. However, I think the habit of him having to make a shot before we always go home lead him to the free-throw line, where he shot it as hard as he could and landed it. Thanks for taking a look!  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Thanks for the kind words. I'm definitely trying to celebrate his failed attempts as best he can, so he could love the work and get through  frustration. What I like about these exercises is that it boosts his self esteem. He discovers that there are activities he can accomplish that he thought were insurmountable. And this confidence helps him behave and score better grades in school. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The only advantage imo is the space you get and potential autonomy with that space. But you could rent a house and get just as much space. The problem finance-wise is that a home is really a liability if you're just living in it. In this market, some people can't sell the home and pull a profit. The home hasn't appreciated enough, or their lines of credit against past-earned equity aren't paid off. Further, if you include maintenance costs, interest, insurance, etc. you're going to spend more than what you would in rent in a lot of situations.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's great to hear how your son is progressing. I'm sure he's getting smarter too, as I see kids are more alert as they learn how to play sports better. And I know the feeling of having him get a shot in. My son hasn't done so in a game, but in practice it cheers us up real nice every time he makes it from a new distance.

I'm planning on getting my son into a local league too when the season starts in the fall. That's why I'm pushing him to get his shots and his dribbling down better.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> He's definitely not a natural athlete, but he's into it enough that he'll stick with the practice and do the drills. What's cool is that he gets into such a good mood after he makes one of these farther from the basket. We didn't go on Tuesday, and he as bit aggravated we didn't go. I've also got him into soccer twice a week, so he could get his legs worked out. Trying to get him off of the video game hook as much as possible :)

Thanks for taking a look and for the advice. And best of wishes for your son and daughter.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> It is his reward. I actually motivate him by letting him play. I'm instilling discipline by teaching him how to play sports and having him do writing assignments (at which he needs some work). 

Most kids I know just get caught up with video games and don't want to do anything else. Even when Super Mario was released in like '86, I believe, I remember I played it until I had calluses on my thumbs. Once I beat Mario, it wasn't as easy to get other games like it is now. You had to pay like $40 for one, if I remember correctly. And I lived with a single mother who couldn't afford to get another game once I beat the old one. So I started going outside again. Until I got Zelda :) But I would typically get to play new games after I conquered the old one months or years later. 

Now games are a lot more involved and better at keeping kids hooked, IMHO. And if they do get bored of one, another is just a click of an app store away.

Thanks for the advice! </TEXT>
