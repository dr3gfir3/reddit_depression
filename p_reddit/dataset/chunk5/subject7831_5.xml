I was a member for several years in the late 90's and spent a decade away, raising a family to return about 6 or 7 years ago.  Returning was a great decision for me and i found that the Lodge had grown in breadth, scope and membership.

As with all things, the outcome would likely depend on where you are and what Lodge or Oasis you are attending.

	<TITLE> Help us find a good Mono/Poly Counselor with Experience? </TITLE>
	<DATE> 2015-08-05 16:48:51 </DATE>
	<INFO> reddit post </INFO>
	<TEXT> My wife and I of 16 years are having a very emotional ride at the moment as we try to transform our monogamous marriage into a Poly Marriage.

We are looking for a therapist / counselor with experience in dealing with Mono/Poly relationships to work with us both and help us work through this.

Location is not an issue, as we are comfortable using Skype.  Can anyone recommend someone with experience in this area?

Thanks in advance! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> I think that our attempt with that was an experiment to see if:
1) My wife liked it, and we could share it
2) was a "solution" or compromise for my Poly nature

There was no issue of jealousy, things went generally really well and I had a great experience, though my wife was just sort of disinterested in doing it again.  She didn't "get anything out of it".

Additionally, I think we both know that this was not a "patch" for my being Poly and her being Mono. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Well, after 16 years together, lots of pain, work, discussions and a successful swing-session at a club this past weekend, we have landed at a trial separation.  sad face.  

We have two teenage kids and both live and work together.  We're both very mature, loving and understanding, but it looks like this will break us, at least for now. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> My wife and I have been negotiation Poly for almost a year without any action.  We've had lots of up and downs, and it looked really bad for a while.

Tonight she has her first date in 16 years!
Feeling very strong, and I am so happy for her to potentially have a great time, though her interest in seeing others is relatively low.

Really interested in the outcome! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Update: Looks like we have a save! She did not leave, took a day to herself and we are again trying to work through it.  It's hard emotional work, but we're still trying.

Thanks everyone for your support and encouragement. I am taking the advice and speaking with someone tomorrow.

	<TEXT> Not great.
Been discussing for a year, made some excellent progress was confirmed to be able to go out on a date this week for the first time, with complete honesty and openness (and some positivity).

Then my wife (and center of my life) had an emotional reaction that lead her to trial separate today.  We are now discussing handling the kids while she stays with friends.

Really fucking crushed today.
Don't know what to do other than support her the best I can.

	<TEXT> If she can focus, clear her mind and truly and honestly do this small practice, she WILL feel Michael's presence (proof of success in her being fully genuine in her prayers / work) and it certainly will help.

Michael is the Lord's Sledgehammer.
Best of luck.  I'd love an update in the future to see how things go. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> If she is not comfortable with that talisman, it will likely not help or protect her.

My suggestions based on her background is that again, she pray to, light candles to, and place images and items related to Michael around the house, asking Michael for protection and to clear the house of the unwanted influence / presence.

What is important is that she does this in a way that is meaningful and powerful to her.  </TEXT>

	<TEXT> What is your religious background? Or the background of the new tenants?  If you or they are Christian (or at least closer to Christianity than anything else) I would highly suggest that you focus on calling upon the archangel Michael to clear the space.

Light candles, give offerings, pray, call upon Michael, hang images of him, Ask Michael to bless water and splash it around the house, etc. 

Otherwise, any further info may help.  Communicating with the troublesome entity is not advisable, so stay away from that unless you really know what you're doing. </TEXT>
