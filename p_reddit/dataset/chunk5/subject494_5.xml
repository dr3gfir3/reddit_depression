	<TEXT> As an asian kid in a white-majority school, I was always embarrassed to pull out my elaborate bento-boxes while all the other kids had ham sandwiches and PB J. All I wanted was a white-kid lunch. All these years later I realize how lucky I was to have a mother that cooked an amazing Japanese lunch every day. </TEXT>
