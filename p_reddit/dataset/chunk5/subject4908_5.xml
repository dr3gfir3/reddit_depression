	<TEXT> Thanks! I do have a baby face, people always mistake me for being maybe 15 or 16!! It doesn't help that I'm also 5'3. But again, thank you for your kind words. :) </TEXT>

	<TEXT> That's really impressive! It takes a lot of guts just to get out of bed, and do something productive when you're depressed. (As of now, I'm currently struggling with trying to stay healthy, but also feeling very lethargic). But good for you, it's amazing how something as simple as running can completely change your state of mind!

Also thank you for the compliments. Haha, I really, really appreciate them! :) And yes, I lost about 45lbs total. Before my depression got really bad, I was exercising almost every day, just going to the gym and such. Obviously cutting down my calorie intake and eating very clean as well. But now, my depression is really taking a toll on my life, and I'm finding it extremely hard to maintain my weight. It sucks a lot. :( </TEXT>
