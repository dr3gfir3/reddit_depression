	<TEXT> In terms of the data we have, physical age is easily measurable in years, but the concept of mental age is harder to quantify. We saw changes in dynamics that can be related to physical age, but are unable to obtain a variable as concrete as mental age from these results. However, there is a range of hypergraph cardinality for any given age, which could indicate that some older individuals are able to effectively use a typically younger hypergraph structure to achieve roughly the same performance as others in their age group.

In the broader field, there is a lot of recent interest in trying to predict various aspects of individuals on the basis of properties about their brain (for example, see this months special issue of NeuroImage, which is devoted to individual subject prediction: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/10538119/145/part/PB). In this vein, hypergraph cardinality may in fact be one component of an individuals mental age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is definitely an interesting area of research, which unfortunately our study does little to address! As we noted in other replies, its unclear whether the properties of brain organization that we focused on can be changed; its also unclear what specific role these properties play in cognitive performance, if any. Generally speaking, current research favors tried-and-true methods for maintaining cognitive functioneating and sleeping well, exercising, and staying cognitively activeover less proven approaches like brain training or neurostimulation (the latter of which can actually be dangerous). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> These are some great examples of different cognitive demands that can be placed on us throughout our lifespans. A main takeaway message from our paper is that older adults appear to have developed different methods for performing our memory tasks than the younger cohort uses on average. We actually do not see significant differences in performance between these two groups - potentially indicating that the adaptations are effective! In this study, we controlled for alcohol, caffeine, exercise, and cigarette use in the past 24 hours, but the data on other drug use was limited to one out of the two data sets we used. Although there are complications in doing studies that involve the use of controlled substances in humans (in the US), it is certainly possible that future research will apply our techniques to examine the impact of the use of various substances (including, for example, tobacco, alcohol, pharmaceuticals, or cannabis). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Excellent question! This is indeed an exciting time for the field of fMRI. For the most part, our method wont change as the technology improves, because those improvements most involve increases in spatial and temporal resolution (and our method, roughly speaking, works at an effective resolution well below the current state-of-the-art, because it considers brain regions hundreds of cubic millimeters in size on a timescale of roughly a minute). However, some advances, such as multi-echo imaging (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3350785/), may improve our method if they help us do a better job removing unwanted sources of noise (such as head motion or physiological noise) from the signal of interest (that is, blood oxygen level dependent signal). </TEXT>

	<TEXT> This is the most interesting seeming paradox in our study: we are looking at organization in a memory task, yet despite these changes in brain organization, we dont see any behavioral changes across age groups. As we hinted at in other replies, one intriguing possibility (given that we intentionally studied only participants who were unimpaired on the memory task) is that the changes we see in hypergraph structure actually reflect adaptive changes that protect these individuals from age-related memory decline. Another possibility is simply that the hypergraph properties we are focusing on, which reflect very high-level, whole-brain properties of brain organization, simply arent specified on a level where the differences we can measure would have any reliable impact on memory. Either way, it is certainly a question we hope to see answered soon!

	<TEXT> We had data on hundreds of individual differences such as gender, years of education, personality, and preferred cognitive strategy (as measured by well known tests). Unfortunately, we did not record whether the subjects were monolingual. Despite all of the data we had access to, the only significant correspondence with the hypergraph cardinality trait was age. However, hypergraph cardinality is only one way to simplify the hypergraph. There could be other features that we did not investigate that may exhibit differences between subgroups. There is an interesting literature suggesting that multilingualism may confer various cognitive benefits, and may be associated with changes in brain function or organization.

	<TEXT> Thats an excellent point. Indeed, its entirely possible that changes in society (for instance, food production, the chemical composition of daily products, and technology have all changed radically in the past several decades) are responsible for the differences in hypergraph structure we observed, rather than age per se. Unfortunately, fMRI has existed for under three decades, and there are (to our knowledge) no longitudinal studies that cover even a majority of this span. Nonetheless, we certainly hope that going forward, this technique will be applied to other datasets. In the last five years or so, there have been more concerted efforts to collect longitudinal fMRI data (particularly so-called resting state data), so it may soon be possible to more directly address the question of what exact role age plays. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> In this study, we used fMRI to measure brain activity while participants performed the memory task. We then applied a mathematical technique (described more thoroughly in some of the other answers) to quantify how cohesive the brain activity in different brain areas was. Our results showed that the functional organization of connectivity between brain areas is less cohesive in older adults, and although there are some gaps in our age scale, this change seems to be fairly continuous and gradual with age, rather than being discrete or sudden.

In our sample, there was no significant age-related cognitive decline, which was at least partially due to our intentionally selecting older adults who were able to perform the task. However, other work on cognition and aging suggests that, absent any sudden change like illness or injury, cognitive performance also tends to change gradually with age, although it does tend to be nonlinear, such that the changes accelerate with increased age. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> The good news is that we found no significant differences in cognitive function or brain dynamical structure between the 18 year old subjects and the group in their mid 20s! You can see this nicely in Figure 11 of our paper. There are, however, major developmental changes in brain structure and function throughout childhood and teenage years - Dani Bassett at the University of Pennsylvania and her colleagues have some particularly interesting results using network methods. So its not surprising if you feel that your cognitive function and learning ability is different from when you were younger, but it is not necessarily worse!

There is research suggesting that early childhood is associated with a sort of special capacity for learning, especially in domains like language, although there is some debate in the field on this so-called critical period theory. If such a critical period exists, it is unlikely that there is anything one can do later in life to recapture this critical periodnor is it clear that it would be a good thing if one could. Regarding the goal of increasing cognitive function, this is a topic of a considerable amount of active debate. We will note only that the evidence for the effectiveness of, for example, cognitive training regimens is mixed at best. Existing research suggests that simple practices like getting enough sleep, exercising regularly, eating healthily, and engaging in cognitively demanding practices like learning a foreign language are probably the best place to start in the quest to stay mentally fit! </TEXT>

	<TEXT> We are truly sorry to hear about your mother. A major goal of work in related fields is to understand how healthy aging progresses. There were no significant differences in memory performances between the age groups in our study, so the differences in hyperedge structure could be related to cognitive mechanisms developed by older adults to compensate for memory changes related to age. We hope future work can clarify how structural hypergraph changes are related to age, which may give insight into strategies for maintaining memory.

Note also that, because we were primarily interested in studying memory-related processes, we specifically selected older adults who didnt exhibit memory impairments. Given the large differences in hypergraph structure between age groups, but the lack of any behavioral differences, one of the most interesting future extensions of our work will be to apply the same methodology in populations exhibiting cognitive decline, or in patients with a genetic predisposition toward early-onset dementia (for instance, see this recent NPR article: http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/12/27/506720771/early-alzheimer-s-gene-spells-tragedy-for-patients-opportunity-for-science). It is also unclear from our work whether changes in hypergraph structure with age are inevitable, or if there are measures individuals can take (for example, exercise, diet, or so on) that might affect hypergraph structure. </TEXT>

However, there is a wide literature relating diet to brain function, cognitive performance, and age. This article by a colleague might be a good place for you to start if you want to read more: http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2016.00297/full. Although age tends to have some of the most pronounced impacts on brain organization, we look forward to future work specifically examining the role diet plays in hypergraph structure. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Really interesting question. In this case, we included dozens of variables as covariates, including some that tend to correlate with socioeconomic status (SES) like education level, although we did not include any questions about SES explicitly. However, our participants were sampled from the Santa Barbara community, so it is possible that there are systematic differences in SES or other factors relative to the US or global population, so it is an open question to what degree our results generalize to the wider population. In particular, SES has been shown to have profound effects on brain development and function (for instance, see http://www.pnas.org/content/112/51/15530.full.pdf or http://www.attn.com/stories/2442/effects-poverty-brain-mental-health) so we certainly might expect SES to impact hypergraphs.

	<TEXT> Great question! The finding that hypergraph cardinality doesnt vary much across tasks for an individual but varies enormously across individuals is one of the most exciting findings from our paper. This trait-like quality was what motivated us to look for possible relationships with the data on individual differences between subjects. We investigated a diverse set of possible factors (including scores from personality tests such as the Big 5) and found that age was the only significantly related measure. It would be very interesting to investigate this further and determine whether the differences in hypergraph structure arise as a result of age, or whether they are indicative of a mechanism that works to mitigate age-related changes in memory function (there were no significant differences in memory performance between the age groups). Applications of this type of research are varied, but one of the most critical is an understanding of how healthy aging takes place!

	<TEXT> In our work, we use hypergraphs to represent changes in brain networks over short time intervals. Traditional brain network analyses use the strength of correlations in activity between each pair of brain regions as edges. Hypergraphs extend this to another dimension by using the strength of correlations in activity between each pair of edges as hyperedges. In short, hypergraphs represent how regions are linked in a way that factors not only the correlations in activity, but how these correlations change over time. In the future, more complex analyses of brain dynamics could be done using this framework - for example, community detection and other graph theoretic measures could be applied to the hypergraph.

To give an analogy, imagine that you have the GPS coordinates for a set of people. Whenever two (or more) people are moving together, we'll say they're "connected". In traditional approaches to functional brain connectivity, the connectedness of each person to each other person would be determined over the course of an entire measurement (say, a single day, in our analogy). However, the hypergraph approach extends this in two ways. First, it determines connectedness dynamically (for instance, hourly). Then, for each pair of people, you compare the timecourses of their connectedness, and group together pairs where those timecourses are similar.

To make the analogy more concrete, imagine a set of four people: a parent and their child, and another parent with their child. Each parent separately takes their child to different schools at 9am and picks their child up from those schools at 3pm. Each parent's location tracks closely with their child's when the child is not at school, and is unrelated while the child is at school. The traditional approach would conclude that each child/parent pair is weakly connected, and that the two pairs have no relationship. However, the hypergraph method would observe the pattern that each pair is "connected" before 9am and after 3pm, and "unconnected" between 9am and 3pm. (Like the traditional approach, it would also note that the two children and the two parents aren't connected at all.) Because that pattern of connectedness over the course of the day is similar for both pairs, they would be grouped together into a hypergraph!

In our analogy, people are brain areas and GPS coordinates are brain activity, but otherwise everything is the same. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hey Reddit,

Im Liz Davison, a graduate student at Princeton University in the Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Department. My research centers on development and application of analytical and computational methods from network science and engineering to study complex dynamical systems, including the human brain.

And Im Ben Turner, and Im a postdoctoral researcher in cognitive neuroscience at the University of California, Santa Barbara. My research focuses on using functional magnetic resonance imaging to better understand human memory.

We recently published a paper titled [Individual Differences in Dynamic Functional Brain Connectivity Structure Across the Lifespan](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005178) in PLOS Computational Biology. This paper applied a method for characterizing how connections between brain regions change together over time (see our earlier article published in [PLOS Computational Biology](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004029) to a group of people including young and older adults. Using different methods, other researchers have shown that the neural activity in parts of the brain that belong to the same network in young adults tends to become less similar by older adulthood. Our results extend this previous result by showing that when brain regions are put in groups based on how their connections change together over time, older adults have a larger number of groups relative to young adults, indicating less-cohesive changes in connectivity.

The only other organisms that we are aware of that utilize a similar mechanism of cell division are members of the Planctomycetes, which are not human pathogens.  While antibiotic resistance is not currently a problem with Chlamydia, there are major changes in the microbiome of the female genital tract when broad spectrum antibiotics are used to treat chlamydial genital tract infections.  This change in the microbiome can lead to outgrowths of Candida (yeast infections) and bacterial vaginosis, both of which negatively impact the quality of life for women.

Yes we have now observed this polarized mode of division in Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B and Chlamydia muridarum.  Although the changes in morphology during the division process are very similar during cell division in these organisms, the localization of the markers (MOMP and LPS) we have used to visualize the division process vary substantially.  We hope that the differences observed among the different Chlamydia will aid us in identifying factors responsible for establishing and maintaining polarity in these cells.

Yes an advantage of developing specific therapies is the prevention of resistance in non-target bacteria, such as Gonorrhea.

We have not been able to document Chlamydia undergoing standard (binary) cell division.  While it may occur at later stages of growth within infected cells, these stages are much more difficult to image using immunofluorescent techniques.  Based on our studies that examined the first few divisions within infected cells, all of the Chlamydia divide by the budding process. </TEXT>

We tried several inhibitors in the paper, and every inhibitor appears to have a slightly different effect. Chlamydia is known to lack ftsZ gene, in fact Chlamydia is one of very few bacteria that lacks ftsZ. if you scan the literature you will find several budding bacteria, but looking at the pictures and comparing them to budding yeast or to our pictures it becomes hard morphologically to group budding bacteria in a single group. </TEXT>

How these processes are regulated in Chlamydia is not known at this time.  Our studies suggest lipid asymmetry is associated with the cell division process.  I am hopeful that our inhibitor screens will identify factors necessary for establishing and maintaining these specialized membrane domains, which are likely necessary for the polarized division process. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> You are correct that Chlamydia, which lacks FtsZ, is dependent upon MreB for assembling peptidoglycan at the septal plane.  This was elegantly shown recently by Liechti and his colleagues.  We also know from our work that FtsQ accumulates in the septum between dividing cells.  Whether FtsQ localization is dependent upon MreB is not clear at this time.
We have not yet identified any new components necessary for this polarized division process.  This is the goal of our current studies.  MOMP localization serves as a marker for the division process but it does not direct asymmetric membrane expansion.  Our recent studies have shown that Chlamydia trachomatis serovar B (a trachoma causing serovar) divides by the same polarized division process but MOMP accumulates in the septum not in the expanding membrane of the daughter cell. So MOMP isnt driving the process.  Our goal is to identify what is driving the process.  The fact that division septum is localized to the base of the bud suggests that there is a specific mechanism involved.
This mode of cell division seems to have evolved in free-living bacteria (Planctomycetes) and obligate intracellular bacteria (Chlamydia).  As you point out both organisms lack FtsZ.  Whether it is the absence of FtsZ that accounts the multi-budding phenotype we observe in Chlamydia remains to be established.

However, recent advances in chlamydial genetics make our goal of identifying potentially novel machinery that is necessary for chlamydial cell division feasible.  From our work and the work of others, we are developing some understanding of how Chlamydia develops polarity and forms a septum between dividing cells, but we have yet to identify a unique target that is necessary chlamydial cell division.

	<TEXT>  Hey guys, great work, and congrats on the PLOS Pathogens paper! I gave it a quick read-through, and I have a few questions.
 
 
 
 My understanding is that recent work (from Liechti and others) suggests a model where Chlamydia still needs (and has) enough peptidoglycan (PG) to form a septum. The PBP enzymes that insert/act on this PG ring are coordinated by "bacterial actin" MreB (which normally organizes elongation, not division) rather than "bacterial tubulin" FtsZ. However, FtsQ (normally part of the FtsZ-coordinated division machinery) still localizes to the septum. This suggests a hybrid model of division, where components of different growth/division machinery work together in an unusual fashion (for example, MreB and FtsQ). Please correct me if I am wrong.
 
 
 
 My questions are:
 
 
 
     Do your results have any impact on this model, to either support or update it?
 
 
 
     Your results seem to confirm that the major determinants of division in Chlamydia are mostly involved in necessary functions in other bacteria (e.g., MreB, FtsQ, etc.). Why, then, do you think that this asymmetric division suggests new drug targets or treatment paradigms? Have you discovered any new components necessary for division in Chlamydia? How significant is it that the MOMPs localize asymmetrically? Does this suggest they are involved in division/asymmetry generation?
 
 
 
     Do you think that Chlamydia's asymmetric division is adaptive, or do you think it's a byproduct of a bug that lives in a fairly unique environment (intracellular) that has a stripped down "minimal machinery" for division, and that this set of minimal machinery happens to be disregulated enough that it now doesn't have much control over septum placement?
 
 
 
 Thanks!

We have just started high-throughput screens to identify drugs that may be used to specifically prevent the chlamydial cell division process.  The only other organisms that we are aware of that utilize a similar mechanism of cell division are members of the Planctomycetes, which are not human pathogens.  While antibiotic resistance is not currently a problem with Chlamydia, there are major changes in the microbiome of the female genital tract when broad spectrum antibiotics are used to treat chlamydial genital tract infections.  This change in the microbiome can lead to outgrowths of Candida (yeast infections) and bacterial vaginosis, both of which negatively impact the quality of life for women.  It is our hope that the development of specific inhibitors will prevent these unwanted outcomes of broad spectrum antibiotic therapies for treating Chlamydia genital tract infections. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,

Im John Cox, a faculty member in the Department of Microbiology, Immunology, and Biochemistry at the University of Tennessee Health Science Center. And I am Yasser Abdelrahman a Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Restorative Dentistry at Oregon Health and Sciences University.

We have been interested in the molecular mechanisms that regulate the growth of Chlamydia trachomatis, an obligate intracellular pathogen that is the leading bacterial cause of sexually transmitted infections. The ultimate goal of these studies is to develop therapies to specifically prevent chlamydial growth.  We recently published a manuscript, [Polarized Cell Division of Chlamydia trachomatis](https://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.ppat.1005822) in PLOS Pathogens. Although it was assumed that this organism divides by binary fission, we showed in this manuscript that Chlamydia trachomatis divides by a polarized cell division process that is similar to the budding process of a subset of the Planctomycetes. This mechanism of cell division has not been documented in other human bacterial pathogens suggesting the potential for developing Chlamydia-specific therapeutic treatments.

	<TEXT> TP53 is the most commonly mutated gene in all of cancer, and especially in breast cancer. TP53 is more commonly mutated in the more aggressive breast cancers. Many researchers have worked tirelessly to try and identify therapeutic interventions to target TP53; however, this protein is incredibly complex with diverse functions across the cell. TP53 function can be completely disrupted in some cancers (as in classic tumor suppressor) but also can acquire missense mutations and thus gain new functions (similar to an oncogene). It is involved in both cell death and cell growth. This all complicates research in identifying both the role of TP53 in breast cancer metastasis as well as successful therapeutic interventions.


As for saving tissues from tumors for future therapy: we as researchers have seen the power of new technologies over the last decade, allowing DNA and RNA sequencing from tissues that was not possible before. We urge the proper collection and storage of tissue, as it is impossible to predict how this tissue could be used in future studies. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Here is our speculation. In order for a breast cancer to break off, survive through circulation, successfully land in a distant organ, and survive all while escaping immune surveillance, some level of genetic diversity and adaptation is needed. Others have observed clumps of circulating tumor cells in cancer patients, further suggesting that multiple cells are needed in order for metastasis to be successful. Potentially, this genetic diversity would be better shared across multiple tumor cells rather than the entire genetic burden existing in one cell. Furthermore, cross-talk between multiple types of cells could be beneficial: studies in our lab have demonstrated that in a mixed population of cells containing both claudin-low (stem-cell like population) and basal-like cells, when we isolate only 1 population of cells, the cells can repopulate both populations such that both populations are in the final culture. This suggests both tumor cell plasticity as well as a need for both populations to exist for the cancer cells to continue to grow. Both data from our studies and many others continue to support the need for multiple targeted therapies delivered together.

	<TEXT> Correct. Because these basal-like cancers were very aggressive and only chemotherapy treated (A1 only 1 round of chemo), the metastatic process of these tumors might be different compared to other breast cancers or other cancer types.  We have previously identified data that suggests basal-like breast cancer develops from a different cell of origin than luminal breast cancer. This very likely extends to mechanisms of metastasis as well. Further research in basal-like breast cancer, luminal breast cancer, and Her2-driven breast cancer are needed to truly understand the differences and similarities of mechanisms of metastasis in breast cancer.

	<TEXT> There is not much consensus in the field of understanding about metastasis. The seminal paper first describing DNA sequencing of a matched tumor and metastasis was in renal cell carcinoma, demonstrating branched evolution with a single cell of origin seeding distant metastasis. A study of basal-like breast cancer, the matched metastasis, and a xenograft show high percentage of shared genetics across all 3 tumors. Single cell sequencing of one breast cancer with one matched liver metastasis suggest a single cell seeded the distant site. This is corroborated by a large panel of matched primary and brain metastases sequenced, showing continued evolution and acquisition of resistance mechanisms in the brain metastasis specifically. A larger study in prostate cancer suggests metastasis can seed other metastases. Other studies in non-small cell lung cancer, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer all shed light on the cancer evolution through metastasis. Few studies, however, have more than 1-3 matched metastases with the original tumors. Furthermore, advances in DNA and RNA sequencing provide even greater depth of coverage and only further illuminate the genetic complexity of cancer. Further research with 3 matched metastases and primaries across multiple subtypes of breast cancer is needed. Parallel studies in immunocompetent in vivo models are needed to better understand mechanisms of metastasis. There is no consensus, but there might not be a consensus, as there are likely diverse mechanisms of metastasis and therapeutic resistance across different types of cancer.  </TEXT>

On-going work in both the United States and Europe looking at 200 women with matched primary and distant metastatic sites will hopefully address your question. A much larger cohort is needed to statistically determine why specific subtypes of breast cancer tend to metastasize to different organs (i.e. ER+, luminal tumors are more likely to first relapse in the bone while HER2-enriched tumors are more likely to relapse in the liver, and basal-like tumors are more likely to relapse in the lung and brain).

	<TEXT> False negatives are extremely difficult to address; however, we did reinterrogate all mutations from the metastases in the primary tumors. We had bioinformaticians who visually inspected the alignment of reads to address this concern. Upon review, we identified low percentage clones in the primary that would typically be filtered when using a VAF cutoff of 5% or greater. Another method that we researched was compiling all alignments from one person (i.e. all 6 tumors sequenced) to achieve 400X coverage at positions and subsequently call mutations. Others have published on similar methods and demonstrate the power of using sequencing from related tumors to lower the false negative rate.

	<TEXT> From the manuscript that you have linked I think you might be looking at non-synonymous, significantly mutated gene figure (Fig3).  These are genes that are recurrently mutated in the larger cohort. This also looked at breast cancer as a whole.  We have previously shown that the mutation rate varies by molecular subtype (doi:  10.1038/nature11412), with Luminal A tumors having lower mutation rates than the more aggressive tumors types like Basal-like and HER2-enriched. The range in mutations per sample is quite varied in breast cancer.  From TCGA we found a range of 1-6,000 mutations per sample in breast cancer.  We used both synonymous and non-synonymous mutations for our clonality analyses. But as you mention, more aggressive subtypes of breast cancer have larger mutational burdens.  Researchers are expanding their analyses to look at CTCs. However, for these two patients, we did not have blood to look at CTCs.

	<TEXT> Our study is limited in that we have only looked at two patients so far, but is intriguing to find that most of the mutations observed in the metastases of these triple negative breast cancers were also in the primary.  These tumors were highly aggressive and are not representative of all of breast cancer: Patient A1 was diagnosed with metastatic disease. We think that it suggests that better targeting of the heterogeneous primary tumor might help reduce metastatic disease. Our finding of multiple clones in the primary also beg for development of new targeted approaches to wipe out the potentially metastatic clones. At this point we cannot conclude if this mechanism is similar in less aggressive breast cancers or other tumor types.  Indeed in other tumors like renal cancer, they show that the acquisition of mutations are required for metastasis to occur. Future research in larger cohorts of metastatic breast cancer patients are needed to identify therapeutic targets to block this process.

As many of us, I was personally affected by a close family member with cancer and wanted to know why - why did some cells go awry in my family member? Why was she so sick? And if we knew the underlying cause, why couldnt we cure it like a simple strep throat? This led to a passion of mine for both medical care and research. Through research, we can directly discover something that may help push the needle just a little bit towards cure. I would encourage any and all women with a passion for science and the curiosity and drive to pursue a career in STEM fields. My advice for women (and men as well!) would be to involve yourself in opportunities that excite you. Identifying a mentor in your field who is truly invested in your success will allow for career guidance at critical steps: applying to graduate school, identifying the right project, and successfully applying for funding.


Katherine: I was born when my dad was in graduate school getting his PhD and was often around the lab.  Science was something I was always interested in and I enjoyed working with my dad on science fair projects as a kid.  When I was in high school, I got a job at a research facility near my house to get hands on experience doing research - both lab and field work.  I found as many ways as possible to get involved in school or outside of school in science activities. I had a strong interest in genetics and that was my motivating interest in applying for graduate school.  My background was mostly plant research, but once in grad school, I found an advisor and lab I really liked that studied breast cancer and it stuck. My advice is to seek out opportunities and become involved.  Similar to what Marni said, finding a mentor to help and support you is a great as well and can help you figure out opportunities.

This has many advantageous, including detecting microscopic tumor which cannot be seen by CT scan as well as monitoring possible resistance mechanisms in real time.

	<TEXT> Thanks for your questions. 
We found sets of mutations, or clones, within different percentage of cells in the primary (as measured by the variant allele frequency) that were also observed in the metastatic tumors. Many of these clones were shared with some but not all of the metastases, indicating distinct populations of cells. All tumors, including the primary and metastases had evidence of multiple clones, with many of the metastatic clones derived from multiple clones within the primary which had then moved/metastasized to other sites of the body. The genome coverage was between 29X to 72X for the samples sequenced. Bulk tumor RNA/DNA sequencing is always limited by sampling error (i.e. sequencing only a small biopsy or only one section of the tumor). Previous work by others have compared multiregional sequencing in primary breast cancer which demonstrate the vast heterogeneity within each primary. Despite this limitation, our analysis still demonstrates multiple clones (genetic heterogeneity) in the primary which is reflected in the metastases.


Our group has not been investigating the mechanism of how multiple cells may be metastasizing but we would refer you to two excellent, recent publications in PNAS where the authors Au et al (doi: 10.1073/pnas.1524448113) and Cheung et al (10.1073/pnas.1508541113) experimentally assess mechanisms of polyclonal seeding.


Your third bullet raises a very interesting question which we have also discussed; however, this is out of the scope of our current study. We would refer you to the Cheung et al. (10.1073/pnas.1508541113) study which investigated this interdependence further. 




 When we looked at the RNA expression profiles of our tumors compared to over 1000 breast cancers from TCGA, we found the metastases were more like their primary tumor than they were to other breast cancers - primary or metastasis.  When we collected the metastases, we also collected normal tissue when we could and performed RNA sequencing on those as well.  We found that the metastases looked much more like the primary breast cancer than to normal tissue from the site where the metastasis occurred.  The dominant expression profiles were similar. However, this does not suggest that the microenvironment isnt playing a role, and we definitely agree both the stroma and the immune component are very important.  We havent specifically looked at the microenvironment role in these samples yet.

	<TEXT> Hi Reddit,


We are Katherine Hoadley and Marni Siegel, researchers at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's [Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center](https://unclineberger.org/). Our research focuses on understanding why some breast cancers spread throughout the body, a process known as metastasis.


We recently published a paper titled ["Tumor Evolution in Two Patients with Basal-like Breast Cancer: A Retrospective Genomics Study of Multiple Metastases"](http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.1002174) in [PLOS Medicine](http://www.plosmedicine.org/).


We wanted to understand how hormone negative tumors in the breast travelled to distant sites, a process known as metastases. By comparing the original breast cancer to distant tumors, we looked for DNA changes that were both shared and unique at these different sites. We found that, in two patients, the majority of disease-causing DNA changes in the metastases are established in the original tumor, and that these metastatic tumors are made up of multiple distinct populations of cells, or clones, from the original tumor.

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Protein aggregation has been linked to many neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (plaques and tangles), Parkinson's Disease (alpha synuclein aggregation), Huntington's Disease (huntingtin protein aggregation). These aggregates serve as pathological hallmarks of each of these diseases. Our work shows that NMNAT2 can function as a protective protein, called a chaperone, which can bind to such aggregated toxic proteins and allow them to be refolded. At the same time, NMNAT2 can also bind to such proteins that are prone to aggregate and prevent this aggregation process. Hence, as a chaperone, NMNAT2 can reduce protein aggregation burden and protect neurons from dying from such proteotoxicity. </TEXT>

There is strong evidence suggesting that caffeine intake via 2-3 cups coffee containing 95200 mg caffeine or several cups of tea per day reduce the risk of dementia. Our preliminary and unpublished studies find that treating adult mice with caffeine (equivalent to about 3 cups of coffee for a human) can increase NMNAT2 protein levels in the brain. Together, these results suggest that caffeines beneficial affects on dementia may be by increasing NMNAT2 levels. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter:

* 1) NMNATs have been shown to be neuroprotective by many different groups in different model systems, ranging from Drosophila to mouse models of neurological disorders. A wide range of published work has already established NMNAT2 as an important neuronal protein. Our earlier work has shown that NMNAT2 levels decline quite early in a mouse model of tauopathy, prior to the onset of any behavioral deficits and brain degeneration. Also, we were amazed to observe an improvement in brain degeneration in these mice, when we genetically increased the levels of this protein in diseased neurons. In our recent work, we wanted to understand the mechanisms by which this protective protein was offering such robust improvements.

* 2) In this paper, we discovered a novel chaperone function of NMNAT2 that allows it to reduce aggregated proteins that are likely causes to neuronal death and dysfunction in many of these brain diseases. To function as a chaperone that can refold these proteins, NMNAT2 needs to interact with HSP90. Without this interaction it cannot act to refold these toxic proteins. We are certain that NMNAT2 is present in both glutamatergic neurons and gabaergic neurons based on our unpublished data, whereby loss of this protein can affect both these types of neurons. We also know that NMNAT2 functions in an activity-dependent manner, where its levels can increase when we treat neurons with forskolin that increases cAMP. At the same time, increasing activity in neurons that lack NMNAT2 promotes cell death, showing a requirement of this protein to buffer excitotoxicity in neurons.

* 3) NMNAT2 is a difficult protein to purify from bacteria. Despite its small size, the stability of the protein is very weak and it easily precipitates during the purification process. Currently, we are exploring alternative ways to purify this protein.

* 4) NMNAT2 appears to be present in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons from an early developmental stage in the mouse brain (unpublished data). From preliminary observations, we do not detect any NMNAT2 in neuronal precursors or progenitors but start detecting it in mature neurons, post differentiation. However, others have also shown its levels to increase in neurons as they mature. In the peripheral neurons, NMNAT2 appears to be very important during development and lack of the protein cause neurite outgrowth deficits. NMNAT2 knock out mice die at birth as a result of collapsed diaphragm from denervation.

* 5) We see a strong correlation of NMNAT2 levels with well-characterized presynaptic proteins such as RIM1 alpha and synaptophysin. We are exploring the underlying basis of this correlation.

* 6) Our next big step is understanding how this protein is regulated. We have a manuscript in revision that outlines essential pathways that regulate the abundance of neuronal NMNAT2. We also are studying why this protein is so important for maintaining the integrity of neurons. We are essentially approaching this question through unbiased mass spectrometric approach to identify the protein interactions of NMNAT2. Although increasing NMNAT2 can be therapeutic in proteinopathies such as tauopathies, we have to understand the functions of this protein in neurons especially since it is extremely labile and has a very short half life. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Dr. Sinclairs work on the role of NAD in aging helps us appreciate the importance of NAD in the normal aging process. With respect to NMNAT2, we show that both the enzyme and chaperone function of this protein performs essential neuroprotective functions in a context-dependent manner. For example, the NAD synthesis activity of NMNAT2 is required to reduce excitotoxicity in developing cortical neurons, while its chaperone function is critical to deal with protein stress. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: I appreciate your interest and please help us to identify the modulators. Yes, NMNAT2 has rather short half-life. It would be great to increase its stability and potentially provide more neuroprotection. However, the labile nature of NMNAT2 may be critical for its endogenous function. Thus, this may be more complicated than one would like. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Is it possible to reduce the risk for dementia in later life through preventative measures? is a question we all like to ask. The answers to this question are complex and vary quite a bit depending on ones genetics and living environment. Epidemiological studies incorporating a large number of subjects and following them for many years are necessary to uncover this. What we found regarding NMNAT2 is just a beginning.  This study points to the importance of neuronal maintenance factors.  House-keeping function has not been actively studied despite the fact that majority of neurons in our brains are born before birth and have to stay functional till the end of our life. More efforts on finding out how neurons maintain their health despite all the stresses they are subjected to during aging are needed to find ways to reduce the dementia risk later in life.

There is strong evidence suggesting that caffeine intake via 2-3 cups coffee containing 95200 mg caffeine or several cups of tea per day reduce the risk of dementia. Our preliminary and unpublished studies find that treating adult mice with caffeine (equivalent to about 3 cups of coffee for a human) can increase NMNAT2 protein levels in the brain. Together, these results suggest that caffeines beneficial affects on dementia may be by increasing NMNAT2 levels. 

Despite the potential cognitive benefits, not everyone can take coffee or tea, especially elderly or people with a history of cardiovascular or high blood pressure problems. We are actively searching for small molecules that modulate NMNAT2 levels either upward or down.

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: Thanks for a great question! In our recent work, we have shown that this protein works in misfolding protein aggregates, which are typical of many neurological disorders such as AD, PD, HD etc. The fact that this protein is already present at high levels in neurons positions it to serve as a first line of defense in these diseases collectively termed proteinopathies. At the same time, we and others have shown an important neuronal maintenance function of NMNAT2 and the two functions of the protein, enzyme and chaperone, are mutually exclusive and are utilized in a context-dependent manner. Hence, increasing the overall abundance of the protein can be therapeutically relevant. In essence, molecules that upregulate the protein can target both the enzyme and the chaperone functions of the protein and can be applicable in a variety of disorders. </TEXT>

	<TEXT> Hui-Chen, Yousuf, and Hunter: This study was published in PloS Biology (not PLoS One), which is a moderately high impact journal (IF8). What really matters to us is to deliver our scientific discovery to the public and we believe in open access, the spirit of PLoS journals.  One can spend (waste) a lot of time trying to get ones findings into the highest impact factor journals.  Getting published in high impact journals is often a random process, determined by editors chasing the next hot topic, and is not necessarily a judge of the quality, impact, or significance of the work. 
The list of funding is the sum of all authors and thus is pretty extensive. The most expensive studies are the human studies. Very general advice to be successful in obtaining funding is to have a solid hypothesis for important questions, clear feasibility of the project, and a track record for getting tasks done with scientific rigors. </TEXT>

Until recently, house-keeping functions have not been actively studied, despite the fact that the majority of neurons in our brains are born before birth and have to stay functional till the end of our life. More efforts on finding out how neurons maintain their health despite all the stresses they are subjected to during aging are needed to find ways to reduce neurodegeneration and the risk for dementia later in life. Neurons often have very long and thin processes connected to their pre- or post-synaptic partners. Proteins synthesized in the cell body will need to be transmitted far distances, to where synaptic connections are located. Neurotransmitter release, occurring in under a millisecond upon the arrival of an action potential to the terminal involves a massive number of proteins changing their conformations. Keeping right balance in protein homeostasis in various parts of the neuron is a constant challenge. The accumulation of misformed/misfolded proteins during aging will undoubtedly impair neuronal function and may lead to reduced memory retention. </TEXT>
